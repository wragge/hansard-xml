<para>—by leave—The committee’s February 2005 public hearing with the Governor of the Reserve Bank was critical because this hearing established a benchmark for monetary policy and interest rate settings in Australia. The Governor of the RBA, Ian Macfarlane, took the opportunity to spell out what he believed was necessary in order for Australia to continue to enjoy steady growth of around 3.5 per cent per year without generating inflationary expectations. The RBA reported on an economy in good shape. However, after more than a decade of continuous growth, a number of bottlenecks are starting to emerge. If these bottlenecks are not addressed then there is every likelihood that these constraints will put pressure on prices and encourage inflation. However, the difficulty for those setting monetary policy is that the economy is producing mixed signals, which are making it very difficult to forecast whether people are heeding these warnings and not letting demand outstrip supply.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The report I have tabled today discusses these conflicting signals and documents the RBA’s views on a number of supply-side constraints, which the RBA believes have become central to the current economic debate. Where interest rates will be next month or in six months time is occupying the minds of many Australians. The governor and the board of the RBA not only have to weigh up all of the conflicting evidence and advice but also have to come to an on balance judgment about where the economy is likely to be in the short to medium term. Given the high level of indebtedness of Australians, monetary policy has become a very powerful economic management tool. It is not surprising, therefore, that when the RBA lifted rates by 25 basis points in March this year Australians started to reassess their current and future spending priorities.</para>
<para>The report presented today highlights the complexities of decision-making in monetary policy, particularly in a global economy where external influences cannot be easily managed from a domestic point of view. One only has to look at the maintenance of low interest rate policies in other developed countries or the willingness of global financial markets to continue to finance both internal and external deficits in a number of major economies as events that are outside Australia’s control. I believe that the major challenge facing Australia lies with our ability to address the infrastructure bottlenecks so that we can benefit from continued economic growth. The good thing is that there are signs that this is happening, but solving many of these infrastructure problems will require long lead times.</para>
<para>The hearings provided the community, financial sector and the media with a valuable opportunity to monitor the way in which the Reserve Bank conducts monetary policy in Australia. The Sydney hearing was a particularly important part of the ongoing accountability of the Reserve Bank of Australia to the federal parliament and the wider community. I thank the Governor of the Reserve Bank for his frank comments on monetary policy and other issues at the hearing.</para>
<para>As with all parliamentary events, members of committees do not do it alone. For this hearing the committee appreciated the assistance it received from David Richardson from the Parliamentary Library, the two economists who met with the committee prior to the hearing—Saul Eslake from the ANZ Bank and Chris Richardson from Access Economics—and the committee secretariat. I would also like to thank all committee members, in particular Deputy Chair Chris Bowen, for their participation in this important public forum. The committee looks forward to continuing this productive process. Our next hearing with the Reserve Bank will be held in Melbourne on Friday, 12 August 2005. I commend the report to the House.</para>

<para>—I am pleased to be able to speak on the tabling of this important report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Review of the Reserve Bank of Australia annual report 2004</inline> of the Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration. At the outset I would like to thank the chairman, the honourable member for Cook, for the bipartisan and cooperative manner in which he has chaired the committee and this inquiry in particular.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The opportunity to hold a public hearing and to hear from the Governor of the Reserve Bank is one of the most important forums for hearing from the nation’s central banker about the challenges and opportunities he sees for the economy. There is really no other opportunity for questioning the Governor of the Reserve Bank apart from these twice yearly hearings.</para>
<para>This hearing came at an important juncture in our economic progress. The Reserve Bank had already indicated in its statement on monetary policy that an increase in interest rates was becoming increasingly likely. The hearing gave the committee an opportunity to flesh out the reasoning behind this decision and future interest rate movements. The governor indicated that the biggest problem facing the Australian economy, in his view, was capacity constraints. In answer to my question about capacity constraints, the governor indicated:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The most immediate capacity constraint ... is the capacity constraint on exports.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This is a clear indication, which I and the opposition endorse, that much more needs to be done to lift our export performance. It is clear that the economic success that we have enjoyed has largely been built on the very good terms of trade that Australia is currently experiencing. These are the best we have had in 50 years. In fact, if Australia currently had the terms of trade that we had in 1986, our current account deficit would be 13 per cent of gross domestic product, not the current seven per cent. Seven per cent is bordering on catastrophic; 13 per cent would be truly catastrophic. I took the opportunity of asking the governor if he was worried about the downturn in the terms of trade, leading to a blowout in the current account deficit. He replied:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">One could construct a scenario of that type going out. ... I would like to see, first of all, the capacity constraints lifted and our exports start to speed up again.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I do not wish to be alarmist about this. The decline in our terms of trade is extremely unlikely while the Chinese economy continues to grow strongly. However, not many people saw the Asian downturn in the 1990s coming, and downturns can come at very unexpected junctures. I do wish to make the point, however, that much of our economic success is based on these terms of trade being so strong while our exports and infrastructure to promote exports have been allowed to stagnate. We must do better. We must lift our research and development capability. We must increase work force participation. I will be speaking later in the week on the report of the Standing Committee on Employment and Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation, dealing with perhaps one of the biggest economic challenges facing this nation.</para>
<para>Of course, the latest interest rate increase has had a much bigger effect on the average householder than it did in the past. Household debt servicing is now at 9.3 per cent, the highest it has been in history. I was particularly glad to hear from the Governor of the Reserve Bank that the Reserve Bank is conducting some research into the amount of equity financing currently going on in this country. It is of concern to me that, unlike in years past, borrowing is occurring based on the equity held in a home for non-home purposes—for holidays, cars and things which do not add to people’s wealth. When the downturn comes or when interest rates increase, people will not be able to fall back on the wealth that has gone into building bigger or better homes, because their money has been spent elsewhere. But the debt is still there. I was very glad to hear that the governor agrees that it is a concern and that he is conducting research into the issue.</para>
<para>This is an important report. The interest rate increase is of keen interest to thousands of mortgagees across the country. The last increase resulted in a $50 a week higher mortgage charge for people on an average mortgage across this country. It is something of vital importance to the economy and to thousands of mortgagees across the country. I thank the committee secretariat for their support and, as the chair of the committee has indicated, thank the Governor of the Reserve Bank and the senior executives of the Reserve Bank, who appeared willingly and cooperatively before the committee and will do so again in August. I commend the report to the House.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I have presented my private member’s bill, the <inline ref="R2341">Flags Amendment (Flying the Australian National Flag in a Heritage Place) Bill 2005,</inline> in the hope of changing the law for the benefit of proud Australians like me, but more especially for the benefit of people like Ian and Kaye Garwood from Launceston in Northern Tasmania. What is wrong with a country when a state government imposes a ridiculous level of regulation which prevents a man from flying the Australian flag on his own property, just because his home happens to be in a heritage zone for planning purposes?</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The need for an amendment to the Flags Act 1953 became obvious to me earlier this year when Mr Garwood, in my electorate of Bass in Tasmania, was told by the local council that he needed planning permission to fly the Australian flag on the flagpole on his heritage-listed home. Mr Ian Garwood is a 72-year-old returned serviceman who lives in charming Batten Street, close to the heart of the city of Launceston. Mr Garwood and his wife Kaye completed the renovation of their 19th-century home by erecting a three-metre flagpole to enable Mr Garwood to raise the Australian flag, as he patriotically does every morning.</para>
<para>After a complaint from a neighbour, the council advised Mr Garwood that without planning permission his flagpole was an illegal structure. The council required him to request permission in a formal manner, which he refused to do, and still refuses to do, for reasons of principle. While the council is stuck with this problem, it is in fact a problem which originates with the Tasmanian government’s planning and heritage laws, particularly the Tasmanian Historic Cultural Heritage Act 1995, which requires councils to seek planning approval for building extensions and outside structures.</para>
<para>Through this private member’s bill I want to ensure that this sort of permission should not be needed in the case of someone wanting to fly the Australian flag on a flagpole. The bill makes it an entitlement for a person to erect a flagpole on land that the person owns or leases for the purposes of flying the Australian national flag. However, this entitlement does not apply if there is a state or territory law, other than a heritage law, that requires the person to get permission. That is to say, that if there is a good reason for the state government to regulate the erection of flagpoles for reasons other than heritage, such as, say, safety, then they may still legitimately do so. However, the entitlement does apply over a state or territory law which is based on heritage considerations.</para>
<para>The bill establishes the entitlement in subsection (1); states where that entitlement does not override state and territory laws in subsection (2); and makes express provision for where the Commonwealth law prevails in subsection (3). I am advised that the Commonwealth has the constitutional power to make this law and to enforce it.</para>
<para>There is no finer example of Australian heritage than the Australian national flag. Flying it should be a right enjoyed by every Australian. The state government of Tasmania has had the opportunity now for many months to fix this problem by amending its own heritage legislation. This bill is therefore important because it will override the relevant state legislation in Tasmania and will also prevent a similar problem from occurring in other states or territories around Australia. Ian Garwood has been offered a one-off personal exemption at the political level. But Mr Garwood, ever a man of principle, has rightly pointed out that that achieves nothing for other people who find themselves in the same situation. The bill does not give any unreasonable rights to land users in respect of building structures that should go through council building approval processes. The bill simply extends the same right that non-heritage building owners have to erect a flagpole with the Australian flag to people who do own heritage properties.</para>
<para>Today I urge both sides of federal politics to support this bill at a future opportunity, and, in doing so, to show that they too support the rights of everyday, patriotic Australians, wherever they live. I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para class="block">It does not seem 30 years since the arrival by boat of the first 400-odd people who came into Australia commencing in 1975. It took us some years to realise that this was the beginning of a major flow of refugees from Indochina. It was not until 1977, with a change of government, that the then Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Hon. Michael Mackellar, on 24 May 1977, announced the basic principles of a comprehensive policy and enunciated the strategy and practical initiatives to implement it. My colleague Petro Georgiou, who is sitting with me here in the chamber, will remember those days as clearly as I do.</para>
<para>The four principles that have become the basis of Australia’s refugee policy were set out by Michael Mackellar on 24 May 1977. He gathered together the legal, cultural, international and compassionate elements of Australia’s attitude towards refugees. There had been major flows of refugees before, but we did not approach them in the comprehensive way in which we approached the flow of refugees from Vietnam. Michael Mackellar announced that Australia fully recognises its humanitarian commitment and responsibility to admit refugees for resettlement; that the decision to accept refugees must always remain with the government of Australia; and that special assistance would often need to be provided for the movement of refugees in designated situations or for their resettlement in Australia. He also said that it might not be in the interests of some refugees to settle in Australia but that their interests might be better served by resettlement elsewhere, noting that the Australian Government makes an annual contribution to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the main body associated with such resettlement. Those four principles have been the basis of our refugee policy since that day—a bipartisan policy, a policy expressed for the first time by Michael Mackellar.</para>
<para>The policy resulted in a great flow of wonderful people from Indochina—freedom loving people with their families. It has not always been an easy road for them. They were quite different from other refugees who arrived in Australia, but Australians took the Vietnamese refugees to their hearts with the community resettlement and support program that opened up communities across the country. During that period, it was my wonderful experience to meet many of them.</para>
<para>The process of settlement in Australia went on despite difficulties in finding employment. Many refugees had to find self-employment—to invent a job for themselves—to make a living for themselves and their families. At the time there were changes in the economy as we moved to a more intense industrial economy, where knowledge and information became very significant. There are reports in newspapers of the time about people who were university graduates in Vietnam—their careers were stopped short by the war in that country—coming to Australia and finding difficulty in re-establishing in their profession in Australia.</para>
<para>In this year, I am proud to say that the Young Australian of the Year is a person whose family came by boat. I am proud to have met this man, 26-year-old Khoa Do, in Cabramatta. I found him an articulate, supportive Australian. He grew up in the Prime Minister’s own early childhood area of Earlwood. He accepts the values of Australia and promotes Australia. I want to congratulate the new settlers and thank them for coming. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Thirty years ago this May, the first of the Vietnamese refugees arrived in Australia. Over the next 30 years, they created one of Australia’s strongest migrant communities. Some 154,831 Australians born in Vietnam had called Australia home at the time of the 2001 census. From those very first arrivals in 1975, our new Vietnamese migrants showed an extraordinary tenacity and commitment to family and their new home that has served them and all of us very well.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I remember the first of what we called the boat people arriving in Australia. I was about 15 years old and I was working during the school holidays at the Golden Circle cannery. Within days of their release into the community, many of the Vietnamese turned up at the cannery. Whole families turned up in those early days, with very little English and very little understanding of the Australian way of life. They caused a certain fear among the locals because they worked so hard. They did not turn up in ones; they turned up in car fulls—the whole family—and they worked every hour, every day, every minute of overtime they could get. These were people who worked every day as if the gains that day would be the last in their lives. They were people who worked and protected their families as if they could lose them tomorrow. Of course, both these fears were realities for a people that had endured decades of war and unimaginable horrors in their escape.</para>
<para>Our newest Vietnamese Australians grabbed their lives with both hands, many with little English and grieving for the loss of loved ones, for the loss of home and all that was familiar, and for their very country. Many were recovering from unimaginable trauma at sea. Yet from day one they looked to the future and began building their lives here. And what an extraordinary community they have built. Ninety-six per cent of Vietnamese migrants have taken up citizenship, a much higher rate than the average for migrant groups, which is 75 per cent. They have embraced the opportunities that Australia offers with equal vigour. In 2002, 41 per cent of Vietnamese-born males aged between 20 and 22 were studying at university—that is more than double the rate for third generation Australians. This next generation of Vietnamese Australians is articulate, highly educated, socially responsible and politically aware. They are fine young Australians that do us all proud.</para>
<para>Thirty years on, it is worth looking back at their arrival here in the seventies, because it was a defining moment for Australia as a multicultural society. We were not a multicultural society in the early seventies. Back then we were a nation of fewer than 13 million people. Only 20 per cent of us were born overseas, mainly in the UK and Ireland, with some Italians and Greeks thrown in, and there was a fairly large population of humanitarian refugees from post-war Poland. It was still the end of the White Australia Policy and we were not the diverse and rich multicultural community that we now strive to be.</para>
<para>It was Gough Whitlam who brought an end to the White Australia Policy in 1973, but it was the arrival of the Vietnamese when Malcolm Fraser was Prime Minister that was the first real test of the new Australia. While most of the refugees came in through official refugee programs, it was the boat people who arrived on our northern beaches that caught the attention of the population. It was not one boat; it was one after another. When the <inline font-style="italic">Kein Giang</inline> came in sight of the northern coast of Australia carrying Lam Binh, its 25-year-old captain, Lam Tac Tam, his 17-year-old brother, and three mates—five people, some of them little more than children—it was the first of many. It is a credit to both sides of politics and the strength and tenacity of the Vietnamese migrants themselves that a bipartisan approach kept the fear at bay.</para>
<para>The following year, Australia admitted over 7,000 Indochinese refugees, including 5½ thousand Vietnamese, mainly from camps in Thailand and Malaysia. But that same year also saw the arrival of the largest ever number of unauthorised boat people. In that year alone, 1,430 people arrived in 37 small boats. In the following year, 50 more boats reached northern Australia carrying 2,011 people. By that time, Australia had admitted nearly 19,000 Vietnamese refugees.</para>
<para>We Australians, those of us already here in 1975 and those new Vietnamese Australians that arrived, have done a phenomenal job in creating a home for the over 150,000 people who now make up our Vietnamese-Australian community—quite an achievement given that we were just creating ourselves as a modern multicultural community.</para>

<para>—I wish to commend the member for Mitchell on moving this motion. All too often we forget significant events in our history and it is a tribute to him that he has remembered on this occasion. This is the 30th anniversary of Australia taking in Vietnamese refugees after the fall of Saigon. It is the 30th year since the first Vietnamese boat people arrived in Darwin.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Fraser government, of which the member for Mitchell was a member, was barely six months old when, after two months at sea, five young Vietnamese men landed in Darwin in a small wooden boat. I was an adviser to Prime Minister Fraser then, and I well remember the discussions sparked by the arrival of those people and by the arrival over the next five years of more than 50 other boats carrying more than 2,000 Vietnamese people. I recall the then Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in that period proposing the establishment of a minimal facility detention centre in northern Australia. That proposal was rejected. It took almost 15 years and a new government before Australia adopted a policy of mandatory detention of asylum seekers.</para>
<para>Although the new arrivals were, to use today’s parlance, ‘unlawful arrivals’, public opinion was generally sympathetic. A June 1979 poll found that just over 50 per cent of respondents said that the government should accept refugees coming by boat from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. At the same time, it needs to be said that 28 per cent believed that they should be put back to sea. A key factor in the public support of asylum seekers was the Fraser government’s commitment to honouring our obligations to the refugees from a conflict in which Australia had been a party. I think Nancy Viviani is right in giving a wider credit to the Fraser government by saying:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">For Australians, Vietnamese refugee entry was the first real test of the disestablishment of the White Australia policy and a test successfully passed.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The Vietnamese refugees and the families who followed them faced formidable linguistic, educational and other challenges in this country. But despite the disadvantages they experienced, the settlement of Vietnamese people of refugee and other backgrounds has been a success story for them and for the Australian community at large. The Prime Minister has praised the contribution of Australians of Vietnamese background in community service, education, business and cultural sectors of Australia’s multicultural policy. I strongly endorse his sentiments.</para>
<para>It is fitting that we mark the achievements of the Vietnamese born and their children in Australia and the compassion of the Australian community in accepting them. But we now need to also reflect on the scores of asylum seekers who are still in long-term detention. Amongst them are 35 Vietnamese people, eight of whom are children, who are presently seeking asylum in this country. They came by boat, the Hao Kiet. They were intercepted by the Navy and taken to Christmas Island, where they have been in detention ever since that time in July 2003.</para>
<para>I do not know whether the Vietnamese detained on Christmas Island have a sound claim for refugee status—that needs to be determined by a fair process and on the evidence. But I do ask: do we need to keep these 35 women, children and men locked up for an extended period in a remote place while that occurs? There is a legitimate role for detention for specific purposes, such as to ascertain identity, to protect public health and safety and to prevent people from absconding. However, under the current mandatory detention system there are no such explicit public interest grounds for deciding whether it is necessary to detain asylum seekers in high-security detention. In the current international, regional and domestic circumstances, I believe there are compelling arguments for the system to be reformed. I intend to pursue that cause vigorously. I commend the motion to the House.</para>

<para>—I also thank the member for Mitchell for moving this motion. I agree with much of what has been said already in the debate. I would not suggest I agree with everything the member for Mitchell has said. However, the substantial parts of the motion I do accept as being very significant. It is a wonderful thing that it is here to be debated. It is also important to reflect upon some of the comments made by the member for Parramatta. I, too, recall the days when the so-called boat people arrived. Being very young, it was a very memorable moment in my life because it was indeed a historic event. The member for Kooyong, whose memory probably is better than mine in relation to this matter—indeed, whose role was larger than mine—was quite right in saying that at the time it was not an easy issue to be dealt with. But a very new coalition government, under the stewardship of Prime Minister Fraser, handled the matter very well. I think it is fair to say that it may have been different if the same thing had happened only a number of years ago.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I do commend the member for Mitchell on moving this motion. Its content provides members with an ideal opportunity to reflect upon the courage and determination of those fleeing a war-torn nation; to remind ourselves of the contributions that those Vietnamese refugees and those that have since followed have made to Australia’s society; and to express sorrow at the now callous, somewhat brutal, manner in which refugees are dealt with by today’s government.</para>
<para>Between 1975 and 1981 between one million and two million people left Vietnam. It is estimated that half did so by boat. It is very hard to actually estimate the precise numbers. As we know, Vietnam was going through an awful conflict of its own. It would be fair to say that there would be divergent views in this place about the reasons for that war and our purpose there. But I think no-one in this place would disagree that, as a result of the war, people were displaced, particularly women and children but generally civilians. Fifty-six boatloads of Vietnamese asylum seekers arrived in Australia, as I understand it, totalling about 2,100 people in that five- or six-year period between early 1976 and 1981. It is important to note that, although the boats ceased arriving after 1981, we accepted over 55,000 resettled Vietnamese refugees from camps in Asia between 1975 and 1994 and another 95,000 Vietnamese as part of the family reunion program. So clearly in that period from 1975 through to today, you could almost say, there has been a generous and decent approach by governments, supported by opposition parties, to allow people to settle here, to find a home, and to wherever possible reconcile families that have been torn apart as a result of an awful war.</para>
<para>It is unfortunate, however, to see some of the changes in community attitudes. It has already been touched upon by earlier speakers. It is important to note—and the member for Kooyong did indicate—that there was still significant support in the late seventies for the so-called boat people, refugees from Vietnam. I believe one of the reasons for that support was the leadership shown by then Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser and the support by the Labor Party and other parties at the time in admitting those refugees into this country. Clearly that support, around 60 or 70 per cent at the time, has dropped rapidly when you consider the refugees from Iraq and other nations in most recent years. I have to suggest that one of the prime reasons that that has occurred has been the failure by this government, in particular of the Prime Minister, to show any leadership in looking after people leaving undemocratic tyrannies—like that we saw in Iraq. It is unfortunate that we have not resolved that. It is unfortunate that there is not a bipartisan position on refugees—indeed on detainees that are currently held in detention centres, many of whom should not be there. Certainly many of them have been there for too long. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I rise in support of this motion. I note the support that has been offered by the members for Mitchell, Kooyong, Parramatta and Gorton, although I would reject what the member for Gorton was saying about our present policies. In fact, I would say the exact opposite. I would have thought that the policies pursued by the Australian government at the moment are actually testimony to the generosity of spirit in Australia in still welcoming humanitarian arrivals. In fact, just in the past few weeks I have been talking to new arrivals in my electorate from the Sudan, from the Congo and from Somalia. I can assure you that they are deeply appreciative that Australia is one of the very few countries in the world that still operates a humanitarian resettlement program. Just as we welcomed the Vietnamese refugees 30 years ago, Australians continue in that same vein to welcome people fleeing oppression in many different parts of the world.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is very important that the House recognise today the contribution that Vietnamese refugees have made to the Australian community over the past 30 years. It is very fitting that we debate this motion so close to the 30th anniversary of the arrival of the first Vietnamese refugees in Australia. In fact the people that arrived by boat in Darwin on 27 April 1976 were the first to come to Australia in a bid to escape the political turmoil that was then engulfing South-East Asia. They were the first of an estimated two million people who sought refuge in neighbouring and Western countries during this turbulent time. Their arrival marked the beginning of a significant contribution that Vietnamese-born Australians and their descendants have made to our community. It also marked—and I think this is very important—the beginning of the first major resettlement of people of Asian descent since the end of the White Australia Policy.</para>
<para>The history of the Vietnamese in Australia is a classic Australian immigration story which mirrors the experience of many of the other immigrant groups that have settled here. Arriving with very little, as noted by the member for Parramatta, the first generation of refugees worked extraordinarily hard to carve out an existence for themselves and their families. Their success over that time created opportunities for their children, who subsequently went through the Australian education system and into professions or other careers.</para>
<para>This is a great story. It is a story of flight from repression, and then the hope that was offered by a new land and new opportunities. It reflects both the characteristics of the refugees—tenacity, self-sacrifice and the courage that it took to risk everything to come to a new land—and the characteristics of Australia, the host nation that welcomed them. It refects the generosity with which the Australian people provided a home and opportunities to people in need of that assistance.</para>
<para>Australians are great respecters of people who are prepared to have a go, and the new arrivals from Vietnam took up this challenge with some vigour. They are now an integral part of Australian life, enriching our cultural, business and social fabric. Indeed, I think there is probably only one further phase to go in their journey through Australian society, and that will be when we welcome Australians of Vietnamese descent into our parliament. Just as we look around the parliament now and note people who have descended from other immigrant communities, such as the Greeks, the Italians, the Irish, the Chinese or the Macedonians—to name but a few of the communities who are represented here—so we will soon welcome Australians of Vietnamese descent into the parliament. There is no greater tribute to our democracy than this. Indeed, having travelled widely, I know of no other country that has enjoyed such success in managing diversity as has Australia.</para>
<para>An anniversary such as the one we are celebrating provides an excellent opportunity to reflect on the wealth of experience and the rich cultural heritage that people from Vietnam have brought to Australia, and in particular to my electorate of Stirling. Western Australia is home to about 10,000 people born in Vietnam, and Stirling is home to about 25 per cent of those. Only last week I visited the Vietnamese Catholic Church in Westminster and I was very proud not long before that to have taken the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Vanstone, down to the Vietnamese Buddhist Association in Nollamara. The Vietnamese Catholic Church, which I visited last week, started with very humble beginnings, but it has just purchased new and much larger premises for its parish.</para>
<para>In closing I would like to again pay tribute to the people of Australia who have welcomed Vietnamese refugees and who have continued to welcome genuine refugees from around the globe. The large number of new arrivals who settle in Western Australia settle in Stirling. I am always amazed by the community spirit that goes into making these new Australians feel welcome.

<para>—In speaking to this motion on Vietnamese refugees I want to pay tribute to the many Vietnamese families who live in my electorate of Cowan. I have a great respect for the contribution they make to our nation, and I have a great regard for the courage that so many of them had to call on in making their new lives and in escaping from Vietnam in 1975. Cowan is an electorate in which many Vietnamese families live. For me, it is a pleasure to work with them and to be of service to them, particularly in areas of immigration and family reunification, which this government makes so difficult. Indeed, I am proud to have a very large Buddhist temple in Cowan, which is situated in the suburb of Marangaroo.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I am also very proud to have a close association with the Vietnamese sub-branch of the Returned and Services League in Western Australia. This sub-branch of the RSL some two years ago constructed a memorial to Australian and Vietnamese forces who fought together in Vietnam. This memorial is located in King’s Park in Perth and stands adjacent to the Australian Vietnam Veterans Memorial. I was very proud of the way in which both Vietnamese and Australian Vietnam veterans worked together to achieve this memorial. It is a memorial that the Vietnamese community in Perth take great pride in—and with good reason.</para>
<para>For many Vietnamese families, the struggle to leave Vietnam and reach Australia to start a new life has not been easy. The dislocation from the home of their ancestors was traumatic and the dangers many faced in leaving Vietnam were many. Escaping was, in itself, dangerous and the boat trips many endured were frightening. I know of many families whose loved ones escaped but were never heard of again—probably murdered by those pirates in the South China Sea who preyed on the weak and defenceless.</para>
<para>I want to refer to one particular family who escaped in 1978. This family of seven left Vietnam in a boat about 10 metres long with a beam of about 2.5 metres. There were 74 people on that boat. On the second day out, they hit a storm and all on the boat thought they were lost. Miraculously, they were rescued by a World Vision boat. They were saved and taken in safety to the coast of Malaysia, where they eventually landed and were put into a refugee centre. This family eventually made it to Australia and I am proud today to call them friends. Indeed, one of the sons, Bahtong Pham, has become a staunch friend and strong supporter of the Australian Labor Party and a servant of his people. He and his wife, Thuy, are delightful Australians and they recently had a baby boy whom they named Alban, after the Catholic priest who befriended and supported them when they first arrived in Australia. All of this family are committed to the development of the community. They are very community spirited, hardworking and certainly dedicated to Australia. They have overcome the dangers, trials and tribulations that confronted them in their escape from Vietnam, their hazardous boat journey and their resettlement in this country, which they now proudly call home.</para>
<para>Of course, like many Vietnamese people, they thank their lucky stars they came to Australia when they did, because they know that, had they arrived in Australian waters under the Howard government, they would have been sent back to sea or indeed interred in one of the numerous detention centres in and around Australia and then probably sent back to Vietnam. I am very pleased that the member for Kooyong noted that we have a number of Vietnamese currently in a detention centre on Christmas Island.</para>
<para>The Vietnamese people in Australia have made a great contribution to this nation, and the story of the Pham family in Perth is just one of many stories of triumph over hardship. These people fit well into the character of Australia. They have made a great contribution to Australia, and they continue to make a great contribution to Australia. It has not been easy. They have faced those hardships head on and they certainly fit the character of this wonderful nation.</para>

</list>
</motion>
<para class="block">This important motion deals with the human rights of a very significant number of people in Iraq. There has been much said and written in recent months about the differing religious and ethnic groups in Iraq. The interaction between the Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds is something that anyone with an interest in Iraq could now speak of relatively confidently just by reading any one of Australia’s newspapers. However, there is another dimension to the unfolding Iraqi story which has received little attention. It is a story which has the potential to erupt into renewed violence and develop into a humanitarian crisis of the first order. It is the story of Iraq’s other minorities: the Assyrians, Chaldeans, Mandaeans and Syriacs.</para>
<para>It is hard to say exactly how many people belong to these ethnic groups, because in his government’s census Saddam Hussein prohibited people identifying themselves as belonging to one of these groups. However, estimates place the combined Iraqi population of these groups at about one million people, a substantial figure. Why do these groups need more attention than they have been receiving in the examination of post-Hussein Iraq? It is for the same reason that they are gaining unwanted attention from fundamentalist groups in Iraq: they are Iraq’s Christian minority. The Assyrians are an ancient race which once laid claim to one of the world’s great empires. Its capital, Ninevah, is now known as Mosul. Their other claim to fame is to be one of the world’s first Christian civilisations. Many of their close cousins, the Mandaeans, practise a unique religion which follows the teachings of John the Baptist.</para>
<para>Anyone who believes that people should be able to follow the religion of their choice without fear of persecution has every reason to fear recent developments in Iraq. There are widespread reports of voting fraud, meaning that minority voters were disenfranchised in the recent elections. In predominantly Assyrian towns in the north, for example, ballot boxes simply did not arrive and votes could not be lodged. The absence of international observers makes it impossible to know exactly how big this problem was, but anecdotal evidence suggests that it was widespread.</para>
<para>Also of concern is the recent spate of church bombings throughout Iraq, a development that has seen former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey join in a campaign to heighten awareness of this issue. Credible dossiers of suspected state-condoned murders and disappearances of members of minority groups have been prepared by various human rights groups. Most concerning is that these murders have not stopped with the fall of Hussein. Indeed, many Assyrians fear that they have become more frequent. One theory, which seems to have at least some credibility, is that Iraqi Christians are being blamed by militants for the Western invasion and are proving easy targets for dissident militias.</para>
<para>The situation in the northern provinces of Iraq can best be described at the moment as a ‘tinderbox’. An estimated 40,000 Assyrians and others have fled Iraq for neighbouring countries in recent months to escape persecution and the fear that violence will break out and become fully fledged oppression, which these groups have been used to for centuries. It remains to be seen whether the optimism that accompanied the fall of Hussein will be realised. There are some positive signs. For example, an Assyrian has been appointed to the Iraqi cabinet. But Iraq will not be truly a democracy until the rights of Assyrians, Chaldeans, Mandaeans and Syriacs are protected.</para>
<para>We have heard much about the success of the recent Iraqi elections, but, frankly, I do not regard them as a success when you consider the hardship, oppression and fear being experienced by these minority groups and the indigenous people of Iraq. I do not see how anyone could. Ineluctably, the signs are foreboding. If the worst happens, and widespread violence breaks out, the West will need to be ready. Whether negotiating for an autonomous administrative area or, as a last resort, providing refugee arrangements for minorities fleeing oppression, the UN and coalition nations will need to be ready for a humanitarian crisis of the first order.</para>
<para>Recent experience with such crises suggests that the world will not be ready. It is incumbent on all of us, government and opposition members alike, to do whatever we can to ensure that the rights of these one million people are protected. I commend the motion to the House.</para>

<para>—The government of Iraq has made enormous steps forward since the demise of Saddam Hussein. I think most people would agree that the peoples mentioned in the motion moved by the member for Prospect should have an appropriate role to play in Iraq. After many decades of hardship, from an outsider’s point of view, there finally appears to be light at the end of the tunnel for the people of Iraq. Their history has been punctuated by conflict, food shortages, dictatorship and war. Even today, overseas forces are currently in Iraq assisting the government of Iraq, at the request of that government, to maintain order. That assistance has been fundamental in bringing about positive change and optimism in this besieged land, but it is an overseas force. All nations and all peoples deserve the right to self-government and freedom, and it is important that the situation in Iraq be stabilised as quickly as possible so that it is no longer necessary for overseas troops to provide the invaluable assistance which is currently being provided.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The country of Iraq is a land that dates back thousands of years, and there are different peoples who have lived in that territory for thousands of years. They are rich in their diversity and cultures, in their customs, in their languages and in their religions. Iraq has been described as an artificial state created by Britain after World War I, made up from the Basra, Mosul and Baghdad provinces of the former Turkish Ottoman Empire. It was made up of three major communities: the Shiah in the south, the Kurds in the north and the Sunnis in central Iraq. Along with these major groups of people, Iraq has been home to minority communities left over from the country’s past, some dating back to almost 2000 BC. These minor groups are: the Turcomans, the Assyrians, the Syriacs, the Chaldeans, a variety of Christian groups, and the Mandaeans. All these are individual groups, each with its own beliefs and histories.</para>
<para>In more recent times, however, during the terrorist reign of Saddam Hussein and his henchmen, the Iraqi regime recognised only two nationalities—the Arabs and the Kurds. Muslim Sunnis dominated state power while, to various degrees, all the other, smaller groups were forced to assimilate. A proportion of these minorities, again to various degrees, were persecuted and had their human rights abused. Many felt that there was little option other than to flee the country to escape these hardships. The majority Shiah Muslims and Kurds were among those suppressed and forced to shift house and resettle in other parts of the country. Effectively, what took place in many instances was ethnic cleansing.</para>
<para>This is the historic foundation on which a new and better Iraq is to be built. The process has begun with the election and formation of a government. There has been an amazing level of cooperation amongst various groups representing various ethnic communities. I think we are all greatly heartened by the very positive attitude that has been displayed by Iraqi people of all ethnicities towards this chance for democracy.</para>
<para>It is important to recognise that in any country people ought not to be the subject of prejudice for any reason, including race and ethnicity. I certainly support the principle that all people in Iraq ought to enjoy the protection of the rule of law and the same human rights that all other people in that country enjoy. It is a matter of great and enduring sadness that certain elements are determined to rob the people of Iraq of democratic freedom—not only of the minorities but also of larger ethnic groups.</para>
<para>Iraq is a challenge. It now has an historic opportunity. I am particularly proud of the role that Australia, with the coalition, has played. I hope that in the future all people in Iraq will continue to receive appropriate recognition of their respective rights. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I am very pleased to rise to support this motion moved by the member for Prospect, which seeks to ensure that the ChaldoAssyrian people of Iraq are constitutionally guaranteed the right to freely exercise their customs, religion, language and traditions. The motion seeks also to ensure that they are given the same protection by law enforcement and international security forces as other ethnic groups and that they be entitled to proper representation and participation in all levels of government.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Iraqi-Assyrian community is made up of remnants of the people of ancient Mesopotamia, succeeding the Sumero-Akkadians and the Babylonians as one continuous civilisation. This ancient civilisation, which has existed since 2000 BC, has one of the oldest Christian traditions in the world; it dates back to the first century. Their language, Aramaic, the language of Jesus, is taught in their churches and used in Assyrian cultural celebrations, such as the New Year celebrations held each year on 1 April of our Gregorian calendar.</para>
<para>The member for Prospect made reference, quite rightly, to former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey. He publicised his views early this year and stated his concern that the Assyrian people of Iraq face extinction. Lord Carey said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">In recent months and years, churches and monasteries have been attacked and people have been killed. We are talking about terrible atrocities which would undermine any community.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It is fairly well known to all of us who have an interest in this area that the ChaldoAssyrian peoples have endured almost a history of persecution and suffering. But, despite these atrocities, it is heartening to see that the ChaldoAssyrian people of Iraq have united recently under the political representation of the Assyrian Democratic Movement, whose leader, Yunadam Kanna, was elected to the Iraqi National Assembly in that country’s first democratic elections, in January this year. Yunadam Kanna and his party were widely supported and have wide support, I understand, amongst the Iraqi Australians who voted in this historic election.</para>
<para>The current draft constitution of Iraq officially recognises the ChaldoAssyrian minority within Iraq and recognises them as ChaldoAssyrians. This name was adopted in October 2003 at the ChaldaenAssyrian General Conference in Baghdad as a sign of unity amongst ChaldoAssyrian people, who now hope that the new constitution will formally recognise a self-administered area in the Nineveh plain for the ChaldoAssyrian community to exist peacefully and free of persecution.</para>
<para>It is important that the practice of ancient customs, language and traditions be maintained and that all minority groups in Iraq be allowed freedom of expression and freedom of religion. It is the ancient traditions of the ChaldoAssyrians that formed the foundation of contemporary Iraqi society. Despite the diversity of faith amongst the Christian and Muslim Iraqis, they still share a common cultural and linguistic heritage, with Aramaic and Syriac being the foundations of the Arabic language. It is these commonalities that unite the people of Iraq and hopefully will continue to bring them together as they move into the future as a democratic political state.</para>
<para>In my electorate of Calwell, the ChaldoAssyrian community has embraced the unified name now identified and they are operating as a united people under one flag with one anthem. Recently, at the 1 April celebrations for the New Year’s festival, I was able to see this new-found unity, with the community coming together to assist each other as they make Australia their new home. The ChaldoAssyrian community is thriving in Australia. They often tell me—as I am sure they tell others of us who here represent members of that community in our electorates—that they feel privileged and lucky to be living in Australia. It is also to our benefit as a country that we are able to share and learn from their rich and ancient traditions as they continue to make their mark on and their contribution to our multicultural landscape.</para>
<para>However, my constituents, although happy to live here, still remain very interested in and concerned about events back home in Iraq. Of particular concern are the welfare and safety of members of their families and friends who have been left behind. Like the ChaldoAssyrian community in the electorate of Calwell, I hope—and I know it is the hope of everyone in this chamber—that the ChaldoAssyrian people in Iraq will soon enjoy the recognition, protection and representation sought by this motion. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I rise in this House today to support the call to the Australian government to make representations to the newly elected transitional government of Iraq to ensure the protection of the nation’s minority groups. I certainly commend the member for Prospect for bringing forward this important motion. I have personally been involved with the Assyrians, Chaldeans and Sabian Mandaeans and their requests for citizenship in this country, which have been successful in all cases. I found all three groups to be delightful. The child of a family of Sabian Mandaeans with three children won the student of the year award two years in a row while they were in detention. I thought it was a most amazing thing, and it was a great tribute to that family.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Iraq consists of a number of ethnic and religious groups. According to the US State Department, 97 per cent of the population of 22 million are Muslims. Shiite Muslims, who are predominantly Arab—although some come from Turkoman—and Kurdish and other ethnic origins make up 60 per cent of the population. Sunni Muslims make up 37 per cent. The remainder are Christians, comprising Syrians, Chaldeans, Roman Catholics and Armenians. There are also a small number of Jews, Mandaeans and Yazidis, who live near the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, with smaller communities in Syria, Turkey, Iran, Georgia and Armenia estimated to number 500,000. The Mandaeans are small in number—there are some 100,000—and live mainly in southern Iraq.</para>
<para>It is these smaller groups, particularly the latter two and the Assyrians, which have made their concerns heard about the risk of being overshadowed in the drafting of a new constitution. Iraqi NGOs, representing minority ethnic groups in the country, held a two-day conference in the capital, Baghdad, in late April. The purpose of this conference was to ensure that the rights of minority cultures in Iraq are enshrined in the new constitution that is being drafted by the transitional government. We in this House certainly want to ensure that that happens.</para>
<para>The NGOs believe that Iraqi minorities have the right to be involved in the preparation and writing of the new constitution to ensure that their rights are the same as other groups, for example the Muslims and Christians. The event, which was organised by the Iraqi Commission for Civil Society Enterprises, resulted in the formation of a committee which will liaise with the government to ensure that minority rights are genuinely protected under the new constitution. We need to make sure that this happens.</para>
<para>The minorities in Iraq at present are remnants of the nation’s past ruling empires. Under Saddam Hussein’s regime, the Iraqi state recognised only two nationalities: the Arabs and the Kurds. Smaller minorities, to various extents, were forced to assimilate, were subjected to some form of persecution or fled the country. These policies were also used against the Shiah Muslims and Kurds, who together, in fact, were the majority and who were, amongst others, suppressed and forcefully relocated around the country.</para>
<para>The protection of minorities at this point in time is provided under the Law of Administration for the State of Iraq for the Transitional Period, or the LAT. This includes a bill of rights with the standard protections for individual rights built into it from the relevant UN conventions. The LAT was approved by the Coalition Governing Authority in March 2004. In practice, this is Iraq’s constitution until a new one is drafted this year. It is stated in the rubric of human rights that:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">All Iraqis are equal in their rights without regard to gender, sect, opinion, belief, nationality, religion or origin, and they are equal before the law.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">There are specific provisions added for minorities that state:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">This Law shall guarantee the administrative, cultural, and political rights of the Turkomans, ChaldoAssyrians, and all other citizens.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">These provisions are unique for minorities in the region, but it is yet to be seen if they will form part of a new constitution. It is important that these minorities be given protection under the Iraqi constitution so that they are protected by the law. It is also imperative that these laws be enforced and that the security forces and law enforcement officials maintain the requirements regardless of political belief.</para>
<para>There are over one million scattered minorities, which are mainly situated in the north of Iraq. Reports of church bombings and missing ballot boxes during the election have been received, and there are widespread concerns about how this situation should be handled. It is important for the Australian government to make representations to the transitional government of Iraq to express our concern for the protection—and the enforcement of that protection—of the minority groups under legislation, thus ensuring a prosperous and democratic Iraq for the future. It is important that we ensure the rights of these minority groups who, at this point in time, are not being given the appropriate representation that we believe they deserve.</para>

<para>—I congratulate my colleague the member for Prospect for bringing this motion to the attention of the House. I represent an adjoining electorate, and I know that he proudly represents the largest group of people born in Iraq, with the majority of those being Assyrian, Chaldean, Syriac and Mandaean people. I can well understand the concerns of these communities for the fate of their families and friends who live in Iraq. I share their concern and the concern of the member for Prospect to ensure that they are free to exercise their customs, religion, language and traditions, as well as having full protection under law and representation and participation in their government.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I know of many cases where people have fled the regime of Saddam Hussein in fear of their lives. Sadly, in many cases I have heard how their close relatives were tortured and executed under that brutal regime. However, the removal of the regime of Saddam Hussein has not led to a peaceful and democratic Iraq. Each day we hear of violence in the streets resulting in scores of deaths, and we must consider that there is a real possibility of civil war. The current tensions between different religious and racial groups can be seen in the length of time it has taken to put together a transitional government. It has taken since the election at the end of January until recent weeks to finalise the make-up of that government. It now appears likely that the timetable for the drawing up of a constitution will not be met. This must add to concern that the rights of minority religious and racial groups may not be guaranteed. While I do not consider that it should be Australia’s role—or the role of any other country, for that matter—to dictate the terms of Iraq’s constitution, I would expect that the Iraqi National Assembly, charged with the task of writing the new constitution, will be mindful of the need to include the guarantees sought in this motion by the member for Prospect.</para>
<para>What is clear is that the future make-up of an Iraqi state is far from certain. As small minorities, the Assyrian, Chaldean, Syriac and Mandaean people are at the mercy of much larger religious and racial groups to guarantee their role in the future government of Iraq. That is why this call to respect the rights of those minorities is so very important. There have been calls for Assyrians and Chaldeans to have their own province, based on Nineveh. As that region includes the oil centres of Kirkuk and Mosul, which include Arab, Turkmen and Kurdish populations, it is the most likely area of Iraq to be affected by major civil conflict.</para>
<para>There are reports of attacks by well-armed fighters on Assyrian and Chaldean villages. It is estimated that there are 750,000 Christian Iraqis, which represents about three per cent of the population. Many Iraqi Christians left Iraq during the time of Saddam Hussein, and this has weakened the standing of many communities. While they have lived in peaceful coexistence with the Muslim majority for many centuries, at a time when the future of Iraq is uncertain their survival will depend on recognition of their minority rights.</para>
<para>In looking to the future, the Assyrian, Chaldean, Syriac and Mandaean people of Iraq have much to gain from a constitution which guarantees their rights to exercise their customs, religion, language and traditions. While their representation in the transitional government is small, it can be seen that a constitution which respects these same rights for all Iraqi people would offer a model which can lead to a peaceful and prosperous Iraq.</para>
<para>I again thank the member for Prospect for bringing this motion to the House and assure the many people from my own electorate of Fowler who are of Assyrian, Chaldean, Syriac and Mandaean heritage that I share their concern for the safety of their families and friends in Iraq and their hopes for a free and peaceful homeland for their people.</para>

<para>—I rise today to support the motion put forward by the member for Prospect. I note the member wants the government to make representations to the newly elected transitional government of Iraq to ensure Christian minorities in Iraq are afforded all civil liberties. As an Australian who enjoys living in a democratic society where I can freely practice whatever religion I please, where I can dress how I please and where I have the right to freely express my opinions, I would hope that these basic human rights would be afforded to all those people living in Iraq, regardless of their beliefs.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>With the fall of Saddam Hussein’s regime when troops captured him on 13 December 2003 the Australian government has been encouraged by Iraq’s development toward respecting human rights—in particular the right of any individual to practise whatever religious beliefs they desire. On 6 April this year Jalal Talabani was appointed as the interim president of Iraq. Talabani was a Kurdish leader and has made history in becoming the first non-Arab head of state. In the acceptance speech he made to the transitional national assembly, Talabani explicitly expressed the belief that all Iraqi people, whether Arabs, Kurds, Turkomans or ChaldeanAssyrians, have made enormous sacrifices to build a free Iraq—free from oppression, authoritarianism, sectarianism and, most importantly, ethnic persecution. These remarks are very encouraging. It says to the rest of the world that this president wants to create an Iraq where everyone can freely express themselves through their right to exercise their customs, religion, language and traditions.</para>
<para>Among other things, the Transitional Administration Law, which is Iraq’s interim constitution, protects the right to freedom from religious discrimination and persecution. This part of the interim constitution augurs well for the new Iraqi constitution, which will be drafted later this year by the transitional national assembly. The Australian government remains confident that the new constitution will contain provisions similar to those in the recently drafted interim constitution. This government strongly supports the emergence of such an Iraq. It encourages Iraq to operate under a constitutional system that upholds and protects the basic human rights of all Iraqis of all religious persuasions and ethnic backgrounds.</para>
<para>I acknowledge the recent reports of intimidation of members of religious minorities in Iraq. These minority groups include Assyrian Christians. These reports are alarming. The federal government has worked closely with the Iraq Ministry of Human Rights on measures to help the Iraqi government in its work to implement basic human rights for all Iraqis. One such measure has been to fund a human rights training program in early October last year for all officials from the Iraq Ministry of Human Rights.</para>
<para>In 2004 there were several attacks against Christians in Iraq. The first major assault occurred on 1 August last year. Terrorists bombed five Christian Sunday church services, killing around 15 people and injuring about 50. The Australian government condemns such violent attacks. Not only does it cause harm to and unrest among the Iraqi people; it also violates the basic right to express religious beliefs without fear of being persecuted or seriously injured.</para>
<para>The Minister for Foreign Affairs has also met with representatives of the Assyrian Christian community and NGOs to discuss the concerns of Christians in Iraq. Furthermore, the government will continue to monitor any report of violence or abuse towards any minorities in Iraq. Another measure the federal government is taking to ensure minority groups in Iraq are not made vulnerable is to commit $126 million in aid funding to Iraq’s rehabilitation. Part of this overall funding includes $6 million for the International Organisation for Migration and the United Nations Development Group’s Trust Fund to facilitate the return and reintegration of displaced Iraqis in Iraq and overseas. Ultimately, the Australian government’s efforts in Iraq are aimed at promoting a democratic political environment in which different ethnic and religious groups are not persecuted or marginalised in any way, shape or form.</para>

<para>—Holding in my left hand a Timorese scarf given to me as a gift by Xanana Gusmao, I rise in the House this afternoon to express on behalf of millions of Australians, including many in this parliament, our profound support for East Timorese aspirations for economic and ongoing political independence. We recognise in this House the travails that East Timor has experienced, including the years of military occupation that resulted in significant loss of life, particularly amongst the male citizens of Timor. We recognise the appalling conditions of poverty, which I have experienced first-hand, that the people of Timor Leste suffer, and we recognise the lack of sufficient education, the lack of sufficient health resources and the lack of sufficient capacity for people to build a society that can take it through into the 21st century with stability. All those necessary things are still absent.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We note also that the United Nations has only now finished its work there and that some 50 or so Timorese refugees currently in and around Darwin, many of whom have families in Australia, are seeking to make Australia their home. They should be allowed to stay. Ministerial intervention in their cases is absolutely necessary. I note further that the minister, Senator Vanstone, has indicated that she will reconsider this situation. East Timor deserves our support. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—It is not often that I stand here and publicly deliver a bouquet to a public servant or, as in this case, a hybrid public body such as Telstra. My electorate of Canning has many challenging communications issues, as have most federal electorates. These include problems with telephony and broadband. The problems may range widely—delays in connection, illegitimate accounts and lack of coverage for mobile phones. The broadband issues are those associated with rolling out coverage to outlying areas, capacity issues and affordability. After many frustrating exercises in assisting constituents in Canning, I have found a beacon of professional light in Mr Geoff Booth, the Regional Managing Director for Telstra in the Western Region.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Far from the indifference and misleading information I have experienced from others, Geoff has been instrumental in the delivery of broadband to Dwellingup and the delivery of the much needed GSM mobile phone coverage in that town. Geoff’s welcome involvement has seen the delivery of much needed broadband to Byford, Pinjarra and the Carey College in Forrestdale. When things go wrong, as they did recently in Yunderup, Geoff has the decency to admit fault on behalf of Telstra and then commit to fixing it, with a timetable in place.</para>
<para>I applaud Geoff Booth for his professional and no-nonsense approach to all that he does. He does not mind becoming personally involved and hands on. At the same time, his corporate knowledge and administrative excellence are well known. A privatised Telstra will be looking for quality executives such as Geoff Booth. I wish him well. By the way, Geoff, I do need some help in Erskine, Halls Head and other areas of the fast-growing Peel Region. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—There was a certain irony for parents in Daylesford on budget night. At the same time as they were listening to the Treasurer introduce harsh measures to push sole parents into the work force, they were facing changes to the funding formula for the multifunctional Daylesford Community Child Care Centre which could see it forced to close and many parents in Daylesford having to give up work. I am tabling today a petition from 708 parents in Daylesford and district, asking that the government reconsider its position. The centre is facing threat of closure if the government does not reverse its decision to cut $87,000 from the centre’s budget. The centre has the unpalatable choice of closing or substantially increasing fees and reducing the type of child care it offers.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Many parents in Daylesford are in low-paying, part-time or casual work. This child care centre is the only child care centre available in Hepburn Shire. It is one of the few centres that offer out of school hours care, long day care, family day care and occasional care from the one site. If the government has its way it will only be able to offer one type of care and will have to increase its fees and charges for that care. The majority of the parents utilising this centre cannot afford a fee rise of the magnitude proposed by the government.</para>
<para>Many parents have written to me and to the minister. Joanne Patching from Daylesford says:</para>

<para>—Today I would like to pay tribute to Mr Craig Dick and the Palm Beach-Currumbin Lions Club members on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of Teenage Adventure Camps Queensland. Unfortunately, I was unable to attend the recent anniversary luncheon at the Currumbin RSL, but I understand the lunch was a huge success and once again raised the funds to host the 2005 teenage adventure camp on the Gold Coast.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The 10-year history of TAC-Q has been a challenge and a huge commitment from Craig and his fellow Lions—a commitment that has seen the budget grow from $10,000 in 1995 to a budget of $75,000 in 2004; and a commitment that has seen 200 campers attend the camps, together with 150 carers, over the 10-year period.</para>
<para>These camps are for disabled young people. They are for those with life-threatening illnesses, for those young people in wheelchairs. Each camp is for a week and it allows these young people to interact with each other, to build bonds with other people, to experience new challenges and to just take a break with their carers. There are some wonderful locals who support the camp each year—people who help out as drivers and mentors and a dedicated committee who put the program together. The week culminates in a dinner at the RSL to celebrate the achievements and milestones of these very special young people.</para>
<para>Today I want to recognise the very special people behind the program: the locals who give up their time and energy to support the program each year; the Palm Beach-Currumbin Lions members; the Currumbin RSL; all those wonderful people encouraged on by Mr Craig Dick, a local man with a big heart and soul who took up the challenge 10 years ago—<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I rise to condemn a recent attack on the Jewish synagogue in Newcastle. On the eve of Passover, vandals senselessly destroyed windows and daubed graffiti, including swastikas and anti-Semitic slogans, across the walls of the Newcastle synagogue. The timing of the attack was distressing. Not only did it upset the congregation as they prepared for their major Jewish festival but it took place on Hitler’s birthday—an appalling coincidence that offends all decent Australians. Importantly, offers of support and assistance came immediately from local community and church groups who, like me, were outraged by the vicious attack. The key message from all of us is that anti-Semitism, racism and xenophobia are never acceptable and have no place in our peaceful community.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The attack on the synagogue was surprising. The Jewish community is a very much appreciated, established and accepted part of Newcastle, with a long and proud tradition of commitment to the wellbeing of our city. But this attack reminds us that we must always nurture understanding and tolerance. The last parliament passed a bipartisan motion expressing unequivocal condemnation of anti-Semitism and all forms of racial and ethnic hatred, persecution and discrimination on ethnic or religious grounds whenever they occur. It is important that this strong bipartisan commitment is reiterated in the parliament today.</para>

<para>—Last Saturday I was at Cronulla Beach, which is located in the eastern part of my electorate of Cook, when I, like other local residents and visitors, was delighted to see two whales not far off the beach. Each year a large number of whales migrate past Cronulla and Cape Solander at Kurnell, the headland north-east of Cronulla. The annual migration of whales past Cape Solander is an important tourist attraction, as bus loads of people visit the whale-watching platforms to see these magnificent creatures on their annual migration north. In last year’s migration more than 1,000 whales had been sighted off Cape Solander as at 6 July 2004, more than double the number seen the year before and the largest number since records have been kept.</para>

<para>Given the great delight and admiration which these superb animals engender in nearly all people worldwide, it seems extraordinary that Japan has announced plans to increase the number of whales which it kills each year. Between 1987 and 2003, Japan harvested more than 25,000 tonnes of whale meat for food in Japan, based on a spurious claim of ‘scientific’ whaling. The vast majority of marine science is conducted via non-lethal means, such as DNA examination of skin samples. I support the Prime Minister’s opposition to any extension of or indeed the continuation of whaling by Japan, and I call on Japan to reverse its policy and stop the senseless destruction of these amazing marine giants.</para>

<para>—I rise today to speak about a little-known, inherited blood disease known as thalassemia, which is carried by about one per cent of the Australian population. Earlier this month on 8 May it was World Thalassemia Day. There are about 450 people with thalassemia major in Australia and about 40 of those live in South Australia. It is important for the broader community to understand a little about thalassemia so that people who live with the condition do not feel that they have to worry about the stigma that has traditionally been associated with the disorder. Without treatment the condition is fatal. The body’s organs are deprived of oxygen because the structure of the haemoglobin is abnormal and the cells die after a few weeks instead of lasting around four months like those with normal haemoglobin.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In the seventies people with thalassemia usually died in their teens, but with the introduction of a drug which helps to reduce iron absorption people have a much better prognosis. However, the procedure is not easy, with people having the drug pumped under their skin for between eight and 12 hours a night up to seven days a week. It is important that people with thalassemia are supported to live as normal a life as they can under these circumstances. A big part of that is getting people to understand the disease and to understand that people can and do manage the condition.</para>
<para>Sadly, people have traditionally felt that there was a social stigma attached to letting people know that they had thalassemia. I hope that is becoming a thing of the past, because no-one should have to feel that they have to keep such a big part of their life a secret for fear of what another person will think. In bringing this disease to the attention of members of the House, I hope that I can make a small contribution to raising awareness and understanding.</para>

<para>Wentworth Falls Lake Bushcare Group is an outstanding group, regenerating an area of bushland on the edge of the beautiful Wentworth Falls Lake. I am pleased the government have been able to help the group with its valuable work, with two Envirofund grants—$6,000 in 2003-04 and $5,000 in this recent round. We have also been able to help the group with the very valuable volunteer small equipment grants scheme, a program which has helped many organisations add to the value of life in our community.

Over 110,000 people in Victoria attended the 114 events, which included 165 artists. I am very proud of the fact that some international jazz musicians like Wayne Shorter, Dr Bobby Jones and the Nashville Superchoir were here, along with great Italian artists Stephano Bollani and Paolo Fresu and the sensational Funk Off jazz band. There were many very famous Australian jazz people as well, including Paul Grabowski, Joe Chindamo and Kate Ceberano. Over five million Australians were exposed to the publicity of the conference, and the Melbourne International Umbria Jazz Festival and its chair, Albert Dadon, got $250,000 of free advertising from CNN to promote Melbourne all around the world as bringing a European and artistic edge to Australia. I want to urge the Victorian government and all the private donors who supported the festival to continue to support this fantastic expression of artistic merit. In Federation Square with 10,000 people and with Dr Bobby Jones, you could really feel that European and artistic edge coming through as the artists expressed their love of jazz and music. The people of Melbourne were able to see that too.</para>

<para>—Last week I received a letter from the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs advising me of a new scheme which allows local community groups in the electorate of Oxley to apply for funding to commemorate the 60th anniversary of Victory in the Pacific Day. A sum of $1.5 million has been allocated to assist communities across Australia to commemorate VP Day, and so $10,000 is available for organisations within the electorate of Oxley. This money can be used to support projects directly commemorating the 60th anniversary of VP Day on 15 August.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>While this is a welcome and worthy initiative, the letter contained scant detail about the actual application and approval process and seemed to be a last-minute thought, part of a very hurried process. With VP Day commemorations only a few months away, I believe there is insufficient time for many community organisations to make quality applications. This is just another example of a B-grade minister out of her depth. There have been many other blunders on other issues in Veterans’ Affairs—too many to mention here, but I can assure the minister the veterans are keeping count. It is not as if the 60th anniversary of VP Day crept up on us. The government have had about 60 years to do some planning on this but have done very little. It seems to me, as I said before, that they are taking a last-minute approach. I will certainly be doing everything I can to ensure that community groups in the electorate of Oxley make the most of the time available to them.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Gilmore for raising with me an issue that is very important to debate on public policy in this country, and that is: which side of politics is better at looking after the interests of workers in this country? The reality is that, in the time that we have been in government, real wages since 1996 have increased by 14.1 per cent. Under the previous Labor government real wages rose by just 1.2 per cent in 13 years. This is relevant because every time I hear somebody from the Labor Party talking about workplace relations reform, do you know what they say? They say, ‘The coalition wants to cut real wages.’ They said it in 1996, they said it in 1997, they said it in 1998 and they have been saying it ever since. But what is the reality? The reality, in contrast to the fiction, is that under us real wages have gone up. I say again to this parliament: I had no prouder boast in the last election campaign than to say to the people of Western Sydney that the coalition had done more for the workers of Australia than the Labor Party could ever have dreamt of doing. And that will be the same when the government’s workplace relations reforms are unveiled. Predictably, as surely as day follows night, the Leader of the Opposition will be up here saying, ‘Oh, they are going to cut real wages,’ just as he said in 1996. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: you were wrong in 1996 and you will be wrong again in 2005.</para>

<para>—There is no confusion. Quite plainly, as I indicated earlier, to the extent that we get a seasonal break the impact on the economy will be minimised. Or, put the other way around, the sooner it breaks and people get an opportunity to put their crops in, to harvest crops and to turn stock off, the better the growth forecast will be. It is quite obvious that many people are still in drought. The budget fully provides for them. That provision is untapped and is going out at the rate of about $4 million a week. But it is also the case, as every farmer knows, that, even as we speak, if we get good rain within the next few days, a lot of the pain that we unfortunately anticipate might happen—and which we are making provision for—may not yet happen.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I hope that everyone in this place would join me in hoping that over the next few days the weather forecast might turn around, we might get good rain and we might get a good wheat and cereal crop. In that sense, can I say that with the best will in the world you cannot accurately foretell what is going to happen in rural and regional Australia. But I make this very important point: if there is one thing the farm sector is glad of, it is that sound economic management has meant that interest rates have been much lower than they otherwise would have been. We remember the horrors for farmers of the 1980s and the 1990s, and if there is a second thing they can be thankful for, it is that we are in a financial position in this nation to ensure that as many as possible of them get through. If the ALP, with their sudden, new-found concern for the welfare of the farmers in this country, want to be regarded as quite genuine, the first thing they could do is to trot off and talk to their state colleagues about what they are going to do.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff for his question. I can inform the House that one of the great differences between the two sides of politics represented in this House is that this side of the House believes that Australians ought to have tax cuts on 1 July and the other side of the House opposes them.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We ought to be very clear about this: the Australian Labor Party believes that no tax cuts should be brought in from 1 July 2005. Can I also say that, in addition, this side of the House believes that senior Australians should get tax cuts and the Labor Party believes they should not. By opposing a reduction in the lowest tax rate from 17c to 15c—and I do not think this has occurred yet to the Leader of the Opposition—he opposes senior Australians getting a tax cut under the last budget that this government brought down.</para>
<para>In addition to that, the Leader of the Opposition talks about equity. And what is his equity? His equity is that if you are a low-income earner over 65 you should get no tax cut. That is his equity. This side of the House stands up for senior Australians while the so-called tax plan of the Australian Labor Party would cheat them out of any tax cut at all. I say to senior Australians who qualify for the senior Australians tax offset: look very carefully at the fine print of what the Australian Labor Party was talking about when it was in this House giving its budget reply.</para>
<para>I can go on. In addition to tax cuts, which we say should take place on 1 July and which the Labor Party say should not, this government has also increased the family tax benefit. Under the budget, which I announced, the family tax benefit part A threshold increases from $33,361 to $37,500, providing 400,000 low-income families with an additional $12.55 a week. That is, again, something that the Labor Party have not even agreed to at this stage. And let me say that family tax benefit A is real money—$600 goes into a bank account, comes out of a bank account and can buy goods and services. It is the same $600 which the Australian Labor Party promised to abolish if they were elected at the last election for all of those low-income Australian families the Leader of the Opposition heartlessly had no concern for in the last election. These changes mean that a single-income couple with one child under five and two dependent children have had a 29.5 per cent increase in their real disposable income since 1996 and, with the family tax benefit cashouts, effectively pay no net tax until they earn $46,000.</para>
<para>I am asked: ‘What is it that would ensure that the government could meet its tax promises?’ I will tell you what it is: the cessation of this useless blocking activity which the Leader of the Opposition is trying to put in place. The schedules that employers need to apply these tax cuts on 1 July 2005 are being prepared by the taxation commissioner. They can be disallowed by either house of the parliament. If they are disallowed in the Senate on the votes of the Australian Labor Party then 850,000 Australian employers will be thrown into confusion and Australians will not get their tax cut on 1 July 2005. Let me make this clear to the House: Labor will not block tax cuts. The very most that this useless blocking activity can accomplish is confusion for employers and a delay in those tax cuts. This side of the House stands for tax cuts on 1 July 2005, and we call on the Australian Labor Party to get out of the way and let Australians have them.</para>

<para>—Where do I start? I could start with the $36 million that you could give the working Australian people by handing back the ill-gotten gains of Centenary House. But let me simply say that, in relation to the disclosure limits, I remind the parliament that when the legislation about disclosure was introduced by the former Labor government a threshold of $1,000 in 1984 was fixed. That was increased during the term of the former government to $1,500. I believe that there is a case for further increasing it; I make no bones about that.</para>

<para>I notice that the Leader of the Opposition has been running around talking about corruption. Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition, through you Mr Speaker, that he does his own party a disservice, as well as a disservice to the party that I am proud to lead and the National Party, by talking about corruption. The reality is that, in the more than 100 years of Federation in this country, politics at a national level has been blessedly free of corruption on both sides. Therefore, all I can say is that in the name of cheap populism the Leader of the Opposition does as great a disservice to his own party as he does to the Liberal Party of Australia. There is a case for adjusting those disclosure levels, just as there is the case for, from time to time, adjusting the levels of tax deductibility of contributions. I do not apologise for saying that, and at an appropriate time we will give attention to the matter.</para>

<para>—I thank the honourable member for Dobell for his question and, together with the member for Robertson, for putting on a fantastic post-budget event quite recently in Gosford. Of course, one side of Australian politics believes that taxes should be cut on 1 July 2005; the other side of politics believes that there should be no tax cuts on 1 July 2005. In the extraordinary performance which he gave in reply to the budget, the Leader of the Opposition released a statement that says that there should be no change on 1 July 2005. I do not know if it has occurred to the Leader of the Opposition yet, but his tax changes are due to take effect on 1 July 2006. That just happens to be 13 or 14 months away. There is only one side of Australian politics that wants to cut taxes on 1 July 2005.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The second point that I will explain to the Labor Party backbench—because they do sometimes have a tendency to believe what their leader says—is that the Labor Party wants to introduce a welfare-to-work income offset. If you read the fine print, you will see that this increase of $680, this new welfare-to-work bonus, is to apply—wait for this—from 1 July 2008. The next federal election is in October 2007. The Leader of the Opposition has a tax cut for July 2008—one for the next parliament. I also point out that the change in the welfare-to-work bonus from 1 January in a full year would amount to a tax cut of $5 for anybody on $20,000 or less, but in the current financial year, because the Leader of the Opposition will introduce it only on 1 January, it would amount to a tax cut of $2.55 for people on $20,000 or less.</para>
<para>Can I also point out that, because the Leader of the Opposition does not reduce the tax rate from 17c to 15c, and tries to cover that up with a welfare-to-work bonus, senior Australians do not get anything. Senior Australians do not qualify for the welfare-to-work bonus; they qualify under the senior Australian tax offset.</para>
<para>So there is no tax cut on 1 July and no so-called $12 at all until 2008. In the current financial year, if you are on $20,000 or less, there is $2.50. And at the end of all of that, the Leader of the Opposition has a tax plan which, strangely enough, seems to be about the same value as the one which the government announced in the budget. That is funny. It is funny you should say that and funny you should announce it on Thursday. On Tuesday and Wednesday the opposition was claiming, was it not, that cutting taxes would put up interest rates? Then, on Thursday, it came out with a plan to cut taxes more. It is such a strong economic attack!</para>

What we say to the Australian Labor Party is this: you will not defeat tax cuts. Those opposite will not defeat them. The new Senate, at the very last, will pass them. All Labor can do for Australians is to delay the tax cuts which they deserve. We say to the Australian Labor Party: get out of the way and let those people have the tax cuts they deserve.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Lilley; I really do. I really thank the member for Lilley for that question. It is very, very kind of him. Both the Treasurer and I understand the difficulties that families in this country on modest incomes face. That is why we have been more generous to them than any former government has. It is amazing that the member for Lilley should talk about an annual income in the $40,000 range when, in answer to an earlier question, the Treasurer made the point that, because of the tax and family payment reforms of this government, a single-income family with two dependent children, with one of those children under five, has to get to $46,000 a year in income before they are, in net terms, paying any tax. It is that kind of reform that enables an independent organisation, NATSEM, headed by Ann Harding, to actually assert from her independence that, under this government, the position of low-income families, especially single-income families and especially sole parents, has improved enormously and that the bottom 60 per cent of taxpayers have enjoyed net gains from the tax and payment system at the expense of the top 40 per cent.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The reality is that, if you look at the budgets of this government, you see a continuum not only of strong economic policy—an economic policy, for example, that has seen unemployment fall to its lowest level in 30 years, has seen real wages rise by 14.1 per cent against a miserable 1.2 per cent under the former Labor government and has seen the number of working days lost per 1,000 employees average 67 over the last nine years, compared with an average of more than 190 days under the former government, the so-called friend of Australian workers, the so-called maestros of the industrial relations system of this country, the ultimate conductors, the ultimate producers, of industrial harmony in the country—but also of where in budget after budget we have given more and more to low- and middle-income families.</para>
<para>We have boosted the family tax benefits. We boosted them in the last election campaign. We will pay the $600 a child and, as the months go by after 1 July, there will be a reminder for about two million Australian families. When they receive the $600 a child payment they will be reminded that, if they had voted for the Labor Party at the last election, that $600 would have been taken from them. It remains a policy of the Australian Labor Party.</para>
<para>Can I say to the member for Lilley: under your policies, a family on $40,000 a year with two children would be worse off to the tune of at least $12,000 per annum. They would be worse off because they would be paying higher interest rates—and we have got the evidence to prove it—and they would face greater job insecurity and lower real wages. So if you are looking for a friend of low-income Australians, you will find them all on this side of the parliament.</para>

<para>—Can I thank the member for Braddon for the great interest that he displays in the forest industry in Tasmania. Can I say how pleased I was to go to Tasmania a little over a week ago, along with him and the member for Bass, and in the company—let me give him full credit—of the Labor Premier of Tasmania, who is a lot more in touch with the interests of the working people of Tasmania than any of his federal colleagues. Let me say how very pleased I am that I was able to conclude a historic agreement with the Premier of Tasmania which guaranteed the jobs of the workers in the forest industry in Tasmania and delivered a $250 million program to which the Tasmanian government contributed about $90 million and the federal government $160 million. It will involve investments in programs to support industry, jobs, the community and the environment.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This agreement—which will result in almost 90 per cent of the Tarkine being preserved from any logging, which strikes a fair balance between the interests of the environment, the interests of workers and the need to provide security and stability for the industry, which commits 170,000 hectares of old-growth forests to reserves, and which will result in over one million hectares being held in reserve—could never have been negotiated other than by a federal coalition government. Labor in the last election showed a willingness to put at risk the jobs of thousands of timber workers in Tasmania because they were desperately craving the indulgence of Green preferences on the mainland. They showed disdain, contempt and indifference to the interests of their traditional blue-collar workers and they rightly paid the price when the election came along.</para>
<para>Can I simply say to the government of Tasmania that the cooperative spirit in which this agreement has been negotiated is an example of what can be achieved when governments work together and when governments care about the job security of average Australians. It was a coalition federal government that was prepared to act to save the jobs of the timber workers. It was a punitive federal Labor government that could not have cared less about the jobs of those timber workers in Tasmania. They were desperately craving the preferences of Green voters on the mainland, many of whom saw through their cynicism, and they paid a doubly heavy price.</para>
<para>Can I finally say what I said at the signing ceremony in Tasmania: I place on record my appreciation of the cooperative spirit displayed by the construction division of the CFMEU. On this occasion, that division acted with a sensitive regard to the rights and interests of their members. That division was pro the interests of the Australian workers and they were willing in that cause to make common cause with the coalition. I finally say what a delight it was to make that announcement with my colleagues the member for Bass and the member for Braddon. I know that for many years into the future they will continue to represent the interests of the workers of Northern Tasmania.</para>

<para>—I will take a moment or two to analyse every part of that question, and, if I can add anything further to the answer I am about to give, I will. The basis on which the question is framed is that somehow or other all of the high-income electorates in this place are represented by this side of politics and all of the low-income electorates are represented by the other side. In fact that is not right. I saw a table the other day that showed that of the 10 electorates with the lowest incomes only one of them was not held by the coalition. I know that we represent a broader church in this place now than we might have in earlier days, and I know that the spectrum of people who are supporting the coalition is getting wider. It is the Labor Party that is narrowing its base to the inner metropolitan elite. I understand that.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The proposition is that we are only interested in representing these wonderful electorates like North Sydney, Higgins and Warringah. We are proud to represent those people. We are also very proud, equally proud, to represent the low-income electorates like Wide Bay, the low-income electorates in Northern Tasmania and the low-income electorates like Paterson and Longman. The list goes on and on.</para>
<para>I give this bit of advice to the member for Hunter, who I think is a person of good disposition: forget about this old idea that the Liberal Party and the National Party are in favour of all the rich people and you are in favour of all the workers. You have proved again and again that you do not understand the aspirations of the Australian worker, let alone have a capacity to represent them.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Cowper for his question and his obvious interest in this important issue to all Australians—because every Australian taxpayer will be receiving a tax cut thanks to the Howard government’s 2005 budget. The member for Cowper will be interested to know that the tax office is working very hard to find an answer to the confusion that has been put upon the Australian workplace, on all of the 860,000-odd employers who are out there trying to find a way through, as to how to deliver the tax cuts so richly deserved by hardworking Australians. The way it is having to do this is that the Tax Commissioner is having to put out not one but two sets of formulas of withholding tax so businesses can actually deliver those tax cuts to the hands of workers from 1 July. It is having to give out to workplaces—to 130,000 employers who actually have their own internal formulas—two separate formulas. The hope is that the Labor Party will get out of the way and allow these tax cuts to go through in time. In the event that they do not—in the event that the Labor Party keep stymieing Australian workers from receiving the tax cuts they richly deserve—there will be two sets of formulas so workplaces will be able to implement the tax cuts the Treasurer announced in the 2004 budget to be introduced from 1 July.</para>

<para>Then we also have the software providers out there who inform my office that there will be some cost of perhaps $10 million to them in wasted time and energy for one reason: the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party continue to stand in the way of a progressive tax system delivering tax cuts to Australian workers. To answer the member for Cowper’s question, there is only one thing that needs to happen. Today in this place the Leader of the Opposition or the member for Lilley needs to stand up here and say: ‘We will get out of the way. We will allow the tax cuts to go through. Let the ATO do its work. Let business get on with making a profit and delivering for the Australian economy and for Australian workers.’</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Perth for his question. He of course validated everything I said earlier in question time. Every time there is talk of changes to the workplace relations system the Labor Party jump up and say, ‘They’re going to cut real wages.’ They said that in 1996, they said it again in 1998 and they are saying it again now. Can I say in reply to the member for Perth that, just as over the last 9½ years you have been proved wrong, you will also be proved wrong as a result of these changes.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>These changes will deliver enormous benefits to the Australian economy. They will boost productivity. They will continue the process of real wage maintenance and gains that have been the case over the last 9½ years. Far from this being an exercise in cutting wages, this is an exercise in boosting the productivity of the Australian work force, this is an exercise in further strengthening the Australian economy, this is an exercise in winning for the Australian economy an even greater share of the globalised economy. Just as the old-fashioned, out-of-date, negative rhetoric of the Australian Labor Party has been proved wrong over the last 9½ years, you will be proved wrong when you see these reforms. The last thing I would say to the member for Perth is: do not believe everything you read in the newspapers.</para>

<para>—I thank the honourable member for her question. The Labor Party are into the big issues today. We look forward to hearing the Mark Latham annual lecture, by the way—given, no doubt, by the member for Hunter. Talk about revisionism! The judgment of the Papua New Guinea Supreme Court meant that the Australian police elements as part of the Enhanced Cooperation Program had no legal authority to exercise political powers in Papua New Guinea. This, in turn, exposed Enhanced Cooperation Program employees to criminal liability in carrying out their work. The police have withdrawn from Papua New Guinea—they did so on 17 May. But the non-police Enhanced Cooperation Program officials who will continue on in Papua New Guinea will do so as advisers only, not in in-line positions.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Already the Enhanced Cooperation Program has achieved good results. There have been improvements in law and order in Port Moresby. The financial and management structures within the government in Papua New Guinea have been improved. It is very important to remember that the Enhanced Cooperation Program, whilst it has undoubtedly been quite controversial in Papua New Guinea, has been very warmly welcomed by the people of Papua New Guinea. The public have been enormously supportive of it.</para>
<para>Both the Australian government and the Papua New Guinea government want to find a solution to enable the Enhanced Cooperation Program to continue. We will be working on that. We have had some discussions at officials level. I am expecting the Foreign Minister of Papua New Guinea, Sir Rabbie Namaliu, and the Minister for Internal Security, Bire Kimisopa, to visit Canberra later this week so we can begin discussions on how we sort out the legal questions. There is obviously a real difficulty when the court has found that the legislation implementing the treaty is unconstitutional. This is a decision of the court. We will all abide by the decision of the court—obviously, the Papua New Guinea government wants to do so—but we also agree that we would like to get the program back on its feet. Once we find an appropriate legal solution to that, the program will be fully reinstated.</para>

<para>—Anybody who is currently on what I think they call ‘parenting payment single’ will not have their payment affected. They will have an obligation, but they will not have it affected. The member for Sydney appears to be proceeding under the same misunderstanding as evidenced by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Evans, in a statement he put out today. It completely overlooks the fact that under the new arrangements which will apply to people newly coming on to the sole parent benefit after 1 July 2006 a single parent family with four dependent children under the age of 16 will receive a $16,000 per annum tax-free family tax benefit A. It also ignores the tax-free $2,000 per annum the single parent would receive if one of the children were under five. The total family tax benefit payable to a single parent family with four children aged over six in the circumstances described by Labor would be more than $614 per fortnight, tax free. Yet in his press statement the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate speaks of that family having to ‘survive’—that is the expression used by Senator Evans—on $813.80 a fortnight, deliberately or inadvertently omitting the $614 a fortnight that that family would receive in family tax benefits. I know that the Labor Party do not think family tax benefits are real, particularly when they have a ‘6’ in front of them, but I would have thought on something as fundamental as this that they would have got their facts right.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We have unapologetically introduced a new system. What it means for people currently on the sole parent benefit is that, when the youngest child reaches six, a person will be obliged to take on a part-time work responsibility. People coming into the system for the first time will continue to get the sole parent benefit, it is now understood, until the youngest child reaches the age of six and then the enhanced Newstart allowance will operate. There is, effectively, 13 months notice being given of that. We think the combination of policy contained in this system will result in more of these people going into the work force. We think that is good for them. We think it is good for the community. We think it would be a good idea if the Labor Party sat down and made an effort to understand the new proposal before attacking it.</para>

The Australian Industry Group today released a survey of some 700 employers, and this report from the Australian Industry Group is welcomed by the government—in particular, the remark made by the Chief Executive of AiG, Heather Ridout, in her foreword, in which she says that further reform to Australia’s workplace relations system is ‘an important element of the drive to make the Australian economy work even better’. These comments stand in marked contrast to statements by the Leader of the Opposition, who just last month argued that ‘the industrial relations lemon has been squeezed dry’. So we have a clear message coming from business, from a survey of some 700 employers through the AiG, saying that they want further workplace relations reform, yet the Leader of the Opposition is saying that this has been squeezed dry.

Will he do that? Does he have the leadership to listen to the voice of business when business is saying over and over again that further reform is necessary? The reality of the industrial relations changes which this government has put in place has meant more than a 14 per cent increase in real wages for Australians, compared with about 1.2 per cent under 13 years of the Labor Party. Our government will make tough decisions. We will not shirk the issues—unlike the Leader of the Opposition, who must be the first politician to ever suffer reform fatigue whilst still in opposition.</para>

<para>—I can understand the enthusiasm of the member for Bass, because I can inform him that the GP bulk-billing rate in Tasmania is up 18.4 per cent since December 2003. We had not a single word on health from the Leader of the Opposition in his budget reply or in his National Press Club speech, because of the divisions on his frontbench over the so-called Medicare Gold policy. But from this Howard government there is more good news on health.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The March quarter GP bulk-billing rate was 73.7 per cent, and that is a 7.2 per cent increase on December 2003. For children under 16, 80.7 per cent of GP visits were bulk-billed, and that is a 12.9 per cent increase on December 2003. Labor denies a tax cut for people over 65 but because of the Howard government 84.5 per cent of GP consultations for people over 65 are bulk-billed. That is a 10.5 per cent increase since December 2003. The bulk-billing rate in country areas is up 14.3 per cent since December 2003 and, as I said, 18.4 per cent in Tasmania.</para>
<para>Bulk-billing is certainly not the be-all and end-all of Medicare but it is important; it should be widely available, particularly for children and pensioners. That is precisely what is happening under the Howard government, and that is why the Howard government is still the best friend that Medicare has ever had.</para>

My question is to the Prime Minister, not the Treasurer, despite his determination to insert that comment in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. I refer the Prime Minister to allegations that four kilograms of marijuana were placed in Schapelle Corby’s baggage at Sydney airport, the infamous camel suit incident at Sydney airport in April and the alleged detection of a large quantity of cocaine in baggage at Sydney airport earlier this month. Can the Prime Minister confirm that, as Inspector of Transport Security, Mr Palmer was responsible for investigating the security of baggage handling at Australian airports? If Mr Palmer is not doing this important job, who is leading the Office of Transport Security?</para>

<para>—It is the case that, in November 2004, Mick Palmer took up an appointment with the Department of Transport and Regional Services as the Inspector of Transport Security. The inspector was to investigate transport security matters referred by me, and they would include such things as major transport security incidents, patterns or series of incidents that might point to a systemic failure or other possible weaknesses of aviation or maritime security problems. As a result of his initial recommendations, I might note, we have determined that we ought to put in place a legislative basis to support the inspector, particularly in the protection of information for no-blame investigation. But I reiterate the answer that I gave a moment ago: he is on a temporary assignment elsewhere. I do not see that going for very long and, in the meantime, the Office of Transport Security is fully capable of undertaking any necessary inquiries on my or the government’s behalf.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Ryan for his question and acknowledge his very keen interest in the growing relationship between Australia and China, particularly on the economic front. This morning in Sydney, I participated in a forum with the visiting Chairman of the National People’s Congress, Chairman Wu Bangguo, who is visiting Australia at the moment. Together we announced that today the first round of discussions with regard to the free trade agreement negotiations with China has begun in Sydney.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The economic relationship between China and Australia has grown dramatically in recent years, to the extent where two-way trade at the moment stands at about $A29 billion. It is not just through exports out of the resources and minerals sector; it is also through the efforts of the banking and financial services sector, tourism, education and agriculture. Of course, these are all sectors that will benefit from the successful conclusion of a free trade agreement with China. The feasibility study that the government undertook into an FTA with China indicated that over the next 10 years it could be worth $24.4 billion to the economy. It is certainly worth pursuing. The rate of growth in China is having a profound impact on the global economy as well as our regional economy and the Australian economy. Of course, we want to take advantage of that and be able to consolidate our position in that market.</para>
<para>We need to position the Australian economy well to take advantage of the growth in the global economy with our traditional trading partners but also with our major trading partners within the region. Our government has taken some hard decisions over recent years with regard to reform of the Australian economy. That has provided exporters with a very solid foundation to tackle global marketplaces. The challenge now for this country is to embrace new reforms in the industrial relations system so that we can boost productivity further and increase our competitive nature. Obviously, our government is absolutely focused on achieving this. The only thing that stands in the way is the Australian Labor Party, which is opposing these reforms and many other reforms. This is a challenge for the business community, as we heard the minister for workplace relations lay out. The business community is challenging the Labor Party to get out of the way.</para>
<para>We need to increase productivity in this country. We need to increase our competitiveness so that we can take up the challenges of the growth that is taking place in the global economy, with the integration particularly of the Chinese economy with the broader global economy. It is a challenge that we are taking up on the trade front. We have taken it up in terms of reform of the Australian economy. We now need to tackle the challenge of reforming the industrial relations system in Australia.</para>

<para>—My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of reports today that almost one in three uniformed Army, Navy and Air Force personnel surveyed in the 2004 Defence attitude survey are looking to leave the armed forces, that more than half of the soldiers surveyed believe the Army suffers from inadequate resources, and well over two-thirds of ADF personnel feel that military values and standards have declined? Given that the Treasurer did not mention the Australian Defence Force even once in his budget night speech, how does the Prime Minister now respond to this obvious indication of the extent of problems and pressures faced by our service men and women and their families?</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Barton for his question. Yes, I did see those reports. I can inform the member and the House that, last week or late the week before last, I wrote to the assistant defence minister, asking her to provide me with a current assessment of recruiting and retention levels in the armed forces.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I think it is fair to say that the current retention levels are broadly in line with the long-term average of the past 10 or 15 years. It is also true to say that, because of the strength of the economy and the well-rewarded employment alternatives that are available, it is correspondingly harder to retain and recruit the kinds of people we want. It is also the case, as the honourable member will know from his shadow portfolio responsibilities, that remuneration levels are set by an independent body. It is also the case that, when this government came to office, the one area that was absolutely quarantined from any budget cuts—in order to get rid of the $10½ billion deficit left to us by your leader—was Defence. There have been significant increases in the government’s provision for Defence over the 9½ years it has been in government.</para>
<para>I have to say that my experience and that of the defence minister and, indeed, of many others is that the enthusiasm and commitment of the men and women of the Defence Force remain at a very high level. We do need to understand that, in a very strong economy, we have to ensure that pay levels are adequate to retain sufficient people. I think it would be a mistake to infer, on the basis of one article in a newspaper, that everything contained in that article is correct, because it manifestly is not. Certainly, based on the advice I have and my own assessment, I do not find the depiction in that article as representative of the attitude of the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. But I can assure the honourable member that this government will continue in the future, as it has done in the past, to provide all the financial support that the defence forces need—and, if further enhancements are needed, they will be provided.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Hasluck for his question. It is well known that state governments own, operate, administer and primarily fund state schools and that the Commonwealth government assists the state governments in doing that. The federal government—the Howard government—had already committed $1½ billion for capital works in schools over the next four years. In addition to that, the Prime Minister announced during the election campaign that an additional $1 billion will be invested directly in Australian schools, with $700 million of it to go directly to government state schools.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As the member for Hasluck knows only too well, the Gosnells Primary School, which is in his electorate and is celebrating its centenary year, has toilets that are only marginally younger. For 20 years the Gosnells Primary School has been second on the list with the Western Australian Department of Education and Training—second on the list for 20 years—to have a toilet upgrade. The member for Forde will know that the Loganlea State School is desperately trying to get some shadecloth for the school. The member for Hume knows that the Bowral Primary School desperately needs some heating and sewerage work as well as a whole range of major projects which parents strongly support and will now receive.</para>
<para>This government will provide capital works funding directly to Australian public state schools. Parent organisations and principals have to sign off on the projects. Up to $150,000 will be provided directly to the schools for projects that the parents believe are critically important in those schools. I noticed yesterday, in the <inline font-style="italic">Sun-Herald</inline>, that parent groups in the state of New South Wales have welcomed this funding. The article was headed ‘Federal money to save our schools’ and said:</para>
<quote>
<para>Sharryn Brownlee, president of the NSW Federation of Parents and Citizens Associations, said parents, frustrated by the long wait for funds from the State Government, were taking advantage of the Coalition’s program.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">She described it as a lifeline.</para>
<para>One thing I would say to the states is that I am deeply disturbed by what Queensland members have told me: that the Queensland government, through its political operatives in the education department, is telling school principals in that state that, if they cooperate with this initiative of money going directly into parents’ projects in schools, it will be ‘a career-ending move’. That is the kind of crippling, ideological bureaucracy that parents have had a gutful of putting up with. This government is determined to break through the educationally constipated bureaucracy at a state level.</para>

<para class="block">To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Federal Parliament:</para>
<para class="block">The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House, that the current system of tax-payer-funded cared accommodation, respite &amp; support services, discriminates against citizens with disabilities aged less than 65 years. Under the current Commonwealth, State &amp; Territories Disability Agreement (CSTDA), the states, and territories have dismally failed to meet even the urgent supported accommodation needs of Australians less than 65 years old, who have dependent disabilities. Disability services systems deny to people with dependent disabilities the same choices in cared accommodation and respite as those provided in aged care.</para>
<para class="block">Cared accommodation for the disability sector has all but halted. There are thousands of urgent cases of persons on ‘years -long’ waiting lists, and family caregivers are in despair. Primary family Carers are suffering untold distress; as caring citizens they work 365 days per year with no pay, no days off, no annual leave, and no superannuation. There is a clear and present need for the Commonwealth to take full responsibility for the cared accommodation and respite support needs of all Australians with dependent disabilities.</para>
<para class="block">Your petitioners therefore request the House to:</para>
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>Take immediate action to stop the age discrimination in the provision of and choice in cared accommodation, by taking full responsibility for all Australians with dependant disabilities.</para>

</list>
</motion>
<para class="block">Last week’s demonstration outside New South Wales Parliament House contained an unlikely alliance of property investors, real estate agents and building unions. That alliance was forged not by partisan politics but by opposition to the Carr government’s extended land tax regime and new vendor tax and by a concern over the terrible damage it is inflicting—on homeowners, on mum and dad investors, on the property industry, on building workers and on the New South Wales economy.</para>
<para>Time prevents a detailed analysis of the inequity, the inefficiency and the short-sightedness of this tax but allows me to briefly make the following points. Firstly, the Labor government’s ideologically driven view that these new taxes would somehow be acceptable because they hit the wealthy is badly mistaken. Some 400,000 new property owners—those whose assets were previously low enough to escape the pre-existing threshold—have become land tax payers for the first time. Most of these were ordinary, hardworking Australians who had gone to great efforts to acquire a small investment property to build a nest egg to save for their retirement. Others were owners of small holiday shacks, which perhaps had been in the family for decades, or were those with an extra block of land on which they hoped to build their dream home. These people have been slugged by Premier Carr’s unfair tax.</para>
<para>Even worse, those being forced to sell have been hit by the double whammy of Labor’s 2.25 per cent vendor tax on the depressed property market it has created. The state government might try to brush this off, but those in the industry are well aware of its gravity. As one of my local real estate agents, Don Nott, said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I’ve been an agent for 30 years and I’ve seen fluctuations and downturns in the real estate industry which have been caused by factors on a national scale, but this is the first time I’ve seen New South Wales singled out and disadvantaged against other states.</para>
<para class="block">The main problem with these dumb taxes is that they are already starting to cost jobs and it is the little people who are being hurt. This is only the beginning of the pain because once the ripple effect starts, it’s hard to stop.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">These taxes are causing pain. These taxes are forcing property investors to flee New South Wales for Queensland and Victoria and they are having an adverse effect on local small businesses, real estate agents, the building industry and jobs. Looking at the figures for the Blue Mountains, for example, sales of properties in the Blue Mountains in the last year were down to 1,386, roughly half of the 2,687 that they were in the previous 12 months to May 2004.</para>
<para>Recent unemployment figures highlight the impact that these taxes are already having on jobs in New South Wales. Eighteen months ago New South Wales had the lowest unemployment rate in the country; it now has the second highest. While the national unemployment level is 5.1 per cent, the slowing New South Wales economy is creating rising unemployment—up now to 5.5 per cent in New South Wales.</para>
<para>Bob Carr’s badly targeted tax is costing jobs in New South Wales. As Andrew Ferguson, the New South Wales CFMEU secretary, said last month:</para>

<para class="block">With every investor that moves their money interstate or overseas because of this unfavourable tax, stamp duty and other government revenue is lost and jobs are lost.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Jobs are being lost in New South Wales because of the Carr government’s unfair taxes.</para>
<para>Thirdly, these taxes are affecting not only investors and building workers; they are affecting the most vulnerable: the renters in New South Wales. The estimated 40 per cent drop in purchases of investment properties is leading to a growing shortage of rental properties. Estimated vacancy levels in Sydney are now only 2.2 per cent, where anything below three per cent is considered a shortage.</para>
<para>Fourthly, this tax is unnecessary. There is no excuse for these extra taxes in New South Wales, except the abject failure and mismanagement of the New South Wales government. They ought to be awash with funds. Since coming to office the New South Wales government have received $7.2 billion more than budgeted in stamp duties and other tax revenue. This year they will receive $10.4 billion in GST revenue, which is up 4.9 per cent on last year and $60 million more than they would have had had there been no tax reform and had they been relying on their own tax regime. Yet, sadly, the New South Wales Labor government cannot seem to manage. The only explanation is fiscal incompetence. Who is footing the bill for this incompetence? The people of New South Wales: real estate agents and their staff; conveyancers and others in the property sector; mum and dad investors; building workers; and the growing number of unemployed in the state. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—This is a rather pathetic attempt to pre-empt the New South Wales budget, which will be handed down tomorrow. The fact is that, when you look at New South Wales finances and then you look at Commonwealth finances, you get some interesting figures. Total New South Wales revenues grew by 14.7 per cent between 2001-02 and 2004-05. This represented an annual average increase of 4.7 per cent. Commonwealth revenues increased by 22.6 per cent during this period—an average annual increase of around seven per cent. Commonwealth company tax increased from $27 billion in 2001-02 to an expected $41 billion in 2004-05, an increase of 51 per cent—or an annual average increase of 14.6 per cent. In 2003-04 New South Wales residents paid around $11,000 per capita in Commonwealth taxes, including the GST. The GST was around $1,800 per capita. In 2003-04 New South Wales residents paid around $2,248 per capita in New South Wales taxes. For every dollar that New South Wales taxpayers pay to the state, they pay around $5 to the Commonwealth. Those are the facts of the matter, from the highest taxing government in Australia’s history.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is also interesting that in New South Wales the Commonwealth is threatening to cut off national competition payments from 2006-07. I invite the New South Wales members of the House of Representatives to actually complain and take to their ministers the issue of why $260 million is being taken from New South Wales.</para>
<para>This couples with the government’s ideological agenda to tie up all capital funding with their new IR requirements. We have the absurd situation where funding for the National Water Initiative, which is important in terms of overcoming drought, is linked to industrial relations. When it comes to the needs of farmers in New South Wales, I am sure that when the water runs out in Goulburn, they will not be asking whether the government’s IR policies have been supported by the New South Wales government.</para>
<para>The biggest factor in housing in New South Wales is, of course, interest rates. What we have seen is the Commonwealth break its promise to the electorate, with interest rates rising and the prospect of more to come.</para>
<para>When it comes to Commonwealth-state finances, you need go no further than the issue of skills. We have seen massive cuts in funding in real terms for the ANTA agreements, with the states having to pick up the slack and ensure that there are at least some skilled workers being trained.</para>
<para>The fact is that I am not surprised that the members opposite moved this motion, but they should have a look at the papers that are available to them. In its Commonwealth-state financial relations section, the federal government Commonwealth Budget Paper No. 3 from last year stated:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">For example, the CGC assessed that New South Wales has a relatively stronger capacity to raise revenue from land tax and stamp duty on property transfers and payroll tax ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So, while they are here saying it should be withdrawn, last year’s budget papers say it should be increased. They need to make up their minds. But we all know what is motivating the members for Greenway, Lindsay and Macquarie in this. The member for Greenway is a product of it already. The member for Greenway is a product of the right wing takeover of the New South Wales branch which occurred last Friday. The member for Macquarie, Kerry Bartlett, has a couple of small ‘l’ liberal views and he can hear the jackboots coming up to Macquarie, as extreme conservatives and members of One Nation take over the Liberal Party—people like Alex Hawke and David Clarke. Alex Hawke does not think John Brogden, the leader of the New South Wales Liberal Party, belongs in the Liberal Party! That is the motivating factor—</para>

<para>—The member for Grayndler and I have had some great debates, but this is the lowest he has ever scraped the barrel. He is defending Michael Egan, the former Treasurer of New South Wales, who grandiosely mucked up the New South Wales economy in one fateful move last year with the introduction of the vendor tax, which is what we are talking about here today. I noticed that, under intense pressure from the member for Macquarie, the member for Grayndler still did not answer the question of whether he supports New South Wales’s hideous property taxes. Thirty per cent of New South Wales revenue is raised from property taxes. Nothing in the Northern Territory is raised from property taxes; there are no property taxes in the Northern Territory.

<para>—Thirty per cent of New South Wales state revenue is typically gathered from property taxation, including stamp duty, mortgage duty, land tax and vendor transfer duty. In the up and coming intergovernmental agreement the federal government is negotiating with the states to withdraw mortgage duties. What a relief it would be for first home buyers if they did not have to pay mortgage duties. And which is the one state holding out, hanging in there for their cut of the property taxes? New South Wales. They want to whack it on again. The ludicrous thing is that Michael Egan justified this tax when it was introduced on the basis that it was about keeping Sydney house prices affordable. Who do you want affordable housing for? It is not for the member for Grayndler’s electorate. No, it is for the electorates in Western Sydney, those of the members for Greenway, Macquarie and Lindsay. We need affordable housing, and that means affordable housing for renters.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>We want rents to be affordable in Sydney because renters are the people who are least able to afford housing. They are not home buyers. In terms of the property market, when you are doing a churn in Sydney the very people you want to help into the property market are your first home buyers. So in this market, yes, you have slowed the rise of property price increases in Sydney but at the same time you have put rents up through the roof. Investors have left the market—they have gone to Queensland and to other states with lower property taxes—and the rental market is tightening in New South Wales. There are already figures coming through showing that there are no further rentals and that rents are increasing. Michael Egan thought he was very clever with this tax, because he thought, ‘Oh, it’ll go on to investors and the federal government will pay half of it anyway.’ But there is still the other half that the investor is going to collect off the tenant. If you think for one minute, you will see that rents are going to rise higher to cover the cost of this tax. The very people Labor said they were there to support are the very people who will be paying it. It is the most disgraceful tax.</para>
<para>At the federal level we permit negative gearing and all sorts of tax incentives to keep rents affordable, especially in cities like Sydney. Yet what does Bob Carr do? Unbelievably, he allows the most gross mismanagement of any economy ever. Access Economics forecast that if the New South Wales government had just left stamp duty alone, they would be $280 million richer from it. That is a huge amount of money which they could be giving back through payroll tax and stamp duties on mortgages. They could be doing all sorts of things to make housing affordable.</para>
<para>New South Wales is the highest taxing state. The member for Grayndler goes on about the federal government’s taxes, but we are the federal government. New South Wales is the highest taxing state, and what do we get for our money from the Bob Carr government? No new roads. The federal government has had to move in and do the capital works on most schools because Bob Carr cannot afford them. Here is a guy under so much pressure to get rid of absolutely regressive taxes, and yet in tomorrow’s budget he will probably fiddle around and say that he is in the red. My bet is that the New South Wales government will come out tomorrow with no relief in sight for our poor New South Wales investors, our 400,000 mum and dad investors who are really getting slugged by this tax. At the end of the day, we will still have a state budget that is in arrears, totally in the red and not delivering the essential services that the people of Western Sydney want: good policing, good schools, good roads. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para class="block">The great Australian dream is now a nightmare for many. Most young people will never be able to afford their own home.</para>
<para class="block">According to the Reserve Bank, 60 per cent of the population have paid down their loan or have a mortgage. That leaves 40 per cent out in the cold.</para>

<para class="block">John Howard and company have been re-elected but their inaction may cost you more than you’ve bargained for.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So I said. Today’s motion is the first attempt by anyone in the government to look at the crisis of housing affordability and, instead of going to the heart of the issue, the cost of housing, it is a cheap shot over land tax—land tax which, in Victoria, is not on the family home but on commercial and investment properties, with many businesses, such as aged care, exempt.</para>
<para>The Victorian state government has heard the cry of investors and many self-funded retirees, who rely on rental income as their primary source of income in retirement, and has provided substantial tax relief in this year’s budget to around 44,000 taxpayers. But this measure from the Victorian government and the motion before this House will not provide relief to renters or to first home buyers locked out of an overinflated investment market. The government thinks that the housing boom is terrific and that home owners now have a huge amount of equity, but who of us will realise that asset? Home owners are not about to sell the family home and, with so many people geared to the hilt, even if they do sell the family home, they will not walk away with any equity—most of them will still walk away with debt.</para>
<para>The housing affordability summit in 2004 found that affordability of housing was at its lowest level ever and that this would get worse if vigorous and coordinated action was not taken immediately. In the past 10 years average house prices relative to income have doubled, the proportion of first home buyers has fallen by 30 per cent, average monthly loan repayments have increased by 50 per cent and the proportion of low-rent homes has fallen by 15 per cent. So what is the government doing? Today it is beating up on land tax, patting itself on the back for the first home owners’ grant—which it put in place because of the GST. It has done very little to address property spruikers and is telling everyone that, if they just go out and buy property, they will get rich. That has done more to take away investment than land tax has, by any measure. A recent study by Demographia has revealed:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... Sydney is less affordable than New York, Melbourne is less affordable than Miami and Las Vegas is more affordable than Brisbane, Adelaide or Hobart.</para>
<para>Housing affordability is a major issue for Australians ... [and] the Howard Government has had its head in the sand on this issue. Despite years of heartache for Aussie battlers trying to get into their first home, the first draft of a housing affordability strategy is not even expected to be released until the middle of this year.</para>
<para>Labor supports a unified national approach to tackling the housing affordability crisis. We condemn the Howard Government for its complete lack of national leadership as housing costs have spiralled out of control.’</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Following my <inline font-style="italic">Insiders</inline> appearance last year, David from the Tenants Union of Victoria sent me the following email:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I’m writing to congratulate you on raising the important issue of housing affordability ...</para>
<para class="block">It is a sad fact that there is a lack of affordable housing throughout Melbourne including in your electorate of Chisholm. At the Tenants Union we provide assistance to almost 30,000 tenants annually in both private and social housing systems who are suffering through unaffordable or inappropriate housing. We assist many people for whom housing related poverty is a reality—many paying huge percentages of their limited incomes on housing. We recognise that for many Victorians the dream of owning their own home is becoming a fantasy and that many of your constituents will probably never own their own home.</para>

<para>—I welcome the opportunity to speak on the private members’ motion on land and vendor taxes before the House today. Land and vendor taxes place a great burden on the people of Western Sydney, including those that I represent in the electorate of Greenway. At their core, the New South Wales land and property taxes are restrictive and inequitable. It becomes more difficult to enter the property market in New South Wales and investment is driven out of the state to more tax friendly environments. In Western Sydney 60 per cent of people are endeavouring to buy their own homes. This is very different in areas in the eastern suburbs, where it is around 30 per cent. My understanding is that it is the state’s responsibility to look after public housing.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Most people who enter the property market and are affected by this tax are not wealthy. They are the mum and dad investors who are seeking to provide for their futures and boost their superannuation. Increasingly, they find themselves unable to invest in property in New South Wales. After the tax-free threshold was removed in 2004, the number of people liable to pay land tax increased significantly. Coupled with this, the introduction of the progressive land tax scale has resulted in serious inefficiencies in the property market. To illustrate this, let me share with you the example of a couple who live in my electorate, in the suburb of Glenwood. These are the very people I spoke of earlier, who want to prepare for their future. The family bought the property before the introduction of the land tax. Within weeks of the tax being introduced they were faced with the challenge of a falling property market. Now the value of the property has dropped below its original purchase price.</para>
<para>Concerns have been raised that in New South Wales the land valuation system contains significant flaws which lead to undervaluations of properties. This allows the government to simply raise land valuations closer to the market rates, increase their own revenue and leave the mum and dad investors with increases in their tax liability from year to year. It is hardly surprising then that property investment in New South Wales is falling. When travelling around Greenway, I am also highly aware of the impact of the vendor tax. It is very easy to see this tax is purely a structural tax. It is, however, a tax of paradoxes. When it was introduced to New South Wales it was estimated to raise $690 million a year as well as to act as a disincentive to buy and sell property. This was supposed to help ease the pressure on the property market. In the next financial year the tax was estimated to have raised $367 million. The paradox is clear: the New South Wales government introduced a revenue raising mechanism that slowed growth, reducing the overall tax take and negating the need to introduce it in the first place. But the Carr government have no plans to abolish the tax.</para>
<para>When I visit local businesses in Greenway I see first-hand the effect of the vendor tax. The market has slowed significantly. When staff leave places of employment they are not replaced because employers simply cannot afford it. The Real Estate Institute of New South Wales noted this year that the vendor tax especially hurts the people of Western Sydney. A substantial proportion of property investors reside and invest in Western Sydney. Now they are looking to invest in other states, primarily Queensland. Construction is slow, property transactions are falling and housing affordability in New South Wales continues to be out of the reach of so many. The Carr government continue to ignore the people of Western Sydney. But they continue to claim they have been hard done by when it comes to the GST.</para>
<para>This year New South Wales will receive an almost five per cent increase in GST revenue. Budget balancing assistance will begin in 2006-07 to ensure that New South Wales is no worse off due to tax reform. The Carr government signed up to the GST agreement in 1999 knowing all the details of the collection and distribution of GST revenue. Now, after six years, they have begun to complain. The reality of the situation is that these taxes could easily be abolished with no financial penalty for New South Wales, freeing the property market to increase, enabling people to be able to invest, and encouraging employment in the real estate market. The vendor tax and the land tax must be abolished, and it is with great pleasure that I support this motion.</para>

<para>—What an interesting contribution to this debate we have had from government members. Can I congratulate the member for Lindsay, who says that the vendor tax is an impediment to first home owners. Of course, the stamp duty has been removed for first home owners in New South Wales. I think some 35,000 first home owners have benefited, many in Western Sydney, from the introduction of the vendor tax and land tax.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I have to say that I would happily abolish these taxes. But I do not understand why the member for Greenway, the member for Macquarie or the member for Lindsay will not stand up for the people of New South Wales. Yes, we have a GST, and $13 billion is raised annually from the men, women and children of New South Wales. Do you know how much New South Wales gets back? It gets back $10 billion. We pay $13 billion in GST and we get back $10 billion. If you would agree to give New South Wales what it pays in GST then of course we could get rid of taxes—the land tax and the vendor tax. But the fact is you do not give New South Wales a fair deal.</para>

<para>—The member for Grayndler pointed out that in fact it was the Commonwealth’s own Commonwealth Grants Commission that in last year’s budget papers assessed New South Wales as having a relatively stronger capacity to raise revenue from land tax and stamp duty on property transfers and payroll tax. Here is the Commonwealth, through its Commonwealth Grants Commission, saying, ‘New South Wales, you raise more money.’ I wonder why the member for Macquarie, the member for Lindsay and the member for Greenway do not quote the Grants Commission’s statements that New South Wales has 15,873 more bus stops than it needs, 1,270 more buses than it needs, 18 kilometres too much of underground rail track and 38 kilometres too much of above-ground rail track. Those figures are all from the Commonwealth Grants Commission in the 2004 methodology review working papers.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The Grants Commission say that in New South Wales we spend $90.76 per person more on health than we should. We heard the Minister for Education, Science and Training in question time saying that the Commonwealth is going to save the schools of New South Wales. But their Grants Commission—and you do not hear a word of it—say that New South Wales is spending $11.64 per person more on education than it should. They are saying that in New South Wales we are spending too much money on health, education, rail, and bus transport, and all the while New South Wales is being diddled by $3 billion. I say to the member for Greenway that if New South Wales had that money then it could spend $60 million more in your electorate. And, if you voted for the $12 tax cut, everyone in your electorate would be better off. I am sure the people of Stanhope Gardens, Quakers Hill, Schofields, Kings Langley and Lalor Park would love to see $60 million more spent in the electorate of Greenway. The same goes for the electorate of Lindsay. I am sure that the people of Castlereagh, Llandilo, Werrington County, Claremont Meadows, Glenmore Park and Orchard Hills would love to see the New South Wales government spending $60 million more in your electorate. But, according to your Grants Commission, we are already spending too much on education, we are already spending too much on health and we are already spending too much on transport.</para>
<para>Mr Deputy Speaker, it is important that you and all honourable members know that if New South Wales had that $3 billion we could hire 2,800 new police officers, 2,800 teachers and 2,800 new nurses and we could halve the land tax and abolish the business taxes that Mr Costello does not like. Give New South Wales a fair share and it can do it. But do not come into this House saying that the vendor tax is hurting new home buyers. That is an absolute outrage because, as a result of that tax, they do not pay stamp duty.</para>

<para class="block">In acknowledging the 90th anniversary of the Gallipoli campaign, I yet again call on the government to award a posthumous Australian Victoria Cross to Private John Simpson Kirkpatrick. I have been campaigning for this since 2000, and I implore the government to listen to the people of Australia and reconsider its decision to deny Simpson the honour he has earned and deserves.</para>
<para>I have received tremendous support from all across Australia, and internationally from the United States, the UK and Turkey. I wish to thank not only the Australian public but also the state premiers and the media, especially the ABC and the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Mail</inline> in Queensland. Of course, I also wish to thank the relatives of Simpson.</para>
<para>I have received letters from Mrs P Coomber, granddaughter of Peggy Balreaves, the eldest sister of John Simpson Kirkpatrick; her two sisters, Peg Heiser and Jean Thompson; and her brother Ted Balreaves recommending that, if the Victoria Cross is awarded to their Uncle Jack, the family will donate the award to the Canberra War Memorial. Mrs Coomber forwarded letters from three grandchildren of Sara Christie, the sister of their Uncle Jack. The family have collected signatures on petitions and noted that the most common response from people was that they thought that Simpson already had the Victoria Cross. Mrs Coomber noted that in 1907 two British officers were posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for their actions in South Africa in 1879 and that, even though it is 90 years since the landing at Gallipoli, her uncle’s deeds are still remembered. Mrs Coomber believes that most people would not know the name of one officer who took part in the Gallipoli campaign; however, they remember a humble private who, for 24 days under constant gunfire, risked his life to save 300 of his mates.</para>
<para>When Simpson was sent to Gallipoli with the 3rd Field Ambulance as a stretcher-bearer he soon found that, with the assistance of his donkeys, he was able to rescue injured soldiers single-handedly. To rescue over 300 people while under direct enemy fire in the last 24 days of his life is indeed an incredible feat. That is 12 to 13 people a day. You would think that one such rescue would be enough to see a man awarded the highest possible honour, and you would be right. But this is not the case. It is not the case even though Simpson was officially recommended for the Victoria Cross on 3 June 1915 by his commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Alfred Sutton, who wrote:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It is difficult to get evidence of any one act to justify the Victoria Cross—the fact is he did so many.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It is not the case even though Colonel Monash—later General Sir John Monash—in a submission to divisional headquarters said of him:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Simpson knew no fear and moved unconcernedly amid shrapnel and rifle fire, steadily carrying out his self-imposed task day by day.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Even though every Australian learns as a schoolchild of the brave deeds of Private Jack Simpson Kirkpatrick, and even though each year on Anzac Day we revisit the tale of his bravery and courageous deeds, the Victoria Cross was denied because he was recommended under the wrong category of heroism.</para>
<para>The error was compounded when a request in 1967 was denied again when Australian leaders tried to correct the error by sending a petition to the War Office, signed by Prime Minister Holt, the Governor-General, the Chief of General Staff and other leaders on behalf of the Australian people. The reason for the denial was that it would be setting a dangerous precedent—which was incorrect, because a precedent had already been set when, in 1907, as I stated earlier, two British officers, Lieutenants Melvill and Coghill, were posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for their actions in South Africa 28 years previously.</para>
<para>Further adding to the travesty of justice is that Simpson’s donkey Murphy was awarded the RSPCA Purple Cross Award posthumously by Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer in a ceremony at the Australian War Memorial on 19 May 1997.</para>
<para>Simpson is a national hero. He deserves to be awarded the Victoria Cross and I call on all members of this House to support the motion. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I rise today to address the motion presented by the member for Shortland. I would like to inform the House that the proposal by the member for Shortland to posthumously award John Simpson Kirkpatrick—‘Simpson’, as we know him—the highest recognition for gallantry in a theatre of war, a Victoria Cross, is ill-founded.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Like all Australians, I acknowledge the distinguished service of Simpson during the Gallipoli campaign. He was a brave man who took great risks with his own life and safety to help fallen comrades. No Australian would ever want to diminish, in any way, Simpson’s contribution to World War I. However, 90 years after Simpson was killed on 19 May 1915 on the Gallipoli battlefield, it is just not possible to award him the Victoria Cross. If the Victoria Cross for Australia—and, let us face it, it is still an imperial award; it is not an Australian award—were to be awarded posthumously to Simpson, it would set a dangerous precedent which would undoubtedly lead to further calls from politicians—unfortunately, from politicians—to have the end-of-war lists reopened. It is not politicians who award military honours or awards.</para>
<para>Based on such a precedent, it could be proposed that Seaman Edward ‘Teddy’ Sheean should be awarded the Victoria Cross because of his gallant and brave actions during a Japanese attack on HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Armidale</inline> in December 1942. What about Gunner Albert Cleary? Should he be awarded the Victoria Cross as a reminder of the 1,700 Australians who died on the death marches as Australian prisoners of war at Sandakan in 1945? Should we take this one step further and award a Victoria Cross to the 234 Light Horse soldiers who sacrificed their lives at the battle of The Nek on the morning of 7 August 1915? These soldiers certainly showed raw courage and bravery when they went over the top into Turkish machine-gun fire. Like Simpson, they showed courage under fire through their gallant actions. The list could go on and on. Eventually it would denigrate the Victoria Cross and all it represents.</para>
<para>However, I would like to point out the biggest flaw in the argument of the member for Shortland. It was not the wish of Simpson’s commanding officer to award him the Victoria Cross. If the member for Shortland had actually done some research, she would know that already. For the record, Simpson’s commanding officer, Captain Fry, did discuss the possibility of Simpson being awarded a Victoria Cross with Colonel John Monash, the day after Simpson’s death. The report by Monash at the time did not include any recommendation for a Victoria Cross, but rather a Mention in Dispatches, with which Simpson was honoured.</para>
<para>A Mention in Dispatches is an award for gallantry. In 1991, under the Australian honours and awards system, the Mention in Dispatches, which was an imperial award for gallantry, was replaced with the Commendation for Gallantry. In fact, a Commendation for Gallantry is the fourth highest award that can be given to an Australian soldier. Furthermore, during World War I, the only two gallantry awards that could be given to a soldier killed in action were the Victoria Cross or the Mention in Dispatches.</para>
<para>Of the thousands of men and women who have fought for Australia since the Boer War, there have only ever been 97 recipients of the Victoria Cross. None of them ever, for one instance, joined the war front with the aim of receiving such an honour. And neither did Simpson. Instead, he joined the war because he saw it as his patriotic duty to serve his country and defend the values enshrined in our Constitution. All Australians understand and recognise the courageous, brave and gallant service of all military personnel and the supreme sacrifice many have made for their country. Posthumously awarding a VC to Simpson would not change their beliefs.</para>
<para>The member for Shortland’s crusade is nothing more than a cheap politicisation of the highest military award for valour and just shows her lack of respect for the 97 Australian soldiers who are recipients of the Victoria Cross. I call on the member for Shortland to respect the decision of Colonel, later Sir John, Monash, who was best equipped to determine acts of selfless courage with regard to gallantry.</para>

<para>—It is regrettable that the member for Maranoa should inject such an extraordinary partisan turn into a debate about what is recognised across the country as exceptional gallantry on the part of Simpson. I think what the member for Shortland has been seeking to do is continue the public debate about how Simpson’s legacy is best reflected and best honoured by the country. It is not at all in the spirit of such debates in this place for the member for Maranoa to adopt such an unfortunate and partisan tone. I am sad about that.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is appropriate, in this the 90th year since the Anzacs landed at Gallipoli, that we have this debate. The Anzac spirit is alive and well, evidenced four weeks ago when hundreds of thousands of people across Australia took to the streets to commemorate Anzac Day. Across the country, Australians came out to pay their respects. In Sydney alone, 250,000 people came out. In my home town of Brisbane, the President of the Queensland RSL, Bill Mason, estimated that 15,000 people came out on Anzac Day. At Gallipoli, up to 20,000 made the trek to Anzac Cove for the dawn service. The Anzac spirit is clearly not restricted to those directly affected by the war and the losses sustained from it; it is shared right across the nation, and that is how it should be. It is a part of the Australian character. We hold dear a respect for those who have served our country, regardless of when they did it, where they did it or how they did it.</para>
<para>Today we debate whether one of those who served Australia has been adequately recognised for his contribution. The story of John Simpson Kirkpatrick is well known. After landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915, he reportedly spent 24 days working to save the lives of his colleagues and his comrades in arms. Aided by donkeys, Private Simpson transported wounded soldiers from the field of battle back to safety where their injuries could be treated. On 19 May 1915, while making his way through Shrapnel Gully, Simpson was mortally wounded and joined the thousands of brave young Australians who lost their lives at Anzac Cove.</para>
<para>The debate that has engulfed the contribution of Private Simpson has been unfortunate. Although he was nominated for recognition on a number of occasions, Simpson, according to some, was not properly decorated for his bravery. Simpson was officially recommended for the Victoria Cross on 3 June 1915 by his unit. The Commander of the 4th Brigade, Colonel Monash, later General Sir John Monash, nominated Simpson for military honours. In a submission to the Australian and New Zealand divisional headquarters on 20 May 1915, Colonel Monash declared:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Private Simpson and his little beast (a donkey) earned the admiration of everyone at the upper end of the valley. They worked all day and night throughout the whole period since the landing, and the help rendered to the wounded was invaluable. Simpson knew no fear and moved unconcernedly amid shrapnel and rifle fire, steadily carrying out his self-imposed task day by day, and he frequently earned the applause of the personnel for his many fearless rescues of wounded men from areas subject to rifle and shrapnel fire.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Monash’s submission was rejected. The contribution Simpson made to the Australian effort in Gallipoli has been subject to continued debate ever since. The official Australian war historian CEW Bean wrote:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Simpson escaped death so many times that he was completely fatalistic; the deadly sniping down the valley and the most furious shrapnel fire never stopped him ... He carried many scores of men down the valley, and had saved many lives, at the cost of his own.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Colonel Monash again recognised Simpson’s contribution by stating:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Simpson was worth a hundred men to me.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I place on the record here in this place my admiration for the contribution of that remarkable Australian, Sir John Monash.</para>
<para>While Simpson’s contribution has not been recognised by the awarding of the Victoria Cross, he has been recognised more recently as he and his donkey have now become the official emblems of the Gallipoli Research Foundation, an initiative of the Greenslopes Private Hospital, supported by the University of Queensland School of Medicine and Faculty of Health Sciences, and Ramsay Health Care. The Gallipoli Research Foundation supports the efforts of researchers to find causes, cures, better management methods and improved medications and treatments of a range of major conditions which affect the health of veterans and the Australian community at large.</para>
<para>By promoting research in the private health sector, we are tapping into a significantly under-utilised resource, stimulating corporate philanthropy and partnership with the community, and enabling the private sector to advance research for the Australian community. I am pleased to record in the parliament that those on the board of this important foundation include three current members of the House and one former member of the House: the member for Moreton, who sits at the table with me, the member for Maranoa, who recently contributed to this debate in a particular manner, the former member for Bowman, Mr Con Sciacca, and myself. It is important and we think appropriate that Simpson’s record be reflected in this organisation. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I think all Australians would like to salute the contribution made by Private John Simpson Kirkpatrick at Gallipoli. It is important to recognise that it was not only Private John Simpson who made the wonderful contribution that he did; there were so many thousands of young Australians who did what they could during Australia’s baptism by fire. It is difficult to determine whether or not any individual should receive the Victoria Cross. No doubt in every sphere of conflict there are people whose bravery is quite outstanding, and ultimately a judgment should be made on which personnel receive recognition in what way. I think most people would agree that Private John Simpson did not seek any recognition. He certainly was not someone who did the wonderful work that he did with a view to being recognised. I would be, personally, quite happy for the case of Private John Simpson to be looked at very closely with a view to considering whether the service that he gave was service which, in the circumstances, would entitle him to the award of a posthumous Victoria Cross. One of the things that the government of the day has to do is make sure that we do have integrity in the honours system. That is why it is important, particularly when looking at military awards, to make sure that people with similar levels of bravery and service are recognised in the same way.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Years ago, well before I was elected to parliament, I backpacked around, as did many other young Australians, the Gallipoli peninsula. I met a person called Tony Malpass, who was with the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, after I had been taken on an impromptu tour of Gallipoli by a Turkish taxi driver. All the Turkish taxi driver could say was: ‘British, Australian, Turks. Boom, boom! Boom, boom!’ But Tony Malpass and his wife took me on the route that was taken by Private John Simpson and his donkey. One could not fail to be incredibly impressed at the selfless level of bravery that was displayed by Private John Simpson. In fact, when I looked at the memorial stones and the ages of the young Australians who served at Gallipoli—and I am pleased that the honourable member for Franklin is here, because I know that his father served at Gallipoli—I realised that Simpson, at 22 years of age, was, relatively speaking, an old man. We find it quite incredible that anyone of that age could be considered an old man. But by comparison with the very youthful ages of many others who lost their lives at Gallipoli he was, in chronological terms, on this planet for much longer.</para>
<para>The 25th of April 1915 is a day that will never lose its significance for Australia. We commemorate it each year. On this day members of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps first landed on the Gallipoli peninsula. One of those was Private John Simpson. His real name was John Simpson Kirkpatrick. He apparently dropped his surname because he had deserted from the merchant navy and he wanted to keep his real identity a secret to avoid his possible arrest under the merchant shipping laws. The service that he created to Australians was way beyond any service he would have provided had he remained in the merchant navy. His name is one of the most recognised in all Australian military history. There are few who have not heard of the story of Simpson and his donkeys. The fact that he was for so long able to save so many Australians made it a cruel irony when he himself subsequently fell victim. Private John Simpson was a man whose memory is part of Australia’s history. He was someone who, in many respects, typified the heroism of so many other Australians. I salute him. This is a very worthwhile debate to be having in the parliament. Private John Simpson will live in our memory forever. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Here we are again debating an issue that should have been resolved 90 years ago. Almost a month ago I returned to Anzac Cove to be part of the 90th celebrations of this nation-building event. Unless you have been to the battlefields associated with the very first Anzac Day, you have no real appreciation of what that eight-month campaign must have been like. To wander across the battle sites, to examine the trenches, to visit the beauty and sorrow that is the cemetery at Shrapnel Gully, to imagine the fighting at Lone Pine and the Nek, is to give you but a fleeting insight into the carnage and courage that was evident there so many years ago.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Like many others in this place I have a forensic interest in the very first Anzac Day and the long eight-month campaign. My interest is personal, for my late father, Private Robert Vernon Quick, served there with the famous seventh battalion. I often asked Dad about Private Simpson and what the other soldiers said about him, what were the reports and anecdotes told about him and what he had heard. Dad never met him at Anzac Cove. John Simpson Kirkpatrick was killed seven days before Dad landed as part of the seventh battalion reinforcements on 26 May. Over the years, reminiscing about those memories, Dad often spoke about the exploits of his comrades at arms. Dad said that many soldiers showed courage and heroism above and beyond the call of duty and were never recognised. At the height of the many battles that raged across this rugged terrain, individuals did what they had to do, regardless of their own safety and livelihood. You did not have time to think; you acted instinctively, as you had been trained to do. You looked out for your mates and they looked out for you; you were in this together.</para>
<para>As other speakers have said, during the first months of this campaign the loss of life was horrendous and organisationally the whole campaign was an absolute disaster. Amid this chaos and constant death ordinary people exhibited extraordinary feats of bravery. Simpson was one of these individuals. Without concern for his own safety he did what he had to do: bring as many of the wounded down from the hills to the relative safety of the beach and the field ambulance tents. Simpson exhibited a trait that exemplified so many other Australians at Anzac Cove and in so many other wars: he used his initiative. He did not wait for orders from on high. A job was there to be done: just do it and place your life in the hands of the Almighty.</para>
<para>Simpson and his donkey would make their way up Shrapnel Gully, the main supply route to the front line, into Monash Valley and on to the deadly zone around Quinn’s Post, where the opposing trenches were just 15 yards apart. Simpson, from day one at the landing, had seen the arbitrariness of the angel of death. He had lost many of his mates before his eyes. What was to be, was to be. Wounded, in their hundreds, were lying unattended in the gullies and trenches and they had to be brought back to safety quickly. It is amazing the impact of one man’s life on this battlefield, just over a 24-day period—and the great impact on the psyche of our great nation. Operating as a one-man unit, he is credited with saving the lives of probably hundreds of men. He has become a part of the Anzac folklore. His grave at Anzac Cove is the first one everyone looks for and stands silently at when they read:</para>

I say bugger the paperwork—let’s reward an iconic figure and give John Simpson Kirkpatrick a posthumous VC.</para>

<para>—I rise today to speak on this motion about John Simpson Kirkpatrick and to reflect on the tremendous sacrifice made by so many Australians during the Gallipoli campaign. John Simpson Kirkpatrick is a man of Australian legend. We see his name in the history books. We see him immortalised on monuments and hear stories of his courage and how he is the embodiment of the Anzac spirit. What we can never forget is that John Simpson’s deeds are not urban legend, and his sacrifice not a sad ending to a story born in fiction. They were the deeds and sacrifices of a real man, a real Australian. John Simpson died alongside thousands of Australians who also gave their lives in the name of this nation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This is a nation whose identity was not created by a constitution or a bill of rights and whose sense of nationhood was not born in the aftermath of a civil war or a fight to free ourselves from a colonial oppressor. This is a nation born in peace, whose identity and culture were forged on a foreign battlefield. I refer to the history of the Anzac and the Anzac spirit. Australians learn of the history of the Anzac and remember the Gallipoli battles as a defining point in our nation’s history. In claiming it as our history, we honour all those soldiers who gave their lives in a way we will never again be able to honour our soldiers—by claiming them as history makers who together created an inspired nation.</para>
<para>As we are all aware, John Simpson was a young man of English descent who enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force and found himself at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915. Using a donkey that had been brought to the battle for water carrying, which Simpson found on his first day at Gallipoli, he transported wounded soldiers from the Monash Valley to a makeshift hospital on the beach at Anzac Cove. John Simpson Kirkpatrick was killed by enemy machine-gun fire, but not before gallantly saving many lives.</para>
<para>It is not good enough to tell the story of John Simpson in history classes or on Anzac Day. We must honour and remember him and all those Australians who fought and died at Gallipoli, and we must always remember the sacrifice they made for their nation. The culture of mateship born out of the Anzac experience is one based on the very premise that Australians go into battle as a group—so many Australians become heroes on those foreign shores and so many Australians take their rightful place in history as the gallant men and women who developed a national culture.</para>
<para>If Australians wish to claim the battles at Anzac Cove as the basis of our national spirit and culture of mateship then the symbol of that culture cannot just be a statue of one man and his donkey. It must be the memory of all Australians who fought and died under our flag to deliver us a free nation. The Australian government recognises the heroic efforts of this brave man as we recognise the heroic efforts of so many Australians on the shores of Gallipoli.</para>

<para>—I rise to speak on a grievance that goes to the heart of a strange mode of behaviour that has marked the entirety of this government’s period in office, and that is a capacity, when confronting a crisis or an issue, to present to the public as the crisis managers par excellence, the people you need to keep in office to see that the job gets effectively done, to get the press releases out and get the initial positioning right—and then forget about it. It does not matter what happens after that point; the politics have been with the government, and the issue is resolved when the politics are resolved. When the government finds out down the track that something has gone seriously wrong, the tactic is: cover up as desperately as you can and point the finger of blame at somebody else.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We know today, after dragging the information out of senior public servants, that for well over three months one of the most senior transport security jobs in this country has been unfilled. Quite simply, there has been no-one doing a job which the government itself describes as essential to—and I quote the Minister for Transport and Regional Services—‘identifying security vulnerabilities’ and dealing with them. For almost 3½ months, one of Australia’s most crucial transport security positions has been empty—vacant, unfilled. There has been no-one home.</para>
<para>It is a story of incompetence and cover-up which began when the transport minister announced, with great fanfare and typical public noise, the establishment of the Office of Transport Security. He spoke about ‘the appointment of an independent Inspector of Transport Security to investigate major transport security incidents’. The announcement was made as part of the government’s so-called enhanced aviation security package. Here is the problem, the crisis—and crisis managers are into it. The office carries a total budget of $93 million, and the component for the Inspector of Transport Security is $1.6 million over four years to the 2004-05 budget.</para>
<para>On the surface, the appointment of an independent security expert is to be supported in the face of the challenges facing Australia and aviation security. It is an appointment that the minister trumpeted as being essential and an integral part of ‘an enhanced security package’. He identified the inspector’s role as investigating major incidents and systematic transport security weaknesses to ‘ensure security vulnerabilities are identified and addressed’. But now we see yet again this government making an announcement and then forgetting about it. In this case, the government made the announcement on 4 December 2003 and then did not appoint an inspector until almost a year later, on 23 November 2004. This is a government that is, ostensibly, taking seriously the protection of Australian airports and travellers in a period of high threat and vulnerability.</para>
<para>It took the Howard government almost a year to appoint an Inspector of Transport Security, but even when Minister Anderson finally got around to making the appointment he did not bother announcing who it was. It is only now that we learn that it was former Australian Federal Police Commissioner Mick Palmer. But his appointment was not publicly announced and, it appears, no media reference was ever made to Mr Palmer’s dual role as Inspector of Transport Security and, now, head of an immigration detention inquiry. Mr Palmer was an appropriate and well-qualified appointment as Inspector of Transport Security, but it was an appointment that was destined to be very short-lived. He was barely three months into the job when he was obliged to stand down, hijacked by Immigration Minister Vanstone into trying to fix yet another of the Howard government’s gaping political holes, the wrongful detention of Australian resident Cornelia Rau.</para>
<para>So, since February, Australia has been without an Inspector of Transport Security—without the independent expert which the government deemed essential to monitoring the handling of systematic transport weaknesses, including apparent flaws in airline baggage-handling systems. While we have been without an Inspector of Transport Security, there have been some glaring and disturbing breaches and allegations relating to aviation security. Just ask yourselves this question: since he is the bloke to inspect these systemic issues, would these things have interested him? Would he have been interested in the alleged involvement of Sydney airport baggage handlers in an international drug-trafficking syndicate? The Australian Federal Police claims baggage handlers were key players in a conspiracy to smuggle cocaine worth $15 million into Australia. Do you think he might have had thought about that? There are allegations out there that luggage belonging to Schapelle Corby, who is on trial in Indonesia, was tampered with. Do you think we can give any guarantees it was not? Do you think that an inspector of security might have been able to? Do you think that the so-called camel suit incident, where baggage handlers opened a passenger’s luggage, removed his belongings and paraded around the airport, might have been a matter that would have caused the Inspector of Transport Security an occasional palpitation?</para>
<para>In the wake of the camel suit incident was the admission by Qantas CEO, Geoff Dixon, that the airline receives 35 complaints a month about alleged baggage tampering. Do you think that might have interested an Inspector of Transport Security? Then there was the warning just over a week ago from the Transport Workers Union that the federal government had been aware of potential security breaches at Australian airports for at least four years, and the union reaffirmed its call for improving the credentialling of short-term employees and for the immediate X-ray screening of all baggage and freight. We are not actually going to get the screening of domestic baggage at our airports until 2007.</para>
<para>This government is the slowest-moving government on earth to confront the contemporary international circumstances in which we live. It is just extraordinary. You would have thought that there would have been a bit of interest in making absolutely certain that, the government having set up a protective system, the Australian people were being properly protected while all this was being put in place.</para>
<para>Add to this the alarming admission from Chris Brown, the head of peak tourism lobby group TTF, that, because of concerns about baggage handling, he would not check in his bags when travelling to Bali, adding, ‘I will be taking only carry-on baggage.’ There is no denying the link between baggage-handling systems at Australia’s airports and aviation security; flaws in baggage handling, including removing and planting material in luggage, increase the risk of the travelling public.</para>
<para>John Anderson has failed in his responsibility to maintain secure baggage-handling systems at Australian airports. He has failed to tell the Australian public that a position which he created and described as integral to his enhanced aviation security package has been left vacant for more than three months. There was no announcement that Mr Palmer had stood down in order to clean up the Cornelia Rau debacle, no announcement that Mr Palmer was no longer the Inspector of Transport Security and certainly no announcement of a replacement. In here today, it does not matter; it just rocks on.</para>
<para>Instead, Mr Anderson has been caught out by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, which invited Mr Palmer to appear before it at hearings today. At first, the Department of Transport and Regional Services offered the excuse that Mr Palmer was too busy to attend, and it only came clean last Thursday, four days ago, when it admitted that Mr Palmer had stood down as inspector while undertaking other duties for the government. So the Inspector of Aviation Security has been stood down since February and absolutely no information has been given to the public about that.</para>
<para>Perhaps the public would have liked to think a little about the important role that Mick Palmer was performing when he was plucked out to give the government political cover on the Cornelia Rau incident. The public needs to hear that he is being removed from a job that he would do extremely well, albeit having been appointed to it belatedly—12 months after the position was created. The public might have said, ‘Leave Mick Palmer where he is, doing the job he ought to be doing: protecting us when we travel. Don’t use him politically by dragging him down on top of yourselves to defend you and your reputations, when you have been caught out and ought to be putting in place a proper royal commission, probably with an ex-judge to run it.’ An ex-judge should be inquiring into the matter of Cornelia Rau. Mick Palmer ought to be handling aviation security; that is what he ought to be doing right now.</para>
<para>We confront substantial terrorist threats to this nation, both domestically and internationally. We require all inspection processes to be in place and operating all the time. This is not a matter of politics; this is a matter of defending the national interest. The government has undermined the national interest, the security of this population, to defend itself in politics. It has appointed a respectable person to do its work on the Cornelia Rau issue, when he ought to be protecting all of us at our airports. The government ought to be shamed, and this is a genuine grievance. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—On 7 May General Michel Aoun returned to Lebanon after spending 15 years in exile, from 1990 to 2005. An extraordinary series of events led to the arrival at the airport in Beirut of General Aoun, a former Prime Minister of Lebanon and a former chief of staff of the Lebanese security forces—a series of events that is noteworthy for this House this afternoon.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The passing of resolution 1559, which I will return to later in more detail, by the United Nations Security Council in September 2004 established the beginning of a chain of events that led to the end of a 29-year occupation of Lebanon by Syria. It led to the end of the establishment of puppet regimes by the Syrian government in Lebanon from 1990 to 2005, in direct contravention of international law and resolutions of the United Nations Security Council and in direct defiance of the entreaties of the Western world, entreaties that were led in particular by the United States, France, Australia and Great Britain, amongst other countries. Resolution 1559 also set in train acts of parliament passed by the United States Congress and motions passed by the House of Commons in Great Britain calling on Syria to fulfil its obligation to the international community, as required by its membership of the United Nations, by following the strictures of resolution 1559.</para>
<para>On 14 February, the former Prime Minister of Lebanon, Rafik Hariri, was killed in Beirut in a bloodthirsty and callous assassination. Rafik Hariri was a great man of Lebanese politics who had tried in his own way, even under the occupation of Syria, to establish a slightly more independent regime for the good of the Lebanese people. He had attempted to make a Lebanon for the Lebanese rather than a Lebanon as a plaything for Syria and other Middle Eastern politicians and terrorist organisations. I am pleased that the member for Melbourne Ports is in the House this afternoon because I am sure he will agree with much of what I am going to say about Lebanon today, and I know that the minister at the dispatch box will too.</para>
<para>The assassination of Rafik Hariri on 14 February was followed by a gigantic series of rallies across Lebanon, particularly in Beirut, led by young people, students and ordinary Lebanese family members who wanted to bring about liberty, freedom and democracy—real democracy—in their homeland. It led eventually to the withdrawal by Syria of its military apparatus on 26 April, which we hope will lead to free and fair elections on 29 May, only a few weeks away, over a rolling period of Saturdays, as is the constitutional set-up in Lebanon.</para>
<para>The return of General Aoun on 7 May ended a very unhappy 30-year chapter in the history of Lebanon: from 1975 to 1990, a civil war between the various groups that make up the extraordinarily multicultural and ancient history of Lebanon; and, from 1990 to 2005, the exile of Michel Aoun and many of his supporters and others who escaped from Lebanon rather than exist under the total domination of Syria. As members of this House will know, in 1976 Syria invaded Lebanon under the pretext of defending and supporting its interests in Lebanon and stopping the civil war. The civil war continued until 1990, when Syria put aside all pretext of protecting the Lebanese people and took total control of Lebanon, ousting the government of Michel Aoun and the Lebanese people.</para>
<para>In those 29 years of Syrian domination, many communities in Lebanon—Christian, Druze and patriotic Muslims who want Lebanon for the Lebanese—kept the fire of freedom alive. The diaspora played an important role in the period from 1990 to 2005 and included people who over many decades left Lebanon voluntarily. As most people in this House would know, many Lebanese have been coming to Australia since the 19th century and before the Second World War. But many more came in the period from 1975 to 2005, leaving a bright, exciting, affluent economic powerhouse in Lebanon that had been destroyed by civil war. They went to Australia, New Zealand, Great Britain and, in particular, the United States. Michel Aoun, with many of his followers, went to France. From exile, they kept the flame of democracy and liberty alive for the Lebanese people. The role they played in bringing about resolution 1559 and in applying pressure on the United States Congress to pass the Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act in 2003 is a matter of historical record. The support that they provided for their own compatriots still in Lebanon fighting for freedom, whether they were Christians, Druze or patriotic Muslims, is also a matter of record. I know from those in my own electorate and other communities from Lebanon now in Australia that a great deal of support was provided over that period to ensure that the people in Lebanon knew that they were not alone. We can be proud of the role that Australia played in that, through housing and supporting Lebanese expatriates. I am certainly proud of it.</para>
<para>Resolution 1559 was passed in September 2004, and it would probably be useful to read five of the sections of the resolution. In the resolution, the Security Council:</para>
<quote>
<list type="decimal-dotted">
<item label="1.">
<para>Reaffirms its call for the strict respect of the sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity, and political independence of Lebanon under the sole and exclusive authority of the Government of Lebanon throughout Lebanon;</para>
</item>
<item label="2.">
<para>Calls upon all remaining foreign forces to withdraw from Lebanon;</para>
</item>
<item label="3.">
<para>Calls for the disbanding and disarmament of all Lebanese and non-Lebanese militias;</para>
</item>

<para>Supports the extension of the control of the Government of Lebanon over all Lebanese territory;</para>
</item>
<item label="5.">
<para>Declares its support for a free and fair electoral process in Lebanon’s upcoming presidential election conducted according to Lebanese constitutional rules devised without foreign interference or influence ...</para>
</item>
</list>
</quote>
<para class="block">Many of these calls by the Security Council have been fulfilled. Syria has removed its military apparatus from Lebanon. But my supporters from the Lebanese community in my electorate want to make sure, and I think all the Lebanese people want to know, that the entire Syrian apparatus in Lebanon is removed from Lebanon—not just the military apparatus but those people they secreted into the Lebanese intelligence services, those people they trained as part of the Lebanese military and security forces for the future, those people they established as the leadership of the clergy in Lebanon and those people they established in political parties in Lebanon as puppets of the Syrian regime. What the Lebanese people I know want to make sure of, and what the Lebanese people around the world want to make sure of, is that there is a true removal of Syrian influence from Lebanon and that Lebanon will be left to the Lebanese people to govern in the way that it was for many years before the grotesque invasion of that country by Syria in 1976.</para>
<para>Syrian forces have been withdrawn but non-Lebanese militias have not been disarmed. We call for Hezbollah and the Palestinian militias to be disbanded and to play no military role in Lebanon. Certainly they may well play a political role in Lebanon, but we deplore armed militias operating as thugs in any democratic country and we want to make sure that the Lebanese people can conduct free and fair democratic elections without the spectre of violence hanging over their heads in the form of militias.</para>
<para>It is also true to say that the war in Iraq has played a fundamental role in the freedom of the Lebanese people. The support that Australia has given to Israel over the last 50 to 60 years and the support that the Australian people and the government gave to freeing the Iraqi people from Saddam Hussein have lit the fire of democracy in the Middle East and given great impetus and inspiration to the Lebanese people, who rose up through a series of demonstrations to demand freedom, liberty and democracy. I salute the return of Aoun to Lebanon, and I salute the chance for freedom and democracy in Lebanon for the Lebanese people. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I rise today to discuss the Tasmanian Community Forest Agreement announced by the federal and Tasmanian governments on Friday, 13 May 2005. This agreement is a vindication of the strong and active stance that federal Labor has taken on Tasmanian forests, both before and after the last election. The principles behind Labor’s approach are clear. They were advanced in the federal election campaign by Mark Latham and in the principles subsequently adopted unanimously by the ALP caucus meeting on 19 November 2004. They include—and I quote:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>A sustainable forestry industry plan, developed in consultation with unions, industry and the Tasmanian Government and based on the use of plantation timber, selective use of native timber, value-adding, and downstream processing;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>No overall loss of jobs in the forestry industry; and</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>Further protection of identified Tasmanian high-conservation-value old-growth forests, rainforests, and other ecosystems.</para>
</item>
</list>
</quote>
<para class="block">Rather than a high-volume, low-value industry, the best economic outcome, the best employment outcome and the best environmental outcome is a low-volume, high-value industry. Woodchips were always meant to be a by-product of the industry, not a driver of it. This agreement will see more protection for old-growth forests than currently exists. Affected sawmills will be engaged in industry restructuring to move them to alternative wood supply sources, allowing them to introduce better technology. This is the key to better paid, more highly skilled jobs and accords with Labor’s advocacy emphasising value adding in forest industries.</para>
<para>The vindication of federal Labor’s position is exemplified by the fact that the regional forest agreement could be renegotiated and varied. Value adding is the key to improved environmental, employment and economic outcomes. The alleged impediments to some of the changes advocated by federal Labor were obviously not impediments at all. In reality, this is not surprising. History is headed one way on these conservation issues.</para>
<para>The Gallop government took a principled stance to end the logging of old-growth forests. Its re-election confirms the merits of this approach, as do the actions of state Labor governments around the nation. The Beattie government legislated to end broad-scale clearing of remnant vegetation forever, and in December it announced a comprehensive plan to protect more than one million hectares of western hardwood native forests. The Bracks government has announced increased protection for the Otways in Victoria, and just three weeks ago the Carr government reserved 348,000 hectares of woodland in the Brigalow and Nandewar region of New South Wales. This includes protection of the very best of the western woodland forests, including the Pilliga, the Goonoo, the Bebo and Terry Hie Hie. This decision was accompanied by an $80 million job creation and industry development package which will create more jobs than those which will be lost. This did not attract great attention. It is just what modern Labor governments do: they establish significant conservation measures whilst always ensuring that communities are looked after.</para>
<para>Labor has always maintained the need to maintain jobs across the industry as part of any policy to save old-growth forests. The additional funding from the federal government for this agreement is an acknowledgement that the Prime Minister’s original funding commitment fell well short of the mark. The federal government has increased its commitment from $52 million to $157 million, which, when combined with $90 million from the Lennon government, makes up the $250 million package.</para>
<para>Labor promised $800 million to ensure that communities were looked after and employment maintained. The Howard government has now recognised its original funding was hopelessly inadequate. Whilst the level of funding is higher than election commitments, a detailed analysis of the agreement shows that many of John Howard’s election commitments have not been met. Whilst this has been largely ignored, as Aldous Huxley once said, ‘Facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored.’</para>
<para>The Howard government’s failure to deliver on what were modest commitments is a sad reflection on how fair dinkum they are when it comes to conservation. The $2.2 million advertising campaign, including full page ads in newspapers in capital cities, is just the latest example of the Howard government’s preparedness to promote spin over substance. The Howard government promised to protect 18,700 hectares in the Styx and the Florentine along the eastern boundary World Heritage area, but they have actually delivered 4,200 hectares of forest in the Styx, a new 336-hectare tall trees reserve in the Styx and a 113-hectare formal reserve near Waterfall Creek Road. This is 13,970 hectares short of what was promised.</para>
<para>The Howard government promised to protect 29,600 hectares of old-growth forest in the Eastern Tiers, the Tasman Peninsula, the north-east highlands and the central highlands; they have actually delivered 22,800 hectares. This is 7,200 hectares short of what was promised. The Howard government promised to end the use of 1080 poison on public and private land by no later than December this year. This agreement delivers this on public land, but permits ongoing use on private land beyond 2005, although there is a new commitment to research alternatives.</para>
<para>Other concerns have been expressed that none of the areas are to be included in a national park or recommended for World Heritage protection—not a single hectare. Whilst clear-felling of old-growth forests has been acknowledged as an inappropriate practice and will be phased down, concern has been expressed by some about forestry practices, including clump clear-felling. Worker safety must be ensured in all forest practices.</para>
<para>Particularly welcome is protection for the Tarkine and parts of the Styx. These are two areas I visited in November and January. I visited the Styx with Graham Green, a timber artisan, and Richard Davis, a master builder of wooden boats. These proud Tasmanians exhibited a passionate love for their natural environment. They did not want it locked up—the forest is the source of their livelihood. Like Kevin Perkins, who built the magnificent furniture in the Prime Minister’s office and the new panelling and pews in the rebuilt St Patrick’s Cathedral in Parramatta, they just argued for sustainable use.</para>
<para>A short walk into the tall trees of the Styx—with 80-metre tall <inline font-style="italic">Eucalyptus regnans,</inline> the tallest hardwood trees on earth; celery tops, which need to grow for 250 years before they are of use for one of Richard’s boats; and the spongy forest floor, in which the nutrients of thousands of years are stored—is an experience never to be forgotten. Having seen it for myself, I reiterated Labor’s commitment that they be protected. This was controversial to some. Today, though, it appears you cannot find anyone who thinks they should be logged.</para>
<para>The coupe which I visited was scheduled for logging but will now be saved. Just down the road I saw the devastation caused by clear-felling and burning. I have argued that clear-felling of old growth forests is environmental vandalism. Today, no-one—not a single person—is arguing that clear-felling is a preferred practice.</para>
<para>I do hope this agreement is the beginning of the end of conflict over Tasmanian forests. Given that the conservation movement has uniformly criticised the agreement as inadequate, it clearly will not end debate, but it is in my view a step in the right direction. Tasmania’s extraordinary natural environment must be promoted to the world and not be a source of discomfort. The agreement has recognised the commonsense solution of saving forests through value adding, but it has not yet taken these principles to their logical conclusion.</para>
<para>The Prime Minister has said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... everybody would like to see old growth logging stopped, but that should not occur at the expense of the jobs of timber-workers.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I agree, but I wish the Prime Minister had been true to his word. This agreement shows reform can be achieved. It is perfectly understandable that workers, families and communities are concerned about their economic security. What is not legitimate is those people in positions of leadership being prepared to exploit peoples’ vulnerability to gain a political advantage, as the Howard government did during the last election campaign. The Howard government’s natural instinct is to promote fear and division, whether of asylum seekers, interest rates or job security. Fear is the foundation stone of the house that Howard built.</para>
<para>Here is what I believe. We in Labor have been right in our determination to save Tasmania’s high-conservation old-growth forests. Labor has been right in allocating substantial funds for employment creation and value adding to make sure communities are looked after and jobs are maintained, and Labor is right to argue for sustainable forestry practices. These issues have been controversial. Had Labor, both before the election and after, not shown the courage of its convictions, the Prime Minister would still be sitting on his hands, doing nothing. That has led to more protection for old-growth forests than currently exists, particularly in the Tarkine. They will be there for future generations to enjoy, long after today’s politicians have left this world.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I rise today to grieve about a couple of issues that are of particular concern to the citizens and the community of Dunkley. To the credit of the Howard government, it has collectively tried to address one of the more compelling issues of our time—the consequences of and possible remedies to family breakdown. This is a particularly devastating experience that far too many Australians have to endure. At the very time when individual citizens need to be at their very best—when they need to be able to find reason, fairness, balance and mutual adjustment to make sure that children involved in relationship breakdowns are cared for and are getting the best that each parent has to offer—the hardship, the grief and the trauma of family breakdown often means that those faculties are not forthcoming. The time when relationships fail is a difficult time, it is an emotionally straining time and it is a time of great disappointment and regret for people. It is also a time that can give rise to acrimony, hardship, even score-settling, when really the task is how to do the very best for the little people who are part of that relationship—the children.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In that light, you can understand how heartened and enthusiastic I was that, in its response to the review of the family law system and in relation to canvassing ideas like rebuttable presumptions of shared custody, shared care and the like, the government came forward with quite a visionary package. That package looks not only at how to strengthen relationships—make them more robust—but also at providing the help and the support that is needed at a time when all that we hope for may not be what we have, a time when relationships are failing and there are difficult decisions that need to be made.</para>
<para>An opportunity is before us, Mr Deputy Speaker. You would have seen media reports that work is progressing around the Child Support Agency formula but, although that is obviously part of the picture, let us put it to one side, for financial contributions are not the only contributions I hope parents make to the raising of kids. There are other parental contributions. There is nurturing, there is care, there is guidance, there is love, there is patience and there is the chance to help young people find a way in an increasingly complex world. That is what I am talking about today, and it all relates to the family relationships centre measures that the Howard government has announced—not only the immediate injection of an extra $15 million last financial year, when the government was canvassing these issues, but the $397.2 million over four years that is part of the budget that was recently announced.</para>
<para>This initiative is part of the Australian government’s family law reform package. It is the announcement of the biggest ever investment in the family law system, which ensures that Australian families right across this vast continent—not only in the cities but in the outer metropolitan, rural and regional areas—have better access to services that aim to help reduce not only the conflict that may give rise to family breakdown but also the conflict that inevitably follows family breakdown—and the consequences for children.</para>
<para>The government recognises the specific challenges faced by families, particularly those outside the inner hub of our major cities. The challenges in my outer metropolitan area are considerable, and I imagine they would be more again in the electorates that you represent, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, in rural and regional Australia. Those issues relating to distance from capital centres should not disadvantage families when it comes to being able to access services and get the assistance to make sure that children’s best interests are carried forward.</para>
<para>The $397.2 million package unveiled in the budget includes a very generous allocation to support the government’s new approach to the family law system—in particular to see that the innovative family relationship centres are established, expanded and available to all sections of our communities, including Indigenous communities. This is an important outreach measure that gives families a chance to access information, advice, mediation, support and wise counsel—where that is appropriate—and provides an environment where face-to-face information can be exchanged and referrals can be made to other specialist agencies. Advice and dispute resolution services will be available, in some cases for the first time. As part of that package a network of 65 family relationship centres is to be established across Australia. I say quite unashamedly that one of those must be in my community in Dunkley.</para>
<para>Frankston City is the bayside capital city of greater Melbourne, if I can put it that way. We service a catchment of several hundreds of thousands of people. It is also an area where some family tensions play out—as they relate to newer families making a start in life, working hard pursuing their aspirations to have fine homes and fine lifestyles in what is the best part of Victoria, down on the Mornington Peninsula. The distance from places of work can be great. I know when I was working in East Melbourne in that remarkable Kennett government era, when Victoria was genuinely on the move, the only downside of being able to do virtuous things for the air I sucked in was having to sit in a car for about four hours a day commuting to and from the workplace. That is one example. If you are caught in peak-hour traffic, that adds to family pressures. When they return home, perhaps fatigued by their challenges, working parents then need to be at their best in their relationships and the raising of their kids. These outer metropolitan areas are often the front line when it comes to the kinds of challenges these family relationship centres aim to support.</para>
<para>The national telephone advice line and web site should help nearly three-quarters of a million people over the next four years. That is an important resource to provide help and assistance. The new children’s contact service centres are a great idea. We are fortunate in Frankston to have one run by GordonCare, and the only time lawyers come and talk to me about their work is to say that they feel the waiting time to get into those centres is too long. Those centres are a crucial new tool for families at a very difficult, in some cases hostile, point in the breakdown of their relationships. In the interests of the children, the contact centres play an important part for parents accessing children in, in some cases, a supervised environment or, when people who once loved each other now detest each other, where the handover for appropriate periods of care needs to be done in a safe place. They give a new resource, a new way forward for legal practitioners working in this difficult area.</para>
<para>Probably the last thing we need, though, is more law. I have often said in this place that no black-letter law will change what is not in people’s hearts. We need to find a way of encouraging people to be more mutually accommodating, as difficult as that task may be. That is why I have been such an advocate of these centres.</para>
<para>I am keen to secure funding for a one-stop, integrated family relationship mediation centre located in Frankston and providing services right across the peninsula, ensuring that clients are aware of their lawful entitlements. If we are not able to improve the situation, recourse to legal remedies is still the default outcome. We cannot get away from that, but surely we could have a centre that seeks to get a better outcome than one that is toiled over by lawyers at billable hours on different sides of the courtroom. Surely there are better options, and that is what these centres aim to pursue.</para>
<para>In partnership with Peninsula Health, the Peninsula Community Legal Centre—an important contributor, given my earlier point about people needing to know about legal recourse, even as we hope they make better choices—Southern Family Life, GordonCare and the municipal councils down my way, we have been working to put together a centre that brings together community education support services that are already funded in bits here and there by state, federal and local authorities. There is already the Family Relationships Services Program, which can look at prefiling services, dispute resolution, contact orders programs, parenting plans, relationships between men and women, family violence services, case management and extended family involvement, including that of grandparents, who so often are not thought to be front and centre in the important role of raising children.</para>
<para>I commend this model to the House. I certainly have commended it and will continue to commend it to the Attorney-General as an exceptionally well-developed idea. It is supported by Jo Cavanagh, who is very involved with Relationships Australia and is president of Family Services Australia. She is also very much the driving force behind Southern Family Life. The agencies in our electorate have a shared purpose: we can do a better job of this and make sure that family breakdown does not mean missed opportunities and greater hardship than the dissolution of the relationship itself already represents. This model is one that is ready to go. It needs to be properly resourced, and in my view it holds out the best prospect for making gains in this very difficult area of policy. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I want to thank the member for Dunkley for raising the very important issues that he has. He has gone through a lot of the services that are in his electorate, and I know that he takes a great interest in these issues. It is a shame, however, that the government he is part of has really dropped the ball when it comes to domestic violence, which is one of the issues that he mentioned. The Partnerships Against Domestic Violence program, which initially got $50 million in funding, has been cut back to a $16 million program, and I fear that many of the excellent prototype projects that were set up under Partnerships Against Domestic Violence will not have their funding continued. For a social ill that costs Australia a great deal in terms of heartache and broken bones and also $8 billion a year in financial terms, it is a shame that the member for Dunkley has not been able to convince his colleagues about the importance of some of the issues that he has mentioned.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The issue I want to raise in the grievance debate today is the Prime Minister’s failure to address the barbecue-stopper issue of work and family balance. It was an issue that the Prime Minister identified prior to the last election as one of those that Australians were talking about all over the country. He called it a barbecue-stopper, and that term has really stuck because it is so evocative of the fact that so many Australians are really struggling to balance their caring responsibilities with their increasing workloads. We are some of the longest-working people in the OECD. We work more unpaid overtime and longer hours than people in most other countries in the OECD, and that is really showing when it comes to people balancing their caring responsibilities with that increased workload.</para>
<para>It is unfortunate that this budget—which, through child care, could have done so much to address one of the major problems in balancing work and family responsibilities—has been so disappointing when it comes to new funding for child care. There are around 84,000 extra places for out of school hours care, and Labor, of course, welcomes those extra places. The bad news, unfortunately, is that we estimate—and Treasury suggest—that there are 35,000 children already on waiting lists for out of school hours care. With the increased number of single parents and disability support pensioners being encouraged to find work with the government’s welfare to work changes, those extra 84,000 places will be eaten up very quickly.</para>
<para>Identifying the need more broadly for child care in this country is very difficult to do, because the last child-care census figures that were released suggested that there were 174,500 kids that needed extra care in Australia. That figure is occasionally contradicted by the Minister for Family and Community Services, who says the figures are old; they are 2002 figures. That is true, and the shame in all of this is that there was a child-care census conducted last year, in 2004, but when Labor asked about the child-care census in the last lot of budget estimates we were told that the data was being ‘cleaned’ and the census would be released imminently. We are now at the next lot of estimates and we still have not seen the census. It must have been very dirty data indeed if it is still being cleaned! Strangely, the next census will be in 2006. We are only six months away from the time of the next census and we still have not seen the 2004 figures.</para>
<para>There is a shocking lack of extra child-care funding in this budget. It is also interesting to note that one of the less frequently told stories about the budget when it comes to child care is that the JET program, which has been one of the most effective programs for moving single parents from welfare to work—a program initiated by Labor when we were last in government and continued by the current administration—has been contracted so that parents who are undertaking training courses that go for more than a year will not be eligible for it anymore. So all those single parents who would like to be training in an area of skill shortage—in hairdressing, child care, refrigeration mechanics or any of the traditional trades where we are facing such looming shortages any day now—will no longer be eligible for JET funding. That really beggars belief, considering all the rhetoric about moving people from welfare to work and, incidentally, all the rhetoric about the skills shortage we are facing.</para>
<para>While on child care, I also want to draw the House’s attention to the upcoming release of the broadband overhaul of child-care funding that the minister has been planning for some time. We know that there will be a number of very badly affected centres. One of those is represented by the member for Ballarat, Catherine King, who is in the chamber now. She has presented a petition of 700 names asking that the Daylesford Community Child Care Centre not lose its funding. It is looking at losing funding of $87,000 a year because of Minister Patterson’s review of how child-care funding is distributed. The Daylesford centre is an excellent multifunction centre providing a number of different services in the one child-care centre. The petition received by the member for Ballarat came from residents, friends and community members who support the Daylesford centre. The irony is that the Daylesford centre might close—and the member for Ballarat will say more on this—while it is helping single parents stay in the work force. Government changes to the funding model will lead to increased costs for parents and may well mean that this centre will close or at least that many of the parents that currently use it will no longer be able to. Instead of being able to work, in fact they will be pulling out of the work force.</para>
<para>The government has spoken many times about its vision for the new industrial relations regime under which this country should be run. The notion that anything in the government’s plans in the arena of industrial relations will actually make it easier for families to balance their work and caring responsibilities is just laughable. We see that the government has opposed the suggestions of the Australian Council of Trade Unions in the work and family test case before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. There were things in the ACTU’s suggestions that the employers but not the government agreed with. The government is more hardline than employer groups when it comes to work and family balance. That is very disappointing for parents. As well there is unfair dismissal. How fair is it that a parent who had been working in a small business and was unfairly dismissed could no longer support their family? How does this level of insecurity make it easier for parents to balance their work and caring responsibilities?</para>
<para>We had a question today from the shadow minister for industrial relations about the collapsing of classifications in awards so that some workers might lose $100 or $150 a week from their pay packets. We know that the government has opposed all of the national minimum wage cases. If the government had had its way, workers on minimum wages would be $44 a week worse off than they are currently. In every instance when this government has had the opportunity to make it easier for families to balance their work and caring responsibilities it has not just shirked the opportunity but has in fact acted against the interests of families by making it more difficult for them to balance their work and caring responsibilities.</para>

<para>—Sadly, I find it necessary to speak today on the subject of the complete disregard that the Queensland government shows to the transportation needs of the residents of my electorate of Petrie, particularly those on the long-neglected Redcliffe Peninsula. It is interesting to note that 38 per cent of the residential work force in this area travel to Brisbane daily, to their places of employment. Yet when it comes to issues like bridges and rail links, the Queensland government is more than happy to sacrifice those workers’ needs on the altar of political favouritism. It is unbelievable that the proposed duplication of the most vital road link in my electorate, the Houghton Highway bridge, will now not be completed until Christmas 2009, more than a year after the closing ceremony of the Beijing Olympic Games. This is despite the fact that in the current financial year alone Queensland is to receive $590 million in GST revenue additional to the amount that was forecast when the deal between the states and the federal government was originally struck. I emphasise: Queensland will receive in excess of half a billion dollars.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This is the same Houghton Highway bridge that one of my constituents, John Cook of the suburb of Kippa-Ring, correctly described in a letter to the editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Redcliffe and Bayside Herald</inline> in November last year as ‘a death trap with little room for error’. This is not an isolated view. It is one which I know to be shared by the many tens of thousands of drivers who negotiate it on a daily basis and wait with bated breath for the problem to be finally eliminated. Yet the Queensland government would have my constituents believe that it cannot be fixed until Christmas 2009. Presumably, we will all have to stand by the side of the road and wish the Premier ‘Happy Christmas’ as he floats by in the opening procession. All this is against a background of a state government absolutely awash in GST cash. I would also point out that this is in stark contrast to the federal government’s ongoing commitment to better transport by providing $196 million over the next few years to widen the Bruce Highway to six lanes from the Gateway Motorway to Caboolture.</para>
<para>Surely in the interests of road safety, the duplication of the Houghton Highway bridge can be accelerated and moved forward some years so that those poor, long-suffering residents in my electorate can have a decent connection to the Greater Brisbane area. The Queensland government’s plan is to spend about $149 million on this bridge duplication, or about 25 per cent of the additional GST revenue that will literally fall into their laps in this financial year alone. As my colleague the honourable Treasurer said on Brisbane radio earlier this month, the hardest thing that the Queensland Treasurer has to do with the monthly GST bonanza is decide which bank to put it in. At the current rate of GST collection, it could be argued that the total bridge duplication cost will represent a mere five per cent of the unexpected GST windfall by the end of 2009. I am well aware that once plans have been put in place there is some degree of difficulty in change, but in the interests of commonsense I simply implore the Beattie Queensland government to revisit this issue and substantially move forward the funding and construction of the Houghton Highway bridge duplication now that these extra GST funds are available.</para>
<para>I again implore the Queensland government to honour its innumerable pre-election promises to get started on the Brisbane to Redcliffe rail link. This rail link was originally proposed in the century before last and it is high time that it was completed. In fact, it is way past ‘high time’. I am aware that the Beattie Labor government in Queensland continues to say it owns the land corridor necessary for building such a link, but to then say that it needs private investment to make the project a reality is a real slap in the face for the commuters in my electorate, who already face the disadvantage of a road network whose inadequacies I have previously spoken of.</para>
<para>It was interesting to read an article from June 2004 by Dr John Nightingale of the Brisbane Institute in which he argued strongly for the Brisbane to Redcliffe link, comparing it to the recent expansion of the rail line from Beenleigh to the Gold Coast. All the so-called experts said that the Gold Coast line extension would not be profitable but, in Dr. Nightingale’s words, ‘It has proved itself a spectacular success.’</para>
<para>If the Labor government in Queensland are so cashed up from the GST windfall, it seems incomprehensible to me and to the people in my electorate that the Beattie government continue to argue for a seemingly perpetual delay in this much-needed work. It is interesting to hear their federal counterparts argue for substantial increases in so-called infrastructure funding when the hands-on problem is squarely at the feet of the Labor state government. So why can’t they do something about it now, and why is it too hard? How ridiculous it is that the plans for the Brisbane-Redcliffe rail link were first put forward when Breaker Morant was overseas fighting in the Boer War and we are still talking about it in 2005.</para>
<para>According to the Queensland government, they will continue to review it. Thank heaven the Wright brothers did not live at Redcliffe; we would still be waiting for the parts of their ‘flying machine’ to arrive by rail. I am aware that many residents on the Redcliffe Peninsula simply raise their eyes to heaven and laugh every time this issue is raised. However, they laugh, not through lack of interest in the subject but through frustration with the succession of state governments that have let them down so badly on this issue—it has become a political joke. The land for the rail corridor is already there and the demand is already there. The people in my electorate want a state government that is really there for them, a state government that will share with the Commonwealth government the workload of providing a decent, multilayered transport system.</para>
<para>It beggars belief that a rail link in one of the highest growth areas in the state is not of prime concern to the state government in providing proper transport for the residents, to make it possible for them to commute with ease between major centres. I have heard transport experts and environmentalists from many places put forward well-reasoned arguments for the expansion of the rail networks. Yet the Queensland government will not deliver on what they have promised at every election since Federation. It is no wonder that people occasionally view the decisions made in these places with a degree of scepticism.</para>
<para>With the interests of my constituents in mind, I urge Queensland Premier, Peter Beattie, to make life better for the tens of thousands of commuters who live on the Redcliffe Peninsula and in the surrounding high-growth suburbs I represent. Now that the Queensland government has all this unexpected GST money—more than half-a-billion dollars extra—I ask them to bring forward the implementation of the duplicate Houghton Highway bridge and start getting serious about the big-picture transportation issues in the electorate of Petrie.</para>

<para>—I rise to speak about the urgent need for governments to stand up and show leadership on two issues that are affecting many in my electorate, as well as Victorians more generally. These issues are above party political lines and reach across state and federal boundaries. The first of my grievances relates to conditions for veterans who are inpatients at the veterans psychiatric unit at wards 17 and 18 of the Austin Hospital. I have been contacted by a number of veterans in my electorate who are extremely distressed about the conditions their mates were in and are still being placed in in wards 17 and 18. These are all DVA entitled veterans who, as they get older, are finding that mental health issues are a challenge for them. At no point have these veterans complained about the level of care from the nursing or medical staff in these facilities. In fact, you hear only words of praise about the staff in wards 17 and 18. However, the physical condition of the wards is a matter for considerable concern.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Although I have not yet visited the facilities—something I am planning to do in the near future—I have seen pictures and spoken to a number of my local veterans who have been inpatients. It is clear that the physical structure of ward 17 is simply not good enough for our veterans. It is an old and rundown facility. I have some photos of it. The outdoor smoking area has a makeshift cover to try and keep out the cold. There is old furniture and there is little landscaping around the facility. There is cracked glass, rotting timber and holes in the asbestos plasterboard.</para>
<para>Complaints are also being made about the meals. In one letter I received about the meals at ward 17, a veteran made the comment, ‘You don’t need a knife and fork, just a piece of garden hose to suck it up off the plate.’ I think all members of this place would agree that it is not acceptable for veterans to be cared for in such poor conditions. These veterans are often severely depressed, and their surroundings are doing little to aid their recovery. It is acknowledged by Austin Health and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs that the physical structure is poor. I understand—though I have not had it confirmed—that the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs was due to visit the facility last week. I look forward to her action on this issue.</para>
<para>There have been some changes. I am pleased that a new food service is to be introduced shortly and, whilst there are plans to redevelop the veterans psychiatric unit, it still has not even progressed to the more advanced planning stages because it has been caught up in the wider redevelopment of the Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital. Veterans first raised this issue over 12 months ago. Whilst progress has been made, something needs to be done to address the immediate concerns of veterans today as well as longer-term planning for a new veterans psychiatric unit.</para>
<para>Although the state government does have a level of responsibility in this matter, as does the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, Commonwealth and state governments need to work together to resolve this issue today—as with my second grievance. Capital funding is needed to build a new veterans psychiatric unit at Austin Health. Until this is done, either veterans must see immediate action to repair their current facility or, if that proves too costly, they should be relocated immediately. Veterans who are using the veterans psychiatric unit at Austin Hospital should not have to wait and they should not have to tolerate the conditions they are currently in.</para>
<para>The second matter I wish to raise is that of young people in nursing homes—another issue that is getting caught between state and Commonwealth boundaries. I specifically want to highlight the case of Chris Nolan. Chris is 34 years of age and has been living in an aged care home because the community accommodation he needs does not exist. He is in need of high-care continuous nursing. Tragically, Chris suffered an acquired brain injury when working as a solicitor in Hanoi in 1995. By all accounts, Chris Nolan was bright, funny and had a passion for life. One of his friends described him as:</para>
<quote>
<para>... a fine sportsman, born leader, brilliant scholar and loyal friend.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Chris was a St Patrick’s College boy. However, because of his brain injury, Chris can no longer use his limbs and can neither speak nor see. Chris once lived in a world where he could communicate through an array of mediums—sport, academia and his work. Now he is trapped in a world where his only communication comes from being able to blink—one blink meaning ‘yes’; two meaning ‘no’. Chris has spent the last eight years in an aged care facility with older people who are in need of high-care nursing. Chris wants to be part of a community with those of a similar age. Instead, he is like the 6,000 other people under the age of 65 across Australia who are trapped in nursing homes. Within this number there are 1,100 under the age of 50.</para>
<para>Aged care facilities are not designed to cater for the needs of younger people. They are not funded for it and they do not have the staff for it. They have always been meant to look after frail older Australians. After waiting eight years for appropriate accommodation, Chris and his family have recently been dealt another blow. Chris’s aged care facility, although inappropriate for his needs, is now about to close. Chris has been offered accommodation in another facility; however, it is another aged care facility. The location of this new facility will make visits even more difficult for his family and friends. Instead of Chris’s connection with the outside world being facilitated it is being even further limited.</para>
<para>What has happened to Chris is one of life’s tragic and unforeseen accidents. They strike indiscriminately and without warning. Chris should not be made to pay any more than he already has. He wants to live with people of his own age and he wants to be part of his local community again. In the case of Chris and the 600 or so other Victorians who are in similar positions, it is not a question of party politics but a moral question of the right thing to do. No government—whatever its political persuasion and whether state or federal—can stand by and continue to let young people live in these conditions. The issue has become caught between state and federal boundaries. The states argue that it is a federal issue because the federal government has responsibility for nursing homes; the federal government argues that it is a state issue because state governments look after disability services. It is not a new issue. Chris’s case has been extensively reported in the media. His family have been fighting for over eight years to get help for Chris and they will not stop until they get what he needs.</para>
<para>In this place I have previously raised the cases of two other young people in nursing homes. One of those is Vicki Smith, who has been in a nursing home since she was 17—again, someone who had a tragic car accident and suffered an acquired brain injury. She has described living in a nursing home as ‘living like a vegetable’. She finds that she cannot play the music that she wants to play; she cannot have friends over; she cannot do the sorts of things that a younger woman of 32 is able to do. Having been in a nursing home since the age of 17, she really has not had the opportunity to have a youth at all. As I said, it is not a new issue.</para>
<para>These young people are not asking for any great solution to be found; they are asking for a more suitable model of nursing home care to be developed for them. They are asking state and Commonwealth governments to actually have the courage to do something about this. It is time that we looked beyond the boundaries that are often put up between Commonwealth and state issues and got on with the job of getting these young people out of aged care facilities and into more appropriate accommodation.</para>

<para>—The commemorations of the 90 years of history since the landing at Anzac Cove, held on 25 April 2005 in Turkey, brought back memories to members of the House of Representatives. My father suffered a horrendous injury at the Western Front, where he lost a leg in 1917 at the age of 21, so World War I was a part of our household. My father went on to become an engineer with BHP. He rode with one leg for his college at Cambridge University. He became a barrister at law, a farmer and a member of the Legislative Council of the Victorian parliament from 1931 to 1965. There he became President and a minister in the Bolte government. So the horrors of war were very much part of our household and my family background because of my father’s injury on the Western Front.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The father of my colleague the member for Franklin, Harry Quick, who joined me in the House of Representatives, served in the Anzac campaign and was then transferred to the Western Front. He suffered a wound to his lung, was discharged at the very young age of 21 and lived to the ripe old age of 87, having suffered horrific injuries on those two fronts. The Prime Minister’s father, as many would understand, suffered gassing at Villers-Bretonneux, and memories of the Western Front are very much part of his household. My thanks go to the government and to the Prime Minister for allowing the member for Franklin and I to make the trip and represent this House on this very historic occasion.</para>
<para>Having attended a number of dawn services at Point Danger at Torquay in the electorate of Corangamite, I have stood in the cold and the rain over 20 years just imagining what it would have been like at Anzac Cove on that fateful morning. What would it have been like when those young Australians landed at four o’clock in the morning and how would they have felt? To be part of this 90th celebration, along with the Australian Prime Minister, the Prime Minister of New Zealand and Prince Charles, was a very moving moment for me and for the 17,000 other Australians, predominantly young people, who had made quite a long trip to be at Anzac Cove on that historic occasion.</para>
<para>When the Anzacs arrived on that fateful morning, they arrived at an unknown destination. They were anticipating a better landing, and they probably landed on the most difficult bit of terrain that was possible on the Gallipoli peninsula. The Turkish fire was from the high ground, as most of us know, and they were able to hold the line, from the Turkish point of view, very well. The Sphinx, on the left-hand side as the troops arrived, is still outstanding as a geographical feature. The casualties that occurred on that morning are beyond belief, and the preparation by higher command to move those injured soldiers from the beaches is one of the great tragedies of the Anzac landing. The landing craft were under fire. A number of the soldiers did not even get to the shore. They drowned because of the heavy kit that they had in preparation for the landing. As we saw the rough terrain that morning and the position which was so well defended by a small number of Turkish soldiers, the impossibility of landing in such a small area on Anzac Cove and climbing that very rough terrain on that occasion 90 years ago became very real.</para>
<para>What were my overall impressions? Firstly, my impression was of the incompetence of the generals, the loss of life and the terrible conditions endured by those soldiers some 90 years ago. I acknowledge Les Carlyon’s <inline font-style="italic">Gallipoli</inline>, a 500-page human story of this campaign, and both his excellent historical record of those events plus his human understanding of the participation of so many Australian families and soldiers. Their tactics were unbelievably bad. The British high command started off with a naval battle to remove the narrows which were the entry into the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea, and that sea battle went wrong. There was a loss of battleships, so, in a casual sort of a way, the Gallipoli campaign became a land campaign. It became trench warfare, as had been the case on the Western Front. The lack of concern for human life and the absolutely horrendous loss of life are unbelievable for such a short campaign. Nine thousand Australians; 2,000 New Zealanders; and 20,000 British—a total of 44,000 soldiers—lost their lives in the eight-month campaign. I put on the record that 84,000 Turks also lost their lives in that quite horrendous campaign.</para>
<para>Another impression you get is of the horrendous conditions that existed in the Anzac campaign. In the trenches the food was bully beef, biscuits and very little else. The lack of water is something that most of us do not fully understand. There was also the ongoing heat at the peak of the campaign, and the bodies of dead soldiers added to quite a horrendous situation that very few of us can envisage. The health of the soldiers was affected by dysentery and, again, the ability to carry on was something that is very hard to imagine, even when you are on the site of that famous landing. The sniper fire was forever present over the eight months. The hand-to-hand combat was in a very small area in very difficult terrain for which maps were hard to find, and the location from time to time was difficult. The shrapnel from the newly-found bombs added to the hazards facing all the soldiers. The effort by generals to win a few yards at great human cost is something that one cannot really believe when you see the site.</para>
<para>The tour of the battlefields that the member for Franklin and I took raised a point about the landing site: was Brighton Bay the real objective and was Anzac Cove a mistake? That is not fully clear. The war memorial recognises both the Australian allied forces and the Turks. From the small area that this whole Gallipoli fight took place on, the narrows are just across the ridge—so far and yet so near. The Lone Pine fight came at such great cost to both the Turkish soldiers and the Australian soldiers. About the landing at St Helens, I quote from Carlyon’s book: ‘and the sea ran red’. On Cape Helles: ‘I never knew blood smelled so strong before’. That was Midshipman George Drewry.</para>
<para>I think that covers the sentiment of the whole Anzac campaign—the loss of life on both sides, the commitment of the generals and the fact that the higher war cabinet in London had no understanding of the impact that was being felt in the Anzac campaign. In the eight-month campaign, with the onset of winter, as you all know, the blizzards were turning up and high command, quite rightly, decided to withdraw. The only success of the campaign was the withdrawal, and 90,000 men were withdrawn between 9 December and 18 December with no loss of life.</para>
<para>On the public debate here in Australia about the road, I would make the observation that the government have done a good job in improving the road. It is on Turkish soil. There were 600 buses at the 90th anniversary celebration, and I think that this whole domestic debate was unhelpful. As for the argument about rubbish, I was there and I do not think it stands up to scrutiny.</para>
<para>The emergence of the Australian nationhood at Anzac Cove is well recorded. I felt very honoured to be part of the ceremony and I extend my thanks to the Australian Embassy and Mrs Ingrid Ashu for their assistance to the member for Franklin and me in showing us around Istanbul, showing us over the battlefields and generally giving us the history, the ethos and an understanding of the way which Anzac Cove is now becoming part of Australia’s history. I also salute the government in Turkey, who have allowed Australians to participate in ceremonies on their soil, which is a founding part of our nationhood here in Australia. I acknowledge the Turkish government’s contribution to this important national symbol.</para>

</talker>
<para>—Mr Speaker, it is an extraordinary honour to be elected to the Australian parliament. It is a privilege to represent the people of Werriwa, a community and an electorate that my family and I have called home for the last 25 years. With this privilege comes a responsibility that I do not take lightly. As I rise for the first time in this place, I would like to acknowledge the Tharawal and Gangara people, the traditional owners of the land on which the Federation seat of Werriwa is situated.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Mr Speaker, elections are difficult at the best of times but to contest a ballot in a by-election adds yet another dimension—a dimension of which the other 15 members of this place elected at by-elections would be only too well aware. Victory in an election requires the commitment of a great number of people. Without attempting to name every individual, there are some people I must thank and acknowledge for their significant contribution. Firstly, I wish to thank the tireless campaigners who so selflessly gave up their time, effort and energy. Of course I refer particularly to the local branch members as well as members of Young Labor. My election win was theirs as well.</para>
<para>I would also like to thank Mark Arbib and the officers of the New South Wales branch of the ALP for their confidence in me, in particular Damian Kassabgi, my campaign director. I also deeply appreciate the support, kind words and sage advice of the Leader of the Opposition and I am thrilled to be joining his parliamentary team. Kim Beazley visited the electorate on many occasions during the course of campaign and was equally at home walking through shopping centres, dealing with the inevitable media scrum or standing with me on the hill at Campbelltown Stadium watching the Wests Tigers play against the Canberra Raiders. Sadly, the Tigers lost that particular match, but I can report that, not only is this well-trained, well-disciplined young side doing better as the season progresses, but yesterday we settled the score by beating the Canberra Raiders by 12 points. I would also like to thank the many shadow ministers and other Labor colleagues who visited the electorate during the course of the campaign to lend their support and help me.</para>
<para>I also want to thank my family. My parents have always been there for me. Sadly, illness prevents them being here today but I know their thoughts will be with me. My father is a former New South Wales police officer and in no small way he has instilled in me my sense of values and ethics—values and ethics that have stood me in good stead throughout my working life and values and ethics that I bring to this House. I am also fortunate enough to have the love and support of a close family, of Bernadette, my wife, best friend and chief supporter for more than 30 years—in fact yesterday we celebrated our 29th wedding anniversary—and my sons, Nicholas and Jonathon, both local tradesmen, and my daughter, Elizabeth, and her husband Ashley. And, as I am sure that it would not have escaped the attention of anyone during the course of the election campaign, I am the extremely proud grandfather of two fabulous grandchildren, Nathaniel and Charlie. Without the support of my family I could not, and would not, have stood in this election.</para>
<para>It would also be remiss of me if I did not mention John Ducker, a long-time mentor who has had a significant influence on me. John Ducker is a man who, in addition to his success in the corporate world, has remained dedicated to his family, his church and the labour movement.</para>
<para>Mr Speaker, much was made in the lead-up to the by-election of my involvement in trade unions. It is true. I have spent many years representing working men and women before their employers as well as the various state and Commonwealth industrial tribunals. I do not, and will not, shy away from my involvement with the union movement. I would like to think that, as a union official, I also played a significant role in assisting Australian industry improve its efficiency and competitiveness while helping to deliver job security along with better pay and conditions for employees.</para>
<para>I fully supported the initiatives of His Honour Justice Barry Madden to introduce in a structured way decentralisation in the industrial relations system while maintaining authoritative oversight by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Justice Madden will be remembered not only as a progressive force in industrial reform but as someone committed to the independence of the Industrial Relations Commission. It is my grave concern that this government’s industrial relations agenda will not just achieve its intended goal of weakening the trade union movement. As someone who has been involved with industrial relations from all perspectives, I believe that it will profoundly weaken the position of individual workers in relation to their employers.</para>
<para>Following my time with the union movement I have worked as an independent mediator in specific disputes and assisted in continuous improvement programs. During the campaign the media focused on my role with Sydney Airports Corporation, probably not because of my achievements but more for the comments of my former employer, Max Moore-Wilton. While I was grateful for his kind words they stand in stark contrast to the comments made of me by the member for Lindsay that I was just another union hack. Comments like that say more about the government’s view of workers and their representatives than any real knowledge of me. For my part I will always be proud of my involvement in the union movement.</para>
<para>In addition to Sydney airport I have worked as an adviser to the Police Federation of Australia representing both the professional and industrial interests of police. In this capacity I have enjoyed a close working relationship with honourable members on both sides of the House. For a period of time I was also a member of the Northern Territory Police Arbitral Tribunal. I served under an oath of office and was required to deliberate without fear or favour on all matters coming before that tribunal. I am particularly honoured to have served on the tribunal with Her Honour Pat Leary, President of the Tasmanian Industrial Relations Commission and former Deputy President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Pat is a truly remarkable woman and a great Australian. In addition to these activities, I have dealt with disputes in regional health facilities in NSW, assisted a major printing company to establish a series of enterprise arrangements and performed similar activities on behalf of aircraft engineering, food processing, power generation and sustainable energy companies as well as being an adviser to the CEO and board of the NRMA.</para>
<para>Throughout my career, I have found negotiation is a key factor when representing the interests of others, whether they are employees, businesses or communities. My time with the Australian Workers Union showed me the benefits of negotiating outcomes rather than litigating them. I can honestly say that I played my part in moving the union from having a courtroom based, adversarial culture to something more in tune with the modern enterprise bargaining system. I advocated and negotiated on behalf of everyone from blue-collar workers in the AWU to veterinary officers, surveyors, architects, lawyers and most other professional and administrative callings. And now I will be advocating and negotiating for the people of Werriwa.</para>
<para>Werriwa covers 168 square kilometres of south-western Sydney, with a population in excess of 145,000 in suburbs stretching from Cecil Hills and Kemps Creek in the north to Minto and Leumeah in the south where Bernadette and I live. Within these geographic boundaries, residents fit into almost every cultural, ethnic and religious demographic there is. The last census found that one-third of residents were born overseas and more than 50,000 people spoke a first language other than English. We have people from all parts of Europe and Asia as well as from smaller Pacific island nations like Fiji, Tonga and Samoa. We also have a significant Koori community. This rich mixture combines to produce a cultural diversity that lends depth and colour to the south-west while reinforcing a strong sense of local community.</para>
<para>Werriwa is full of young families. This is understandable because it is a great place to raise a family. It is where Bernadette and I raised our family and built our community—quite literally at times. I remember getting involved in various building activities with other dads at my kids’ school—digging drainage ditches and trenches for footings, constructing formwork, carting bricks and cement or whatever else the then principal and part-time building supervisor, Brother Mark, required. As well as being an interesting way to spend a Saturday, it was surprising the number of lasting friendships that were made following these working bees, which, after all, is community building.</para>
<para>Just as we did back then, young families continue the same process now of building and contributing to their community. Whether it is the Islamic community of Green Valley, the Bangladeshi community of Minto, the Filipino community of Campbelltown or the Fijian-Indian community of Liverpool, they are all young Australians working together for the benefit of their families and their local community.</para>
<para>My community building these days might not result in splinters and blisters, but today I remain as committed as ever to community building in south-western Sydney. There are no pretensions in the south-west. People do not indulge themselves and everyone gets in and does their bit. Today, just as it was 25 years ago, starting a family goes hand in hand with the added responsibilities of either home ownership and mortgage repayments or paying rent. I know the pressures this can place on families and I know that Australian families are doing it tough. Bernadette and I know what it is like to struggle to meet the repayments, let alone afford the little extras like shoes, clothes and school fees. After all, $6 does not stretch all that far.</para>
<para>The important thing to realise is that Werriwa is about families working hard to provide a future for their children. But they cannot do it alone. They need jobs, education, infrastructure and community safety. One in four workers in Werriwa are engaged in part-time work, and 75 per cent of the residents of Liverpool and Campbelltown have a weekly income lower than the national average. Youth unemployment is unacceptably high, with almost one-quarter of all full-time job seekers under the age of 20.</para>
<para>You do not need to go much beyond the police, welfare groups or drug referral agencies to hear the true cost to the community of high youth unemployment. The combination of suburbs with a substantial number of people receiving some form of income support, high youth unemployment and a slowing economy means that my constituents will be among the first to suffer from this government’s cuts to benefits and services.</para>
<para>The fact is that families in the south-west are caught in the crossfire of increased casualisation of their jobs on the one hand and increased costs of living on the other. There is reduced job security and increased financial instability. What these families need are real jobs—permanent employment to sustain their families and service their mortgages. What they want are real opportunities for their kids. They want their kids to have access to tertiary education, whether it is a university degree or a trade qualification through TAFE. They know how important education is to getting ahead and they know how important it is for their children’s future. But tying education funding to the government’s industrial relations agenda and continuing to erode standards will not help local kids or their families.</para>
<para>And in a rapidly growing region they need infrastructure investment that will keep pace with community growth. Since July 2002, more than $1.5 billion has been approved for investment in new dwellings and non-residential construction in Liverpool and Campbelltown. Recently, approvals were given for an additional 12,000 dwellings in Edmondson Park, Glenfield and south Hoxton. This strong growth will continue over the coming decades with up to 100,000 new dwellings to be constructed in the south-west corridor over the next 20 years.</para>
<para>State and local governments are doing their best, but Canberra needs to do more. Canberra’s refusal to fully fund new Hume Highway on-off ramps at Ingleburn is a prime example. The Commonwealth’s decision forced Campbelltown City Council to contribute $4 million to the cost of the project, funding the shortfall with an extra levy on local businesses. Small businesses can do without further subsidising Canberra. After all, they are already burdened by substantial compliance costs as they struggle through the maze of the ‘simplified tax system’. They need to be able to get on with the job of growing their businesses and generating local employment opportunities. It is my intention to pay particular attention to the concerns of local small business owners and operators because their sustained prosperity will create the jobs sought by the young and the unemployed.</para>
<para>For too long, policing has been seen simply as an issue for state governments. There is no doubt that local, state and federal government policies all have an impact on crime and, therefore, there is a need for greater integration of policy responsibility in respect of policing, law and order, and crime prevention. It is estimated that crime costs our country $32 billion a year. That is more than the budgets of most state governments. The people of Werriwa are concerned about drugs. They are certainly concerned about crime. But, as recent drug busts have shown, criminals are not concerned about state or national boundaries. Crime undermines the security of Australia and of Australians. It is time Canberra took more of an interest in, and provided more funding for, local initiatives aimed at helping local communities, in partnership with police, to combat local crime.</para>
<para>The Werriwa by-election was a unique opportunity for hardworking Australians to take a second look at this government. It came after a surprise post-election rise in interest rates. We have all heard the usual hairsplitting and carefully chosen words, which have become the hallmark of this government, but the fact remains that ordinary people in Western Sydney thought they had been given a guarantee that interest rates would not rise. It also came after the surprise announcement to expand our troop commitment to Iraq. By its standards, the government made a pretty clear commitment during the election that Australia had already made a significant contribution to Iraq. And then, of course, after the by-election we had the saga of the disappearing Medicare safety net, which was more than just another broken ironclad promise; this went to the very heart of this government’s commitment and integrity. It is not surprising how quickly the shine has come off this government.</para>
<para>In concluding, as honourable members would appreciate I am very conscious of the distinguished rollcall of my predecessors over the last half century. For nearly half of that period, since 1952, the seat of Werriwa was held by that giant of Labor history, Gough Whitlam. During that period Mr Whitlam was able to reform and modernise the Labor Party. In particular, he had the genius of being the first major political figure to comprehend the fundamental changes in Australian society in the 1950s and 1960s. He understood that a new political focus on the educational, cultural, social and infrastructure needs of the residents of the expanding outer suburbs was fundamental to improving the lot of average Australians. I am very conscious that communities like mine are the beneficiaries of the Whitlam legacy. Following Whitlam was John Kerin, a mainstay of the Hawke and Keating governments. He was a great contributor to policy development. He was a core member of the first Hawke cabinet, a group widely acknowledged as the most talented executive in Australian history. John served the people of Werriwa with distinction and they are the better for it.</para>
<para>Finally, I would like to reflect on the contribution of my immediate predecessor, Mark Latham. Mark served as the member for Werriwa for almost 11 years. But there is more to Mark Latham than just his national profile. I would like to remind my colleagues that it is important not to lose sight of the essence of Mark Latham. Mark built a political career from a fundamental involvement in his local community. My experience in the recent by-election campaign gave me some new insights into the nature of Mark’s involvement and his relationships with his people.</para>
<para>My family and I are long-term residents of Werriwa. Bernadette and I have been active in school parent organisations, sporting teams and various community groups. Our children have grown up and attended schools, TAFE and the University of Western Sydney. We have lived as ordinary members of our community and, like most in that category, ours has been a relatively low profile. This meant I had to make a very special effort to present myself to the people of Werriwa. During the campaign I met with community groups, spoke with rail commuters, conducted street meetings and knocked on thousands of doors. I spoke to as many people as I possibly could.</para>
<para>In the course of this intensive process of engagement with the community I constantly encountered a universally deep affection and concern for Mark Latham. People spoke of him as a friend. They did not see him just as a national leader, a writer of political analysis or a proponent of radical policies of change. They saw him as one of them—as a westie. They thought of him as a local lad who was raised in difficult circumstances, attended local schools, went to university and achieved distinction in his studies. They were proud of him. They knew he remained one of them. Obviously, I expected a reaction like this but I was surprised at how universal it was. People said these things time and time again. It is obviously a bit trite to say, ‘This is what it is all about.’ But I have to say that this experience has been a genuine inspiration to me. As a local member, I am honoured to replace Mark Latham and I intend to serve with the same commitment to my electorate as he did.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I would like to congratulate the member for Werriwa on his maiden speech in the House and thank him for his contribution. I can identify with much of what he said, as we serve somewhat similar areas. Certainly as far as Sydney’s members are concerned, they tend to be Western Sydney before anything else.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This budget is one of the best that I have seen while serving in this parliament. I have examined it carefully and in my mind applied it to the circumstances of my constituents and of people that I know both in rural Australia and in Western Sydney. It builds on previous budgets, budgets which sought to give particular support and assistance to families and small business in order to create greater productivity and to turn Australia around. It builds on this government’s record of being able to pay off a massive debt—a debt that was costing the annual budget $9 billion or $10 billion in repayments and interest repayments every year. Every year the huge debt of the Australian Labor Party was a burden to the Australian taxpayer and to the Australian worker.</para>
<para>The changes that have been brought about over a period of eight years have been quite startling. But it is not a time for us to rest on our laurels or assume that the future will continue as the past. We must continue to be active and attentive and to apply ourselves to the needs of the Australian people, and we must commit to constant reform and change—to a process of constant improvement. The 2005-06 budget provides an underlying cash surplus of $8.9 billion, in addition to the sidelining of $16 billion in the future fund to cover the Commonwealth government’s commitment for the retirement bills of public servants and the defence forces. This is a process that has never been entered into by a government of Australia before. It is a process to prepare for the future. I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, knowing that you are aware of the capacity of a fund of this size, that this superannuation fund may in fact grow to be the largest of its type in Australia. It is an investment in Australia’s future. It will be investing, I am told, in profit-making ventures, but it will also be an opportunity for those making decisions about investment for the fund to invest in the upgrading of Australia’s infrastructure, for such things as water resources and transport.</para>
<para>Therefore I believe that the future fund is a far-sighted and visionary decision, and one that has not been given the appropriate attention by commentators or by the public. But we will see, as has occurred in Singapore, that as the savings of the community are set aside and reinvested in the future they produce magnificent yields and earnings for people seeking to have an assured retirement. Nothing in Australia could be counted on to provide a better opportunity or return than investment in urban water supplies. The earnings of such funds, I believe, would be huge and magnificent, and Australians would grow to accept that they must pay the real costs of water. Any investment in water infrastructure is going to be a high yield one. I believe that the $16 billion future fund outlined in this budget is going to offer that investment opportunity.</para>
<para>This budget maintains a strong position but personal income tax cuts are provided. There are significant reforms to the welfare system, and that will help to improve work force participation. Improving work force participation is a process whereby people are encouraged to equip themselves, and where the government pays for training, counselling and mentor programs to assist people back to the workplace. Some people yearn to be in the workplace—and I am speaking about people with disabilities. I know many people with disabilities who would love to be able to find employment. I know many of them really yearn to be considered normal and capable of earning a salary, whether it be a partial or a full salary. I think of the example given by my friend John Temple, who was recognised by Her Majesty the Queen. John is a serious sufferer of cerebral palsy. But, by perseverance, he has learned to drive vehicles—he can drive bulldozers and front-end loaders. Anything with four wheels he is a genius with. With his earnings, John built a home for himself and his parents in Castle Hill. In his spare time he drove for the Spastic Centre. John Temple talks of himself as an able disabled person. He says that many of the people that he knows, if only given the chance, guidance, direction and encouragement, would be able to achieve what he has. He is proud of what he has done. On one occasion he had the opportunity of visiting this parliament and Government House, and everybody who met him said that they were amazed that a man who appeared to be so disabled was so capable in his capacity to earn a full wage and living. John, now retired on the Central Coast of New South Wales, is an example to me and to our community of what can be done if people are given the chance, encouragement and support that they need.</para>
<para>The economic outlook for Australia—as far as I can determine and according to the budget—remains strong. All the predictions that I see, whether it be St George Bank projections or other business projections, indicate that there is confidence in the business community and an expectation that the economy will provide suitable profits and employment opportunities for Australians. Economic growth, which is at about three per cent, is moderately high. It is certainly not as high as it is in China or in some of our neighbouring countries but, then again, Australia came through circumstances of moderately high growth factors where others crashed because their growth was too high. So Australia will retain a moderately high growth rate, which will continue to provide employment.</para>
<para>To listen to members of the Australian Labor Party you would think that we were back in the old days of 10 years ago, when everybody was worried about their job and when high interest rates, high unemployment and high taxation did not appear to be able to be put to any benefit. And what have we done since that time? There are now more jobs than we have ever seen; with over one million jobs created people are now in work. Unemployment is at a record low, interest rates are at a level where people can afford to buy houses and small businesses can afford to borrow to expand. In addition to that, the debt has gone. It is no longer a charge on the Australian people year in and year out, with $9 billion each year going out the window to pay the people that the Labor Party borrowed money from when they were in office. Unemployment is forecast to remain at around its current low level. Australians will benefit from $21.7 billion in tax cuts over the next four years.</para>
<para>Already we are building on tax cuts and changes to family tax benefits A and B in the last budget. That is going to be expanded and improved—and there will be tax cuts as well. The 17 per cent tax rate will be reduced to 15 per cent. That will go across the board; everybody benefits from that. The tax threshold for the 42 per cent and 47 per cent rates will be raised on 1 July, and again on 1 July 2006. This means that only three per cent of the Australian community will ever have their salary reach that upper level and have to pay 47 per cent at the top margin of their income. This is an incentive that is due.</para>
<para>Prior to last year’s budget there was an argument being expressed that we should be reducing the high marginal rates of tax in Australia. I did not agree with that because I felt that at that time we needed to be doing more to give more choice to encourage families, particularly families with children, to consider whether both partners worked or not. Many women—I say women, but it applies equally to men—would prefer to work two or three days a week and not have a full-time job. Under the tax regime that we had two years ago, there was a big loss factor once a person, usually the mum, worked over about 10 or 15 hours a week. Once you got to that point there was a severe penalty, sometimes rising to almost 100 per cent of tax take. The family was disadvantaged by loss of benefits and increased taxation, so there was no real net gain for the family from the mother going to work. The choice was not whether someone worked two or three days a week but whether they did not work at all or whether they worked full time. Many families found that inappropriate. They did not have the choices that they would prefer to have. The government has solved that problem and, with the changes to the family tax benefits, has moved to a point where there can be real choices. This was the time to provide more incentive by reducing those high marginal tax rates.</para>
<para>The Australian Labor Party seem to have an envy factor on this, but they must remember that the high achievers—the high yielders, the ones who create the opportunities for many more to be employed—need to have adequate reward. There are many Australians who should be working here but who are working overseas because the opportunities offered to them in the United States and Europe are much more attractive than the opportunities offered here. If the Australian Labor Party consider that that is a desirable trend, they will continue to vote against these tax changes. If they want Australians to continue to move offshore, if they want to deplete the skilled and talented work force of Australia, they will continue as they have done.</para>
<para>The Australian Labor Party are about mediocrity. They like mediocrity at all levels, including the frontbench. The mediocrity that they are aiming at with their refusal to pass the tax cuts that the government wants is one that will see Australians who should be remaining in the country—people who are highly qualified, highly educated and trained in their jobs—being attracted out of this country for more income and greater opportunities to get reward for the effort they have put into their skill, learning and talent. They are being attracted offshore. We need to reverse that process. We need to change that. This is one small change that will help.</para>
<para>In addition, the superannuation surcharge has been a pain to everybody involved in it. Its termination is long overdue. The calculated process that goes into the collection of this money is so high that I believe most people would have preferred to pay an extra one or two per cent of tax than to be lobbed with the pain and difficulties of working out the superannuation surcharge. That is going out the door. The surcharge is gone. People will be able to make private savings and invest in their own future without the encumbrance of the weird, difficult-to-understand surcharge.</para>
<para>The Welfare to Work program is going to ensure increased work force participation. From 1 July 2006, there will be a wider range of income support. Much of the complaint that has been made by some welfare groups and the Australian Labor Party has been that it is not fair that single mums should start back at work or people with disabilities be encouraged to participate in the workplace. The fact is that nobody who is currently on these benefits is going to be affected. Recipients on 1 July 2006 will be obliged to seek work. Newstart allowance is going to be enhanced. There are going to be greater benefits for people involved. They will be more strongly rewarded for getting back into the work force. More than $2 billion will be invested over four years to help those seeking jobs—to train them further, to give them extra skills or to support the services that will be looking after them.</para>
<para>Incentives to find work will be strengthened by changes to the compliance framework. At the end of the day, if somebody does not want to work, constantly refuses to participate and is capable of working, they will have their benefits suspended. But that does not mean to say that people who have a severe disability or people who cannot manage to get back into the work force will be penalised in any way. That is not the case, and that is not the government’s intention.</para>
<para>The health system is being dealt with in this budget with sustainable and continuing improvement to the health system—$45 billion in 2005-06. That is a further rise of $20 billion from the time when the government first came to office. Cancer care is going to be improved. There will be a special package to make dementia care a national health priority. A Medicare safety net will go ahead and the PBS will be made more sustainable.</para>
<para>In the electorate of Mitchell in particular these changes were noted by our community. Our community saw an opportunity to confidently move ahead. I have a huge electorate. There are a large number of people living in the electorate. It is constantly growing and has a voting population of something like 96,000 people. They feel confident with the result of this budget. It will particularly support families and will give them confidence about continuing their employment and the capacity to pay off their homes because their jobs are secure. They can see by what the government is doing that there is not going to be a rapid change in their employment prospects. They will be able to continue to make plans as they have in the past, will be able to manage their circumstances and they expect that there will be other changes which will be beneficial.</para>
<para>Some of these changes are of particular import. I like the new approaches that we are going to be adopting in family law and in the support for families caught up in marriage breakdown and separation. The funding is there for family centres to be able to support families where they are caught up in this tragic conflict—it is almost like warfare in some circumstances. The government’s decision is to create family relationship centres and to support families with guidance. Families who cannot continue to live together can establish a parenting plan for their children so that they are properly cared for. That is a very significant change which is, together with the future fund, farsighted and a very valuable adjunct to the budget.</para>
<para>I have looked through all of the comments and reports that have been offered from welfare agencies, the business community, family organisations and other groups. I can see an occasional expression of concern, but I know that those concerns will be allayed as we move through to a thoughtful and carefully geared program. Another factor that will change in the coming weeks is the workplace practices: more people will be able to negotiate how they work and their hours and conditions. These changes are long overdue. The situation in the state of New South Wales is so unusual and so hard to manage for many employers and employees that people are fleeing to Queensland.</para>
<para>I noticed that the Leader of the Opposition told the National Press Club that he thought we were tinkering with economic reform, indirect tax and the decentralised wage system. We are not going to do that; we are going to produce a change in outlook. People are going to gain greater satisfaction from extra earnings. The 13 per cent of real growth in wages since we came to office is real growth. People are prospering—and they know it. They listen to members of the Labor Party mouth off and just ignore them. The Australian Labor Party go into an election expecting to get a great result—they never will whilever they mouth half-truths. They need to come up with alternatives. The fact of the matter is that they are not prepared to put in the work. They are too comfortable in opposition. That is where they want to stay and that is where they should stay because they are not an alternative to the current brilliant government.</para>

<para class="block">As I said at the National Press Club last week, this budget was a missed opportunity to set Australia up for the next generation of sustained growth and shared prosperity. This complacent government has not focused on skills development, new infrastructure or putting incentive into the tax system and it has ignored the growing burden of regulation on Australian business. In addition, it has proposed some very unfair income tax cuts. Instead of addressing crucial reform priorities, it has gambled on a once in a generation surge in world economic growth in the terms of trade.</para>
<para>The budget itself admits that this is a high-risk approach. The budget does not give priority to investing in the machinery of wealth creation and building the economy’s supply capacity. The benchmarks for a modern and reformist economic policy should be what it does to lift productivity and the performance of the economy within a responsible fiscal policy. Labor will seek to create wealth through world-class infrastructure, a highly trained and educated work force, research and development, and incentive to work hard. Better harnessing our national skills and potential in providing real incentive must be our goal.</para>
<para>Where has the government brought us to in macroeconomic management? The budget papers predict the following for the economy: a sharp decline in the rate of GDP growth; a continuing very large current account deficit, even with spectacular improvement in the terms of trade; a growth in exports in 2005-06 smaller than the predicted increase in imports; a decline in dwelling investment; a significant decline in employment growth in 2005-06 from the current level; and an increase in inflation. We should all remember that, despite the extraordinary surge in Australia’s projected terms of trade to their best level in 50 years, Australia has just experienced its 41st consecutive trade deficit. At 7.1 per cent of GDP in the December quarter of 2004, Australia’s current account deficit is now the highest in 50 years.</para>
<para>In 1997 the Prime Minister claimed that four per cent annual growth would be achieved through the current decade. He could do that in 1997 because of the excellent economy he had inherited. However, the government have only achieved 3.3 per cent in this decade’s first half, and we are looking at growth falling to two per cent this year and an estimated three per cent in 2005-06. To keep our prosperity sustainable, we need the government to pay attention to the skills crisis, infrastructure bottlenecks and other capacity constraints which are holding us back. This is the position now agreed with by business groups, the OECD, the Reserve Bank and most commentators. This is precisely why Labor has been arguing for years for more investment in the productive capacity of our economy.</para>
<para>This budget largesse is built on taking a gamble on the boom in export prices largely flowing from activity in China. This is specifically recognised in the budget papers as a key risk. Indeed, the budget papers recognise:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... it is likely that commodity prices will retrace significantly in the medium term.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In addition, the budget papers themselves detail a number of further risks in this budget. These include higher oil prices and higher prices for steel, leading to higher engineering and construction costs. Another key threat is the risk to the international economic outlook of the large fundamental imbalances in current accounts. In the face of these risks it is therefore all the more imperative that we enhance skills, incentives and infrastructure investment. These should have been the focus of the budget. Instead all we got was relief for a few, not real tax reform, while around seven million hardworking Australians are missing out on tax justice.</para>
<para>Then of course we have the drought. That is the other significant risk failed to be mentioned in key parts of the budget. The budget papers state:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">As is normal practice, the forecasts for the rural sector are predicated on an assumption that average seasonal conditions will prevail in 2005-06.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That sounds like the budget has ignored the drought’s potential to reduce production and ignored the dire impact on communities. This is what the Treasurer had to say just last week:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We have put down forecasts for GDP as a whole and they take into account all of the foreseeable events.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Well, what on earth was the Deputy Prime Minister on about last Saturday week? He certainly does not agree with the Treasurer. Deputy Prime Minister Anderson spilled the beans just five days after the budget when he told News Ltd:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It could knock up to 1 per cent off economic growth. It could do that again if we can’t get the crop in.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Who is telling the truth here—the Deputy Prime Minister or the Treasurer?</para>
<para>In addition to that, Labor has been warning the government for years that their short-term approach to cutting training would come at the long-term cost to the economy. Those responsible warnings from Labor have not been heeded—just ignored and indeed denigrated by the government. They have not listened and now the skills shortage that Labor has been talking about and calling for urgent action on has come upon us. The government are still in denial that they have caused the problem. Instead they focus solely on an ideological agenda on industrial relations and put in place welfare to work measures which will simply not work. In addition to that they will punish hundreds of thousands of vulnerable Australians.</para>
<para>Recognising the magnitude of the skills problem, Kim Beazley has called for a trade apprenticeship school incentive scheme, which will go some of the way to addressing these skills shortages that many in the broader community have been pointing to. The government is now trying to pretend that it is concerned about skills through the proposal to create a duplicate set of Commonwealth technical colleges. These will not be enough to undo the damage that has already been done. There will not be any graduates from these institutions until at least 2010. We should note, though, that there is no new money being proposed to the existing federal training structure. So there is no across-the-board strategy in this budget to properly boost skills training—simply the Prime Minister’s pre-election gimmick where he wanted to look like he was doing something. Again, Labor have been consistent and correct in pointing to the defects in the government’s economic management. We welcome the fact that the Reserve Bank is blowing the whistle on the skills shortage issue and we continue to urge the government to do more to fix up the mess that it has created.</para>
<para>The government has also ignored the creeping burden of regulation that Australian business faces. We do need to improve productivity. Yet instead the government is increasing red tape. We all remember what the Prime Minister famously promised before he was elected: he would cut red tape by 50 per cent. Everyone knows that was a non-core promise. It has been comprehensively breached, not least by the GST BAS burden on small business. We now have a report in the media today about Access Economics and the Business Council of Australia showing that business regulation has in fact doubled under this government. Federal legislation and regulation are growing at more than 10 per cent a year, and the annual compliance burden for business and taxpayers could be as high as eight per cent of GDP. This is certainly not the way to ensure higher growth into the future, and it is certainly not the way to make the economy stronger for dealing with our future challenges.</para>
<para>Even the Business Council has put the onus directly on the Prime Minister to do something about it. Obviously it has no confidence in the Treasurer to make any impact. Dick Humphry, who is now the chairman of the BCA’s regulatory task force, summed it up well in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> today, where he said:</para>
<quote>
<para>We have got ourselves into a trap, with regulation growing at an almost uncontrollable rate, and we need to take stock and find a better solution.</para>
<para>We propose a number of steps to put in place reasonable hurdles before regulation is introduced so the benefits will outweigh the costs. That’s not done at all; there’s no form of impact study.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So what does the budget do about this critical issue to the business community? Nothing. It ignores the problem. This is just the continuing pattern of the Howard government. It collects the benefits of prior reform and coasts along, ignoring the investments that need to be made to sustain good economic performance into the future. That is why Labor has been consistently arguing for long-term policy. Long-term challenges need long-term commitment and long-term investment. Responsible policy needs constant attention, not a politically driven set of giveaways just before the election.</para>
<para>Of course the Treasurer does not like criticism. We know this government thinks that it should be immune from all criticism. Saturday’s back page of the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> demonstrates the new lows to which the Treasurer is now stooping. An article there states the Treasurer has:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... implied threats against any bank whose economists may choose to criticise or be less than fulsome in their praise.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So the message from the Treasurer or his office is: praise us or there will be consequences. This is the method of tyrants and organised thugs, and it is a technique which is used by this government frequently. If it is not true, let the Treasurer come in here and state for record that he, or his office, has not been making such threats.</para>
<para>In the face of all of this, Labor do have a clear alternative. Our response to the budget is driven by an entirely different philosophy with three alternative wellsprings: (1) a plan for higher productivity and participation; (2) fairness for all workers, low-, middle and high-income earners; and (3) national leadership in skills and infrastructure. Kim Beazley has already addressed these issues in his budget reply. Labor stands for fairer tax cuts, spreading incentives throughout the work force, which in turn will lead to higher productivity and higher levels of participation.</para>
<para>The government is now embarrassed at the unfairness of its proposal and at the obvious equity and reform in Labor’s superior plan. Labor has shown how low- and middle-income earners can obtain twice the tax benefits of the government’s proposals in a responsible manner which will also boost participation. All this will still allow the top rate not to cut in until incomes reach $100,000. This government is reduced to a distortion of Labor’s proposals as it cannot attack their fairness. We had a perfect example of that from the Treasurer in the House today when he set out to distort and mislead about the impact of Labor’s fairer and more reformist package.</para>
<para>Labor’s proposals will see already legislated increases in the 42c and 47c thresholds from 1 July 2005, new tax cuts for low-income earners from 1 January 2006 and further tax cuts for middle and high-income earners from 1 July 2006. The implementation of Labor’s plan would see the $12 weekly tax cut made available from 1 January 2006, and senior Australians would get a tax cut from Labor. They would benefit from the increase in the 30c threshold and an increase in the income threshold for the senior Australians tax offset—all things which the Treasurer deliberately misled the House about today.</para>
<para>The weakness of the government’s proposals on tax is perhaps most glaringly exposed when we look at their impact on participation. This government’s budget was not up to the hard economic reform task of removing disincentives from our tax and welfare systems to boost work force participation. Labor’s tax package is designed to improve participation, particularly for those on lower incomes who are likely to have the strongest behavioural work force response. Studies of labour elasticity suggest lower income earners are more likely to re-enter the work force or work longer hours when given added incentives. Reducing effective marginal tax rates where we find low-income earners and part-time workers will have a relatively strong effect on labour market participation and hours worked. Where is the policy logic in claiming marginal tax rates matter and then directing the bulk of the relief to those on the top marginal rate? If your concern is with marginal tax rates, would you not logically start with those who are paying effective marginal tax rates exceeding 80 per cent rather than the 48.5 per cent top rate?</para>
<para>There is a better way, and that is what Kim Beazley showed in Labor’s budget reply—as indeed we have shown before in constructive proposals for welfare reform. This government’s proposals in that area are simply to move people from welfare to welfare without making the necessary investments in their capacity and cutting the incomes of some of the most vulnerable people in the community. When we talk about the need to invest in the capacity of the nation, it requires real welfare reform which has a correct balance between incentives on the one hand, personal responsibility on the other and the availability of skills training and child care—all of which are noticeably absent from the government’s package.</para>
<para>In the face of all of this, we have not seen due attention to the economic capacity of the nation. In the face of what have been in the last two years the worst trade deficits in our history by far, and in the face of a current account deficit which last year was the highest as a share of GDP in more than half a century, how can the government ignore such issues in the budget? They have again ignored repeated calls from the OECD and the Business Council of Australia, among others, for urgent attention to skills crises, infrastructure bottlenecks and other capacity constraints which are all holding us back. What is their response to some of the longer term issues that they are supposed to be addressing such as the ageing of our population and how to get productivity and participation going? We hear from them that they have a future fund, which is really code for higher taxes now locked away for the next 15 years at the expense of future economic growth, at the expense of investing in our skills development and in our infrastructure and at the expense of putting real incentive and real reform into the tax system. When you boil it down, the government’s proposal for a future fund should really have seen a budget headline that read, ‘Government proposes new multibillion dollar tax’.</para>
<para>Labor’s alternative to the future fund, the building Australia fund, is integrated with our fiscal policy, our pro-growth agenda and our plans for infrastructure leadership at the national level. Labor believes that the government should stick to the budget balance over the cycle fiscal rule and not increase the tax burden. Accumulated surpluses need to be available should the economy slow, otherwise the government has no alternative except to run up debt. Labor also believes that the fund should not be used exclusively for the pensions of public servants in Canberra. The focus on public sector superannuation is a distraction from the main agenda: productivity and participation.</para>
<para>There is broad agreement that, based on current demographic trends and policy settings, Australia will face future fiscal challenges. Where we critically differ from the Howard government is how to deal with this challenge. The debate has narrowed down to essentially two approaches: the low road, the government’s road, which involves taxing more now to pay for future fiscal challenges—that is their approach that underlies the future fund—and the high road, the Labor road, the pro-growth policy which focuses on capacity building, productivity and participation enhancing reforms.</para>
<para>Treasury secretary Ken Henry also expressed a preference for this second approach in a speech in May last year, arguing higher tax now is inconsistent with higher economic growth. Quoting his predecessor Ted Evans, Ken Henry argued that ‘the greatest contribution that today’s population can make to the living standard of future generations is to ensure that today’s policies are directed towards maximising future GNP.’ Labor agrees, and our policies will be framed accordingly.</para>
<para>Our approach, the building Australia fund announced on Thursday, means there should be a level of funds on deposit at the RBA sufficient for the Commonwealth’s short-term liquidity needs. Excess money, including the proceeds from asset sales, should be transferred to the fund to be invested according to an appropriate rate of return and degree of risk. Our building Australia fund and the availability of revenue from this fund for Infrastructure Australia will help to address the supply bottlenecks that are now impeding the Australian economy.</para>
<para>Sadly for the Australian people, this budget does not do enough to invest in our future prosperity and growth to ensure that we can sustain strong and shared growth into the future. This budget was a golden opportunity for real tax reform—reform which gave incentive to the great bulk of the work force that have worked so hard to create wealth in recent years.</para>
<para>We got no leadership on skills, no leadership on infrastructure and no enduring solution for the buck-passing that bedevils federal-state relations, and there was barely a mention of competition policy. All we got from the government was a lopsided response—a lopsided set of tax cuts that reward only very high income earners. As a consequence, they passed up the opportunity for welfare reform which invested in people and their skills and which gave them some real incentive to move from welfare to work. Instead, we got a welfare to welfare package, from a higher benefit to a lower benefit, dressed up with terms like ‘enhanced Newstart’ and so on, to disguise the fact that the government have broken the promise they made during the last election and the election before that about not cutting income. What we got was a cut to the incomes of some of the most vulnerable people in our community. At the same time, we did not get enough investment in their skills training and in their rehabilitation to give them a chance to get a toehold in the work force.</para>
<para>This government’s reform program is to attack the vulnerable and give a set of lopsided tax cuts to a select few in our community. We argue for a comprehensive approach to long-term economic reform—real incentive in the tax system, investment in infrastructure, leadership from the Commonwealth for infrastructure, leadership in skills and leadership in investing in the future to create a growing economy on a sustained basis. That is why Labor will oppose parts of this budget; that is why we will stand and fight for the vast majority of the Australian work force who deserve a brighter economic future. We look forward to that debate in the days ahead, particularly with the introduction of the tax legislation tomorrow.</para>

<para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2335">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2005-2006</inline> and to participate in the cognate debate on the related appropriations legislation. I had the great honour of following the Treasurer on the night of the budget commitment announcement, when, as Parliamentary Secretary for Finance and Administration, I was able to commence this debate in talking about what I think has been one of the most equitable and forward-thinking budgets produced by any government. It is one of many in the long line of budgets—some nine years of them—which have given this country a future. It will address intergenerational challenges and, at the same time, it understands and purposefully goes about establishing better funding for our social and physical infrastructure, given that in our 150 to 200 years of legacy we, like other developed countries, are reaching a stage where a lot of our original works are in need of rehabilitation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In recent times, the private sector have been keen to stress their interest in partnering with governments in Australia to build new infrastructure. Some have suggested that they are frustrated at not seeing more opportunities for public-private partnerships. The federal government’s opposition has gone so far as to say that PPPs may be the panacea for what they claim is a crisis in national infrastructure provision. Few would agree that there is indeed a crisis. In fact, this government has put more funds on the table for roads compared to any others. For example, the Roads to Recovery funding has forged new relationships between the Commonwealth and local governments. Never before have we been able to respond directly to the crisis that the states had left us, where a backlog of gravel and poorly bitumened local roads were in such disrepair that it was affecting the economy of local communities dependent on the road infrastructure to deliver product to market.</para>
<para>In the Murray electorate we have seen, for the first time, local roads being addressed with the available federal funding, which, in this budget, was increased substantially to all of the local councils in my electorate. Besides the road infrastructure investment that this government has dedicated, there has been the substantial new program called AusLink. AusLink addresses not only roads but also rail, ports, air, communications and infrastructure, and more than $10 billion has been identified in the extraordinarily important AusLink project.</para>
<para>Over $2 billion has also been put on the table by the Commonwealth government—by this John Howard-led government—through the National Water Initiative, an initiative of such significance that we have been hailed internationally for our efforts to try to redefine property rights to water, the trading of water in the marketplace and also the conservation of water in the metropolitan areas. Increasingly with climate change, water is becoming a scarce resource that may curb our development in future years unless we address the issue of sustainable water supply. There is also some half a billion dollars for the Living Murray project, which specifically aims to secure the sustainability of the Murray River and its dependent ecosystems, ensuring that they are properly financed for the future generations.</para>
<para>Labor’s extremist language notwithstanding, the Howard government’s private financing policy of 2001 acknowledged that public-private partnerships may represent best value for money in the procurement of some major projects where particular characteristics are evident—for example, where there is a sufficient economy of scale, where the various elements over the whole of the life of the new infrastructure can be coalesced into one contract and where risks can be appropriately transferred to the partner who can best manage that risk.</para>
<para>Private and public sector partnering is not a new concept in building infrastructure here or internationally. Over the last 10 years the UK has had experience with over 600 PPP projects ranging from roads and schools to hospitals and waterworks, to name but a few. Of course, the bulk of Australian experience so far with public-private partnerships has been at the state level, where, traditionally, jurisdiction for infrastructure such as schools, hospitals, roads and ports has been found. At the Commonwealth level, the Australian government has been joint-venturing and outsourcing for many years, but some significant PPPs are now under active consideration. For example, we have a 12-year $900 million public-private partnership for Customs aerial surveillance, as well as the consideration of the $300 million Defence Headquarters Joint Operations Command facility. These projects present both exciting opportunities and major challenges as public-private partnerships, potentially.</para>
<para>For certain types of projects of sufficient scale, public-private partnerships allow the government sector to focus on delivering its key core business while leaving the support services to the private sector, which can perhaps best deliver things like security, catering, IT systems, fit-out and occupational health and safety measures. All these aspects of the infrastructure project are negotiated up-front into a single contract, unlike with a traditional procurement process. Proper consideration of PPPs, whether by the state or the Commonwealth, is definitely a balancing act that requires very careful consideration and selectivity. However, for a government, a public-private partnership may offer market-driven benefits such as innovation, excellence in support services and the best value for money, where it can deliver on-time completion and lower costs. To the private sector, it offers a good client-and-government long-term investment opportunity. This can generate bankable goodwill amongst taxpayers and for their future commercial dealings.</para>
<para>Obviously, though, the substantial up-front consideration and project assessment require significant skill and resource in public sector agencies. To help government agencies build their capacity in determining the best procurement method that should apply to deliver the best value for money to taxpayers, the Department of Finance and Administration has developed, and I have had the honour of launching, financial management guidance. This includes guidelines on the Commonwealth policy principles for the use of private financing, business case development of private financing or public-private partnerships, risk management and contract management; a guide to discounting rates is still in production. These guidelines will help ensure that agencies can reduce the cost of bidding as they assess best value for money, which we need to remind ourselves does not always rest solely on the lowest cost. We need to look at the whole-of-life footprint of projects as they come forward. As mentioned before, PPPs will work best where there are opportunities for cost-effective risk transfer to the party best able to manage it, a mix of public-private skills to realise project outcomes, innovation, a single point of accountability, efficient bundling and efficiencies derived from economies of scale.</para>
<para>All these issues, as I said before, require there to be significant capacity, experience and skill in our government agencies. So in the Department of Finance and Administration we have developed a second tool to assist our agencies in evaluating the best procurement method for each large and significant program. Recently I launched what we call the private financing panel. This panel consists of some 20 financial and commercial advisers. The panellists have been competitively selected based on their extensive experience and expertise in areas of significance in the consideration of public-private partnerships as a procurement method. This panel can be accessed by all Australian government agencies that want specialist advice as they work through a PPP as an option for an infrastructure project. The panellists will give general policy and private financing advice, as well as risk management, taxation, accounting and strategic business advice. Some 20 Australian firms are represented on the panel.</para>
<para>There can be a gap in the experience, knowledge and skill levels between the private and public sector and between agencies. So, to ensure that the government are always in a position to negotiate the best deal and that our infrastructure is delivered on time and for the agreed price, it is important that our agencies increase their capacities by using this new panel and the guidance materials and at the same time access, whenever they wish, the specialist advice of the department of finance officials who are there to work with the other agencies in a collegiate fashion. In particular, special consideration is needed of intellectual property protection and the cost of PPP pre-tender preparations.</para>
<para>All this is also the subject of significant intrastate, interstate and Commonwealth consideration in what we have called a new national PPP forum. Despite being a relative newcomer to PPPs, the Australian government accepts its leadership obligation to support and encourage a national approach to PPPs. This includes the finalisation of relevant tax treatments. To harmonise policies and processes, the national PPP forum, which consists of all Commonwealth, state and territory governments, is working towards reducing bidding costs through harmonised documentation and the sharing of lessons learned. The Commonwealth is actively participating in this forum.</para>
<para>The next issue I want to discuss is the current drought, which is the worst on record for my electorate of Murray and throughout much of Australia. We used to believe, and I used to regularly state, that the irrigation systems had drought-proofed agribusiness in northern Victoria. The oldest of these irrigation systems was built in 1886, and this is the first time that we have seen them unable to deliver the basic water right; this has occurred over the last few years. Unfortunately, annual rains are needed to fill farm dams as well as irrigation infrastructure dams, such as the Eildon, the Eppalock and even the much larger Dartmouth dams. Over generations, these dams have made the Murray and Goulburn irrigation areas the food bowl of Australia.</para>
<para>Much has been said in recent days about the need to increase the government’s response to this natural disaster of drought, which is affecting much of eastern Australia as well as other parts of the country. Let me put on the record that so far the Commonwealth government has committed more than $60 million in the Murray electorate alone. This has been for both irrigation and dryland farmers, from dairy farmers through to livestock producers and those involved in cropping. Over 2,500 families have received the exceptional circumstances payments—and some are now into their third year. In addition to those on exceptional circumstances payments, there is also the Farm Help program. This program has filled the gap where, unfortunately, the state government has refused to declare drought, which is the entry point for the commencement of negotiations where exceptional circumstances are considered warranted. The threshold entry requirement for consideration of exceptional circumstances for drought relief is that state agreeing that there is, in fact, a drought.</para>
<para>In Victoria, the state government initially offered $20,000 per farm in areas that the government had declared drought affected. When this was enthusiastically taken up by farmers, alarm bells rang in the Treasury of the Victorian Bracks-led government. Ironically coinciding with the re-election of the Bracks government, the $20,000 per farm grant ceased. Across the electorate of Murray a very small proportion were able to access the state funds. The majority were not able to receive a drought declaration for their area from the Bracks government—which would have left the state embarrassed because no $20,000 was then on offer—and this stymied their capacity to apply for exceptional circumstances funding.</para>
<para>We also have the problem of a significant difference in irrigation systems across the electorate. Those on the Murray system continued to receive 100 per cent water right whereas those on the Goulburn system received substantially less in the way of water right. I commend the Commonwealth government for changing the way that farmers could assess their eligibility for exceptional circumstances and for allowing farmers to model forward into future years so that different irrigation systems could be worked into exceptional circumstances payment consideration.</para>
<para>I also commend the Commonwealth government for an extraordinary program called Drought Force. This was derived from the Work for the Dole concept. It was understood that one of the biggest impacts of the severe drought would be the loss of the next generation of farmers to city work. There were farmers who were unable to pay their farm labour, often their sons and daughters who were in the process of taking over the farm, because of the lowered income as a result of the drought. The Drought Force program enabled those sons, daughters and other farm workers to access the newstart allowance while they returned to the properties they had been forced to leave. They could then work at least 2½ days per week on the farm and they could volunteer for more work if they wished. They were eligible for the Work for the Dole training component but they were not required to actively look for other work. Drought Force allowed farm workers to stay on properties in drought affected regions, thereby maintaining the work force that is so essential. One of the myths about droughts is that farmers somehow have less work to do because their crops are not growing or their livestock has been sold. To the contrary: in drought, there is daily feeding of livestock and, more than ever before, farm maintenance must be continued as natural systems wind down.</para>
<para>Drought Force has given more than 150 individuals in the Murray electorate a capacity to stay on the land and it has helped drought affected farm owners. The government’s expectation and hope is that, when the drought does break, that farm work force will be in place to resume the work that they had done before. I commend the Howard government for the very swift response to this loss of work force in rural areas with this innovative and most humane use of the newstart allowance, very appropriately applied to people in rural and regional areas.</para>
<para>I want to look at another way of drought-proofing properties, which in arid regions now also often suffer from severe soil erosion and the loss of remnant vegetation or indigenous vegetation and where weeds and feral animals are putting additional pressure on the remaining native vegetation. Payments for ecosystem services, also sometimes known as environmental services, can help protect these environments. It is acknowledged that, on privately owned properties, farmers not only produce food and fibre for the domestic and export markets but also, as part of their farm work or agribusiness production, produce ecosystem services for the public good. These ecosystem services may include such things as managing the water table by keeping vegetation in place on the groundwater accession areas that are vulnerable. They may include feral animal and weed control to retain native vegetation, which in turn helps to protect water quality. These ecosystem services include soil erosion work and the maintenance of urban water supply catchment areas. There is a whole range of ecosystem services that agribusiness delivers and supplies to the broader population.</para>
<para>Through the Natural Heritage Trust, there have been at least three pilot programs in Australia—I should call them ‘beyond pilot’ programs—with very successful applications of the ecosystems service process. These have occurred in the north-east of Victoria, in Gippsland, and in the Mootwingee area of New South Wales. Property owners have had to tender to supply services which would deliver the ecosystem benefits that have been identified by catchment management authorities or other cross-management agencies. The tender processes ensure value for money, and agribusiness owners have had to identify how they can maintain the ecosystems on their properties cost-effectively.</para>
<para>Across parts of Australia where the droughts have been so severe—where there is a likelihood, with climate change potential in the future, for climates to be even more arid and for higher temperatures to prevail—there may be even more need for this environmental service or ecosystem service payment to farmers, who can manage all or part of their property for active food and fibre production and can, on other parts of that property, deliver ecosystem services to the broader Australian society. This would sustain the environment and keep the populations in place so that in small towns and regional cities the social services and community of interests are retained. There would not be the growing internal migration because rural families have lost heart. State governments would not be required to maintain this land that has been degraded or is under threat. The best people to do that work are those with a love of this same land, who often have intergenerational experience. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—During question time today I posed a question to the Prime Minister about the inequity of the government’s budget tax cuts. In response to the point I was making the Prime Minister turned to his backbench and started pointing towards backbenchers who represent low-income electorates and indeed represent electorates that are experiencing an infrastructure crisis. I said by way of interjection that I looked forward to them making their contribution on this budget debate and I looked forward to seeing first-hand whether they were prepared to defend Peter Costello’s last budget.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I thought the member for Murray for a while was going to prove me wrong. I thought she was going to stand and defend this budget. I listened very carefully for 20 minutes. I heard her talk about private-public partnerships, which I do not deny are very important. I heard her talk about drought, something that did not even rate a mention in this budget at this critically dry time. We are hearing something about it this week, apparently, after the event, but there was nothing in this budget on much-needed assistance for drought-affected farmers. She made no attempt to defend the tax cuts. The phrase ‘tax cuts’ barely passed her lips, if at all. I am giving her the benefit of the doubt, because I was distracted at one point in her speech when she may have mentioned tax cuts, but of her 20 minutes there is no way that she committed any substantial amount of time to defending the tax cuts of John Howard and Peter Costello.</para>
<para>So I look forward to other members, particularly those representing rural and regional electorates, coming into this place. We are going to set a little test for them. It is a pretty easy one. We want them to come in here and do two things: we want them to defend or, otherwise, criticise the proportion of tax cuts going to people in their electorate and we want them to tell us whether they think it was appropriate that Australia’s infrastructure crisis should have been ignored in this budget.</para>
<para>Of course, I am delighted that the member for Paterson will be following me in this debate. Only one thing could have made me happier—that is, of course, if I were following him. I lay down this challenge, and he gets an early opportunity to meet that challenge. I want the member for Paterson, who represents an electorate where the average taxpayer will get a $6 tax cut out of this budget—</para>

<para>—I will take the interjection—I was only hoping. The member for Paterson asked me about my coalminers. Let me talk to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, about my coalminers. My coalminers can earn up to $100,000 a year. It is not all that unusual. Those same coalminers, of course, have been carrying the burden of a superannuation surcharge that the member for Paterson’s government introduced about eight years ago. Let me make this point: you do not need to raise the threshold for the top marginal tax rate in this country to $125,000 to help my coalminers. This is the point the Labor Party is making: we believe that while the government is awash with money off a minerals boom and the best terms of trade in 50 years it should be handing some money back to hard-working taxpayers.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>We support tax relief for the top end of town, for middle-income earners and for those on lower incomes. What we do not support is tax relief biased towards the higher income scales. We know why we got that result. It was because the Treasurer and the Prime Minister sat down in the Lodge and decided that the best way to deliver unfair tax cuts was in the first year of the new parliament. That is why the decision was taken, that is why we are in here having this debate today and that is why we will be back here tomorrow arguing and debating the merits of the government’s tax package as opposed to the alternative proposal that the Labor Party have put forward as a means of showing what we would have done on Tuesday night, 10 May, if we had been in government.</para>
<para>The challenge I lay down to the member for Paterson is a simple one: I want him to get up in this place and defend the tax cuts and their unfairness and the fact that he will be getting a tax break worth $80 a week come 1 July 2006. It will be $80 for Bob Baldwin—</para>

Remember this: a taxpayer in his electorate with a mortgage of $200,000 is already paying $8 more each week as a result of the interest rate increase the Reserve Bank imposed on the Australian electorate in March. And this is from a government which effectively won an election on the question of interest rates. The Prime Minister toured the member for Paterson’s electorate and said, ‘You vote for me and interest rates will remain where they are.’</para>

<para>—There is already an additional $8 a week needed by people in the member for Paterson’s electorate who have a $200,000 mortgage, so the $6 is already gone—and, as we know, backed up by some of the country’s most senior economists, including Saul Eslake at the ANZ Bank, the tax cuts and the way in which they have been delivered are likely to force interest rates up further. If they go another 25 basis points, the constituents of the member for Paterson will have to find another $8 or more—those constituents who he is expecting will be joyous because they have received a $6 tax cut. This, of course, is in addition to the rising price of petrol, the rising cost of private health insurance premiums and the government’s backdown on the Medicare safety net. It goes on and on and on. I remind the member for Paterson, who was an enthusiastic supporter of the GST, that his constituents on average are now paying $88 a week in GST.</para>

<para>—I will give the member for Paterson a hand. The point he is trying to make is that he was not in this place in the lead-up to the introduction of the GST. His big point here is that he was not here to vote for it because, for a little while, the electorate was awake to him and threw him out! The fact is that, back in his electorate, of course he campaigned in favour of a GST.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Let me recap: a tax cut of $6 a week; $8 already gone in the first interest rate rise, with another one coming; an increase in private health insurance premiums; petrol prices up; a backflip on the Medicare safety net—you name it. So here is the challenge for the member for Paterson. I will be waiting. I think I will stick around while he explains to his constituents why these tax cuts are fair and why his electorate was dudded in the area of infrastructure reform. I might return to a couple of those issues before I finish tonight. There are a couple of local issues that I suspect the member for Paterson may be talking about a little later—issues that I know he is very good at gilding the lily on. I might beat him to that opportunity.</para>
<para>This budget generally, which members like the member for Paterson are not prepared to defend, is a missed opportunity. This is a government awash with money—a government raising $93 billion annually more than the Keating government did in its last budget year. In fact, if you add the GST, which the government does not like to do, it is around $130 billion. This government is raising twice as much as the Keating government did in its last year in office. I will make this point about the GST: the government says that the GST goes to the states, so it is not booked into its accounts. What a silly proposition. The government no longer gives general purpose grants to the states—the GST replaced them. So of course the GST should be counted within the government’s revenue.</para>
<para>So, awash with money from the minerals boom, the government had a one-off opportunity to really make a difference and to consolidate the opportunities it has been provided—opportunities that commenced four years before it took office. The foundation for them was laid down by the former Labor government but, alas, the Treasurer passed up the opportunity. Rather, he chose to go the low road with his Prime Minister and pitch to the electorate as they fight out their battle over leadership in this country.</para>
<para>I want to say something that I said during the MPI debate last week. With respect to what we should have seen in this budget, there are at least six points about which there could be no disagreement in this place. The first is that we need a real plan to address the ageing population issue in this country and our national savings shortfall. The second is that we do have an infrastructure crisis. No-one needs to take my word for that—turn to the IMF, the Reserve Bank and other respected organisations and they will tell you the same. The third is that this country is desperately in need of a tax reform project, but one that improves the efficiency of our tax system, not one that just unfairly hands out interest rate pressure and tax cuts to the rich.</para>
<para>The fourth point is that there are a range of variables putting pressure on interest rates in this country. The fifth is that we are experiencing a skills crisis. Very little about that was addressed in the budget. The sixth is that we have a growing number of people on DSP in this country—and too many sole parents relying on welfare—and we do need to be extending a hand to those people. We do need to be addressing that problem, but it has to be done so that it is about an investment in those people—providing them with the tools they need to get back into work. What is needed in the case of DSP is more occupational therapy, of course, along with opportunities to travel to work and training in skills that match job opportunities. Those are the things that the government needs to invest in, and the same applies to sole parents.</para>
<para>Alas, we saw no plan to address the savings shortfall. We got no real tax reform. We saw nothing done on infrastructure and skills. We saw the temperature on interest rates turned up, rather than seeing it turned it down. And, instead of extending that warm hand to those who are stuck on welfare, more often than not through no fault of their own, the government got out the big stick. That was the only solution that John Howard and Peter Costello could find to those very serious problems.</para>
<para>Let me go through each of those in a little bit more depth. I think it was three years ago now that the Treasurer commissioned the <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational report</inline>. The clear message from that report was that we were in crisis in this country with respect to the ageing of our population and the burden that that was going to put on Commonwealth resources in the out years. But since that <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational report</inline> we have had nothing but rhetoric from this government. We have had rhetoric and press releases in response to that <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational report</inline>. We thought we would get a plan; we got media releases.</para>
<para>What we did get was a future fund. Many of us thought that that future fund might be about addressing the problems of national savings and the ageing of the population. But all that that future fund turned out to be was a liability offset fund, a fund to use today’s tax contributions to pay for the Commonwealth’s obligations of tomorrow—and there is a serious question of intergenerational equity in that regard. If the government really did want to return to the taxpayer some of the money it has been getting into its coffers, it could have considered doing it in the form of savings rather than cash. Our real future fund in this country is what we call occupational superannuation, another Labor achievement. It is stuck at nine per cent. It is inadequate, and it is something this government should be working on—but it is simply not prepared to do so.</para>
<para>The second point I made related to infrastructure. I have made the point that all the appropriate bodies—the most highly regarded industry groups, economists and international organisations—recognise that we have real capacity constraints in our economy. The government chose to do nothing about that but now, when they have been caught short, they have come up with a plan. They have said on infrastructure: ‘What is most visible to people out there watching the six o’clock news?’ And of course the answer is ships waiting off the port. Everyone has seen a photo or a bit of footage of a ship waiting off a port. And John Anderson has worked out something else: ‘If we focus on ports, we can blame the states.’ That is something we see on a daily basis from this government—</para>

</talker>
<para>—and, I must say, something we see even more regularly from the member for Paterson, who spends all of his time in his electorate blaming the state government for every problem his constituents experience. So John Anderson has said: ‘We’ll go for the ports. People will understand that. We can blame the states, so we’ll say that we’ll take over the regulation of the ports.’</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Let me pose the question: what does taking over the regulation of the ports mean? There is only one thing that can mean, and that is that the Commonwealth wants to take over the regulation of the prices the monopolists who operate and own the ports charge their end users. If that is the answer, the only conclusion you can draw is that John Anderson and the member for Higgins, the Treasurer, believe that these monopolists should be able to charge more. If this is their approach now, and if this is what we can expect from the infrastructure committee involving Max Moore-Wilton and others, then the message from the government is that, whether they be pipeline monopolists, port monopolists, airport monopolists or any other type of monopolists, we have to let them charge more so they can reinvest in the economy. That is rubbish, and the Labor Party will stand by the consumer and make sure that, in this country, competition will determine price wherever it can and where it cannot, because of a natural monopoly, a fair deal will be struck to determine what prices those monopolists should be allowed to charge.</para>
<para>The third thing I said is that this country needs a tax reform project. I do not want to get bogged down on this, because I spoke about it during the MPI debate last week and the Leader of the Opposition has canvassed the tax cuts stuff very widely. We have been running it in question time, and the member for Lilley, the shadow Treasurer, has touched on it again this evening. I simply make the point again that it is unfair that the member for Paterson should get an $80-odd a week tax cut while people in his electorate on average incomes get a $6 a week tax cut. I made the point in question time today that there are only five electorates for which it is not true that average income earners only get $6, and they are the electorates of Higgins—the Treasurer’s electorate—Bradfield, North Sydney, Warringah and one other which escapes my mind. We want tax reform in this country, not tax cuts which are biased towards higher income earners.</para>
<para>I am not going to go through the fourth, fifth and sixth points again. I canvassed them in the MPI and I am going to run out of time. I want to return to the member for Paterson, most importantly. I want to turn to the impact of this budget, most of the points I have made and how they relate to the Hunter region. The Hunter region was dudded in this budget. The Treasurer came into the Hunter region last Tuesday and did a very good thing. He raised some money for Hunter Medical Research, and I congratulate him for that and I congratulate the member for Paterson for facilitating that fundraising luncheon. But my criticism lies in the fact that, while he was in the Hunter, the Treasurer could have taken the opportunity to visit more broadly—to talk to some of the business and social welfare groups, for example—and explain to the broader electorate why we missed out on funding for the F3 freeway link; why Wheatleys Drive missed out on funding again; why the government is not prepared to do something for one of our most important educational institutions, the University of Newcastle; and why the Muswellbrook bypass is incapable of securing some money.</para>

Labor committed to it 10 years ago, before we left office, so it has been 10 years in the making. There was $22 million last year but it disappeared this year. And what did the member for Paterson do? He blamed the state for not drawing up the plan. Yet the day before that he issued a media release saying ‘Preferred option adopted for Wheatleys Drive’. In it he claimed that everything is bedded down and the design has now been embraced. Of course the plan is done; that is the only way the design can be embraced.

I would remind the House that in 1996 when we came to power there was a $96.2 billion debt left to every man, woman and child in this country by the Labor government. In our first year we paid off $8.4 billion. In 1997-98 we paid off $7.3 billion; in 1998-99, $6.9 billion; in 1999-2000, $6 billion; in 2000-01, $4.8 billion; in 2001-02, $4.2 billion; in 2002-03, $3.6 billion; in 2003-04, $2.9 billion; and, in 2004-05, $2.4 billion.

<para>I was surprised to hear my colleague the member for Hunter stand up and say, ‘This is a government awash with money.’ How can you be awash with money when you are carrying a debt? You have to pay your debts off. The one thing the Labor Party never learnt from all their time in government is that debts must be paid off, yet here they are lecturing us about financial responsibility! We will continue, and we will pay off the debt left to this country by the Labor Party.</para>
<para>The solution for the Labor Party to every problem that is raised is that they would give more tax breaks, more money for education, more money for health and more money for roads. There is not a problem that they will not throw more money at. They have to develop financial responsibility and an understanding that the income purse is only one size. It must be divided up but, importantly, to have strong growth in your economy and to have stable interest rates you need to be able to manage your budget properly and produce the results that lead to that.</para>
<para>This budget will deliver some $21.7 billion in tax cuts over the next four years. It will reduce the 17 per cent tax rate to 15 per cent from 1 July and this will continue. Importantly, this is a budget that will reduce business taxes. It will also increase the number of deductible items for small business. Small business is the very heart of our economy in this country. Reducing the three per cent tariff applying to business inputs where no substitutable goods are manufactured in Australia will remove some $1.3 billion in burden over five years.</para>
<para>I am very proud of this budget. This budget also injects $45 billion in 2005-06—$45 billion higher than the $20 billion when we came to government 10 years ago—into our health system. Dementia is a terrible condition—a condition that affects many people in this House through their friends and their relatives. I am glad the government is investing $321 million to make dementia treatment a national priority, including 2,000 dedicated places to provide high level care in their own homes for people with dementia.</para>
<para>There are many more exciting things in our budget but time does not allow me to go into those tonight. We have heard a lot of rhetoric from the state government of New South Wales—from Bob Carr, Michael Egan and his replacement, Andrew Refshauge. They have continually told us they are being dudded by the Commonwealth government. When this government came to office in 1996, the state government of New South Wales received $4,688 million in general purpose payments and $5,882 million in specific purpose payments, giving them a total grant from the federal government of $10,570 million.</para>
<para>That is a lot of money but, to show that New South Wales is a progressive and growing economy, that has grown. This year it will receive $10,426.7 million in GST income, taking the general purpose payments to $10,692.9 million with a further $8,515.6 million and a total income from the federal government of $19,208.5 million—an increase of $8.6 billion, nearly doubling the amount of money provided to the state government of New South Wales since 1996. But the questions that I have to ask are: have services in New South Wales doubled? No. Has the cost of wages in New South Wales doubled? That answer is no, so we cannot blame it on the increase in payroll for the bureaucracy.</para>
<para>There has been incredible waste by the New South Wales government. The New South Wales government have misappropriated money in that they have not managed their economy properly. There is a document that has been produced by the New South Wales opposition called the ‘Waste O Meter’. I will come to more of this in a minute, because I want to go through the good points that were announced in this budget.</para>
<para>In the time leading up to the election I campaigned for a Medicare office for Forster Tuncurry, a relatively isolated community. It is a fair haul up to Taree to the local Medicare office. There are not many doctors that bulk-bill. I was glad during the election campaign to be able to announce that we would be establishing a Medicare office there and, more importantly, in this budget we will see around $500,000 go towards the establishment of a Medicare office in the Forster Tuncurry region. I understand that locations in the region are being considered at present. Also importantly, and as a promise of this government, the after hours GP services will attract $58.2 million over four years from 2005-06, and the Hunter after hours GP services had their contract extended to June 2006.</para>
<para>Defence is an important employer in my electorate, through RAAF base Williamtown. In this financial year we will invest $27.5 million in the base facilities and for their upgrading as part of a $129.2 million redevelopment of the base to get it ready for the introduction of the airborne early warning and control aircraft. Some of the works that will be completed are the AEWAC hangar, taxiway widening and base engineering. There will also be general repairs done to the existing aircraft shelters. As we move on in time and get ready for it, we are looking forward to the location of the Joint Strike Fighter at Williamtown and to the further investment that that will bring not just in base facilities but also in an upgrading of skills in our region.</para>
<para>I campaigned long and hard during the election campaign on roads. It is a sad fact that people die on roads for a range of reasons. The poor state of roads generally does not help. Back in 2001 I campaigned for the Bucketts Way, and this federal government committed $20 million. This is the third year of funding with $5.9 million to be spent in 2005-06, bringing the total spend at the end of this financial year to $15.9 million. Some of the works that will be carried out are upgrades of the work north of Booral and the road leading up to Limeburners Creek Bridge and several upgrading projects between Gloucester and Taree, including work on the approaches to the north and south of Kundibakh Creek bridges.</para>
<para>Work that was carried out in 2004-05 included upgrading near Belbora and Bakers Hill, north of Wellard’s Lane to the Jacks Road intersection, south of Gloucester on Lemon Grove Road north to the bridge and south of Booral; upgrades on Stroud Road, Alderly Creek and Wards River; and replacement of the south and north Kundibakh Creek bridges. Prior to that, in 2003-04, we saw a replacement of Cromarty Creek Bridge and upgrading near the Wards River section, Lamans Creek in Stroud, Dog Trap Creek and north of Stroud Road. So there is a fair investment.</para>
<para>My colleague the member for Hunter raised the issue of Weakleys Drive, which is a saga that has been going on for 10 years. My colleague also raised the issue of infrastructure. Weakleys Drive crosses the very busy New England Highway. But the Weakleys Drive interchange was always meant to connect to the link road. There was a 5½-year delay by the state government in building their link road for the flyover to go into, so it was pretty hard to build a flyover with nowhere to go—it dropped off into a marsh. So that road was built, and then two years ago we committed money. The New South Wales government have asked for around $1.5 million dollars per year for the last two years for planning and surveying; they have consumed around $2 million and have not advanced the cause any more than putting an option plan forward. My colleague the member for Hunter said they had finished all the designs. It is amazing that the RTA this year requested only $5 million because, according to them, they have not done the designs, they have not finalised the land acquisition and they will not be ready to go to tender until mid-2006. That is the reason why the money is not there, yet Michael Costa, the roads minister for New South Wales, beat his hairy cheat and said, ‘We want the funding and we want it in full.’ But there was no point in giving it to him earlier, because he could not spend it. The RTA will not be ready to go to tender until nearly the time of the budget next year. This roadwork is extremely important; it will remove three sets of traffic lights along the highway. But Michael Costa is a minister who is obviously led by the RTA; he does not run the RTA—he is led by it.</para>
<para>During the election I also promised $10 million for local road funding. I was very glad to see last Tuesday, budget night, the government’s commitment of $10 million for roads in Dungog, Port Stephens and the Great Lakes Shire being established. There is $2 million for the Lakes Way roadworks around the Pacific Palms and Seal Rocks turn off, and there is $8 million for main road 301, from Dungog to Raymond Terrace, and main road 101, from Dungog to Maitland. We have heard that the state government has had its budget from the Australian federal government increased from just over $10 billion to around $19 billion. But we have learnt our lesson. When we put up the $20 million for the Bucketts Way we expected that any responsible state government with a responsibility for that road would also contribute funding. But no—the state government cut the funding out. They are not serious about safety on roads. So this time we have said that the $10 million Commonwealth contribution must be matched by the state government. I am hoping that Steve Low, the Mayor of Dungog Shire, or John Chadban, the Mayor of Great Lakes, or indeed Craig Baumann, the Mayor of Port Stephens, will take the argument up to the state government and ask them to deliver funding.</para>
<para>Funding on roads has been extremely important to this government, as is shown by our Roads to Recovery funding over the past four years. In the previous program Dungog received $1.437 million and in the new programs will receive $1.423 million. This year’s allocation will be another $355,752. Gloucester, in the previous allocations, received $1.417 million and in the next four-year projection will receive $1.414 million. In this financial year it will receive $353,689. Great Lakes Council received just over $2.3 million in the previous four years. Under the current program it will receive $2.4 million; this year it will receive $617,602. Maitland received $1.8 million in the previous four years. In the next round it will receive $1.89 million; this year it will receive $473,678. Port Stephens Council, which received $1.8 million in the previous four years, will receive in this round $1.85 million; importantly, this financial year, it will receive $462,971.</para>
<para>This is money that those councils did not have before, money to be spent on very worthwhile roads and in fixing up roads that otherwise they might not have had the financial ability to get to for quite some period of time. In addition to that, a program cut out by the Labor government, prior to 1996, was for black spot funding. Our government then, under the leadership of the transport minister John Sharp, reinstituted the black spot funding, and we will spend an extra $45 million a year on the black spot program in 2005-06, as well as an extra $45 million a year in 2006-07 and 2007-08. To give an idea of how much impact this has had in my electorate, since 1996 Dungog has received $360,000, Gloucester $910,000, Great Lakes $6,277,000, Maitland $974,457 and Port Stephens $1.17 million, giving a total black spot funding of $9,691,457.</para>
<para>The biggest road that goes through my electorate is the Pacific Highway. In 1996 Prime Minister John Howard committed the Australian government to supporting the state government highway from duplication from Hexham to the Queensland border by 2016. We have already committed $600 million to 21 upgrading projects as a part of the $2.2 billion jointly funded 10-year Pacific Highway upgrade program, which commenced in 1996. In 2005-06, the Australian government is providing $40 million, which is the final instalment under the current 10-year agreement. This will bring the Australian government’s total expenditure over the 10 years to $656 million. As we move to AusLink an additional $480 million will be invested over the three years from July 2006 to June 2009, and further government funding will be provided beyond this five-year project.</para>
<para>Some examples of the work that has been done are the Raymond Terrace bypass, costing a total of $78.1 million, of which the federal government kicked in $18.6 million; Wang Wauk to Bundacree Creek, costing $21 million, of which the Australian government kicked in $8.26 million; the Karuah bypass, costing $123 million, of which the Australian government committed $50 million; Bulahdelah to Coolongolook, a massive piece of road infrastructure, costing $145.7 million, of which the Australian government contributed $66.68 million; and Coolongolook to Wang Wauk, costing $49.2 million, of which the Australian government contributed $24 million.</para>
<para>Currently we have under way section 1 of Karuah to Bulahdelah—in fact, it is only to Viney Creek—costing a total of $114 million. The Australian government is committing $53 million to that project. And there is Bundacree Creek to Possums Brush, costing a total of $115 million. The Australian government is contributing $57.6 million.</para>
<para>As I said earlier, the Australian government has increased the amount of money that it has given to the state government from $10.5 billion to $19.2 billion. But we have seen massive waste by the Carr government, which does nothing but bleat. I will give a couple of classic examples. In 2003-04, it spent $5.9 million on media monitoring. That would have paid for 60 per cent of the road commitment that we asked for for the roads in Dungog and the Great Lakes shires. And there is the Pacific Highway upgrade blow-out. The Carr government talks about its contribution. The blow-out over-cost is $939 million since March 2003. What about the write-off at the Allandale Aged Care Facility, which is in the electorate of the member for Hunter and which he was so silent about—a write-off of $30 million. What about the $21 million for the aborted Austeel project cost? That is $51 million, which would have built a nice high school at Medowie. It would have also upgraded the polyclinic at Nelson Bay—perhaps even helped the state government lease the beds at the Cape Hawke hospital, to provide facilities for my constituents up there.</para>
<para>But no! The Carr government goes on a rampant spending spree. As I said, its budget from the Australian government has nearly doubled. The services to the people in New South Wales have diminished. Let me say one thing. Every time we see Bob Carr announcing that he is opening a new hospital ward, the question we have to ask is: ‘How many beds did you shut down in the preceding 12 months?’ He opens 100 but fails to tell us that he closed 300 or 400 beds in the same year.</para>
<para>Just the political advertising of the Carr government on the Commonwealth Grants Commission was $880,000. That would have paid for another extension on Medowie Road’s dirt section. Their botched police infringement management processing system, which they moved to Maitland, amounted to $41 million, which would have well and truly paid for highway upgrades through the Bucketts Way to its full commitment.</para>
<para>There was the state debt recovery where they wrote off $61 million. Mr Deputy Speaker, $61 million is a lot of money. That would have employed a lot of doctors and nurses. Our health system in New South Wales is in crisis. What about the Department of Health? Just the Newcastle strategy blow-out was $60.7 million. There is a list here that goes on to name $5.1 billion worth of waste by the New South Wales government. Nobody—not the media—is holding them to account. Only John Brogden is doing that, but he is at times unable to get his message out because obviously the media do not like going against one of their former colleagues.</para>
<para>What we have to say to Bob Carr is this: ‘Stop bleating about your misfortunes on the GST; accept the fact that you are getting nearly double the budget you received in 1996; and get on with the job of managing New South Wales.’</para>

</talker>
<para>—In addressing <inline ref="R2335">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2005-2006</inline> and related bills, I suppose it is really not so much a question of what is in the bills as a question of what should be in the bills. At a time when this government is sailing on the back of a once-in-a-lifetime economic boom built on the resources sector and unprecedented Asian growth, especially in China, I contend that the government is squandering the opportunity to address the big issues facing the nation. Those issues are skills and training, infrastructure, and innovation for the future. It is about productivity and how we lift our game in a tough international environment.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>These issues and real capacity constraints for the resources sector, the sector that is underpinning Australia’s economic performance today, are the real challenges that will confront our nation in the immediate future. As I have said previously in this place, over the decade to 2003-04 the value of exports from the minerals and energy sector grew by an outstanding 95 per cent. This reflects just how important the sector is to Australia’s export performance and overall economic performance. In fact, 26 per cent of Australia’s total exports now come from the resources and energy sector. In addition, the sector contributes $34 billion gross value added, contributes 4.6 per cent to Australia’s total GDP, and contributes over $4 billion to government revenue through royalties alone. I therefore believe it is important that we as a nation keep this sector healthy. The problem is that this government is, alternatively, ignoring the critical issues which are holding back the sector’s growth and wellbeing.</para>
<para>The government deserves to be condemned for failing to invest in skills development and infrastructure, in flagrant disregard of repeated warnings from a variety of institutions. Those warnings about chronic skill shortages and infrastructure bottlenecks have come from such respected institutions as the OECD, the Reserve Bank and industry peak bodies. It is also fair to say that some private sector operations have contributed to their own difficulties with the skill shortage. This failure is making Australia less attractive to global capital and less competitive as an investment location.</para>
<para>These are very serious issues. We compete in a tough global environment. We have to make sure that our economic framework is at all times attractive to investment. I mention issues concerning the companies of global importance in the resource sector. I am talking about companies such as Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton, Anglo, and Xstrata, who unfortunately, at this point, cannot meet market demand in China or India. I am talking about them meeting market demand for resources from their Australian investments. If they cannot meet those market demands because of labour shortages, slow approval processes or infrastructure bottlenecks in ports, water supply, telecommunications or rail, the trouble is that those economies will not wait for Australian capacity to catch up. If we do not grab these opportunities for exports now, we will never get them back. That also reflects the fact that we as a nation have failed to see this growth in demand coming and failed to put decisions in place some years ago to enable us to meet this potential growth in demand. I think it is fair to say that we have sat idly by. Now we are trying to belatedly address our capacity constraints in skills and infrastructure, I suppose, in an unfortunate endeavour by the Commonwealth government to duck-shove its responsibilities and blame state and territory governments.</para>
<para>In terms of these global companies, you must also understand that, if we do not get our house in order, they are not going to wait for Australia. We are talking about major global companies. They have no particular attachment to Australia or to any other nation for that matter. They will therefore move their investment capital somewhere else in the world, somewhere without capacity constraints and somewhere from which they can supply the market unconstrained. That is where Australia is falling down at the moment.</para>
<para>Potentially this means that Australia’s future share in the global trade in resources will be diminished, not just in the near term but for the decades over which these investments will be matured. The risk is that Australia’s resources, in terms of resource demand, will be delayed because of a lack of development, possibly for decades. Unfortunately, I dare to suggest to the House that in some instances, some resources may end up economically stranded forever—lost opportunities for this and subsequent generations. The end result is that our share in global trade in resources will be diminished and we will never catch up.</para>
<para>Meanwhile, our trade competitors will see large investment inflows that will underpin their future capacity and put them ahead of Australia in the long term. It is a once in a lifetime opportunity that we are unfortunately not grasping with both hands at the moment. Alternatively, the government is squandering a once in a lifetime surge in world economic growth in terms of trade by failing to invest in Australia’s productive capacity—skills, training and infrastructure—to underpin future growth.</para>
<para>It is no wonder, therefore, that the reality is that economic growth is slowing or that the budget predicts a permanent downgrade in the expected future growth rates from 2008-09. It is no wonder that, despite the extraordinary surge in trade to the best level in 50 years, Australia has experienced the longest run of trade deficits in our history. It is no wonder that, despite record demand and record prices, the rate of export growth is just two per cent, down from 10 per cent when the government came to power in March 1996. It is no wonder that Australia’s current account deficit is now 6.5 per cent of GDP—higher than at any point in 50 years. I do not hear the Treasurer talking about that.</para>
<para>This is what happens when you drive the economy with consumption and not productivity. ‘Productivity’ has almost become a lost word in the Treasurer’s vocabulary because he does not think that he has the answer to the challenges confronting Australia. Alternatively, we get debates about cutting the wages of the lowest paid in the community: child-care workers, cleaners, process workers, gardeners and domestics. Cutting their wages is not going to lift our productivity gain. It is about how you invest in the productive elements that drive growth in Australia. I therefore believe that the top priority for this government should be to invest in the machinery of wealth creation and the economy’s supply capacity. As a nation, we should be taking advantage of our good fortune in benefiting from record demand and prices for our resources. We can use these to drive the next round of productivity and participation growth to provide for a competitive sustainable future.</para>
<para>Why is it that at the moment we have severe skills shortages in many occupations which are constraining economic growth, yet we have 2.5 million people who are not participating in the work force as they should be? I remind the House this evening that last year there were nearly 22,000 unfilled vacancies for tradespersons in Australia. Further, it is estimated that skills shortages could cost the Australian economy $9 billion in lost output over the coming decade. But what do we get? The government’s response is a proposal to establish tech schools which will not produce these tradespersons for another four years. Our demand is now. Further, $20 billion worth of major infrastructure and resource projects could be in jeopardy as a result of skills shortages primarily in trades and engineering areas.</para>
<para>The skills shortage across the trades and the professions is a major and serious capacity constraint in the Australian economy. I refer to the budget papers, which say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... there is a risk that the tight labour market could lead to wage increases across the economy that are greater than is justified by productivity growth.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Unfortunately, neither the Commonwealth government nor our businesses are investing enough in education and training, particularly for trade skills. It is about time these organisations and the government understood that trade training is not a cost to running your business; it is an investment in your future. Both the Commonwealth government and the private sector need to be doing more. They urgently need to lift their game on the training front.</para>
<para>In my discussions with the resources sector in recent months, it has annoyed me that the performance of these major resource companies on the trade training front has been mixed. It annoys me more to find that we have major resource companies that have no apprentices on their books at a time when they are riding a resources boom. It is about time that some of these companies did more to protect their future and also guarantee Australia’s potential for further economic growth in the immediate future. It is also not good enough for these bills to cut funding through the Job Network, a program designed to assist Australians back into the work force, while at the same time forcing Australians to look for work. It is about mutual obligation, not about blaming the victims.</para>
<para>In that context we should note that recent OECD research shows that a 10 per cent increase in the average number of years of education of the working age population would increase per capita GDP to between four per cent and seven per cent. Yet according to ACTU research, only one in 10 private sector employers last year delivered structured industry training leading to a national qualification. Moreover, investment in structured training actually fell between 1996 and 2002 from 1.7 per cent to 1.5 per cent.</para>
<para>Why is it that while Australia diversified its exports and expanded its share of world trade in the decade to the mid-1990s, export diversification has been reversing under the Howard government and Australia’s share of world exports has shrunk? Despite the best purchasing power of our exports in more than 30 years, Australia has recorded 41 monthly trade deficits in a row. It is no wonder that that foreign debt truck that the Treasurer used to like to talk about has exploded from $180 billion when the coalition rolled it out in 1995 to $422 billion today. That effectively means that every day—and this is interesting—Australia loses $154 million to foreigners from a current account deficit that is the fourth largest in the world. That is more than $6 million every hour—not an insignificant amount. It really reflects on the government. It establishes beyond any doubt that this policy lazy government’s neglect of exports and failure to invest in Australia’s skills, ideas and infrastructure is putting upward pressure on interest rates and putting Australia into hock as never before.</para>
<para>It is therefore a real risk that the government is being overly optimistic about the size of our export recovery, which is acknowledged by the budget papers:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It seems unlikely that world commodity prices will be sustained at these levels indefinitely ...</para>
<para class="block">…            …            …</para>
<para class="block">The timing and extent of ... such price adjustment is very difficult to predict.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Further, the budget papers say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... there is a risk that Australia’s terms of trade will fall over the medium term from their historical highs in 2005-06. This, in turn, carries significant implications for the budget projections for 2006-07 and beyond ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I raise these issues because we have already heard from the Deputy Prime Minister over the last week that the drought was not factored into the budget forecasts. Indeed he has said that the impact of the drought may knock one per cent off GDP. One per cent off GDP is potentially one-third of the forecast GDP growth for 2005-06, a huge hit for the Australian economy. That also reinforces my very firm view that the government has dropped the ball on economic reform. Instead of investing in productive capacity—key issues such as skills, training and infrastructure—we as a nation are relying on factors beyond Australia’s control. We are in essence relying on record demand and record prices for our commodities to determine our future economic wellbeing. That is just not good enough. You have actually got to try as a nation to shape your future by leading at the highest level, and that is the Commonwealth government.</para>
<para>The area of infrastructure has been subject to a lot of debate in recent months. The government is not listening to the states, industry or exporters. We have got side games. It is not listening to the infrastructure users, owners or operators. Let us take Western Australia, because we need a few examples. Western Australia is one-third of the continent. It produces 30 per cent of the nation’s exports by value and it generates $23 billion in revenue each year for the Commonwealth. One would have thought that, because of the importance of that, the Commonwealth government would engage the Western Australian government in a mature partnership rather than confrontation. But what do we get? Two weeks ago, we got the direct opposite. We saw advertisements in a Western Australian newspaper, paid for by taxpayers, criticising the WA government for not cutting its taxes as required by the GST agreement between the Commonwealth and states—cooperative federalism.</para>
<para>Let us look at the benefits of Western Australia to the Commonwealth and whether or not the Commonwealth ought to be taking a more generous approach to our Western Australian friends. Resource projects on and around the Burrup Peninsula in Western Australia generate $4.5 billion in direct revenue for the Commonwealth government and one-tenth of that for the state of Western Australia. But it is the state, not the Commonwealth, that is investing in productive capacity for the region to the tune of $183 million. They are getting nothing from the Commonwealth government, which gets the benefit of the revenue—not one cent. Instead of dealing with the Western Australian government, the Commonwealth is dealing directly with a long list of failed project developers; that is where the Commonwealth finds itself. Not one cent has been provided by the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth has refused to work with the state.</para>
<para>What is it doing in this area? It is going out and trying to pick winners. It is dealing with companies such as Syntroleum and Methanex, as two examples in Western Australia. We have seen Australian taxpayers lose out because it has picked companies that have failed on the ground to the tune of many millions that will never be recovered. Then we saw Australian Magnesium Corporation, where taxpayers lost $170 million—again a disaster because of the government failing to actually invest in the future. It has been proven in the past that you cannot pick winners. A government that gambles with taxpayers’ money is a government that lacks the maturity to engage meaningfully with the states, territories and industry to work on a common vision for Australia’s future. We need a government that will deliver a transparent resources policy that focuses on nation building and prudent development of Australia’s resources.</para>
<para>Financing and pricing of new infrastructure is a serious debate that needs to take place in the parliament, in the relevant ministerial councils and at COAG. Further, we should not confine our infrastructure discussions to just transport. Demand for energy in Australia is going to go through the roof. It is going to increase by 50 per cent by 2020, and the energy sector has estimated that at least $37 billion in energy investments will be required by 2020 to meet our needs.</para>
<para>COAG has to be given the job of taking the Parer report forward, but it also has to accept that very little has been done to date to act on the Parer report recommendations. Again, it is another example of the Howard government’s approach. The Parer report has some meaningful recommendations. But what do we get? Committee after committee, inquiry after inquiry, task force after task force—almost as if we have got a government driven by trying to find out how to pick up an issue, have an inquiry and then bury it without pursuing any of the recommendations or making some decisions to overcome the problems that led to the original inquiry. I raise the Parer report this evening because that report, by a former member of the government, identified all the deficiencies in our energy markets, but barely—unfortunately, despite all the hard work put into the preparation of the report—have any of its recommendations been implemented. This is significant. Our electricity and gas sectors remain burdened by excessive regulation, overlaps in regulatory roles, slow and cumbersome code change processes, anticompetitive marketing practices, poor market design and poor—if any—planning mechanisms.</para>
<para>It is time for the Commonwealth government to get moving on both the Parer recommendations and the Productivity Commission recommendations. We cannot wait any longer for yet another task force, the government’s normal answer to dealing with difficult issues. We cannot wait for another report that is likely to meet the same fate; that is, to sit on the minister’s desk without action.</para>
<para>I raise these concerns this evening because, as I said at the outset, this is not a debate so much about what is in the budget papers but, more importantly, what should be in the budget papers. From my point of view as the shadow minister for resources and tourism, there are big issues facing Australia at the moment. We have to come to grips with our weaknesses on skills and training, infrastructure and innovation. I commend the second reading amendment to the House. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—It is a great pleasure to rise and speak tonight in support of the appropriation bills and, more particularly, to draw people’s attention to the delicious world of possibilities that this government’s program over the last 9½ years offers our community, and the citizens of the nation more generally, and to talk about some of the specific measures in it that are very supportive of the interests of the Dunkley electorate. This budget is another positive instalment of a journey that began nine years ago. The budget is another example of what has happened over a period of time to overcome many challenges and of how the nation has grown: it has adapted to a changing international and domestic environment, to financial challenges and to changing geopolitical climates.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It has been a dynamic time. Through the government’s leadership and its sound economic management, Australia as a nation today is one that offers a world of opportunities. We are living in a prosperous, peaceful and pluralist country. We have gained an air of maturity about the way we as a nation handle ourselves internationally and some confidence in the goals that we seek to achieve together.</para>
<para>Internationally, we have played a key role in fighting against terrorism; we have managed to sustain growth within a volatile region and with international financial markets presenting more than the odd ill wind over the period; we have been at the forefront of promoting democracy, good governance and peace around the world; we have extended the hand of friendship to our neighbours and allies when they have required assistance; and, given my portfolio interests, I might add that we have seen successive increases in overseas development assistance or foreign aid budgets, showing that our good fortune has been shared to the benefit of those in our region. Domestically, we have presided over the lowest unemployment rates in 30 years and have steered an economy through what I call a golden era, a period of record growth turning around a large budget deficit and debt left by the ALP after years of economic mismanagement and missed opportunity to become a nation with a budget surplus. We have repaid debt, kept interest rates at record lows, sustained low inflation and, above all, delivered efficient and effective government and services.</para>
<para>Ultimately, ordinary Australians like those I represent in Dunkley have been the big winners for the Howard government, and this budget continues that trend. A good economy is important not only for our future opportunities but also for delivering broader prospects for improved living standards and prosperity. This budget is a further instalment on how a good economic climate delivered by the government is delivering benefits for all Australians. The government has delivered another budget that remains in a strong position, with a forecast surplus of $8.9 billion in 2005‑06 building on an exceptional record of economic management over the past nine years.</para>
<para>By taking this approach, the federal government is laying the foundations for our nation to have prosperity for not only years but also decades ahead as we relieve some of the debt and deficit burden that has been imposed on past generations as well as providing generously for important works and services for future generations. Only a strong economy can deliver tax relief. We have heard much discussion in this place about tax relief, a discussion that was not one that was regularly had in this parliament before the election of the Howard government but one that is now a mainstream debate made possible through sound and wise economic management.</para>
<para>The budget also tackles head on the need to provide greater labour force productivity and participation as well as tax cuts. The tax cuts provide a reward for increased endeavour from work and saving and will heighten the incentives for all Australians to make a contribution to their wellbeing and the wellbeing of the nation. From 1 July this year, unless thwarted by the Labor Party, those tax changes will see a reduction in the 17 per cent marginal tax rate to 15 per cent and the 42 per cent threshold will increase to $63,001. Then from 1 July 2006, the 42 per cent threshold will increase again to $70,001 and you will see a change in the top income bracket as well. Dunkley taxpayers will welcome income tax cuts and a generous package of family support programs that will help to ensure that people benefit from the best employment and economic prospects in a generation.</para>
<para>The opposition has committed itself to not support the package of tax breaks in the Senate. It has become apparent that the opposition has adopted a policy of opposition for opposition’s sake or of politics just for politics’ sake, neither of which is in the interests of the people that I represent. I implore the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer to reconsider their position and to realise that the hardworking men and women of Dunkley deserve a tax cut—one that is funded, real and tangible—as it has been proposed by the Howard government.</para>
<para>Another positive sign that this budget recognises is that the rate of national unemployment now stands at a 30‑year low, a generational low for the unemployment rate, and that is extended to the picture in Dunkley. In Dunkley, the unemployment rate now stands at five per cent, down from 6.2 per cent at the same time last year and down a further 3½ per cent from where it was at the time I was elected. For years our electorate has had to face an unemployment rate higher than the national average. We have broken that tradition, and that is an outcome I am very proud of. But it has not happened just by chance. People have worked very hard to achieve that outcome. This budget continues to maintain and sustain a continuing positive economic climate that is ripe for investment, ripe for creating more employment opportunities and ripe for creating an air of optimism and opportunity that inspires people to reach out and be a part of a brighter future.</para>
<para>At a local level, the budget plan is also delivering opportunities. Mornington Peninsula hosts the peninsula campus of Monash University. Through our work and the support of the Howard government, that campus is expanding. It is being revitalised and providing new opportunities with the vision of a health and wellbeing precinct that not only provides economic growth and stimulus and appeals to international students but also enhances the range of tertiary education opportunities readily within reach of those citizens living in Dunkley and the broader Mornington Peninsula.</para>
<para>Our work in improving the infrastructure and facilities at the Chisholm TAFE Frankston campus with the Business Enterprise Centre is another example of how, through sound economic management, we can invest in the tools that provide improved opportunities for the citizens in our region. But even Frankston’s role as a key regional centre is being supported by this economic climate. We are seeing investment, we are seeing new businesses established and we are seeing new facilities such as the Village cinema, which I was happy to attend on its opening night. We have seen a terrific facility out at Karingle Hub.</para>
<para>There was some difference of opinion about the need for a bulky goods zone—not the need itself but where it was located. We had several hundred million dollars of escape expenditure from our region as people left our community to find household and electrical goods in other regions. That has been redressed, and I must say that what is planned for the further expansion of the bulky goods zones on the corner of Cranbourne Road and the end of the freeway is quite an inspirational vision as to how we can ensure that the economic horsepower in our region is delivering economic and employment opportunities for our citizens. After a curious start with that venture, it represents, in the form that I have seen it proposed, a major destination and should attract investment and employment as well as expenditure to our area, which is currently lost through escape expenditure in that category of retail.</para>
<para>The Frankston Visitor Information Centre, a fantastic initiative supported by the Howard government in partnership with the local council and the state government, is starting to take shape. Contracts have been awarded and construction is expected to commence in May. It is an important project and is the only visitor information centre between Dromana and the CBD of Melbourne. There are some 60, probably nearly 70, kilometres of coastline around Port Philip with no visitor information centre. You, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker Somlyay, from that beautiful part of the Sunshine Coast, would know that it is hard to share the joys and the jewels—it is often not wise to leave it to good luck and chance for people to find the jewels of your community, and so is the same for our region. So the visitor information centre is a very exciting proposal and will be an architectural showpiece inviting people not only to learn more about our region but to learn more about the opportunities as a visitor for leisure in our region.</para>
<para>I have said it on the public record and I will say it again: if Frankston is ever to have a safe boat harbour, the current proposal and the planning scheme provisions that have been approved by the state government embody the best chance of seeing that project concluded. It is in an appropriate place and subject to appropriate environmental impact studies and compliance with the land use planning arrangements the state government has put in place. We should give the Frankston Safe Boat Harbour—a project which, in its various guises, has been talked about since I was in short pants—a chance to see whether that project, in the order of $45 million, can embrace the best asset our city and our region has; that is, Port Philip Bay. For too long our city has turned its back on its best asset—the coastal area. Providing appropriate and safe boating facilities that act as a magnet of interest to our region is a vision that we should seek to facilitate. Given the planning parameters that the state government has put in place and the modest funding that seems to be available through the state government, particularly for public infrastructure like the seawall, we need to see whether the private sector can be tantalised to be involved in the financing of that project. We must also ensure that quality is not compromised. If that project goes ahead—and it can only go ahead if it meets the environmental and land use planning requirements that have been set in the planning scheme amendment—it needs to be one of quality so that people are further attracted to our city as a regional destination.</para>
<para>I have already talked about the provincial peninsula. Our landscape values on the Mornington Peninsula will not be preserved by just hoping that that will happen. We need to put in place an arrangement where broadacre property has a viable future, where the landscape values—the wind in your hair, I might say, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker—are preserved and where visiting the Mornington Peninsula is underpinned by viable broadacre land use. I believe we can do a better job of embracing primary production and folding that into the visitor experience, the cultural experience of visiting the fantastic part of Victoria that is the Mornington Peninsula. When people come to enjoy the environmental splendour, the cultural and artistic offerings, the magnificent restaurants, the beaches, the hinterland and the wineries, I hope that, as part of their visit, they will indulge in our natural produce. I hope that they will use all their senses and involve the whole experience of the peninsula. That will support the farming community and primary producers in our region. Every day they feel the pressure of increasing property values as people purchase broadacre property as a lifestyle choice—for recreational and leisure pursuits—at a time when good people with a solid history of very credible primary production are facing increased costs and pressure from land value. That is another area.</para>
<para>I turn now to vocational training. The Australian technical colleges are very appealing to our community, along with school based apprenticeships and the increasing number of apprenticeship starts and conclusions in our area. All of this combines to make sure that our community is vital, vibrant and viable for the longer term. It builds optimism and opportunity, and this budget underpins the foundation preconditions that let our community present that kind of positive picture to the outside world and to itself.</para>
<para>Social cohesion is also a key contributor to the picture of a viable, vibrant and vital community. It is also a key building block of social stability. The budget carries forward some of the early excellent work such as the Communities for Children program, and I am very excited about working with Anglicare to see it implemented in the Karingal, Frankston North and Belvedere Park areas. The Pines Community project is a fantastic initiative that is now looking to see how it can sustain itself into the future. Mentoring to Mobilise is a project where we are partnering with secondary schools in our area to develop workplace know-how for senior secondary students to support, ease and facilitate their transition into the work force. We also have the new Neighbourhoods Nurturing Networks initiative, where we are trying to proactively knit the social fabric in rapidly growing residential areas—houses are popping up everywhere and we know that communities need something other than just built forms in them. What we are trying to do is to get those networks happening that turn a place into a community. That work is being proceeded with through the Coach Mentoring scheme with the Mornington Baptist Community Care group. There is also the Langwarrin Partnership Initiative, the parenting expo I was recently able to open in Mornington, and the Communities that Care initiative in Mornington. That is all happening at a local level at a time when it is also feeding into the national scene.</para>
<para>A key part of this budget is participation, where $3.6 billion has been allocated to support people moving from welfare into work. It is particularly important in our area to make sure that concerns such as intergenerational hardship are tackled head on. That is what this welfare to work initiative addresses. Almost 10 per cent of the population in Dunkley receives either a disability support pension or a parenting payment for a single parent. That is a large proportion of our community. Those people have skills, gifts and capacities that we hope to focus on and encourage the use of while supporting them on DSP and PPS as they return to the work force at an appropriate time. Welfare to Work is more than just helping people with disabilities; it is about helping everybody focus on their abilities and capacities and to support them into work and employment.</para>
<para>It is important to recognise that, from 1 July 2006, people with disabilities who claim the disability support pension will be assessed for the appropriate income support payment. People who can work at least 15 hours a week in the open labour market without ongoing assistance will be assessed as being eligible for newstart allowance or youth allowance. It is also important to recognise that the circumstances of all those who are currently receiving that benefit will not change. But we are signalling that this is an important change, where we are focusing on ability and capacity to contribute; we are not having people focus primarily on misfortune, inability or disability, as the case may be. Where people have that capacity, we are keen to support them back into the work force. It is important to understand that that will not affect people who currently are receiving that benefit—and there appears to be a bit of a misunderstanding about that.</para>
<para>The parenting payment is another important area. We know that single parents do a remarkable job. Few people aim to be a single parent; it usually occurs as a result of circumstance. As I mentioned earlier in this parliament, sadly far too many relationships start with optimistic hopes for the future and end in separation. Almost all single parents I know would rather their circumstances not be those of single parents—and we need to put that on the record. At the moment, under these measures, existing parent payment recipients will not face any changes to their income support. They can remain on the parenting payment until their youngest child turns 16. But, as from 1 July 2006, there will be some changes to the income support and participation arrangements to encourage more parents with school-age children to participate in the work force and to see what other opportunities are available for them rather than to rely on welfare. I hope to talk more about these measures because, again, this is another area where there seems to be some confusion about what those measures represent.</para>
<para>I again draw the House’s attention to our efforts to attract funding for a one-stop, integrated family relationship mediation centre for the greater Frankston-Mornington Peninsula area to help strengthen families, promote positive parenting and support relationships before and after separation. Important and necessary elements of that idea are the availability of services in the southern peninsula area—that was put to us by the councils as we worked through that proposal—that parents always recognise there are legal recourses available to them and that we make sure that people are aware of what they are.</para>
<para>Another encouraging area for our community is health. I particularly want to note the improvement in the bulk-billing rates and the announcement last week of an injection of funds into the after-hours GP service, the medicentre that is co-located with the Frankston Hospital. In the budget, there is a $321 million package to make dementia a national health priority. I am very encouraged by that, particularly with respect to Banksia. The Banksia Centre in our community does a remarkable job in working with dementia clients and their families. The respite program that is provided will be extended and supported by a $400,000 grant from the Howard government. That grant will secure the future of that program and has clearly delighted clients, carers and staff. It will also enable the Brotherhood of St Laurence to develop a purpose-built facility to better cater for the existing and growing demand for respite services.</para>
<para>In the few moments remaining to me, I will point to our work in the area of dementia and high-care veterans. Through their condition, high-care veterans often have memories of war service and circumstances that add to their care needs. I am working hard to ensure that RSL Park in Frankston is resourced to trial and investigate specific care measures that take account of the very particular circumstances of veterans.</para>
<para>In closing, this budget is about opportunity. It is our time as a nation to make the very best of the good fortune we have, and the budget certainly does that. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—This evening I wish to speak on the appropriation bills and to make some comments about John Howard’s 16th budget and Peter Costello’s 10th budget. I do so in my capacity as Labor’s shadow minister for industry and infrastructure. Wearing that cap, there is no better starting point than to associate myself with the second reading amendment, which was moved by Labor’s shadow Treasurer, the member for Lilley. It states:</para>

</quote>
<para class="block">In my capacity as Labor shadow minister for industry and infrastructure, my areas of focus will be skills and infrastructure issues, the risk of higher interest rates, the slowing growth in GDP, our current account deficit, foreign debt, import growth exceeding export growth and the Howard-Costello government’s proposal for a future fund. Regrettably, this budget is a wasted opportunity and it fails to build for our nation’s future productivity needs.</para>
<para>This is a budget off the back of record terms of trade. At the moment we see 30-year historically high record terms of trade; and, with the budget estimates, that will become 50-year historic record terms of trade. We have record high commodity prices. We have record high minerals and petroleum resource exports to China. Off the back of the unexpectedly strong revenue growth which we have from those factors, we find a failure to invest in long-term productivity improvements. The budget fails to invest in the skills of our nation’s work force. It fails to invest in the education and skills of our people. It fails to invest in our national infrastructure. It fails to provide real incentives for reward and hard work, and it does that in the budget in an unfair way. In particular the budget fails to address the concerns of the Reserve Bank that, at this point in the cycle, we need productivity-enhancing reforms to ensure that we relieve upward pressure on interest rates.</para>
<para>To survive as a modern economy, Australia must be internationally competitive. This budget fails to provide the necessary building blocks to enhance Australia’s international competitiveness and to take the Australian economy to the next necessary level of productivity improvement. Labor supports the removal of the three per cent tariff concession scheme impediment on Australian industry, but, other than that, the budget contains nothing new to substantially improve Australian industries’ international competitiveness. The budget fails to deliver any additional, substantial incentive for greater investment in our national innovation, research and development. It fails to provide any additional investment in our national economic infrastructure. Both of those things—infrastructure; and innovation, research and development—are drivers of significant productivity improvement in our national economy.</para>
<para>All of this is a result of the government’s economic complacency. As a result of that complacency, we now grapple with a productivity crisis across our economy. Without that economic complacency, we would not have a skills crisis; it could have been avoided. Without that complacency, we would not have an infrastructure crisis that directly and adversely impacts on our ability to be internationally competitive. As a result of the government’s economic complacency, we now have a record current account deficit. As a result of the government’s economic complacency, we have a stagnant industry export sector.</para>
<para>The budget follows the release of the Australian Industry Group’s performance of manufacturing index, the PMI, which suggests that annual manufacturing growth will be below two per cent, representing non-farm GDP growth of around 2.5 per cent. The budget also follows the 28 April release of the Australian Industry Group’s report <inline font-style="italic">Who’s winning: the shape of global competition</inline>, which pointed out that the government’s economic complacency is hurting Australia’s competitive and trading position. It said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">After holding its export market share roughly unchanged … down to 2001, a sixth of the share at the 1986 starting point has been lost in the last three years … ETM [elaborately transformed manufactures] exports have underperformed major trading partner markets since 2002 … there are also market share losses to imports in the domestic market</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">What has the government done to redress issues such as these? Regrettably the sad truth is, in this budget, very little to nothing. The reality is that the government has taken our international competitiveness for granted. It has lived off 14 years of economic growth, growth which has been a great thing for the nation. When the government came to office in 1996, it was off the back of three years of economic growth which was greater or higher than that of any comparable industrialised country.</para>
<para>The economic growth that we have now seen for 14 consecutive years, which has been throughout the duration of the government’s term in office, was essentially secured by the structural reforms made by the Hawke-Keating governments: changing our nature as a trading nation, opening up our financial services, floating the dollar and ensuring that we changed the composition of our industrial capacity in exports to an export oriented economy. For much of its period in office, the government relied simply on that economic growth, plus—until the last couple of years—a competitive Australian dollar. Now what do we see the government complacently relying upon? The most historically favourable terms of trade, the most historically favourable commodity prices and a booming minerals and petroleum export industry to China. The truth is that, if you replaced historically high terms of trade with average terms of trade and if you replaced historically high commodity prices with average commodity prices, our current account deficit would be closer to 12 per cent than seven per cent. The truth is that, if you replaced the terms of trade as they were when Paul Keating said we were a banana republic, our current account deficit would be closer to 11 per cent than seven per cent, which is where it is now—a record.</para>
<para>Rather than addressing the need for deep reforms to take our nation to the next level of productivity improvement, the government continues to rely on a once-in-a-lifetime surge in world economic growth and terms of trade and commodity prices. But to be competitive into the future the government cannot rely solely on these factors. The Treasury’s own analysis provided in the budget papers identifies a number of risks which threaten our already vulnerable international position, including little progress globally in implementing necessary policy reforms to rebalance the world economy and increasing exposure to a sudden change in investor sentiment, the result of which could lead to ‘an abrupt and disruptive adjustment to exchange rates and interest rates’. The likelihood is that historically high commodity prices are unlikely to persist as world supply expands; therefore, if world demand for commodities were to falter, ‘there is a risk that commodity prices could fall further’ and infrastructure constraints would continue to adversely affect our mining exports.</para>
<para>To be competitive in the future, the government must build our nation’s capacity and our people’s capacity to be internationally competitive. In the current context, this means investment in the education and skills of our people and investment in our nation’s infrastructure. It must do this through building the skills base of Australian employees, fixing our national economic infrastructure and putting in place the right framework to ensure we benefit from the economic dividends that a prosperous and productive Australia can deliver. That means building an integrated national economy that is internationally competitive, innovative and responsive to change.</para>
<para>With record levels of foreign debt and 41 consecutive trade deficits under its belt, the government can no longer afford to be complacent about Australia’s economic sustainability. This makes the fact that the budget contained no substantial investment for Australian industry’s future development all the more galling. It is no secret that the manufacturing sector urgently needs support to boost skills training, encourage innovation, modernise transport infrastructure and build export markets and market share. Yet the budget is silent on these areas. It is silent on innovation and on building incentives to build back our national research and development credentials. There is nothing to bridge the gap between Australia’s research and development and the OECD average, which is something in the order of $5 billion.</para>
<para>As of last year, Australia spent 1.62 per cent of GDP on R&amp;D, significantly below the OECD average of 2.26 per cent. This is a national disgrace, and the blame for it rests squarely with the government’s complacency. Internationally, our ranking does not look any better these days. According to ABS data released in September last year, while gross expenditure on R&amp;D had increased marginally, Australia was still placed 13th of 19 developed countries in total gross expenditure on research and development—or GERD—spending. The ABS report itself made the situation clear:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Australia’s GERD/GDP ratio is low compared with other OECD countries. Australia is ranked below countries such as Finland, Japan, United States of America, Germany and France.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Yet, despite this, the budget contained nothing additional to rebuild Australia’s R&amp;D credentials, nor was there anything to provide incentives for industry to invest in R&amp;D itself. The budget also failed to equip the Australian work force with the necessary skills our industry needs for future ongoing productivity improvements.</para>
<para>Since 1997 vacancies for skilled tradespeople have increased by 72 per cent. According to the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations’s skilled vacancies index, skilled vacancies have increased 1.5 per cent over the last month and two per cent since April 2004. Skilled vacancies in the professions are up 6.2 per cent in the 12 months ending in April 2005. This includes a massive 11.8 per cent increase in science vacancies, a 19.5 per cent increase in health vacancies and a 4.2 per cent increase in building and engineering vacancies. Skilled vacancies in the metal trades were up 13.9 per cent in the 12 months ending in April 2005, while the electrical and electronics trades were up 11.4 per cent over the same period. These figures also reveal that there has been a 72 per cent increase in the skilled vacancy index for total trades since June 1997, including an 81 per cent increase for metal trades, a 43 per cent increase for automotive trades and a 160 per cent increase for construction trades. Despite this, the budget contained nothing new. It contained nothing more than a restatement of the government’s election commitments so far as skills are concerned. This fails to deliver the skills Australian businesses and industry need now.</para>
<para>Moving to infrastructure, most people will recall that in March this year the Reserve Bank of Australia increased interest rates by 25 basis points and gave two reasons for that increase. One was skills shortages putting upward pressure on wages and therefore inflation and the other was capacity constraints caused by infrastructure bottlenecks. Not many people know that since May 2001 the Reserve Bank, either in its monetary statements or quarterly bulletins, has referred to capacity restraints causing difficulties on 11 separate occasions. It was only when the Reserve Bank increased interest rates in March this year that the government started talking about this issue.</para>
<para>Just as the budget is silent on the crucial area of investing in our national industry, so too is the budget silent on investing in our essential nationally significant infrastructure. Of course, this should come as no surprise. Until recently the government refused to even acknowledge that the Commonwealth had an interest in infrastructure—other than in roads, with its inadequate AusLink package. Until recently, infrastructure was simply a matter for the states and roads were solely a matter for the National Party and National Party pork-barrelling.</para>
<para>Until recently the Howard-Costello government refused to acknowledge that the Commonwealth had a role in a coordinated transport policy. It took nearly nine years for it to understand that piecemeal change does not work.</para>
<para>Then, like a bolt out of the blue, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services announces that regulation of the nation’s export ports are to be included in the AusLink package—a package he says on the weekend he has been working on for three to four years. Suddenly, out of the blue, there is a need to expand it to our national ports. AusLink is a package which is now more famous for its $120 million in ministerial discretionary spending than for any attempt at national infrastructure coordination. This was a stellar example of policy on the run—a personal preservation strategy by the Deputy Prime Minister to protect himself against the charge that, under his stewardship, federal government involvement in national infrastructure has fallen to pathetic levels. In making his announcement on the run, the Deputy Prime Minister did not consult the states, the private port operators or the owners, let alone the Prime Minister.</para>
<para>This is a government, of course, that over the past nine years of economic complacency has run down our national investment in the infrastructure needs of our nation. Since 1997, public sector investment, including in infrastructure, has slumped to around 2.2 per cent of GDP, the sixth-lowest of all OECD countries. As I have said, it was only in March, when the Reserve Bank sprung the government for its complacency, by citing infrastructure capacity problems as half the reason for its interest rate increase, that the government finally and reluctantly was forced to address this issue.</para>
<para>The infrastructure needed to support Australia’s future economic growth does not exist and the infrastructure needed to support Australia’s economic growth will not materialise under this government. To survive in a modern, global economy Australia must be internationally competitive. It is essential that the federal government is committed to taking the Australian economy to a new phase of sustained productivity growth. Crucial to this is building world-class infrastructure. Labor has a longstanding commitment to providing national leadership for our infrastructure needs. Labor’s policy approach since 2000 has been the establishment of a nationally led and coordinated authority to work in partnership with the states and territories and industry to identify and achieve the most effective outcomes for our nationally significant infrastructure. That is why the Leader of the Opposition announced in his speech in reply to the budget that Labor in government would establish Infrastructure Australia. Infrastructure Australia will be charged with the responsibility for developing a strategic blueprint and facilitating the implementation of our nation’s infrastructure needs over coming years, in partnership with the states, territories, local government and the private sector.</para>
<para>Infrastructure Australia will be an independent statutory authority that will report to the Commonwealth minister for infrastructure. Infrastructure Australia will present regular reports to COAG, as part of Labor’s plan to make infrastructure a standing item on the COAG agenda. Infrastructure Australia will receive input from the three tiers of government, from the private sector and from the general public, to identify infrastructure projects of national importance. Infrastructure Australia will establish policy guidelines and standardised formats to facilitate consideration of infrastructure proposals and to expedite decision making. Labor’s Infrastructure Australia initiative offers a coordinated and objective approach to the long-term planning and development of nationally significant infrastructure—planning and development our nation desperately needs after nine years of this government’s economic complacency.</para>
<para>Complementary to Infrastructure Australia, Labor will also establish the Building Australia Fund. When the government announced during the 2004 federal election that it would establish a future fund from the proceeds of asset sales and budget surpluses to meet unfunded public sector superannuation liabilities, it justified it on the grounds that public servants’ unfunded superannuation liabilities needed to be offset. Unfunded public sector superannuation liabilities and associated cash flows are already declining as a share of GDP and will fall further once the Public Sector Superannuation scheme closes on 1 July 2005, a decision that has already been made. The government’s future fund simply means locking up surpluses forever, which may well mean higher taxes and/or less spending. Depending on the economic circumstances, that may well mean higher taxation and lower economic growth.</para>
<para>While Labor supports the notion of an intergenerational fund, we do not support the future fund the government is proposing. In contrast to the government, Labor believes the income stream of the fund should be used to enhance the productive capacity of our economy. It is by boosting productivity growth over the long term that Australia will be best able to lock in sustained prosperity. Labor will adopt the same corporate governance arrangements as those for the government’s future fund. A Labor government will set the broad investment mandate for that fund. The fund will be managed by an independent statutory authority, which will set the investment strategy and contract fund management to the private sector. In setting the broad investment mandate, Labor will ask the board to consider the full range of investment opportunities suitable to the risk and return objectives of the fund. Labor envisages that this would include commercially attractive infrastructure investments.</para>
<para>The two proposals announced by the Leader of the Opposition during the budget reply, Infrastructure Australia and the Building Australia Fund, represent a long-term investment in our productive capacity. Australia needs economic reform if, as a nation, we are to go to the next level of productivity improvements. As a nation we need reforms in skills and infrastructure, and we need effective and practical support of our research and development capacity. This budget fails to deliver on all these crucial areas. Instead of addressing these crucial reform priorities, the budget relies on a surge in world economic growth, terms of trade, commodity prices and exports to China of minerals and petroleum resources. That is an insufficient response from a government that for nine years has been a complacent economic manager. Australia needs national leadership. This budget demonstrates again that it will not get it from this government.</para>

<para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2335">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2005-2006</inline> and associated bills, more commonly known as the 2005-06 budget. This budget is about opportunities for seniors in Somerville and Rosebud, for policemen in Hastings, for tradesmen in Cowes and for firemen on the Mornington Peninsula. For anybody who may find themselves creeping into a higher tax bracket, it is about giving them opportunity. Thirdly, it is about retiring debt and preparing for contingent liabilities—for the newborns in Kooweerup, Mount Martha and other parts of the Mornington Peninsula.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This budget does three things. Firstly, it provides incentives and opportunities for employment for those people who have had disincentives and who have not had opportunities. It provides training on an enormous scale and it provides incentive. It gives these opportunities to people whether they are in Crib Point, Moorooduc, Cranbourne South or anywhere else in the electorate of Flinders or elsewhere in Australia. Secondly, it sets out a regime for lifting the tax burden further from people throughout the tax spectrum. Every working person who currently pays tax will receive tax relief. Thirdly, it provides the long-term framework for the economy. It sets out to do this in a very simple way, by further reducing debt—down from the original $96 billion of net debt that we inherited to $6 billion by the end of this financial year. It also makes provision to deal with contingent liabilities. It is a very simple proposition.</para>
<para>First, we had to overcome the annual deficit. Second, we had to pay down the accumulated debt. Now that we have done both of those, we can provide for the contingent liabilities or the possible payouts to be faced in the future—an issue which, on budget night, the Leader of the Opposition glibly dismissed as something that will ‘take care of itself’. These things do not take care of themselves. That is the fundamental difference between what the government is proposing with the budget and what has been put forward by the opposition.</para>
<para>In looking at the current budget, I wish to examine three things: its background and context, its major themes and the tasks still ahead of us—the non-budgetary tasks that we have to address to deal with the economy as it is in 2005. The budget is a critical step, but it is not the sole step. After 1 July there will be significant opportunities for real, significant and demonstrable reform in terms of: constraints on employment; tax simplification; competition policy; and a national approach to bringing the states up to the mark on their infrastructure responsibilities. We will set sail on all of those fronts after 1 July. This budget lays down the framework for a strong economy, but it prepares the groundwork for the even more significant reforms still to come.</para>
<para>I said that the first area I wanted to address was the background to the budget. The budget must be seen in the context of Australia in 2005. As with all of the Western world, what we see is an ageing of the population, although much less so in Australia and the United States than in western Europe. Western Europe is in many ways sliding into a period which has been described by some as sclerotic. There is an extraordinary ageing of the population there, and that is occurring in a similar way in Japan. The long-term consequences for these societies, in terms of both their social dynamic and their economic capacity to deal with an older population, are significant. That is the underlying issue which every society within the developed world must face. It is an inevitable consequence of the development and change which we have been through over the last two centuries. Against that background—arguably the most significant demographic change within the Western world over the last 100 to 200 years—we have to make the generational changes and commitments which will prepare us. If we do not, we will have utterly betrayed the sacred trust that comes with a representational role within this House.</para>
<para>The first thing we have done is to turn around an accumulated debt of $96 billion. I am delighted that the member for Hotham has arrived at the moment when I begin to talk about an accumulated debt of $96 billion when we came into government.</para>

<para>—I am delighted that our friend across the chamber, the member for Hotham, enters with his customary bluster. We remember that he shares a famous number in Australian history, the number 96—made famous by Abigail and also made famous by the member for Hotham, who as one of the chief economic ministers of the previous government left as his great legacy to Australia a debt of $96 billion. When we look at the conditions which we inherited and look to where we have moved, what we see is this: we have unemployment down, we have inflation down, we have had continued growth and we have had a continued increase in real wages. There is a difference of 14.2 per cent in real wages, as opposed to 1.2 per cent, over the period of the two governments respectively.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>What do we see when we take away that background and look at the current budget? How does it deal with the conditions as they are? The first thing it does is that it seeks to set out a new regime for employment. It seeks to encourage people from welfare to work. From 1 July 2006 new applicants who can work part time will not be entitled to disability pension or parenting payments unless they seek work and unless they do significant things. I note that we have the member for Dickson, the Minister for Workforce Participation, in the House. He has shepherded these reforms through, and I commend him on his work. As I said at the outset, this is about providing opportunities for seniors and for people who are struggling to enter the work force and for those who have not had the confidence to enter the work force, whether they are in Hastings, Somers, Rye, Rosebud, Dromana or any other place within Australia. Importantly, this is accompanied by a package of real incentives, training and significant expenditure—all of those things together.</para>
<para>The second of the critical elements within the budget package is tax cuts. These tax cuts are the third set of tax cuts in three successive budgets. On each occasion they have provided over one per cent of GDP in terms of surplus—which compares very interestingly with the last five years of the previous government’s performance, all of which were deficits of over $10 billion, or two per cent in terms of GDP at the current time. Through all of those tax cuts, we have had a change in the taxation rates. Firstly, the lowest rate will be reduced from 17 per cent to 15 per cent, meaning that every worker in the economy who pays tax will receive a tax cut. Secondly, the threshold for the 42 per cent and 47 per cent rates will be lifted. The 42 per cent rate will be lifted from $58,000 to $70,000 and the 47 per cent rate will be lifted over two years to a level of $125,000. This means tax cuts for people, whether they are police sergeants who work overtime, plumbers who have been working hard or other people who through force of hard work have lifted themselves into those upper rates. It means that 80 per cent of the Australian population will be on a 30 per cent rate and that 97 per cent of the Australian population will be below the top tax rate. Those things together have a real impact on people’s lives. They will have a significant impact not just now but in the future.</para>
<para>The third of the major reforms in the budget is about precisely that: the future. It is about what we will leave as a legacy for our children in 20 and 30 years time. We have looked at that, firstly, by reducing the annual deficit and turning it into a surplus, secondly, by paying down net debt from $96 billion to an expected $6 billion at the end of this year and, thirdly, by making contingencies for the future. We are dealing now with contingent liabilities which will arise as the population ages and the ratio of workers to retirees decreases. That will place an additional burden on the workers of 2020 and 2030. If we do not provision for them now, then what we are simply saying is: ‘We consumed your resources in an act of monumental selfishness.’ Yet what the Leader of the Opposition said in his response to the budget was, very simply: ‘That will take care of itself.’ With great respect, the annual deficit did not take care of itself, the accumulated debt did not take care of itself and contingent liabilities will not take care of themselves. We must prepare.</para>
<para>That is why we have established a future fund to deal with contingent liabilities, to operate through something like the military superannuation fund and invest across a broad portfolio. It will not be directed by any government but will act like the most successful superannuation funds in the world, such as the endowments of the universities in America. Interestingly, the starting point for the future fund will be of a comparable size to the largest of these endowments which invest across a broad sector and earn significant amounts well in excess of ordinary returns. That will have a great impact both on investment and infrastructure within the economy and, more importantly, on the potential for future generations to meet their needs as and when they become due.</para>
<para>When we look forward, what are the tasks we face? Beyond this budget, I believe there are four great tasks which the coalition must deal with as we look into the second half of this decade. The first task is the question of breaks on the employment process. The budget deals with providing incentives for people to move from unemployment to employment. The next step, in removing the unfair dismissal provisions on small business, is to remove the disincentives for potential employers to bring these people in. Not one member of this House has not heard it said, whether by a mechanic, a baker or someone else within their electorate: ‘I wish to employ an additional person but, if things do not turn out right, I am not confident that I could terminate their employment if they do not come up to the mark.’ So we will be changing that to give employers a fair chance to take some risk and employ people. The estimates are that this will significantly increase employment in the Australian economy.</para>
<para>The second great task is that there has to be tax simplification. That is a further step that we will be taking which I believe is absolutely necessary. As the finance minister has foreshadowed, simplification of the tax system is a further step. The third great task, which I think is very important, is additional pressure on the states with respect to competition policy. This would mean that a body such as Sydney Water could not hide behind monopolistic practices and continue to discharge up to 400 billion litres of primary or raw sewerage per year. Sydney Water is standing in the way of private sector firms which wish to recycle this water, end the pollution and deal with Sydney’s water problem. It is not letting them compete. Competition policy is a critical step in dealing with pollution and an absolutely inexcusable waste of water.</para>
<para>That leads me to the fourth great task for the future: dealing with infrastructure. Our friends in the opposition seem to have discovered, after AusLink and Roads to Recovery and the extraordinary amount that has been expended there, that that has not occurred. Again, that must be an issue of ‘not real money’. But these are real expenditures. As we go forward on infrastructure, we now have a role in water. The Australian water fund is something that I am proud to have played a small role in helping to develop over last three years. That is $2 billion funding for water infrastructure for national standards and for community water activities.</para>
<para>Going forward, there is an additional role, and that is working to ensure that the states contribute their fair share. Instead of simply consuming and expending recurrent expenditure, they have to invest. Secondly, and more significantly, the states have to allow the private sector to invest, because it is clear that the infrastructure funds are out there but the opportunities are closed. That is why there is no greater example of a monopoly that needs to be cracked in Australia than Sydney Water. There are people who are willing to solve the problem, but the state of New South Wales will neither solve it themselves nor allow anybody else to solve it.</para>
<para>Ultimately this budget is about dealing with three immediate issues: providing incentives for employment, returning to people the tax that they have paid and dealing with the needs for the future. The task ahead beyond the budget is about removing the constraints to employment; about simplifying the taxation system; about freeing up the competition regime, particularly at the state level; and about provision for infrastructure across Australia, both through the future fund and—in particular—working to free up a regime around Australia that the states are holding by the neck. I am delighted to commend <inline ref="R2335">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2005-2006</inline> and all of the ancillary budget papers to the House. I urge their passage and I urge the opposition to pass the tax cuts and to give that money back to the people of Australia.</para>

<para>—I rise to support the second reading amendment moved by the shadow Treasurer earlier this evening. The reason we moved that second reading amendment is that this was a budget of missed opportunity, a budget that squandered the chance to position Australia for future economic growth and for prosperity. This is a budget that in fact failed the central test of any budget—to meet the challenge that we are confronting and to articulate a plan for the future.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is incredible that, on the back of exceptionally strong tax revenue from the highest taxing government in Australia’s history—a government which when it came to office had a tax take of $130 billion—the government is projected to collect something like $214 billion this year and $233 billion by 2007. No wonder people are feeling the squeeze. This government just keeps reaping the money out of their pockets, whether in the form of bracket creep or the GST that they said would never, ever be introduced. This is the highest taxing government in Australia’s history. It is also a government that has presided over, and is experiencing, the highest commodity prices for 50 years and our highest terms of trade for 30 years.</para>
<para>Despite this, despite being awash with revenue from Australian taxpayers, it provides no plan to invest in the future drivers of economic growth—in our people, in our skills, in our innovation, in our education or in our nation’s infrastructure. It is irresponsible and it is negligent, because the good times will not last forever. But the government wants to coast along without any consideration or any planning to generate the next round of productivity growth or to enhance Australia’s capacities to respond to future economic shocks.</para>
<para>I will have the opportunity tomorrow to talk about the taxation dimension of this budget, so I will not touch on it tonight. Initially, I want to talk about the macroeconomic settings around which this budget is framed because, quite frankly, they are unbelievable. So unbelievable are they that within days of their release the Deputy Prime Minister has walked away from them. He participated in so much of the construction of this budget preparation, he agreed to the parameters, and he has confirmed all the doubts around the plausibility of the outlook for economic growth and for our trade performance. He did that before the ink was even dry on the budget papers, because on 14 May, just after the budget was brought down—four days afterwards, in fact—the Deputy Prime Minister outlined the potential impact of another El Nino. He suggested:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It could knock up to 1 per cent off economic growth. It could do that again if we can’t get the crop in.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Before the ink was even dry on the budget, the Deputy Prime Minister, who had participated in its formulation, was out there saying that there could be another one per cent hit to the growth forecasts contained in the budget. Despite the fact that he came out saying that within such a short period of time, he also presided over the cost-cutting exercise that saw the program associated with drought relief cut by more than half, from $132 million to $59 million—a $73 million cut. Where was the National Party standing up for its members’ interests? Of course, it was rolling over, as always, to the cost-cutting fetish of the Treasurer, despite the fact that the Deputy Prime Minister knew full well that the question of the drought was posing a huge problem to our future.</para>
<para>El Nino threatens to impose further hardship on our rural communities and to force them into further debt. It threatens the prospects of our rural exports. But we have a government that still cut drought relief and is now having to scramble to give much-needed relief to these farmers, and we still have not seen the outcome of it. The Treasurer’s forecast is for economic growth to increase to three per cent next year from two per cent this year, its lowest level for 15 years. But that has already been blown out of the water by the Deputy Prime Minister’s pronouncements. Is the Deputy Prime Minister saying that we are looking at two per cent growth again next year? If he is, then let that be confirmed here in the parliament. It is not just the growth downgrade that we are dealing with here, because the growth prospects for this nation also deteriorate if our trade performance continues to suffer.</para>
<para>This budget does nothing to address our chronic trade crisis, a crisis that is undermining economic growth and generating record current account deficits and foreign debt. Where is that debt truck now? Those opposite used to say that debt was so crippling this nation that they were going to halve it—they have turned the debt truck, still out there, into a B-double. The Treasurer said that in this budget he would rebalance economic growth from domestic to external sources, and that that process was expected to continue.</para>

<para>—I ask the garrulous member, because he did not address this in his budget speech, where is the evidence of that? Over the past 12 months the export growth forecast has been cut from eight per cent to four per cent to two per cent and now we are expected to believe that next year it will miraculously grow by seven per cent. There is no evidence of that, particularly with the Deputy Prime Minister questioning the outlook for our rural exports.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Added to that is the fact that for the last four years the government have persistently overshot on their export growth forecasts. So why should we believe them this time? The Treasury poses some very interesting downside risks to this budget as it does the question of whether or not we can rebalance this growth. Treasury points to—but the Treasurer does not make much emphasis of this—the persistence of global imbalances. It talks about the failure to correct the US’s current account deficit, which could result in an abrupt and disruptive adjustment to global exchange rates and interest rates; it talks about the fact that the high commodity prices are likely to ease; and it also talks about the infrastructure constraints and bottlenecks associated with that.</para>
<para>In addition to the downside risks on exports, which at least Treasury is honest enough to highlight, we have the massive stimulus to domestic consumption arising from increased government expenditure and tax cuts. Their impact has the effect of generating upside risk on the imports, calling into question the forecast drop in import growth from 10 per cent to eight per cent. So we have a downside risk on exports and an upside risk on imports. For the government’s forecast for net exports to subtract only one per cent, following a two per cent subtraction this year, is unrealistic.</para>
<para>Tonight I have discussed two aspects of the parameters of this budget that we will be watching very closely. The Treasurer reasserts that there will be a rebalancing of economic growth from domestic to external sources, but there is nothing in the budget papers to support that assertion. Worse, he then narrows the basis for his optimism to an expansion of the resources sector. This is not a vision for the future—it is a policy steeped in the past. Where is the strategy for industry policy to grow value-added agriculture in manufactured and service exports? The Treasurer thinks that the export solution lies in free trade agreements. He does not mention the WTO or the Doha Round and, as far as the budget is concerned, it will provide $6 million over two years for exports. And what does it fund? It funds only 30 export facilitators for the US. The budget provided an opportunity to change the course of trade policy. We have demonstrated in the past that we can improve export performance, because under Labor exports grew by an annual average rate of 10.8 per cent a year, more than double the growth of 5.3 per cent achieved under the Howard government. For manufactured exports, the figures are starker: growth of 13.7 per cent under Labor compared to 3.7 per cent under the Howard government.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I rise tonight to talk about a large group of people, in particular a couple of organisations, that have missed out on the largesse that has been spread around by this government in the last federal budget—in fact, in the last couple of budgets. We have heard much about the amount of funding that has gone for tax cuts—$21 billion. The amount of funding that went through the last budget was $66 billion.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I want to look at the effect on the poorest and most disadvantaged in the community in my electorate. How a government looks after the poorest and most disadvantaged within the community is always a hallmark of a government—a test of a government, a test of its credibility. There are families that are struggling. I have heard my good friend Tony Abbott, the Minister for Health and Ageing, talking about the Medicare safety net and how that provides assistance to people in need. But in looking at the last budget and its effect in two key areas, I seriously question what the government is actually doing, particularly in the federal electorate of Holt. I will look at two areas. One is the Commonwealth Financial Counselling Program. The second is the provision of the emergency relief funding. They are two key areas. None of us on either side of the chamber could disagree that it is government’s role to provide funding to people in financial need as a consequence of marriage break-up et cetera or to people who are really struggling as a consequence of their financial difficulties.</para>
<para>If you look at the Commonwealth Financial Counselling Program in particular and the Casey Cardinia Community Legal Service, which is one of the recipients of the Commonwealth Financial Counselling Program funding, you would think, as a consequence of this massive budget surplus, that this organisation would be awash with funding to provide financial counselling to those in need in an incredibly fast-growing area in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne.</para>
<para>For those who do not know what the Commonwealth Financial Counselling Program is, the objective of the program is to provide access to quality financial counselling services free of charge to people in low-income groups experiencing financial crisis due to circumstances such as unemployment, sickness, credit, overcommitment and family breakdown. Unfortunately, notwithstanding the enormous growth within the economy, what has happened is that there is a large group of people experiencing family breakdown, with large levels of debt, who need this sort of service.</para>
<para>This is particularly so in the area of the city of Casey. The city of Casey is a microcosm of the community. The population of the city of Casey at the present time is 217,590. You might ask why I refer to this. It is basically because the population increases by 153 people per week. The city of Casey has a dial that flutters because of the number of people shifting in per week—about 50 families per week, 153 people. There are 217,000 people within the city of Casey. The 2001 census figure had the city of Casey population at about 175,000. There is enormous growth.</para>
<para>One would think that an organisation like the Casey Cardinia Community Legal Service, which is the primary body that provides financial counselling to people in need within the city of Casey, would have got an enormous amount of funding given the largesse that we have within the budget. In fact, when one looks at the 2005-06 budget allocations, one sees that an appropriation of approximately $2.9 million was made to the Financial Counselling Program. Under the general element, there are about 41 community based organisations like the Casey Cardinia legal service which get funding of about $71,000 per organisation to provide much-needed financial counselling. Yet despite the population and the great need that there is, given the massive number of families that are shifting into the region, the Casey Cardinia legal service has had no substantive increase in funding. The Commonwealth should have at least doubled the funding.</para>
<para>The same applies with the emergency relief services. The Berwick and District Benevolent Society disburses about $130,000 in emergency relief funding per annum. It is a fantastic community based organisation that provides emergency relief funding to people in need. Given that it provides the service to that same growth corridor with 217,000 people, one would expect a substantial increase in funding from the $62,000 per annum that it receives from the federal government to provide emergency relief to that enormous number of families in financial need. There was no increase in funding—no real increase in funding. That is a disgrace.</para>
<para>As I said, it is the hallmark of a government that it provides services to those most in need. This government, in relation to those two organisations, has failed the community. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I rise tonight to inform the House of assistance the federal government is providing to a very important project in my electorate of Kingston. The City of Onkaparinga council raised funds for the refurbishment of a local war memorial in Morphett Vale and the construction and installation of an eternal flame. During that process the federal government contributed $4,000 to the works. Unfortunately, during the construction there was a cost blow-out, and the council and residents were left to cover the massive increase. Today I am able to announce that the federal government has, under its Saluting their Service program, provided an additional $20,000 in funding to help cover the additional costs. The purpose of the Saluting their Service program is to honour the invaluable contribution of service men and women in wars, conflicts and peacetime operations. Funding is available for commemorative activities and educational programs.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I was exceptionally disappointed when a local constituent faxed me a copy of state parliament <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> from Monday, 11 April. The local Labor member for Reynell, Ms Gay Thompson, rose to speak about the youth vigil and the site of the new memorial. During her speech Ms Thompson stated that her application for federal funding had been unsuccessful. While Ms Thompson’s application may have been unsuccessful, I am able to inform the House and Ms Thompson that the City of Onkaparinga’s application, with my support, was successful—successful to the tune of $20,000.</para>
<para>The member for Reynell also went on to state that she did not know what the local federal member was doing about funding. Just so the local member for Reynell is aware of what I am doing about federal funding in her electorate, I can tell her, as the local representative of the Howard government, that we will be providing the City of Onkaparinga with an additional $20,000 in funding on top of the $4,000 we have already provided. Along with that, as the local federal member, I have fought for in excess of 100 grants for the southern area in just six months. Some of these grants, already announced, include over $500,000 for the Pathways for Families Centre at Hackham, over $100,000 for the Christie Downs Community House Inc., over $4 million to provide in excess of 150 new aged care places and over $5½ million to the City of Onkaparinga under the Roads to Recovery program for our local area. These are but a few.</para>
<para>I was disappointed in the Labor South Australian state MP Ms Thompson because I would have liked to hope that the commemoration of Anzac Day, such an important day on our national calendar, was beyond partisan politics and cheap political point scoring. Unfortunately, it seems it was not so in this case. The Eternal Flame monument is of immense value to the people of the south. Every day when we take for granted the freedoms we all enjoy without a second thought, we must remember that those freedoms came with a price—not one which is paid by the generations of Australians who have the benefit of them, but a price which was paid by the men and women whose names now adorn the Eternal Flame monument and their fellow service men and women who gave their lives in the name of this fine nation.</para>
<para>The memorial gives the people of the south a place where we too can honour those from the local area who gave their lives in various conflicts and during peacetime operations. But, more than that, it provides us with a place where we can go and reflect on the sacrifices which are constantly being made by the men and woman of the armed forces and their families in the defence of our nation.</para>
<para>I would like to commend the hard work of local RSL clubs and, in particular, of Frank Owens and local councillor Daryl Parslow, without whom the monument would not exist. I would also like to recognise the commitment and dedication of the City of Onkaparinga for their continued hard work on the project. This is a great result for our local returned service men and women and a great result for future generations living in the south who will always be reminded of the sacrifice made by those who went before them.</para>

<para>—If you only read Australian newspapers, you would be forgiven for thinking that in recent months the only controversy in North-East Asia regarding nuclear proliferation involved North Korea; that Hosni Mubarak, the President of Egypt, was going to hold a democratic election for the Egyptian presidency in the foreseeable future; that the United Kingdom is going to continue to maintain its level of military presence in Iraq; and that there is no evidence to support the theory that the American attack on Iraq was premeditated and that the intelligence was modified in order to fit the plan.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>However, if like me you actually read some international media, you would know that the world is a little bit different and that there have been some very significant reports in recent times that do not fit the picture that I have just described. You would have read, for example, the <inline font-style="italic">Guardian</inline> earlier this year indicating that South Korea has been in breach of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. You might have read last week’s <inline font-style="italic">Economist</inline>, where the Mubarak plan for so-called democracy in Egypt was unveiled, which requires that candidates for president will have to be nominated by 250 elected representatives in either the Egyptian parliament or provincial councils, almost all of whom currently belong to President Mubarak’s National Democratic Party—so much for the alleged flowering of democracy in the Middle East that was supposedly being triggered by the invasion of Iraq.</para>
<para>You may well have read the London <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> early in March, where it was reported that the United Kingdom proposed to reduce its troop presence in Iraq from 9,000 to approximately 3,500. And, the daddy of them all, you may well have read in early May in the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Times</inline>, in the <inline font-style="italic">Guardian</inline> or perhaps even in the <inline font-style="italic">Los Angeles Times</inline>, the minutes of a meeting of the heads of the British security services on 23 July 2002, in which the then head of MI6, Sir Richard Dearlove, was quoted with respect to recent meetings that he and others had held with the Bush administration. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para>Military action was now seen as inevitable. Bush wanted to remove Saddam, through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD. But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This was in mid-2002 and this was the head of British security in MI6 stating in a private meeting what was happening with the Bush administration. In other words, the entirely fraudulent nature of the rationale for the attack on Iraq was exposed by an unimpeachable source, the UK security services. It was one of the biggest stories of the year, but you would have to look long and hard to find that story in the Australian media.</para>
<para>I read the Australian newspapers pretty thoroughly, as most members of this House do, and I have not seen much sign of these stories. With the assistance of the Parliamentary Library, I have had a bit of a look recently. What I have found is one very oblique reference to the Mubarak story in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, no report with respect to the reduction of the UK troop presence in Iraq and a couple of sketchy reports in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> regarding the minutes from the UK security services meeting, where the angle was all about the British election and Tony Blair’s involvement.</para>
<para>Although all these stories are obviously inconvenient for the John Howard-George Bush view of the world, where the United States, Australia and others are selflessly and nobly spreading democracy, light, freedom and peace throughout the Middle East, I do not necessarily see their absence from the Australian media and that they are being ignored as some kind of conspiracy, even though, as I indicated, at least one of them is a very major international story—the presence of clear evidence that the policy to invade Iraq was well predetermined before any of the processes of the United Nations or weapons inspections occurred. I see these things as evidence of a very narrow, shallow and parochial orientation on the part of the Australian media, where most issues are reduced to good guys and bad guys and it is simply a headline regurgitation strategy. Material that does not fit the standard Western perspective is routinely filtered out. It is particularly noticeable that all the reports that I have referred to were covered in the British media, of which most of our international reporting tends to be derivative. In other words, even when you have major issues on key international controversies reported in the British media, they are not being adequately reported in the Australian media.</para>
<para>There are some rare honourable exceptions. Nicolas Rothwell in the Australian has been an outstanding reporter and correspondent on the Middle East in recent times. I could not commend his reporting on the nuances and complexities of the Middle East situation more highly. Paul McGeough is rightly commended for his very courageous reporting both in Afghanistan and the Middle East, but the media needs to wake up to itself—(Time expired)</para>

<para>—Martin Luther King famously said, ‘I have a dream.’ Les Noseda, the elder statesman of Apollo Bay, had another dream, which was the inspiration to create an international marathon along the Great Ocean Road from Lorne to Apollo Bay, in the heartland of the seat of Corangamite. On Sunday, 16 May 2005 this dream became a reality. International runners joined with locals and interstate performers to test this iconic marathon course.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>They came in all shapes and sizes, ages and abilities. To a man and to a woman they voted the event to be of world significance, like the course itself. Les Noseda and his dedicated small group guaranteed the event with their own money and took a huge risk in staging this first Great Ocean Road International Marathon. Les Noseda was assisted by the Apollo Bay Chamber of Commerce, with Ross Stephens—as chairman—Nick Polgeeft, Gerry Tidd and Councillor Joe Di Ceccio. This small committee were ably assisted by Stephan Traueb, Frank Buchanan and Darren Brimmacombe. This group were instrumental in arranging the detail of this classic event over the last six months.</para>
<para>Congratulations go to John Craven for his fantastic capability in organising an event of this calibre and standing. His experience in organising the Otway Classic and the Melbourne to Warrnambool bike race showed through during the preparation for the Great Ocean Road marathon. The endorsement of Steve Moneghetti and Lee Troop of the concept and the event meant that international runners were encouraged to participate. Lee Troop was unfortunately injured. However, Steve Moneghetti, in his inimitable style, ran the full marathon in two hours and 42 minutes, which included an extra three kilometres to the 45-kilometre mark in order to finish in Apollo Bay. Mona congratulated the event organisers for their great country spirit, the Apollo Bay atmosphere and the friendly welcome to all competitors. He assured the locals that he would be back next year supporting this emerging international marathon.</para>
<para>There were 376 runners in the marathon, which was won by Machuka of Kenya in two hours and 31 minutes. The real heroes of the marathon were those who finished further down the field but completed the course in under five hours. The half-marathon was won by Jacob Mwema from Kenya in one hour and 10 minutes, a total journey of 23 kilometres. Over the weekend there were 1,270 competitors running in the Paradise and Mariners Lookout short runs. The locals say, ‘Who can reach Paradise in 14 kilometres?’ The Great Ocean Road marathon will be soon competing with the Boston, New York and London marathons on the international circuit for prestige, unique and iconic landscape and, of course, the friendly hospitality of the people of Lorne and Apollo Bay.</para>
<para>VicRoads are to be thanked and congratulated for their support in closing the Great Ocean Road from 7 am to 3 pm on the Sunday of the event. Without their cooperation this great event could not have happened. The Apollo Bay Chamber of Commerce are forever grateful. Many sponsors helped to get the event off the ground in an uncertain commercial and sponsorship climate—our grateful thanks to them. The Chamber of Commerce appreciated the coverage by the <inline font-style="italic">Geelong Advertiser</inline> and its positive support. Also the outstanding special media coverage of the event by Channel 7 was most helpful, and the assistance of the Rotary clubs of Colac in the drink stations aided the organisers and the athletes.</para>
<para>Personally, I have supported the Great Ocean Road marathon from its earliest days and felt honoured to participate in the inaugural event. As my twin sons James and Andrew say, ‘Pain is temporary and glory is forever.’ I was not too sure about the glory bit at the 17-kilometre mark, nor was I over the last two kilometres, but I finished and pulled up well. The inaugural medal, which I show here to members of the House, for every finisher of the half-marathon made all the pain and effort worth while. My time was two hours and seven minutes for the 21 kilometres—not a bad effort for an older runner, age not recorded. There is local support for the Prime Minister to participate in next year’s event and speed walk against the member for Corangamite over the full course. Steve Moneghetti would be very pleased to make the presentation to the winner.</para>

<para>—For the fourth successive year farmers in many parts of Australia face inadequate rainfall and above average temperatures at the same time as climate scientists warn that the Pacific is heading for a new El Nino and an intensification of the ongoing drought. These destructive changes in our weather patterns are firmly linked to global warming driven by growing levels of carbon dioxide pollution, and yet the Minister for the Environment and Heritage and the Prime Minister remain dogmatically opposed to any measure that would reduce Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions. Instead, as we have heard repeatedly, the minister for the environment and his leader, the Prime Minister, refuse to sign the Kyoto protocol, on the grounds that to do so would damage Australia’s economic interests—all the while ignoring the billions of dollars that are being lost annually by the rural sector as the climate changes to a drier and hotter regime.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Australia could be adopting affordable measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, yet the government apparently expects that we should simply adapt to climate change and just get used to the hotter and more arid conditions that are now destroying the countryside and drying up urban water supplies. The technologies needed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions are practical and affordable. The Howard government behaves as if climate change will never happen and despite unequivocal evidence refuses to make even the most minimal precautionary policy changes.</para>
<para>In contrast, in the United States of all places the federal government offers its citizens an income tax reduction of up to $US2,000 for purchasers of fuel efficient hybrid vehicles, while the state of Colorado offers new car buyers a hybrid electric vehicle tax credit of up to $US3,929. Here in Australia the Howard government offers buyers of the largest and least efficient family vehicles—imported four-wheel drives—a preferential tariff of five per cent, a subsidy that costs taxpayers on average $500 million per annum, to encourage the purchase of high-polluting gas guzzlers.</para>
<para>And now it appears that new car buyers, fearful of the threat posed by oversized four-wheel drives, are turning to larger sized passenger cars for protection against these overweight road locomotives. Here we have a perfect example of an ill-considered policy that encourages people to buy inefficient vehicles, together with the inevitable consequence—other road users being forced to buy larger vehicles for protection. Instead of taking measures to reduce vehicle fuel consumption and the concomitant emission of greenhouse gases, this government’s negligent policies are causing a rapid growth in carbon dioxide pollution from motor vehicles.</para>
<para>There has been much progress in other parts of the world in reducing carbon dioxide emissions. For instance, the Germans already generate eight per cent of their electricity from renewables and are on target for renewables to supply half of all of their energy needs by 2050. By then they will have reduced their carbon dioxide emissions to one-fifth of their 1990 levels.</para>
<para>From 2007, New Zealanders will pay $NZ15 per tonne of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. This tax will add an average of $NZ208 to householders’ bills, but our friends across the Tasman evidently believe that the price is one worth paying for climate stability. Here is a warning from Robert Nicholls from Southampton University about the number of people that may be flooded out of their homes by rising sea levels caused by global warming. The estimates vary from a few hundred thousand per year to a few hundred million per year between 2020 and 2100, depending on different assumptions about population growth, economic development and climate sensitivity.</para>
<para>Many of these people may well end up on Australia’s doorstep with no possibility that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs will be able to deport them to their place of origin. When will the Prime Minister and his government recognise that there is no time to waste in taking action to reduce carbon dioxide emissions?</para>

<para>—Mr Speaker, on the Gold Coast the word ‘mirikai’ has a local Aboriginal meaning: it means ‘a place of peace’. The name is very apt as Mirikai is a specialist alcohol and other drug treatment program that works on a therapeutic community model. Its goal is to enhance the capacity and commitment of clients to achieve, as well as maintain, an optimal level of personal and social functioning free from harmful drug use. And achieve they do. The dedicated staff and volunteers at Mirikai led by Mary Alcorn achieve outstanding results with their clients.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I was privileged last week to attend a graduation ceremony where more than 100 clients graduated from the Mirikai residential program or drug court program and were moving into their next phase of independent living. It was an exciting night for all involved. Challenging milestones had been reached by the clients, and they were supported and recognised for their achievements by their families and friends as well as by the staff and volunteers who assisted them through their individual journeys. It was a night of tears and hugs.</para>
<para>The Gold Coast Drug Council had its beginnings as a voluntary organisation known as the Drug Referral Centre. It was established in 1971 as the first drug and alcohol service on the Gold Coast. In 1981, land was granted by the Gold Coast City Council at 191 West Burleigh Road to establish a centre for education, prevention, assessment, referral and detoxification. This place was called Mirikai or ‘a place of peace’.</para>
<para>In the 1980s, the Gold Coast Drug Council focused on developing professional standards for treatment and education and in 1987 adopted a therapeutic community approach to treatment services for young people. Since that time, the organisation has developed community services which assist young people and their families. These services include residential services and a wide range of out-client services supported by both state and federal funding.</para>
<para>In fact, in the last 12 months, the federal government has supported Mirikai with two grants to assist with their programs. I would like to report to the parliament that these funds have been well utilised and support the prevention, early intervention and specialised treatment in order to minimise the harm related to the use of licit and illicit drugs within the Gold Coast region. In the recent budget, the Howard government committed $21.8 million in new funding for programs to help young people say no to illegal drugs and to provide more treatment and rehabilitation to drug users. There is $0.85 million for the national illicit drugs campaign and another $12 million for the Non Government Organisation Treatment Grants Program over two years from 2006-07. The additional funding for the Non Government Organisation Treatment Grants Program is a firm commitment from the government to ensure that existing treatment services can continue to operate after the current contracts end in June 2006. I will certainly be supporting Mirikai in seeking further funding to continue their valuable services on the Gold Coast.</para>
<para>My evening last week with these graduates, their families, their friends and the staff and volunteers of Mirikai will not be an evening I will forget in a hurry. The programs these graduates have been through have tested them. Graduation means that these young people have completed all phases and stages of their relevant program, and many of them have now moved into a halfway house—a huge stepping stone before they begin independent living. For some graduates the program took six months; for others it took 12 months; but each of them has been confronted and challenged, and each has given up many behaviours that no longer suit the lifestyle they have now chosen. For many, learning the discipline of getting up at six o’clock in the morning was a real challenge.</para>
<para>Most residents of Mirikai complete a residential program that focuses on anger management, anxiety groups, goal setting, communication skills, health lectures, relapse prevention, drama and art, group therapy, individual counselling and assertion training. On the evening of the graduation, students performed for guests. It was a lively and sometimes sad performance. It took the audience through the journey of an addict: the many highs and lows, the anger, the isolation and loneliness, and the ultimate celebration of the graduation. It was a gutsy performance full of emotion that gave each of us a better understanding of the journey these young people have made.</para>
<para>There is not the time here tonight to name all the graduates, but to each of them I wish them well for the future and thank them for their hugs and their stories the other night. To their families who have also travelled the journey and found their loved one again, they are to be thanked for sticking around and giving these people the strength and love they needed to complete the journey. To Sean Cousins, thank you for the time you spent with me; thank you for answering my questions and being patient about my learning. To Mary Alcorn and your support team, keep up the great work. You have my full support for the future.</para>

<para>        On 11 June 2003, in response to Treasury’s request of 20 March 2003, the Tax Office offered its views on Joint Taskforce Recommendation 12 and other alternative suggestions and strategies to deter high income professionals from avoiding their taxation obligations.  The Tax Office has since undertaken a significant review of the ATO Prosecution Policy.  The outcome of that review will be the publication of a revised prosecution policy which, among other matters, will ensure that Tax Office staff may elect under s.8F of the Taxation Administration Act 1953, in appropriate circumstances, to treat offences otherwise than as prescribed taxation offences.  This will enable a broader range of sentencing options (including custodial sentences) to be considered by a court if a prosecution results in conviction.</para>

<item label="(5)">
<para>The Commissioner, in his capacity as a creditor, has continued to take action to overturn arrangements designed to disadvantage creditors by funding trustees in bankruptcy to challenge such arrangements in the Courts.  The Commissioner is also currently considering the recently released Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia Discussion Paper – Strengthening Bankruptcy Anti-Avoidance Provisions.  This discussion paper examines possible approaches to strengthening the ‘clawback’ provisions.</para>

<para>The ABC is currently in a preferred airline and Travel Management Contract (TMC) with Qantas Business Travel. The ABC does not have records of the travel arranged through the TMC with other carriers. Consequently the figures for 2002-03 are not available. However, in preparation for the RFT, Qantas prepared for the ABC a breakdown by carrier of 2003-04 travel. From these figures, the ABC has calculated the following expenditure with Regional Express, Qantas and Virgin Blue, as shown below:</para>

<para>Through Medicare, the Department funds a range of prenatal, birth and post natal services.</para>
<para>        In the case of unplanned pregnancy, the Department funds organisations to provide support, information and non-directive counselling.  The Australian Government funds the Australian Federation of Pregnancy Support to provide national sexual and reproductive health counselling services for women requiring support for unplanned pregnancy including a 1300 telephone line and the local services provided by affiliated agencies.</para>
<para>        In addition to the Australian Federation of Pregnancy Support Services, Family Planning Organisations funded under the national family planning program through the Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements also offer pregnancy counselling, both telephone and face to face; website information sheets; interactive facilities; and links to both national and international websites. </para>
<para>        The Department, through the Office for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health (OATSIH) provides funding to a range of Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services for the provision of comprehensive primary health care to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, inclusive of a focus on child and maternal health.</para>

<item label="(b)">
<para>The Australian Government is currently involved in the development of the National Agenda for Early Childhood (for children 0-5 years, including pregnancy) which is currently being finalised with input from state and territory governments.  The National Agenda proposes a broad framework for a national approach to prevention and early intervention with the aim to ensure all children get the best possible start in life.  The National Agenda will focus on four broad areas:</para>
<para>        - healthy young families;</para>
<para>        - early learning and care;</para>
<para>        - supporting parents and families; and</para>
<para>        - child-friendly communities.</para>
<para>        The National Agenda encompasses pregnancy and has a focus on detecting problems early so that appropriate intervention/s can be initiated.</para>
<para>        Maternal and Child Health is a priority action area identified in the national public health nutrition strategy, Eat Well Australia 2000-2010, endorsed by Australian Health Ministers in 2001.  This action area focuses on the promotion of breastfeeding and improving nutrition for pregnant and lactating women, infants and children.</para>
<para>        The Australian Government acknowledges the important role of breastfeeding in infant nutrition and supports activities to both promote and protect breastfeeding.  </para>
<para>        Activities to promote breastfeeding include:</para>
<para>        - funding the Australian Breastfeeding Association ($100,000 in 2004/05) to promote breastfeeding in the community.  The Association fulfils an important role in supporting Australian mothers to establish and maintain breastfeeding; and</para>
<para>        - dissemination of the Australian Dietary Guidelines (NHMRC, 2003).  The guidelines aim to provide advice about healthy food choices and lifestyle patterns to promote good nutrition and health for all Australians, including pregnant and lactating women.  The recommendations acknowledge the nutritional, health, social and economic benefits of breastfeeding.</para>
<para>        Activities to protect breastfeeding include:</para>
<para>        - implementing Australia’s response to the World Health Organization Code for the Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes via the Advisory Panel on the Marketing in Australia of Infant Formula (APMAIF).  APMAIF is a joint industry-government mechanism for monitoring industry compliance with a self-regulatory agreement that governs the marketing of infant formula in Australia; and </para>
<para>        - administering the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code to protect the quality, safety and labelling aspects of infant formula.</para>
<para>        The Government’s 2004 Election policy included a commitment to provide further funding of $30 million over four years to Beyondblue, the National Depression Initiative.  Beyondblue has a program which focuses on post natal depression.</para>

<item label="(2)">
<para>It is the role of the Department of Family and Community Services and the Department of Human Services to provide practical and financial support to pregnant women and/or new mothers.  This includes, for example, the parenting payment, maternity payment and other related family assistance payments.  The Department of Health and Aging provides subsidies to the Australian public through the Medicare Benefits Schedule and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for medical and pharmaceutical services.</para>

<para>—The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>The Government, through the Department of Family and Community Services (FaCS), provides a range of payments and services to support pregnant women and new mothers.</para>
<para>        The Government provides a range of family assistance including Maternity Payment, Maternity Immunisation Allowance, Family Tax Benefit (FTB) Part A and FTB Part B. Additionally, from 1 July 2005, mothers returning to work after the birth of a child will be assisted by the quarantining of FTB Part B payments. This means the income they earn after returning to work will not affect the FTB Part B received earlier in that financial year.</para>
<para>        FaCS also supports new mothers by providing support for child care.</para>
<para>        Principally, this assistance is in the form of Child Care Benefit (CCB), a means tested payment made to families to assist with the costs of child care. CCB is available for families using approved child care services or registered carers.</para>
<para>        In addition to the financial support available through the Child Care Benefit, the Government announced in the election context that a 30 per cent Child Care Tax Rebate would be implemented. The Child Care Tax Rebate will cover 30 per cent of out-of-pocket expenses, that is, regular fees for approved care, less CCB entitlement, for families who receive CCB and meet the CCB work/study/training test. The Child Care Tax Rebate will be payable on costs from 1 July 2004, and will be payable up to a maximum of $4,000 per child per year. The Child Care Tax Rebate is payable in addition to any CCB entitlement.</para>
<para>        The Australian Government Jobs Education and Training (JET) Child Care supports JET creches, which are flexible and innovative services that enable parents to participate in training and work activities in areas where no other suitable child care services are available, or where it is deemed in the best interests of the child and parent to remain in close proximity.   JET creches are run in conjunction with education and training activities for targeted vulnerable groups such as teenage parents.  Creches enable parents to attend their courses while their children receive care on-site or nearby. There are a number of creches attached to high schools to support young teenage mothers.</para>
<para>        In 2004-05, 75 JET creches have been funded across the five states and territories of WA, SA, NT, NSW and QLD.  The total funding for JET Child Care creches in 2004-05 is approximately $4 million.</para>
<para>        The Stronger Families and Communities Strategy provides support through a number of projects which help pregnant women and new mothers. The Strategy focuses on the Government’s concerns about the health, development and wellbeing of Australian children with a focus on children from 0-5 years. The Government has committed nearly $490 million to the Strategy over the next four years.</para>
<para>        The Strategy consists of four main streams:</para>
<para>·         Communities for Children ($142.4 million over four years) targets up to 45 disadvantaged communities providing funding for local early childhood initiatives;</para>
<para>·         Early Childhood – Invest to Grow ($70.5 million over four years) provides funding for national early childhood programs and resources. It will ensure that Australia continues to be one of the world leaders in best practice in the early childhood development arena;</para>
<para>·         Local Answers ($137 million over four years) gives communities the power to develop their own solutions and help them help themselves by supporting locally developed and implemented projects which provide help in such areas as parenting and relationship skills, community strengthening and participation for young parents, volunteering, mentoring and leadership; and</para>
<para>·         Choice and Flexibility in Child Care ($125.3 million over four years) continues the groundbreaking work of the first Strategy in providing Australian parents with flexible and innovative child care solutions. It will fund the continuation of the in‑home care program and provide additional places for families without other formal child care options. There will be incentives for long day care providers to set up in areas of high need, and funding will continue to the quality assurance systems for family day care and outside school hours care.</para>
<para>        From the Prime Minister’s announcement in April 2004 to 1 March 2005, 21 projects were approved for funding which provide support to pregnant women and young mothers under the Local Answers initiative of the Strategy at a total of some $4.3 million.</para>
<para>        The Department also supports pregnant women and young mothers through programs such as Early Childhood-Invest to Grow and Responding Early Assisting Children (REACh). REACh aims to improve the capacity of parents and other caregivers to respond appropriately to children’s needs for care, stimulation and safety. It encourages early intervention approaches to prevent child abuse, neglect and other poor outcomes for children.</para>
<para>        Early Childhood-Invest to Grow funds projects that provide targeted early intervention and prevention projects in various areas of Australia. These include: home visiting; parenting education and workshops; family therapy and support for families of children with a disability; education and support for mothers with intellectual disability; and advice for new mothers about available services. Funded projects also include development of resources or tools for use by parents, professionals and the community to support positive early childhood development. These include the $4 million Parenting Information Website, which will shortly commence development.</para>
<para>        Most recently, the Government announced a grant of $615,000 under the Early Childhood – Invest To Grow program to help expand nationally the Core of Life ‘Pregnancy, Birth, Breastfeeding and Early Parenting’ Program to address the rate of teenage pregnancies.</para>
<para>        The Family Relationships Services Program (FRSP) provides funding to 100 community organisations to deliver family relationships services through about 350 outlets across Australia. The program’s current aims are to enable children, young people and adults in all their diversity to develop and sustain safe, supportive and nurturing family relationships; and to minimise the emotional, social and economic costs associated with disruption to family relationships.</para>

<para>and (2) Job Network is administered on the basis of 19 Labour Market Regions and 137 Employment Services Areas (ESAs), the boundaries of which do not align with those of Federal Electorates. Job seekers choose Job Network members for a variety of reasons including location, proximity to transport routes and Centrelink offices, or the satisfaction of friends and others. Job seekers residing in one Electorate or ESA may be assisted through Job Network sites located in adjoining Electorates or ESAs. For illustration, job seekers residing in the Electorate of Ballarat may be assisted through Job Network sites located in the Electorates of Bendigo, McEwen or Lalor. The Eureka ESA is most closely aligned with the Electorate of Ballarat and, therefore, answers are provided with reference to this ESA.</para>
<para>        There are currently 18 Job Network members and other Job Placement Organisations operating in the Eureka ESA. Their names, office locations and the number of job seekers on their caseloads are shown in Table 1.</para>

Job seekers eligible for Job Search Support Only have been excluded from the calculation of percentages. The number of participants refers to all job seekers assisted in Intensive Support in that year.</para>

<para>In view of the 12 month duration of Intensive Assistance it is not practical to report on the numbers of job seekers who participated on multiple occasions in 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003.</para>
<para>Delivery of Intensive Assistance ceased on 30 June 2003. From 1 July 2003, improvements to the delivery of Job Network services were introduced through implementation of the APM. While Intensive Assistance allowed for multiple episodes of assistance, the new APM arrangements provide for job seekers to be assisted by a single Job Network member for the full duration of their unemployment, allowing the service provider to develop a detailed understanding of each job seeker’s needs.</para>

<para>Applications for further protection visas lodged by temporary protection visa holders from tsunami affected countries are being assessed on their merits under the normal arrangements for determining applications for further protection visas.  To be eligible for grant of a further protection visa, an applicant must either be found to be owed protection obligations under the Refugees Convention or be accompanying a family member who has been found to be owed such protection obligations.  The tsunami and the damage and disruption it has caused do not meet the grounds set out in the Refugees Convention for identifying persons owed refugee protection.  However, where the Refugee Review Tribunal affirms a decision to refuse a further protection visa, the Minister has a non-compellable personal power to substitute for the Tribunal decision a decision which is more favourable to the applicant, where the Minister considers this to be in the public interest.</para>

<para>The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) was responsible for the removal of this person as he had no entitlement to remain in Australia. </para>
<para>        In exceptional circumstances the use of restraint on high risk removees during a removal operation may be required.  This includes cases where the removee presents a high security risk or behaves in a way that threatens the safety of themself or others. </para>
<para>        In this case, the removee was violent, noisy and disruptive during the removal process.  He assaulted the escorts and attempted to bite them.  He also bit his own lips, apparently in an attempt to delay his removal and appear unfit to travel.  The escorting officers found that it was necessary to restrain the person with hand restraints, leg restraints and mouth tape, to allow him to board the flight without posing further danger to himself or others.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>The removee was restrained for the minimum time required.  The flight departed Sydney with a stopover in Melbourne.  The restraints were removed when the flight departed Melbourne on its international leg.  The removee was allowed to eat and drink.  He was also allowed toilet breaks.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>During the period July 2003 – June 2004 there were 10 reported incidents of removees being restrained with hand and leg restraints.    In addition, five were restrained by the hands only.  During the period July 2004 – February 2005 there were 11 reported incidents of removees restrained with hand and leg restraints. Four of these 11 removees were additionally restrained with mouth tape.  In once instance it was also necessary to tape a removee’s finger nails due to attempts in the past to use them as an instrument to harm himself and others. </para>

<para>My Portfolio does not have a whole of Government responsibility for this issue.</para>
<para>        Disclosure of commercial arrangements between radio current affairs presenters and sponsors is provided for by the Broadcasting Services (Commercial Radio Current Affairs Disclosure) Standard 2000.  The standard requires on-air disclosure during current affairs programs of commercial agreements between sponsors and presenters that have the potential to affect the content of those programs.  Commercial radio licensees are also required to provide the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) with particulars of each commercial agreement between sponsors and presenters of current affairs programs or their associates.  This register is published on the website of the ABA.  Licensees are also required to publish these details on any website operated by or on behalf of the licensee.  Compliance with the Standard is a condition of a broadcaster’s licence.</para>
<para>        The Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice also provides for the disclosure of commercial arrangements.  The Code requires the disclosure, by licensees, of any agreements or arrangements under which a licensee, an independent producer or a presenter agrees with a third party to endorse or feature the third party’s products or services in a factual program in exchange for consideration.   The disclosure must be made either during the program or in the credits of the program and should adequately bring the existence of any such commercial arrangement to the attention of viewers in a way that is readily understandable to a reasonable person. </para>
<para>        It should be noted that my Portfolio responsibilities for media issues in Australia do not include the operation of the print media.  Any concerns the honourable member may have regarding the impact of commercial agreements on the representation of news and current affairs in the print media should be directed to the Australian Press Council (APC).</para>

<para>At the time that the ABA released its report on the allocation of three community radio broadcasting licences for Sydney, it advised in a news release on 25 May 2001 that it had formed a preliminary view that an additional wide coverage community radio service should be made available in Sydney.</para>

<para>        On 27 February 2003 the ABA decided not to make the 1386 kHz frequency available for temporary community broadcasting due to problems that had recently been identified in relation to serious electro-magnetic compatibility and possible health and safety issues due to the location of the transmission tower at the nominal transmission site at Homebush Bay and its proximity to new residential areas.  The ABA advised that it would review this situation in 12 months time.</para>
<para>        In its 10 May 2004 news release, the ABA announced the commencement of its review to explore the issues surrounding the use of the 1386 kHz frequency in Sydney and possible options for its future use in the Sydney licence area.  Written submissions were sought from the public in relation to the matters raised in the paper.</para>

<para>I am advised that Sydney Christian Broadcasters Ltd (Rhema Sydney) was one of eight applicants for the community radio broadcasting licence to operate on the 1386 kHz frequency.  At the time of submitting its application, Rhema Sydney stated that it had over 4,249 financial members, provided petitions and letters of support with over 7,500 signatories and provided over 500 letters of support from churches.  Rhema quoted a 1998 Australian Community Survey that indicated that 20% of the Christian population (476,000 people in Sydney) attended a church on a monthly basis.  It claimed a target audience of between 237,000 and 755,000 people; however, did not provide evidence to support this.  It should also be noted that there is already a community radio broadcasting service licensed in Sydney to serve this Christian community.</para>

<para>        The jurisdiction with respect to foreign ships falls variously within 12 nautical miles, 24 nautical miles and 200 nautical miles.  Australia has sovereignty within the 12 nautical mile territorial sea claimed by Proclamation in the Gazette No. S 297, 1990, under section 7 of the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973. Therefore, Customs enforces a range of Commonwealth laws.</para>
<para>        The jurisdiction with respect to foreign ships between 12 nautical miles and 24 nautical miles is limited to establishing the identity of a ship or, the prevention or punishment of a contravention or an attempted contravention in Australia of the Customs Act 1901 or an Act prescribed by regulations consistently with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).  The Acts prescribed are the Migration Act 1958, Quarantine Act 1908, Fisheries Management Act 1991 and the Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1984.</para>
<para>        The jurisdiction with respect to foreign ships between 12 nautical miles and 200 nautical miles is the exercise of board and/or search powers where there is a suspicion that that the vessel is, will be or has been involved in a contravention, or attempted contravention, in Australia’s Exclusive Economic Zone of the Fisheries Management Act 1991.</para>
<para>        Generally states do not have jurisdiction over foreign ships on the high seas.  There are three exceptions to this that allow a boarding to be made and powers to be exercised over foreign ships.  The first exception is where an agreement exists between Australia and the flag state of the foreign ship. No such agreements are currently in place.  The second exception is to board a ship without nationality to establish the ship’s identity.  The third exception is exercising powers over a mother ship that may be on the high seas.  That is, although the mother ship is located on the high seas it is linked to a ship closer to Australia (daughter ship) and the two ships are involved in a contravention of Australian law.</para>

<para>—The Minister for Justice and Customs has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The AFP has a sophisticated and pre-existing methodology for accepting, allocating and monitoring matters referred to it for investigation.  In considering acceptance or rejection of referrals the AFP applies its Case Categorisation &amp; Prioritisation Model (CCPM).  Decisions to accept or reject a referral take into account a number of variables including CCPM classification, referral evaluation and recommendation, and available capacity. </para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The AFP has a number of publicly available stated performance measures against which it monitors its outputs. The AFP makes decisions on the allocation of capacity to crime types and geographical offices based on its understanding of the criminal activity and the requirements of client agencies.  As part of its regular performance review, the AFP monitors the potential displacement of current activities by the demands of emerging threats.  In particular, the AFP has been vigilant to the possible impact of its overseas operations on its ability to conduct domestic criminal investigations.  </para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The AFP monitors its activity through operational hours allocated to a matter and through the results achieved. Performance reports are provided to the National Managers Group each month and to the Executive Management Board every two months, and these provide an opportunity for a number of interventions to occur where decisions concerning resource allocations are seen to impact work delivery.   The nature of the AFP’s core activities has changed over the past five years especially with respect to overseas operations.  The impact of these changes on domestic operations has been minimal both in terms of activity levels and results achieved.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Details of the impact on domestic operations is included in the following answers addressing your specific questions.</para>
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>The IDG deployment force is made up of resources from the AFP’s Outcome 1 areas, ACT Policing and from State Police forces.   In order to permit the deployment of resources without impact on domestic operations the AFP has specifically a) recruited staff into ACT Policing and specifically into the IDG, b) encouraged voluntary movement of staff across the AFP business streams, c) has redirected some work to offices with available capacity and d) seconded staff to international work directly from state police services.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>AFP staff do not move to the IDG permanently, but for an agreed period of deployment.   This arrangement allows for a fixed term allocation, which in turn is covered through a backfilling strategy.   For example a 70-week EOI process allows staff to voluntarily apply to fixed length transfer to encourage movement across AFP business streams to maintain appropriate resource levels.   This movement is balanced by recruitment strategies which to date have seen more than 170 staff come into the AFP.   The recruitment strategies target a balance between fixed term engagement and permanent appointment to the AFP.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>The AFP examines the operational case load of each deployed officer well in advance of deployment, and makes decisions about case load and allocation.    Prior to deploying a member overseas or to another geographic location the member and their supervisor review cases allocated to the member to identify cases that can be completed prior to deployment and those needing re-allocating to a new case manager.   Because of the resource management decisions taken, and because the management of case load is continually reviewed, the AFP has experienced minimal impact on its domestic operations because of its IDG involvement.   Performance measures quoted in the following answers, particularly to Question 6, demonstrate this position.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>Prior to deploying a member overseas or to another geographic location, the member and their supervisor review cases allocated to the member to identify cases that can be completed prior to deployment and those needing re-allocated to a new case officer.  When a case is re-allocated the new case officer is provided with briefing and reviews case situation reports to become appraised of the case.  In the case of major investigations a second case officer and/or core team may be allocated to the investigation to ensure continuity of investigation.</para>
</item>
<item label="(5)">
<para>The number of matters rejected is indicative both of internal resource availability and demands by client agencies.  Matters rejected increased from a low of 184 in 2000 to a peak of 389 in 2002 (impacted by the Bali bombing investigation), but have since declined to 288 in 2004.</para>
</item>
<item label="(6)">
<para>The AFP has committed itself to investigating serious crime.  Over the five years from 2000 to 2004, the number of High or Very High Impact matters has increased from 386 new cases in 2000 to 700 new cases in 2004.</para>
<para>        Over the same period, the total number of domestic cases has decreased by 19%, primarily because minor matters have increasingly been handled by alternative strategies, e.g. outposted officers. </para>
<para>        The number of cases finalised has remained steady over the period.</para>
<para>        The number of cases resulting in convictions has increased from 282 in 2000 to 300 in 2004. The quantity of illegal drugs seized has remained high over the five-year period increasing from 2.0 tonne in 2000 to 2.6 tonne in 2004.  Results in the intervening years are variable.</para>
<para>        Over the past five years, the AFP has met its Portfolio Budget Target of 65% of resources devoted to High or Very High Impact matters.</para>
</item>
<item label="(7)">
<para>As indicated above, the AFP will continue to monitor the impact of emerging operational activity on traditional law enforcement activity.</para>

<para>No.  Joint investigations between the AFP and State law enforcement agencies utilise liaison officers who have access to agency on line services.  Joint initiatives between the Commonwealth and State law enforcement agencies are further supplemented by installing AFP and relevant State agencies on line services within the joint investigative team to service the requirements of the investigation.  Information is readily shared between the Commonwealth and State law enforcement agencies through the application of a variety of non AFP information systems when appropriate.</para>

<para>There are no computer systems which automatically advise either the AFP or State law enforcement agencies of information regarding an investigation.  However procedures have been implemented to facilitate information flow between agencies.  In any investigation regular consultation occurs between agencies and in many instances agencies are co-located to facilitate information flow.  The appointment of agency liaison officers to investigations assists in cross-agency information sharing.  The AFP and State police conduct nation wide criminal history checks to access cross-jurisdictional information regarding persons of interest.   AFP computer terminals are being progressively installed in State Police Operation Centres (POC) to enable access to AFP systems for specific incidents or investigations. </para>

<item label="(2)">
<para>From the data provided in the Electorate reports it is not possible to provide a simple explanation for the variation between electoral divisions in the prescribing of dexamphetamine. Establishing the reasons for such variations is complicated by the uncertainty of the data. Dexamphetamine is currently the only drug listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) specifically for the treatment of ADHD. As dexamphetamine is priced under the general patient co-payment of $28.60, there is limited available information on the number of prescriptions and prescribing patterns. The Health Insurance Commission only collects data where a Government benefit is paid. As such we do not have data on prescriptions that cost less than the general co-payment amount. In addition, as dexamphetamine is classified as a Schedule 8 medicine (see 3 below), the states and territories are responsible for collecting data on the prescribing of these drugs.</para>

<item label="(3)">
<para>I encourage best practice in providing guidance to doctors on the quality use of medicines. Best practice guidance comes through sources such as the National Health and Medical Research Council and through National Health Priorities initiatives.</para>
<para>The Australian Government does not regulate the treatment and prescribing practices of doctors. The decision to prescribe medications, including medicines for the treatment of ADHD, is a judgment made by a doctor approved to prescribe by their respective state and territory health departments with regard to individual circumstances.</para>
<para>The states and territories regulate the prescribing of some drugs as they are classified as Schedule 8 Drugs – drugs of addiction. Most states and territories only allow dexamphetamine to be prescribed by an ‘authorised’ prescriber, such as a consultant pediatrician or a consultant psychiatrist.</para>
<para>Medicines for ADHD should always be prescribed as part of a comprehensive treatment program which includes psychological, educational and social remedial measures.</para>

<para>(i) (ii) and (iii) Mortality data is predominantly provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) and is based on registered death certificates received from state and territory registrars of births, deaths and marriages. </para>
<para>        Deaths are classified according to ICD-10-AM which is the international statistical classification of diseases and health related problems.  ICD-10-AM classifications of deaths from causes including drug use are attributed to the event leading to the death rather than by the specific drug per se.  For example, death may be recorded as caused by lung cancer (malignant neoplasm) or a motor vehicle accident.  Hence, information on drug-related deaths is not available for every year since 2000.</para>
<para>        For alcohol and tobacco, the Department has estimates of deaths derived using the aetiological fraction methodology.  This methodology relies on the prevalence of a risk factor and associated relative risk of a particular illness or injury.  According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, the aetiological fractions methodology shows that in 1998 some 19,019 people died in Australia as a result of tobacco smoking.  Information from the National Drug Research Institute for alcohol shows that in 2001 an estimated 3,004 people died as a consequence of risky or high risk levels of alcohol consumption.</para>
<para>        The Australian Bureau of Statistics Information Paper (2003) Drug Induced Deaths 2001 provides some information about deaths attributed to drug use (excluding alcohol, tobacco and volatile substances) in Australia.  This indicated that in 2001 there were 1,038 drug-induced deaths registered. </para>

<para>—The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>As at 28 February 2005, there were 1824 s417 requests before both the Minister and the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs.  It should be noted that there is no application for Ministerial Intervention under s417.  Section 417 of the Migration Act 1958 provides the Minister with the power to substitute for a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal, a decision which is more favourable to the applicant, if the Minister considers that it is in the public interest to do so.  This power is not compellable and the Minister does not have an obligation to consider substituting a more favourable decision in a case.  In all cases where a review authority affirms a decision on a Protection Visa application, an assessment against the Minister’s guidelines is undertaken by the Department.  If the case falls within the guidelines, a submission is prepared to enable the Minister to decide whether he or she wishes to consider the case for intervention.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>The s417 power is not delegated.  Both Ministers exercise their s417 Ministerial Intervention power in their own right.  The division of cases between the two Ministers is broadly determined by whether or not the cases are deemed to be made by individuals in the community or cases deemed to be made by individuals in detention.  The division of responsibilities for s417 Ministerial Intervention cases between portfolio Ministers is determined by categories and not by the number of cases.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>Under administrative arrangements put in place after Minister McGauran was appointed as Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs on 26 October 2004, Senator Vanstone handles section 417 intervention cases covering people in detention, while Mr McGauran handles the intervention cases covering people who are not in detention.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>Departmental systems do not maintain statistics on average processing times for Ministerial Intervention processes in a reportable format.  Variations in processing may be determined by the individual aspects of a particular case.  The power for the Minister to intervene is exhausted only when finalisation of the case is determined.  Every person whose case is brought to the Minister’s attention is advised of his or her decision, whether it is a decision to refuse to consider exercising the public interest powers, or a decision following consideration of the exercise of those powers.</para>
</item>
<item label="(5)">
<para>As at 28 February 2005, there were 1824 requests processed by the Department or being considered by the Minister.  Of these, nine per cent or 171 requests were detention cases.</para>

<item label="(1)">
<para>and (2) Job Network is administered on the basis of 19 Labour Market Regions and 137 Employment Services Areas (ESAs), the boundaries of which do not align with those of Federal Electorates.  Job seekers choose Job Network members for a variety of reasons including location, proximity to transport routes and Centrelink offices, or the satisfaction of friends and others.  Job seekers residing in one Electorate or ESA may be assisted through Job Network sites located in adjoining Electorates or ESAs.  For illustration, job seekers residing in the Electorate of Capricornia may be assisted through Job Network sites located in the Electorates of Dawson, Kennedy, Maranoa or Hinkler.  The Emerald ESA, Gladstone ESA, Mackay ESA, Rockhampton ESA and Townsville ESA are most closely aligned with the Electorate of Capricornia and, therefore, answers are provided with reference to these five ESAs. </para>
<para>        There are currently 12 Job Network members and other Job Placement Organisations operating in the Emerald ESA, 11 in the Gladstone ESA, 20 in the Mackay ESA, 18 in the Rockhampton ESA and 40 in the Townsville ESA.

<para>—The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>The SES methodology calculates an SES score for each school based on all the Census Collection Districts (CDs) from which the school draws it students.  The data present an average socioeconomic profile of the school community, that is, the families of students at the school.  The SES model does not set out to measure the wealth of any individual family or school, but rather to rank schools relative to each other based on the SES of each school’s community.</para>
<para>        Following the SES Simulation Project undertaken in 1998, a series of validation exercises were carried out using the simulation results against other parental income and wealth measures.  The findings of the validation exercises support the view that a Census-based SES measure produces a good proxy for parental socioeconomic status, without the intrusiveness and administrative complexity inherent in measuring parental income more directly.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>The SES approach is a transparent and objective measure based on Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Census data that are consistent for all schools.  The SES Index that is used to calculate schools’ SES scores measures the income, education and occupation levels of all residents within a CD.  The SES score of each student’s home CD is the only factor that contributes to the school’s SES score.  There is no discrimination between boarding and non‑boarding students.</para>
<para>        Data collected by the Department of Education, Science and Training in 2003 show that there were over 140 independent boarding schools, enrolling some 11,000 boarding students.  These students come from a wide range of CDs in both urban and rural areas, with about 45 per cent coming from urban areas.</para>
<para>        The data also show that schools with boarding students are not advantaged by the SES funding formula.  In many instances, boarding schools which are located in the same area as day schools have a similar or higher SES score than the day schools.  For example:</para>
<para>·         there are two boarding schools located in Wahroonga, NSW; the four other non-government schools located in this suburb all have lower SES scores</para>
<para>·         in Hawthorn, Victoria there are six non-government schools, one of which is an boarding school with an SES score of 124; three of the remaining schools have scores below 124 while the other two have scores of 125</para>
<para>·         there are five schools located in Brisbane, one of which is a boarding school with an SES score of 116; the other four schools have scores of 102, 113, 117 and 119</para>
<para>·         the two boarding schools in the ACT have SES scores of 119 and 124; the 13 other schools in the ACT, which also cater for secondary students, have scores ranging from 100 to 122.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>A review of the SES funding arrangements will be undertaken during the current quadrennium.  The review will involve consultations with all non‑government school groups and these discussions will inform policy development for the funding of non‑government schools for 2009‑2012.</para>

<para>While it would be inappropriate to directly intervene in private sector markets, the Government has introduced a range of measures to improve the competitiveness of fruit and vegetable growers. The Government has gained improved access to export markets for fruit and vegetable growers and recently introduced legislation to amend the Trade Practices Act to make it quicker, simpler and easier to collectively negotiate with buyers of their produce. The Government also provides matching research and development funding for fruit and vegetable industries, to help them lower industry costs and provides support for industry training.</para>

<item label="(2)">
<para>There are a number of Government programs available to assist farmers experiencing a loss of income. The Agriculture – Advancing Australia Farm Help Program, is the Government’s key means of providing short term income support to low-income farm families who are experiencing financial hardship. There is also Exceptional Circumstances Assistance for farmers experiencing a severe and prolonged decline in income due to a rare and severe event. Interim income support is also available where a prima facie case for Exceptional Circumstances Assistance has been demonstrated.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>The Government helps farmers including fruit and vegetable growers face challenges such as increased costs through its Agriculture – Advancing Australia package of programs. This package of programs is targeted at helping producers become more competitive, sustainable and profitable by improving business management, supporting families through change, providing access to professional advice, improving access to markets and building industry capacity to meet future challenges. Australian Government funding of over $1 billion since 1997 for these programs demonstrates the Government’s strong commitment to ensuring the long-term prosperity of rural and regional Australia.</para>

<item label="(1)">
<para>Australia does not return anybody who is found to be a refugee to a place of persecution.  People who have been found to be refugees are free to leave Australia at any time should they wish to do so and are not obliged to inform the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) of this.  DIMIA does not advise clients about safety in returning to their home country.  Some 3.5 million Afghan refugees and former refugees have returned to Afghanistan in recent years, many under UNHCR auspices (including some 200,000 Afghans of Hazara ethnicity).</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>As stated above, DIMIA does not provide advice on safety to return.  The Department’s Country Information Service maintains information on provinces and districts of concern within Afghanistan from a wide range of sources.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>The Department’s Country Information Service maintains comprehensive information on the human rights and security situations in countries around the world.  Afghanistan, including Afghans of the Hazara ethnicity, is a priority for country research.  The Country Information Service is in close consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade network of overseas posts as well as the equivalent governmental country research agencies in Europe and North America.  There is also close consultation with non-government and inter-governmental organisations (dealing with human rights concerns) and individual country experts, as well as extensive and continuous monitoring of academic, media and Internet information sources.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>A decision-maker must be satisfied that the applicant has met all legislative requirements for grant of a permanent protection visa.  One of these requirements is that the decision-maker is satisfied that the applicant is owed protection obligations under the Refugees Convention.  In reaching their conclusion the decision-maker considers whether the applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason at the time of decision.</para>
</item>
<item label="(5)">
<para>Australia does not return anybody who is found to be a refugee. </para>
<para>        The Australian Government has not sought such assurances.  The most effective way to ensure that persons do not suffer persecution if returned to their homeland is to have a robust process to identify refugees and protect them so that they are not returned.  Australia has such a process which includes access to merits review by an independent tribunal of any unsuccessful protection claim.  Applicants who are unsuccessful at the tribunal level have access to judicial review by the courts.  Their cases are closely and regularly monitored to identify any instances in which the Ministerial intervention powers may be appropriately used to either to allow a fresh protection visa application to be lodged or to grant a visa on non refugee grounds.  This process allows consideration of claims that may raise Australia’s protection obligations under other international human rights instruments to which Australia is a party.  The persons returned have been conclusively found not to face any well founded fear of persecution. To date there have been no involuntary returns to Afghanistan.</para>

<para>Where an application for a further protection visa has been made, it is necessary for decision-makers to be satisfied afresh that the applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution for a convention reason.  This assessment includes an assessment of whether the cessation clauses of the Convention apply to all of the claims made by the applicant, at the time of decision.  To date, the courts have agreed with the Department’s approach to assessment.  The Department has been successful in all eight matters involving applicants for further protection which have proceeded to final court hearing and judgment. </para>

<para>Departmental representatives attended the second Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group (IGWG) on the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) in Geneva from 31 January to 4 February 2005.  Delegation members interacted formally and informally with a large number of other delegations.  A full list of participants at the meeting is available from the House of Representatives Table Office.</para>
<para>        During the period December 2004 to February 2005, the two months leading up to the second session of the Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group on the FCTC, there were a number of informal communications at Departmental level with New Zealand, Canada and Japan. </para>
<para>        Departmental representatives attended a session of the first meeting of the Pacific Senior Health Officials Network on 26 November 2004.  The Network meeting was attended by representatives from Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Samoa, Vanuatu, Tonga and Nauru. </para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>The IGWG meeting held in Geneva from 31 January 2005 to 4 February 2005 discussed a number of matters that will be referred to the first FCTC Conference of the Parties (COP), particularly the arrangement for the permanent secretariat and the Rules of Procedure for the COP.</para>
<para>        Various models for the secretariat were discussed and several principles agreed, including housing of the secretariat within World Health Organization (WHO) and the need for maximum synergy between the secretariat and other WHO programs, especially the Tobacco Free Initiative, to avoid duplication and ensure value for money.  There was agreement that the secretariat arrangements need to be reviewed after two years.  Many of the draft Rules of Procedure were agreed but some key issues (status of non-Party country observers, involvement by non-governmental organisations, and procedures for consensus decision making) will need to be further considered by the COP.  The IGWG also agreed that the COP should follow the financial rules of the World Health Assembly.  The meeting also reviewed the terms of reference for a study of actual and potential sources of financial assistance for the implementation of the FCTC.  This will be undertaken by the WHO Tobacco Free Initiative as interim secretariat to the COP.  The outcomes of this meeting are expected to be available on the World Health Organization website www.who.int/tobacco/framework.</para>
<para>        While the IGWG meeting inevitably focussed on administrative detail, these discussions played an important role in establishing the necessary infrastructure for the COP to begin consideration of substantive tobacco control issues such as product regulation and cross-border advertising.</para>
<para>        Informal communications with New Zealand, Canada and Japan during December 2004 and January 2005 included topics such as countries views on the approach to be taken at the upcoming Working Group meeting.  These communications provided Australia with an understanding of these countries broad policy position on matters such as the secretariat for the Convention’s Conference of the Parties.</para>
<para>        The session of Pacific Senior Health Officials Network meeting attended by Departmental representatives on 26 November 2004 discussed various matters on tobacco including the economic impact of tobacco in the region and the FCTC.  There was general understanding that through the Network there would be benefit from future exchanges about tobacco policy issues.</para>
<para>        The Pacific Senior Health Officials Network aims to support the Australian Government’s agenda of public sector capacity building by pooling expertise and skills to meet shared health challenges, create linkages between the Department of Health and Ageing and Health Ministries in the Pacific, facilitate communication and provide opportunities to work together and share best practice.</para>
