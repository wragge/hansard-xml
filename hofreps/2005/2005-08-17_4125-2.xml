<para class="block">This <inline ref="R2418">bill</inline> makes a number of amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989—the act—to better secure compliance with Australia’s high standards for therapeutic goods.</para>
<para>These amendments follow on amendments to the act made in May 2003 in the wake of a succession of serious safety and quality breaches by a major Australian manufacturer of therapeutic goods—Pan Pharmaceuticals Ltd—which necessitated unprecedented regulatory action to protect the Australian public from medicines manufactured in a way that posed a threat to public health and safety. Since that time evidence from further monitoring and auditing by Australia’s therapeutic goods regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), has shown that further amendments to the act are required to more effectively address continuing failure by other manufacturers to adequately comply with regulatory requirements.</para>
<para>The main purpose of the amendments is to provide new alternative enforcement options to enable the TGA to deal more effectively and efficiently with suppliers and manufacturers who may place public health and safety at risk by failing to fully comply with regulatory requirements including product and manufacturing standards. The amendments represent the government’s determination to respond to deficiencies arising from the limited range of enforcement measures presently available to the TGA and are considered necessary to enable the TGA to adequately protect public health and safety. Existing options for dealing with breaches of regulatory requirements are restricted to either criminal prosecution or administrative sanctions such as withdrawing the sponsor’s or manufacturer’s right to continue marketing or manufacturing therapeutic goods. Resort to either of these options may not, in some circumstances, be appropriate or achieve the optimal regulatory outcome, given the time and resources taken to prosecute offenders and the possible need to maintain supply of products to the public because of their essential nature or the lack of available substitute products.</para>
<para>These new provisions are designed to overcome these difficulties and ensure that the TGA can take timely, appropriate and effective action to discourage sponsors and manufacturers from not fully complying with regulatory requirements, particularly when this is driven or influenced by commercial considerations at the expense of public health and safety.</para>
<para>The new package of sanctions is built on existing conduct already regulated as an offence under the act.</para>
<para>Several important measures are introduced in this bill.</para>
<para>In relation to a number of significant existing offences the bill introduces a tiered regime of criminal offences that is intended to better tailor penalties for criminal conduct so that more serious offences resulting in, or likely to cause, harm or injury will attract heavier criminal sanctions. The penalties for higher tiered offences, that require proof of an aggravating element relating to harm or injury, are significantly higher than the corresponding offences without the aggravating element to reflect the more serious consequences flowing from breaches of regulatory requirements that result in, or will pose, a serious and direct threat to public health and safety. The level of penalties for offences with an aggravating element is comparable to those contained in other Commonwealth legislation.</para>
<para>Under the bill penalty levels for some offences are increased to ensure consistency of penalties across the act.</para>
<para>The bill allows for alternative verdicts in respect of the various tiered offences in relation to the same conduct regulated under the act. This measure allows a jury to convict a person of the lesser offence, if the jury acquits the person of an offence specifying an aggravating element but is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of facts that prove the person is guilty of the lesser offence relating to the same conduct. This provision is necessary in view of the tiered offence regime regulating conduct that consists of the same physical elements. This approach is modelled on similar alternative verdict provisions in other Commonwealth legislation.</para>
<para>Under the bill a defendant may be required to provide a pre-disclosure notice of evidence, in support of a defence to an offence related to dealings with unapproved goods, prior to the defendant being committed to trial or the determination or hearing by a court of summary jurisdiction. It provides the Director of Public Prosecutions with a way of adequately assessing evidence of an exception to the offence claimed by a defendant prior to committal or hearing. The pre-trial disclosure requirement is similar to that provided under the New South Wales Criminal Procedure Act 1986.</para>
<para>The bill introduces a parallel civil penalty regime for breaches of the act. The inclusion in the act of civil penalties, alongside criminal penalties, will allow for an alternative and quicker process for dealing with a wide range of legislative breaches. Civil penalties are expected to be more effective in deterring and preventing noncompliance with regulatory requirements by body corporates, who represent the bulk of those regulated under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 and regulations.</para>
<para>Higher penalty levels attach to civil penalties because they are designed to provide adequate incentives, especially in relation to well-resourced corporate entities, for deterring breaches of regulatory requirements under the act. The inclusion of alternative civil penalties and criminal offences is an effective strategy that has worked well under other Commonwealth legislation.</para>
<para>The bill introduces infringement notices (on-the-spot fines) for strict liability offences and for conduct that is subject to the new civil penalty regime. Use of infringement notices will allow appropriate enforcement action to be taken where readily assessable elements of a breach are identified and where use of other enforcement options are not warranted. An infringement notice, which will set out the particulars of the offence, is intended to give the offender the option of either paying the penalty specified in the notice or electing to have the matter dealt with by a court. If paid on time no further liability arises. If not so paid, the matter may be subject to subsequent court proceedings. The bill introduces provisions that enable the TGA to accept enforceable undertakings by a person either to remedy breaches of regulatory requirements or to not engage in future contraventions. Enforceable undertakings are a form of administrative resolution based on voluntary undertakings given by the person concerned as an alternative to litigation or regulatory action. If an undertaking is breached the TGA may seek enforcement of the undertaking by the Federal Court. The use of this measure may be more efficient and productive in particular circumstances, such as where a deficiency in a manufacturing process needs to be rectified by a manufacturer whose general manufacturing ability is not in question. The use of enforceable undertakings in appropriate situations will ensure that public health and safety is assured while access to therapeutic goods for which the public has a continuing need is maintained. The power to accept enforceable undertakings is already given under Commonwealth legislation to other regulators such as the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.</para>
<para>Enforceable undertakings cannot be unilaterally enforced by the TGA and can only be used where those regulated agree to their use.</para>
<para>The bill provides for certain offences to extend to conduct by an Australian citizen or Australian body corporate outside Australia, and to conduct by an Australian resident outside Australia where there is an equivalent offence in the laws of the relevant overseas jurisdiction.</para>
<para>The offences that will be extended extraterritorially relate to the making of false and misleading statements in a material particular in connection with an application to include therapeutic goods in the register, the manufacture, supply, export or import of counterfeit therapeutic goods, the manufacture or supply of tampered goods and the failure to notify the secretary or the National Manager of the Therapeutic Goods Administration about actual or potential tampering of therapeutic goods.</para>
<para>These particular offence provisions have been given extended extraterritorial application in order to ensure that a person who would ordinarily be subject to the laws of Australia, had the conduct occurred within Australia, will be held accountable for the same conduct undertaken whilst the person is not in Australia, on the basis that the conduct, undertaken externally, could result in a significant impact on the health and safety of the Australian community.</para>
<para>The bill extends the powers by an authorised person available under monitoring warrants to secure appropriate evidence in respect of a contravention or suspected contravention of civil penalty provisions. The bill also introduces a new search and seizure warrant relating to contraventions of civil penalty provisions. The provisions reflect similar requirements in the act for offence related warrants.</para>
<para>The bill extends the liability of a body corporate to executive officers who are directly involved in its day-to-day management if the body corporate commits an offence or contravenes a civil penalty provision. This measure ensures that executive officers who are in a position to prevent a contravention by the body corporate will be deemed liable for the contravention if they fail to take reasonable steps to do so.</para>
<para>The bill extends the circumstances in which the TGA is authorised to release information it holds in relation to therapeutic goods. The bill specifically permits the public release of information relating to any regulatory decisions and actions taken under the act and regulations. In addition, the bill also authorises the release of information relating to a breach or an alleged breach of the act or regulations involving therapeutic goods to Australian and overseas regulatory agencies. This extra capacity to disseminate such information will assist in improving the TGA’s ability to protect public health and safety.</para>
<para>The bill provides substantial measures to improve the regulation of therapeutic goods. The expanded range of enforcement mechanisms under the bill provides a more flexible approach to securing compliance with the regulatory scheme. The introduction of civil penalties means that noncompliant persons can be fined rather than prosecuted in appropriate circumstances. In a number of cases this may be the TGA’s preferred course of action unless the conduct has the characteristic of criminality and is likely to cause or has caused harm or injury to consumers. The level of fines applicable in a particular case will be determined by a court and will reflect its assessment of the seriousness of the conduct in question. The payment of fines rather than conviction is likely to be preferable to many persons in view of the adverse consequences on a person following a conviction.</para>
<para>With the new measures the TGA will be better placed to deter a company’s continuing breaches of regulatory requirements before they become so serious that administrative action has to be taken that could put the company out of business.</para>
<para>Deterring noncompliance by the industry as a whole is important in protecting consumers but it also creates a fairer environment for all players as law-abiding sponsors and manufacturers are not unfairly disadvantaged by their noncompliant competitors. Increased compliance also leads to greater credibility and attractiveness of marketed products.</para>
<para>The confidence of the community in the safety of therapeutic goods is of great importance. The observance of Australia’s regulatory requirements for therapeutic goods by suppliers and manufacturers enhances the reputation of Australian industry. The provisions in the bill represent appropriate measures to protect the interests of both the community and industry.</para>

<para>—I continue my remarks from last night’s debate. The reason why the <inline ref="R2234">Workplace Relations Amendment (Small Business Employment Protection) Bill 2004</inline> needs to be introduced into the parliament is the decision by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to overturn small business’s exemption from redundancy pay obligations. The Australian Labor Party’s blocking of unfair dismissal reform in the Senate on over 40 occasions demonstrates that the Labor members in the other house are certainly not friends of the small business community. It is unfortunate that their stance has been supported by the recent decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to impose redundancy pay obligations on the small business community. In this instance, it is not the ALP and their blind allegiance to the militant unions that is placing a noose on small business; it is the AIRC itself. That is a real shame. It is a disgrace.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The AIRC’s decision highlights the deficiencies within the antiquated industrial relations system, which is not up to speed with the needs of modern small business in modern Australia. The fact that there is a need for this bill hammers home the piecemeal pace at which industrial relations reform has taken place in Australia. While many sectors in the economy have adapted and evolved with change, our current industrial relations system is restricted by the parameters of the past. The commission is a creature of initial post Federation Australia. Our economy and our business sector continually strive to adapt to the ever globalising environment. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission however, as a bastion of the traditional industrial club, has continued to stand out as a key example of how the system can stifle modern workplace agreements. The failure of the commission to provide sufficient protection for small businesses against often financially crippling redundancy payments highlights the commission’s disconnection from the needs of our small business community. It also highlights a strong need to reform the commission. I welcome the decision of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations to introduce as part of the coming reforms a new Fair Pay Commission along the lines of that currently operating in the United Kingdom.</para>
<para>This important reform will help drag the industrial relations system into the 21st century and will create a real benefit for small business. A strong and sustainable economy is vital for the small business sector to prosper. They do not have the buffer zones within their budgets to absorb an economic downturn and, if things are going well, a small business should be able to put on extra staff. This productive improvement for small business will also enable the local community to share in the net benefit of the strong business climate.</para>
<para>We know that there should not be a ‘one size fits all’ approach to our industrial relations system. It is unfortunate, but the Labor Party’s opposition to this bill highlights that they are increasingly out of touch. They look at industrial relations as something that can so easily be implemented and imposed on businesses no matter what their size. In a strong economy small businesses create employment. The last thing that the small business sector needs is an impediment and a disincentive placed upon it by the AIRC through pressure from an ever irrelevant Australian Council of Trade Unions, which is suffering from underrepresentation in the Australian work force.</para>
<para>Historically the industrial relations system has adapted to contemporary requirements at a snail’s pace. More than ever before, it is evident that large centralised bodies such as the government and the commission have less of a role to play in efficient employment arrangements within small business. This bill is vitally important. Its purpose goes right to the heart of the small business liability. If not passed, the vast majority of small businesses covered by federal awards will eventually be subject to redundancy payments for their employees in accordance with the Industrial Relations Commission’s decision. With the commission’s decision pointing the IR system in a ‘one size fits all’ direction, there is a need for legislative change to guarantee protection for small business.</para>
<para>The bill underlines the current need for reform within this system. The commission’s decision will impose an unfair financial burden on small businesses. Every employee and their employer deserve the right to negotiate and reach an agreement on employment and salary packages. One must ask how far we have actually come in workplace relations given the fact that this piece of legislation is even needed. Small businesses were exempted by the commission’s predecessor, the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, in 1984.</para>
<para>The decision to exempt small businesses from mandatory severance pay was an ironic step in the right direction by that commission during the time of the former Labor government. It is perplexing to understand why the current Labor opposition are against this bill, considering that those exemptions were put in place when they were in power. More importantly, it is also perplexing when one realises that state based industrial relations commissions around Australia—of course, all in Labor states—have created this exemption as well.</para>
<para>Two years prior to the coalition’s election in 1996, the New South Wales Industrial Commission reaffirmed the need for the small business exemption. Just recently, the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission continued the almost unanimous view that the exemption made plain commonsense. The question remains: why did the national commission go against this trend and why will federal Labor also go against this trend? It is a trend so readily accepted by their mates in Queensland and New South Wales. I ask that the Labor opposition rethink their view on this issue and realise that their position is contrary to the practices that are taking place in other states and also from when they were in power at a federal level.</para>

<para>—From the viewpoint of the very many small business holders in my electorate of Hasluck, the <inline ref="R2234">Workplace Relations Amendment (Small Business Employment Protection) Bill 2004</inline> is very welcome, removing as it does onerous and unacceptable burdens placed upon them by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The bill will amend the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to ensure that those small businesses covered by federal awards will continue to enjoy an exemption from the need to provide redundancy payments—an exemption, I might add, which they have enjoyed since 1984.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>If the AIRC’s decision imposing such a burdensome obligation of redundancy payments is allowed to stand without challenge, it will directly impact on the ability of many thousands of small businesses to continue to operate and provide, as they do, much needed employment opportunities for local people in the community of the electorate of Hasluck. Members may recall that in my maiden speech to this House in November 2004 I made a commitment to small business within the electorate of Hasluck to work on their behalf to reduce the excessive burden placed on them by bureaucracies such as the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. I am therefore delighted to be able to stand here today to provide those small businesses with a loud voice to protect their interests.</para>
<para>Local businesses stand at the heart of many local communities, including my own, adding vibrancy, and providing valuable services and, most importantly, employment to the many constituents of Hasluck. This sector of our economy is one that truly underpins our economic capacity and, indeed, our Australian way of life. The 1.1 million non-agricultural small businesses that are spread throughout Australia are responsible for employing over 3.3 million people, and the role they play in economic growth and job creation within this nation should not be underestimated or go unrecognised. Any measure that threatens the viability of small business is therefore unwelcome and will have many undesirable consequences.</para>
<para>The small business sector is filled with some of our nation’s most self-reliant, innovative and entrepreneurial people. Small businesses operate the length and breadth of our country, from the smallest country town to the largest of our capital cities. For me, and indeed for the majority of people within my electorate of Hasluck and within this country as a whole, the decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission overturning the exemption from severance pay for businesses employing fewer than 15 employees is very baffling and puzzling in the extreme.</para>
<para>The exemption was granted with good reason by its predecessor over 20 years ago. It is therefore truly mystifying why the Australian Industrial Relations Commission should introduce a requirement that has the very real potential to result in the insolvency of many small business holders. It is a flawed decision, and one that must be extinguished by this bill. The decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has caused alarm and consternation. We must not allow excessive regulation and compliance standards to stand in the way or crush the aspirations of those hard-working and committed people who run small businesses and contribute so much to the communities in which they operate.</para>
<para>For many years I was the Chief Executive Officer of the Master Plumbers and Gasfitters Association as well as the Master Painters, Decorators and Signwriters Association. They served the interests of many small business operators in the building and construction sector, so I know from personal experience the difficult environment that many small businesses have to work in. The decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to impose the requirement to take on the obligation for redundancy payments stifles free enterprise and has the potential to be the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s back for many small businesses.</para>
<para>It is interesting to note that both the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission and the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission have reaffirmed the need for small business exemptions in this regard. It is also interesting to note that none of the four state governments that participated in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission test case supported the removal of the exemption. Indeed, my own state of Western Australia actively opposed the measure—why?—because it just does not make economic sense.</para>
<para>The Australian Industrial Relations Commission imposes a ridiculous and unreasonable financial burden on businesses that operate in often difficult circumstances and with tight margins. Typically, a small retailer employing just six or seven people could potentially find itself having to put aside many thousands of dollars into a contingency fund to cover its liability for severance pay. It is a cost that few if any but the most prosperous of small businesses can afford to bear. Those affected by this decision are not the BHPs or the News Corps of this world, with their multimillion- or even multibillion-dollar turnovers; they are often family owned businesses that, while paying their way, are not in a position to take on redundancy liabilities that can run into the tens of thousands of dollars.</para>
<para>The coalition and indeed the majority of reasonably minded people within this country oppose any unnecessary restraints on small business operators that make it more difficult for them to employ people. This government has consistently made its support for small businesses known and has translated that support into action. This bill shows that we will continue to oppose absurd and unwarranted impediments that will make it much harder for small businesses to provide jobs and contribute to the health of local economies.</para>
<para>The opposition is opposing the bill—not because the bill doesn’t make good sense, but rather out of political dogma and, I suspect, a desire to be seen to support the ACTU’s opposition to the exemption. In reality, it is also about protecting the Labor Party’s bottom line and the $47 million that the union movement has donated to the opposition over the last 10 years. It seems that Labor is prepared to leave small business operators and the millions of people that they employ out on a limb in order to line its own pockets.</para>
<para>The Labor Party is proposing a system whereby small businesses will have to make individual applications to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission for exemption from redundancy payments. The proposal is unreasonable—indeed absurd. It imposes an extra and totally unnecessary burden on small businesses and a degree of uncertainty that at the end of the day is just unacceptable. The Labor Party’s expectation is that small business owners should jump through hoops to deal with the bureaucracy of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The reason for doing so is to restore an exemption that should never have been removed in the first place.</para>
<para>Small business owners have neither the time nor the money to devote to such a farcical system, a system which previous experience has shown just does not and will not work. Such a system has been in operation for larger businesses for around 20 years; in all of that time  there does not appear to have been a single exemption granted. The Labor Party is once again failing small businesses in Australia in a deplorable and absolutely abysmal way. While at least the ACTU’s support for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission’s decision is understandable—it is after all a morally bankrupt institution—I find the Labor Party’s slavish following of the ACTU’s position repugnant.</para>
<para>It should be noted that this bill will not affect any redundancy pay provisions that were in awards prior to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission’s decision. Nor does the bill prevent small businesses from reaching an agreement with their employees on redundancy payments should they wish to and should they be able to afford to do so. Rather, the bill extinguishes an entitlement which previously did not exist and which small businesses were unable to plan for.</para>
<para>By introducing this bill, the coalition is going some way to deliver on its re-election promise to continue to pursue changes to take the unfair dismissal laws burden off the back of small businesses and protect small business from redundancy payments. In my view, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission seriously underestimated the adverse impact its decision would have on an important sector of the Australian economy. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission’s imposition of a ‘one size fits all’ regulation flies in the face of economic reality and small business imperatives. It also very seriously ignores the fact that small businesses simply cannot afford the financial burden it has imposed upon them. I wholeheartedly support this bill and recommend it to the House.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I would like to dedicate my speech on the <inline ref="R2234">Workplace Relations Amendment (Small Business Employment Protection) Bill 2004</inline> to the memory of Clive Macness, who passed away in February this year. Small business people in my electorate of Dobell cannot afford an increase in the cost of running their businesses—nor can the Central Coast economy. That is why I am here today debating this important bill. The <inline ref="R2055">Workplace Relations Amendment (Protecting Small Business Employment) Bill 2004</inline> proposes to amend the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to maintain the exemption for small business from redundancy pay by overturning a recent decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to impose redundancy pay obligations on small business.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>If this bill is not passed, hundreds of small businesses in my electorate will be required to make redundancy payments to their employees, which will result in the loss of many permanent jobs on the Central Coast. It will make the lives of small business people unnecessarily harder and will make them more reluctant to give new apprentices and disadvantaged groups like unemployed people the opportunity of full-time work.</para>
<para>The Australian Labor Party does not understand this. The Labor Party, which is beholden to union bosses, does not understand that small business is the biggest contributor to employment there is and needs to be supported for the future prosperity of our region. Small businesses need greater flexibility, because they do not have the same access to financial and human resources as larger businesses do. Unplanned expenses can threaten the viability of businesses and, importantly, the jobs of those working in those businesses. You can only pay people out of profit. The AIRC ruling is essentially a $190 million tax on the restructuring businesses need to undertake regularly just to survive. The Australian Labor Party simply cannot purport to support permanent jobs and then oppose this important legislation—and, in doing so, oppose much of the significant workplace relations reform that has taken place over the last decade.</para>
<para>Strangely enough, the Labor Party’s own policy concedes that many small businesses should be exempted from redundancy pay. It has proposed an ‘exemption’ system, in which affected small businesses can apply to the AIRC to be exempt from redundancy payments. The times when small businesses are forced to retrench people are typically times when their financial resources are stretched. It is absurd to expect that small businesses in that situation will have the money and the time available to run a case before the AIRC to have them exempted. The Labor Party does not really care about the challenges facing small business. The truth is that, by opposing this bill as well as our reforms to right of entry laws, unfair dismissal and compulsory union membership, the ALP is showing Australia that it is indifferent to non-union businesses and job creation.</para>
<para>I will take this opportunity to read a letter from a man named Phil Dulhunty, who wrote to me about the turmoil union bosses put his company through, eventually forcing him to sell his hard-earned business to a foreign company. I worked for this company in the late 1970s and early 1980s, so I experienced first-hand the havoc caused by bullying union bosses. The letter states:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">My consideration for Unions was totally destroyed when my company in Wyong was ‘invaded’ by the Storemen and Packers Union under the leadership of a fellow by the name of Simon Crean.</para>
<para class="block">My company, Dulmison, was founded by 3 ex servicemen in 1947 at the end of the Pacific War, using their deferred pay as initial capital. Over some 40 years, through hard work and enthusiasm the company grew to a size where we employed some 350 people and had a turnover of $50m. We established a large export market for our products in the electric power transmission industry. We manufactured and supplied all the fittings and equipment for the major 500kv grids of Victoria and NSW. We had established factories overseas in NZ, Thailand, UK, USA and South Africa and became the largest international supplier of these products.</para>
<para class="block">Because we had a factory in South Africa we came into the spotlight of the union movement who decided eventually to apply secondary boycott so that we could not ship any goods nor receive any from overseas.</para>
<para class="block">Mr Crean became incensed when he learned that none of our employees in Wyong were members of neither his union nor any other union. We were a decentralized manufacturer and most of our employees were local residents, country people, conscientious and hard working. There was a great esprit de corps amongst us all, managers, owners and workers.</para>
<para class="block">We invited Mr Crean and his men to visit and address the company employees and to recruit them into his union. Not one person was interested or prepared to join and the union representatives were invited to leave.</para>
<para class="block">This is what then led to the secondary boycott and the smashing of headlights of our employees’ cars in the company car park!</para>
<para class="block">Our company, all our employees, the Wyong district and the nation as a whole suffered immensely from this action.</para>
<para class="block">The union leaders had absolutely no concern for anything but themselves.</para>
<para class="block">As a result of Mr Crean’s action the Dulmison company, proudly Australian owned, had to be sold, eventually to an overseas company and is now owned 100% by Tyco of USA.</para>
<para class="block">If any political party is beholden in any way to support the union movement at the expense of the broader national interest, it will be to their doom along with Australia as a Nation.</para>
<para class="block">If the Labor Party is ever to get my vote again, they must reorganize the union movement or disassociate themselves entirely from it.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Mr Dulhunty is perfectly right. As it stands, 71 per cent of Labor members of parliament have union links, which is scandalous when you consider that average union membership in private industry is only 17 per cent. If the Australian Labor Party are serious about wanting to govern Australia, they need to understand what small Australian businesses need. What they need are laws that support them. Labor must support this legislation and put jobs in my electorate first, particularly permanent jobs. They can no longer support legislation that hinders non-union businesses and, in so doing, impedes jobs.</para>
<para>The AIRC’s decision is severely flawed. It is significant to note that none of the four state governments that participated in the AIRC test case supported the removal of the exemption. The Queensland and Western Australian governments opposed the removal, while the New South Wales and Victorian governments neither supported nor opposed it.</para>
<para>With a background in small business I understand what the AIRC ruling means for small businesses in the electorate of Dobell. A typical retail small business with seven employees, each with six years of continuous employment, would, under this ruling, face a contingent liability for redundancy pay of nearly $30,000. I know that there are business operators in my electorate who have taken a risk to provide some wealth for their families and are struggling, with their homes and their assets on the line. Forcing small businesses to make redundancy payments will serve only to push these businesses into insolvency. It is vital that opportunities for continued growth and job creation for the 1.4 million small businesses in Australia be maximised. It is even more essential for the 3.3 million people employed by these businesses.</para>
<para>The Howard government is the only government that is consistent and strong in its support for small business. It recognises that the biggest threat to jobs growth in Australia is the unnecessary impediments which make it harder for small businesses to employ people. I encourage members to dissociate themselves from the union movement and instead put small business and jobs in my electorate and across Australia first and foremost. I commend this bill to the House.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I thank all members for their valuable contribution to this debate on the <inline ref="R2234">Workplace Relations Amendment (Small Business Employment Protection) Bill 2004</inline>. While I understand some of the concerns raised, I sincerely hope that the opposition will finally join with the government and stand up for small businesses and their employees by supporting the key measures that are proposed in this bill.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This bill will ensure that small businesses with fewer than 15 employees that are covered by federal awards are not burdened by redundancy pay obligations. It will amend the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to maintain the exemption that has been in place for small businesses from redundancy pay and it will legislate to address the Australian Industrial Relations Commission decision of 26 March last year.</para>
<para>As honourable members know, the government introduced this bill to parliament on 8 December last year. Since then there have been a number of key developments that have further strengthened the case for this bill. These developments have made it increasingly obvious that the Industrial Relations Commission’s decision to impose redundancy pay on small business was a mistake that must be addressed. I am of course referring to the fact that, since the bill was first introduced, two state industrial relations tribunals have issued rulings rejecting union claims to adopt the AIRC’s decision and remove the small business exemptions in their states.</para>
<para>In December last year the full bench of the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission rejected for a second time a claim by the Queensland Council of Unions to remove the small business exemption. It first rejected the claim in October 2003. In its most recent decision the full bench declined to adopt the AIRC’s decision and instead reinforced its original decision. It stated:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">There are substantial reasons for a small business exemption and we again adopt those reasons referred to in our previous decision.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The Western Australian Industrial Relations Commission also refused to adopt the Australian Industrial Relations Commission decision in April this year, rejecting a claim by the Trades and Labour Council of Western Australia to impose redundancy pay provisions on the small business sector in that state. Rejecting the union’s claim, the Western Australian commission stated that they were ‘required to evaluate the evidence according to its weight and not merely adopt the conclusion of the AIRC’. The decision particularly relied on witness evidence that small business as a whole is inherently riskier than larger business and that small businesses have more difficulty in obtaining finance when required.</para>
<para>Two industrial relations tribunals were strongly urged by unions to accept the reasoning of the AIRC decision. Both refused to impose redundancy pay provisions on small business. The cumulative effect of these decisions has produced an untenable situation across Australia. Employees of small businesses located side by side can now have widely different redundancy entitlements, depending on whether they are covered by a state or federal award—in fact, employees of the same small business that is covered by a federal award and a state award can have significantly different entitlements. This situation is totally unsatisfactory and we believe it demands legislative action from this parliament now; yet our Labor colleagues would have this uncertainty and confusion for small business continue indefinitely. This is an irresponsible stance to take for both employees and employers. As well as protecting jobs, this bill will provide small businesses and their employees with consistency and certainty.</para>
<para>During the debate on this bill, we have heard from several Labor members about the incapacity of some small businesses to make redundancy payments. We now know that Labor accepts that the AIRC’s decision does not adequately protect small businesses that cannot afford redundancy pay. The Labor Party also accepts that many small businesses need to be exempted from redundancy pay. The Labor Party acknowledges that the AIRC’s decision as it stands will not achieve this. The only real difference between the government and Labor on this is how to go about protecting small businesses that cannot afford redundancy pay.</para>
<para>The government’s answer is clear and simple, and it will work. Our bill will exempt small businesses from new redundancy pay obligations and will enable employers and their employees to negotiate redundancy pay through workplace bargaining where a small business can afford it and it is a priority for employees. In contrast, the solution proposed by the member for Perth in his second reading amendment is for the government to ‘adopt mechanisms to address those individual businesses with a genuine incapacity to make redundancy payments’. The member for Perth elaborated that the government should ‘find mechanisms to assist those small businesses which genuinely cannot afford to make redundancy payments’. He said that the ‘process for small business employers to demonstrate an incapacity to pay should be readily accessible and simple’ and that they should not have to go through ‘expensive, time-consuming processes’ to prove incapacity.</para>
<para>This is the same alternative that Labor put forward over 12 months ago, except that, at that time, Labor wanted a Senate inquiry to find the mechanisms, not the government, and they suggested that electronic lodgment of applications might be the way to go. At least our Labor colleagues have learned since then that electronic lodgment already exists, has been tested and has been proven to be a complete failure in overcoming the notorious ineffectiveness of the incapacity to pay processes. I would have thought that, in the intervening 12 months, Labor might have been able to develop some specific proposals of their own, other than a wish for a simple and inexpensive process. It goes without saying that we all want all processes to be simple and inexpensive.</para>
<para>The incapacity to pay mechanism envisaged by Labor will not work. The incapacity to pay process is not capable of protecting small businesses from redundancy payments. I am surprised that Labor again put forward incapacity to pay processes as some kind of bandaid solution. It is particularly surprising given the recent developments in Queensland and Western Australia that I have just outlined. Both the Queensland and Western Australian industrial relations commissions had the option of using incapacity to pay processes to address the very real financial burden which small businesses would face if redundancy pay obligations were imposed on them. In fact, the unions argued before both commissions that this would be the appropriate way to deal with small businesses which could not afford redundancy payments.</para>
<para>So why did both the Queensland and Western Australian commissions reject these arguments and refuse to remove the small business exemption? It was because the evidence resoundingly shows that incapacity to pay processes do not work. The evidence also shows that the lack of financial resilience found in small businesses means that the only real option for this important sector of our economy is to retain the exemption for small businesses from redundancy pay obligations. Our Labor colleagues know this, yet they persist along the same worn track. One can only wonder why.</para>
<para>I note that some members believe that this bill undermines the authority and independence of the Industrial Relations Commission. I reiterate that legislation is the only possible option available to government to overturn this decision of the commission. On 3 April 2004, the Prime Minister publicly announced that the government would legislate to overturn the commission’s decision to impose redundancy pay obligations on small businesses under federal awards. The government sought and obtained a mandate on this issue at the subsequent October election. By delivering the Howard government a majority in both houses of parliament, the Australian people have made it clear where they stand on this issue. Australians realise the importance of protecting the job-generating capacity of small businesses and they have chosen to re-elect a government that will not only protect existing jobs but encourage and support new jobs growth.</para>
<para>Labor members have also argued that the bill goes further than just overturning the decision of the Industrial Relations Commission and that the government is bulldozing its way into state industrial relations systems. That is simply not true. Test case decisions of the AIRC hold enormous weight within the various state industrial relations systems. The Western Australian commission confirmed this when it handed down its redundancy decision earlier this year. While the commission rejected the general removal of the small business exemption, it left the way open for unions to mount cases to remove the exemption from individual awards. In doing so, the commission noted that ‘the decision of the AIRC will, in our view, be of considerable weight in such claims’. This is a very real possibility in other state jurisdictions as well. To properly stop any further adverse consequences as a result of the decision, it must be prevented from flowing to state jurisdictions. The bill will achieve this—no more and no less.</para>
<para>Throughout the debate on the bill, Labor members have tended to focus on the supplementary decision of the Industrial Relations Commission, seemingly believing that the decision is some kind of magic cure-all for small businesses—but of course it is not. The member for Perth is correct that the supplementary decision reduces the immediate burden for small businesses, but that is all it does. In the longer term, the decision changes nothing. After four years, small businesses would suffer exactly the same cost burden as they would if redundancy pay were introduced in full immediately. If small businesses were to spend the next four years accumulating the massive reserves necessary to fund potential redundancy payments, as suggested by Labor, instead of using the funds to employ people and expand their businesses, the impact on employment and the economy would be devastating.</para>
<para>To summarise the government’s position, this bill underlines the government’s strong commitment to the small business sector, which it recognises as the job-generating engine of the economy. I call on the opposition to show the same level of commitment by supporting this important legislative amendment.</para>

</amendments>
<para class="block">A key aim of this bill is to maintain an exemption for small businesses from the obligation to make redundancy payments by overturning the Australian Industrial Relations Commission decision of 26 March 2004. The bill, as introduced, will amend the Workplace Relations Act to, firstly, prevent the Industrial Relations Commission from including new small business redundancy pay provisions in federal awards and, secondly, prevent the flow-on of the commission’s decision by precluding the imposition of new small business redundancy pay obligations by state laws, state awards and state authority orders in respect of small businesses that are corporations and by territory laws in respect of all small business.</para>
<para>The bill, as introduced, also contains transitional provisions cancelling small business redundancy pay obligations contained in federal awards and state and territory industrial instruments that were made on or after 26 March 2004 and before the commencement of the bill. However, the bill, as introduced, does not prevent a state law, a state award, a state authority order or a territory law made before 26 March 2004 which contains a small business redundancy pay obligation that was previously suppressed by a federal award from springing up to fill the gap when a federal award no longer provides for small business redundancy pay. The proposed government amendment to the bill addresses the lacuna in the bill, as introduced, by substituting a new item 9. This amendment will simply ensure that, to the maximum extent of Commonwealth power, small businesses respondent to a federal award that previously exempted small business from redundancy pay are not subject to new redundancy pay obligations as a result of other changes proposed in the bill. I commend the amendment to the House.</para>

<para>—The <inline ref="R2381">Health Insurance Amendment (Medical Specialists) Bill 2005</inline> implements changes to the prerequisites for the recognition of certain medical specialists and consultant physicians. The changes will remove separate processes that these medical practitioners must undertake currently to access Medicare.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Currently there are three ways in which medical practitioners can apply to the Health Insurance Commission to provide Medicare services. The processes vary depending on the circumstances. If a medical practitioner is domiciled in Australia, if they are a fellow or if they have a relevant qualification from a specialist medical college, they are able to seek automatic recognition. This recognition occurs after the Health Insurance Commission receives confirmation from the medical college that these qualifications have been satisfied.</para>
<para>Consultant physicians and other medical practitioners that do not meet these criteria must seek recognition through the Specialist Recognition Advisory Committee. These committees are established in every state and territory and meet every two months to perform this task. They are appointed by the minister. All other medical practitioners not domiciled in Australia must seek recognition through a ministerial determination. The government sees these committees as redundant because they rely on the advice of the specialist medical college. They have the effect of delaying recognition for the purpose of Medicare because the committees meet only every two months. This bill proposes that, in their place, this recognition will come from a delegate of the minister in the Health Insurance Commission.</para>
<para>This bill tidies up an administrative process associated with the recognition of medical practitioners for the purposes of Medicare, and Labor supports this. However, the bill demonstrates that the government is happy to fiddle with extraneous elements of our medical work force policy but the government is not happy to look at the big picture and focus on the larger and longer term issues facing the sector.</para>
<para>It is no mystery that the minister with carriage of this bill in this place is Minister Abbott. As we know, the government is happy for Minister Abbott to fiddle around the edges of health policy. But the truth is that today the core of health policy in this country is being driven by the Treasurer entirely through the premise of what health costs and what savings can be made. Minister Abbott has counted himself out of the health debate and out of any substantial role in driving health policy in this country because he has positioned himself absurdly by saying that there should be no reform at all in health.</para>
<para>This might strike people as a remarkable position, given that everybody knows that this nation, along with all other Western developed nations, will experience huge cost pressures in health over the coming few decades. Part of those cost pressures is attributable to changes in demographics with the ageing of our population. That means that there will be more people in the older age ranges needing a significant draw-down on health services. Then there is the challenge of the financing, as the dependency ratio changes and there are fewer taxpayers engaged in the work force to generate taxation revenue to meet the needs of the ageing population. The cost pressures in health do not end there. We know that our society, along with all other Western developed countries, is facing a significant increase in the burden of chronic and complex diseases, which has huge implications for health expenditure. In addition, we know that there are significant cost pressures from innovative pharmaceuticals and new technologies.</para>
<para>All of that adds up to a substantial challenge that the government needs to manage with a reform agenda. The purpose of that reform agenda must be to ensure that we are constantly improving health, from the point of view of those of us who receive health services and preventive health messages and of those we are relying on to manage our health. We want to improve the system for those who rely on it, but we also want to improve its productivity and efficiency. We want to relegate to the dustbin of history the big proportion of waste that is in the system now. That degree of waste has been estimated by experts to be in the vicinity of $1 billion to $2 billion annually. We know that having frail aged people accommodated inappropriately in public hospital beds—because there are no aged care places, respite care places or rehabilitation places for them to go to—wastes around half a billion dollars a year. So there are big reform challenges facing this country, as we look at our current health system and seek to eradicate waste and to drive productivity and efficiency and as we look to the future to manage the challenges and the cost pressures that this nation will undoubtedly face.</para>
<para>In the face of that complex debate and the complex set of choices about what Australia should do next to make sure that our health system serves us better today and continues to serve us well 10, 20, 30 to 40 years down the track, Minister Abbott has decided just to step out of the way. It is too hard and he does not want to know. He is wandering around saying—and this was published last week in the newspapers—that there is no need for reform. He has, in fact, shrugged his shoulders and said, ‘What does it matter if health expenditure moves from around nine per cent of our national income, nine per cent of GDP’—which it is now—‘to around 15 per cent?’ ‘What does that matter?’ Minister Abbott says, with a shrug of the shoulders.</para>
<para>To give the House an idea of how much that matters, in today’s dollars the difference between nine per cent of GDP going on health and 15 per cent of GDP going on health is $51 billion. If in Minister Abbott’s version that $51 billion is to be taxpayer dollars, it will increase the tax burden on every Australian taxpayer by around $4,500 per year. So, when Minister Abbott with a shrug of his shoulders says, ‘Who cares? It does not matter if it goes up to 15 per cent of GDP,’ he is contemplating a system where this government would need to increase the tax burden on Australians, on average, by $4,500 a year. This government, which already runs the highest taxing government in Australia’s history—a big, bloated government—would increase the tax burden of every Australian taxpayer by $4,500 a year.</para>
<para>Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall that in question time last week we had some interplay about this. When asked about Minister Abbott’s speech about this new fiscal burden and about the weight it would put on taxpayers’ shoulders, Treasurer Costello frankly conceded that he had not read the speech. The day afterwards, when the matter came up by way of interjection, as I recall, he said that he had tried to read the speech but had fallen asleep at the second paragraph. I guess there is no mystery why Treasurer Costello would fall asleep trying to read Minister Abbott’s speeches. It might be because they are boring—and I am sure that is part of the explanation—but, beyond that, Treasurer Costello knows that he does not have to trouble himself with what Minister Abbott says. What Minister Abbott says does not matter because Treasurer Costello is actually in control.</para>
<para>But sooner or later Treasurer Costello will have to say to Minister Abbott that he does care if the amount spent on health floats from nine per cent of GDP to 15 per cent of GDP. In fact, concern about those sorts of questions led to the Treasurer publishing with the budget papers two years ago the <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational report</inline>. One of these days Treasurer Costello will have to explain to Minister Abbott that it probably is not on the Howard government’s agenda to put taxes up by $4,500 per taxpayer just so Minister Abbott can stand by watching the passing parade of health generate increased health expenditure.</para>
<para>I think it was at the point of that byplay in question time last week that Minister Abbott was shrugging his shoulders and saying, ‘Well, it doesn’t have to be taxpayers’ dollars.’ But, if that is right, Minister Abbott’s solution to increased cost pressures in health will be to say, ‘Well, health expenditure will float from nine per cent of GDP to 15 per cent of GDP,’ and then presumably he will say, ‘But we won’t be putting up government expenditure; we’ll hold government expenditure around where it is.’ So presumably that difference of $4,500 will fall on Australians as private expenditure.</para>
<para>Either way you cut Minister Abbott’s speech, it is a pretty dark view of the future: where you stand by, engage in no health reform and do absolutely nothing—except fiddle around and watch health expenditure go up as a percentage of our national income—and then somehow Australians pay the bill. There are only two choices: they will pay the bill through their taxes or they will pay the bill through their private expenditure—there is nowhere else the money can come from. That is Minister Abbott’s view of the future. It is an absurd view. One should not get paid for being health minister for taking such a lackadaisical approach. If in truth the Howard government now views Minister Abbott as so incompetent that the only thing he can do is fiddle around the edges and bring bills like this into the parliament—but do nothing else—then really it is time that he was replaced, rather than have him sit in this House masquerading as the health minister while Treasurer Costello is really doing it all and doing it all through the prism of cost cutting.</para>
<para>One of the biggest issues that need reform—and obviously it is squarely raised by this bill—is the crisis we have in Australia’s medical work force. I use the language of ‘crisis’ advisedly, because any Australian who lives in an outer metropolitan or rural and regional area—and I am sure Minister Kelly at the table has probably had some experience with this—will tell you about the problems of getting access to the right medical practitioner when they need to. They will tell you about the shortage of GPs and the shortage of specialists. That means that people are waiting for care because there are simply not enough people in the medical work force or—perhaps more disturbingly still—they are not getting care at all. Particularly in the GP primary-care end of the spectrum, it is very likely that people are putting off going and getting the preventative health checks they know they really should have. But, if accessing a GP is problematic and expensive and so people are not having those preventative health checks, that is going to show up in the future as an increased burden of disease.</para>
<para>We know from the statistics that over the 30 years to 2001 the rate of growth in the number of medical practitioners was faster than the rate of growth of the population generally, but in the 1980s and 1990s this rate of growth slowed. At the end of 2002 there were nearly 22,000 primary-care practitioners employed in Australia, of which 64 per cent were male and 34 per cent were female. The majority of the group—about 87 per cent—are vocationally registered GPs, who are essentially Medicare-licensed GPs. We need to remember that amongst the first actions of the Howard government was a cut in the number of GP training places, so where we are with the work force balance now has in part been driven by Howard government cutbacks.</para>
<para>Apart from the cutbacks another thing that has put a great burden on our primary-care system and has hugely exacerbated the shortage of primary-care practitioners is the changing nature of the medical work force, particularly the changing nature of the number of hours that GPs now work. Deputy Speaker Lindsay, I am sure that you are aware that the historic image of the GP was of a man who could work almost an endless number of hours, relying on a non-working wife to attend to all matters associated with the family. We know, of course, that that historic image of the GP does not accord with modern day reality, where many GPs are women and where many men who are GPs want to work fewer hours than their historic counterparts, because they have working wives and they have a view about work-family balance. This means that out of the raw number of GPs that we train we actually get fewer full-time equivalent GPs because each GP on average is working fewer hours. So an important measure of the medical work force is full-time equivalents. Measured in full-time equivalents, there are 101 full-time equivalent primary-care practitioners per 100,000 people in Australia, based on a 45-hour standard week, which is a decrease from 108, which was the statistic as recently as 1997.</para>
<para>Apart from there being fewer GPs as a whole and apart from the changing nature of the medical work force compounding there being fewer full-time equivalent GPs, we also know that our health work force is ageing. About 39 per cent of people employed in health are aged 45 years or more, up from 31 per cent in 1996. The proportion of workers aged 45-plus increased faster for females than for males, which reflects the fact that our nursing work force is rapidly ageing. We know that there is a global shortage of GPs and, coming back to Australia’s situation, we know that there is a national shortage of GPs. We also know that this national shortage is compounded in outer metropolitan and rural and regional areas by problems of maldistribution. We are short of work force numbers overall and the work force we have tends to be clustered closer to the centre of our bigger capital cities rather than being in outer metropolitan and rural and regional locations.</para>
<para>This is very important—and I am sure Minister Kelly at the table would agree with me in this—because we know that one-third of Australians live in rural and regional areas and that generally these Australians have a higher mortality rate and higher health risk levels than their counterparts in the city. This is due to a greater tendency to develop chronic illness, which is due to the likelihood that people will be working in physical employment, in occupations such as farming, mining and forestry, which can be more hazardous—not to mention the fact, of course, that our Indigenous communities are also concentrated in many rural and regional areas.</para>
<para>In 2002 the AMA commissioned Access Economics to investigate the extent of the shortage of GPs that we will face in the future. I have to say that their results are startling. They found that there is a declining participation rate by GPs. They found that female GPs, who form an increasing proportion of the work force, and younger GPs, both men and women, are only prepared to commit to a working life of well under the 50 to 60 hours per week traditionally worked by GPs. They found that Australian medical schools are not graduating enough doctors and they found that the GP work force shortage has been greatly exacerbated by the Howard government cutbacks to GP training places. In 2001 Access Economics estimated that the overall shortfall of GPs in Australia was between 1,200 and 2,000 full-time equivalent GPs. The rural shortage was estimated at 700 full-time equivalents and the urban shortage at 500 full-time equivalents.</para>
<para>Confronted with that knowledge, you would think that a responsible government that was competent rather than incompetent would be spurred to act, but we really have not seen anything profound being done in the medical work force area; we really have not seen anything except an increasing reliance on overseas trained doctors. We understand that in the current circumstances overseas trained doctors have an important role to play in our medical work force. There is no doubt about that. But it cannot be a strategy for the long term that we rely on importing doctors, nurses and other medical professionals. Why? The world is short of doctors, nurses and other medical professionals. Other developed countries have the same problems we have. They also have medical work forces which are ageing, and they too are looking to be net importers of staff for their medical work forces, so there will not be enough health and medical work force staff to go around.</para>
<para>It is a pretty unseemly vision of the future for us to say that, year in, year out, we will sit idly by, as the Howard government is incompetently doing now, and not train enough Australian doctors, Australian nurses, Australian dentists, Australian radiographers and so on and so forth and then we will go into the global market and see if we can poach them from somewhere, most likely a developing country that needs them. But that is the Howard government’s vision of our future medical work force, unless we do the right thing now—that is, provide a major package to increase the number of Australians we are training for our health and medical work force. It really is very simple. This should be about training and skilling Australians who want to be in our health and medical work force, rather than importing skills—and we will not be able to import them in the longer term, because of global competition.</para>
<para>There is a fashionable view, in particular in the nursing area, that we end up importing because no-one wants to be a nurse anymore. That is not true. Every year thousands of appropriately qualified Australians who want to be doctors, nurses, dentists or radiographers—indeed many of them throughout their whole school life have aspired to work in our health and medical work force—are turned away because there are not enough training places. And then, further down the track, what do the Howard government do? They say: ‘Too bad. We’ll turn those Australians away, and now we’ll desperately fossick around the world and import people.’</para>
<para>We have brought here many highly skilled overseas trained doctors who have made a major contribution to our health system, and I do not want to be seen to be saying anything other than that. But we also know that we have had some big problems in terms of the recognition and quality of skills amongst some overseas trained doctors—the most spectacular example of this, of course, having been in Bundaberg in Queensland. We would be better off on a whole series of levels if we were training Australians and training them now, so that we could be nationally self-sufficient in our medical work force. That does not mean no-one will ever migrate, because human life is partly about people travelling overseas, getting overseas working experiences and perhaps falling in love with someone overseas. Australians will migrate overseas for those reasons and overseas doctors will come here for those reasons. But we should not be in a position where we are out in the international market, desperate to recruit doctors because we simply do not have enough.</para>
<para>There is another major issue on which this government, Minister Abbott style, shrugs its shoulders, wanders around and never gets anything done. It is an issue this government needs to address. It talks a fair bit about it but never translates that talk into policy action. That issue is the question of regulation of specialists by specialist colleges—in particular their ability to restrict the supply and distribution of specialists. It might strike some as a grand irony that, in an environment where this Howard government is contemplating—and, indeed, is undoubtedly going to put into this parliament—a package of extreme industrial relations changes, all of which are about breaking down workers’ rights and the trade union movement, it can take a different stance when it comes to looking at questions relating to our medical work force. It has struck me that way. The Howard government can take that stance in relation to the work force overall—when it comes to shop assistants, cleaners, factory workers, farmhands and all the people who make up our work force—but, when it comes to looking at questions relating to our medical work force and, particularly, to the way specialist colleges control the supply and distribution of specialists, it does not want to know. If a craft union restricted supply and training places, the Howard government would raise the issue in question time and it would think it was a big scandal. But it sits around doing very little—indeed, precious little at all—when it comes to the fact that we have a major problem—not having enough specialists—and part of that problem has been driven by work force restrictions on supply and distribution from specialist training colleges.</para>
<para>That might strike you as a controversial statement, Mr Deputy Speaker Lindsay, but the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission came to the same view when it looked at this area. It is an area that needs to be addressed. If we can train the right number of specialists and provide specialist training places in regional hospitals, then the specialists trained in those hospitals are more likely to locate there over the longer term than to cluster around our central business districts. Consequently, it is an important part of government policy to ensure that we are training the right number of specialists and that those training places are distributed in an appropriate pattern across Australia to meet our needs. That can be done whilst ticking every box in relation to the quality of the training experience.</para>
<para>I am certainly not suggesting that quality should be lost in this process—quality can be maintained—but there is a degree of supply and distribution restriction which is artificial, which is not about quality and which has to be challenged in the interests of all of us who will rely on getting timely access to health services at some point in our lives. We might well be resident in an outer metropolitan or rural or regional area when we need access to those health services. Our ability to access those health services will be compromised unless we look at these questions.</para>
<para>There is no magic to the fact that where we have undertrained the people we need, where we have not addressed the distribution questions and where our overseas-trained doctors end up in regional or remote areas, where they can be least supported and monitored, we end up with situations like the Bundaberg situation, where someone was not properly accredited and where no other doctors were working alongside him monitoring and addressing quality issues. It is no surprise that we end up with the sorts of problems we have seen spectacularly in Queensland.</para>
<para>The Productivity Commission is currently working on the medical work force issue. It is to be hoped that its report lifts the lid on the longstanding regulatory and structural elements of the medical work force issue. We need to do that in the interests of all of us who rely on health services.</para>
<para>As well as looking at the questions of total numbers trained and distribution, we have to take a sophisticated look at who is going to do what within our health system. This should be driven fundamentally by improving the quality of our health system. There is no doubt that as modes of care change and as technology changes who can do what in our medical work force will change as well. When we first worked out how to do blood pressure tests, only a doctor could take your blood pressure. Now in a world where blood pressure checks are routine, where the technology to do it is easy to use—I am sure we are all familiar with having the band wrapped around our arm and having our blood pressure taken—those sorts of checks can be done by nurses, for example. That is one example of a pattern of change that applies right throughout our health system. As technologies which were innovative become routine, they can be best used by someone in the health and medical chain who is not necessarily at the professional end which first introduced those new technologies. So there is a question there that we need to address about the balance in our health and medical work force.</para>
<para>If you go to Canada, Mr Deputy Speaker—and I am quite sure you would like to do that on some occasion—I would recommend that you go to the royal college in Ottawa and talk to the Canadians. When you talk to the Canadians about this matter, you will find that the medical profession is driving this debate about substitution because they want doctors always to practise at the highest skill end and to shed to other medical professionals things that those other medical professionals can do. They are driving that debate from a quality point of view, not only for the patient but also in regard to the quality of the doctors’ working lives.</para>
<para>None of this is addressed in any way by the Howard government at this time. Minister Abbott just wanders around shrugging his shoulders in the face of these very complex issues because they are beyond him. Maybe Treasurer Costello will address this issue post the Productivity Commission report. I now move the opposition’s second reading amendment, which raises some of these issues:</para>

<para>—I rise to support the <inline ref="R2381">Health Insurance Amendment (Medical Specialists) Bill 2005</inline>. I am glad to see that the member for Lalor raised the issue of the role of the Treasurer and the health minister working in partnership. It is important to highlight the fact that the spending on health and ageing has doubled since 1996 under the Howard government, and it is not through inefficiency; it is through bringing in some of the very measures that the member for Lalor was talking about—things like MBS items for practice nurses who can support doctors and provide some of their services. I was in a surgery only two weeks ago in Salisbury North in Wakefield and hearing from the doctors how that move alone had made the practice viable into the future. So I am glad to see that we agree that some of those initiatives are good. They are taking place with the Treasurer’s support of the health minister, who is making Australia’s health care system—as is recognised internationally and by the state and territory leaders in Australia—a good and improving health system.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>However, I do acknowledge that there are inequalities between parts of our population which the overall statistics mask. I speak particularly of people of lower socioeconomic status and those who live in rural and remote areas and outer metropolitan areas, where there are higher rates of morbidity and mortality. The causes of this are complex and diverse but ultimately they come down to the issue of access to medical care by skilled people—both general practitioners and specialists.</para>
<para>As I address the <inline ref="R2381">Health Insurance Amendment (Medical Specialists) Bill 2005</inline> I will touch briefly on some of the measures brought in by the Howard government to address work force shortages in outer metropolitan and regional areas. Firstly, I welcome the initiatives that seek to attract medical professionals to practise in areas of work force shortages and the incentives to increase bulk-billing rates. I have visited practices in Whytes Road, which I spoke about, in Salisbury North, and I have seen how these measures have made a real difference to the viability of these services. The doctors who run these services talked about how the additional payments to practice nurses have enabled them to provide services on a sustainable and viable basis without raising charges to the people who access health care services. While there are some incongruities in the way the areas of work force shortage are defined, which I am pushing to have addressed, these measures have already made a real difference to people in the outer metropolitan areas of Wakefield.</para>
<para>I have also met with those who are involved with health professionals or who are affected by their availability in the country areas of Wakefield. I am indebted to the work of Dr Steve Holmes and Dr James McLennan, both of Clare. Not only do these men and their colleagues tirelessly serve the needs of their community on a day to day basis but they have the passion to make the time to help me as their representative understand the issues that affect the delivery of health care in country areas. More importantly, they do not just complain about problems; they actively seek to develop solutions. I am happy to support initiatives that aim to support and improve the health of those who live in the bush and which include components that encourage the recruitment and retention of an adequate work force that is equipped with the range of skills necessary to deliver the services and procedures to communities that are remote from the easy access to tertiary medical services that so many take for granted. These people are much more likely to be involved in procedural work, such as obstetrics, and emergency services, such as looking after folk after accidents. Where there is no hospital support, they will have to manage these cases with the resources they have to hand and without the backup of hospitals, imaging services or other health professionals who can complement their care.</para>
<para>Given the geographic distribution of the population of Australia, and certainly in the electorate of Wakefield, these specialist level skills will not be available in regional areas on a sustainable basis unless the doctors who provide the general practice care can also give health promotion and disease prevention advice, can care for people during the births of children and have the knowledge and skills to care for people through all of life’s events, even their palliative care.</para>
<para>With the diversity and depth of knowledge required in the working life of a doctor, the doctor no longer really fits the standard definitions of specialty groups. The doctor has become something more than a GP with a specialist interest, such as HIV or sports medicine—he has become a practitioner of rural and remote medicine which, in essence, is a speciality all of its own. The recognition of rural and remote medicine as a medical specialty is not a further process of sub-specialisation; it is about returning the delivery of patient care of rural and remote patients to a specialty level. The important thing to note is that training for this is not provided in a coherent way by any other medical college in Australia, so I support the moves toward establishment of a rural and remote medical register as one of the first steps toward the outcome of a better supply of medical practitioners for rural and remote Australia.</para>
<para>This bill proposes to amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 to streamline the procedures under which certain medical specialists and consultant physicians are recognised as eligible to provide services that attract a Medicare rebate. I welcome this as another initiative which removes barriers to the timely provision of quality health care for the people of Wakefield. The reason for this amendment lies in the current cumbersome and time-consuming process through which some medical practitioners are recognised as specialists or consultant physicians for the purposes of Medicare. The amendment does not bestow specialist or consultant physician status on medical practitioners. The practitioners are identified as specialists or consultant physicians by medical boards when they are registered on the advice of specialist medical colleges.</para>
<para>There are three ways that this process works at the moment. Firstly, applicants can seek automatic recognition if they are domiciled in Australia, they are a fellow of a specialist medical college and they have a relevant qualification from the college. Secondly, they can go through the alternative method of recognition, which is what this bill addresses, by Specialist Recognition Advisory Committees. This is currently the only pathway for the recognition of consultant physicians, including rehabilitation specialists and psychiatrists. These committees are established for each state and territory and meet every two months. Thirdly, medical practitioners who do not live in Australia at the time of application can seek recognition through a determination of the minister.</para>
<para>This bill affects the second option, which is referral through the Specialist Recognition Advisory Committees. This was necessary in the past and provided a structure for the assessment of specialists who are not eligible for automatic recognition. Since these committees were established, special medical colleges and state and territory medical registration boards have been developed. They have implemented assessment processes that are now used by the Specialist Recognition Advisory Committees to make their determinations. This is essentially a redundant administrative layer to the recognition process and unnecessarily extends the period between the registration of specialists and the provision of services that attract the Medicare rebates that are needed by the people of Wakefield.</para>
<para>Following the passage of this bill, it is intended that the decision-making powers of these committees will pass to the delegate of the Minister for Health and Ageing in the Health Insurance Commission. This has the potential to streamline application processes by avoiding the necessity for specialists to meet the cut-off for that two-month cycle. In conclusion, this bill represents a minor change to current procedures. The objective of this change is to reduce the complexity and the time involved in the recognition of medical specialists and the provision of Medicare rebates to patients. I welcome and support this bill as another initiative, albeit a minor one, that will benefit the health care of the people in Wakefield who live in outer metropolitan and regional areas.</para>

<para>—I find it rather surprising that the previous speaker, the member for Wakefield, failed to pick up on the excellent amendment moved by the shadow minister for health, because that touched on some of the real problems that exist within our health system—problems that, if fixed, would really help the people in the electorate of Wakefield. In speaking to the <inline ref="R2381">Health Insurance Amendment (Medical Specialists) Bill 2005</inline>, I would like to associate myself with the comments made by the shadow minister for health and also state how pleased I am to second the amendment moved by her. That amendment touches on issues that are very important to the communities in the electorate of Shortland that I represent in this parliament.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I have to say at the outset of my contribution to this debate that it is most unfortunate that the Howard government has failed the people in Australia when it comes to health. I do not think there is any other area where there is more evidence that the government has failed. We have a situation where we have got rising health costs, where a greater percentage of the GDP is being spent on health, where the cost to people throughout Australia of purchasing health services and paying for private health insurance, which this government is so committed to, is increasing and where the cost of pharmaceuticals is increasing. There is an increase in costs in every area of this country’s health system. I hate to say it, but I really feel that the government has failed to recognise the key drivers of this situation and to address these issues. These issues are a symptom of a health system that is under enormous pressure and teetering on the brink of disaster. We cannot allow that to happen, because so many people in Australia depend on a strong health system. The government should resolve these issues and not blame other people for their failures. They blame the states, and they refer to the fact that the problem of the increased costs in health are to do with the ageing population. You name it—the government will find some reason to abrogate their responsibility in this area.</para>
<para>After those few introductory comments, I turn to the legislation before us, which  implements change to the prerequisites for the recognition of certain medical practitioners and consultant physicians. The changes will remove separate process these medical practitioners must undertake to access Medicare rebates. It will not affect the registration process that these professionals must undertake to be recognised as specialists or physicians by their relevant medical boards. I am going to talk a little bit more about specialists later in my contribution to this debate.</para>
<para>As previous speakers have pointed out, currently there are three ways in which medical practitioners can apply to the Health Insurance Commission to provide Medicare rebatable services. Firstly, a medical practitioner who is domiciled in Australia and who is a fellow or has a relevant qualification from a specialist medical college is able to seek automatic recognition. This recognition occurs after the HIC receives confirmation from the medical colleges that these qualifications have been satisfied. Secondly, consultant physicians and other medical practitioners that do not meet that criteria must seek recognition through specialist recognition advisory committees, established in every state and territory, which meet every two months. Thirdly, medical practitioners not domiciled in Australia may seek recognition through ministerial determination.</para>
<para>The government sees these committees as redundant because they rely on advice of the specialist medical colleges and have the effect of delaying recognition for the purpose of Medicare, because the committees only meet two monthly. This legislation seeks to change that. This recognition will now come from the minister’s delegate in the Health Insurance Commission. I think that anything we can do to streamline the system to make recognition quicker is a good change. As the shadow minister pointed out, we will not be opposing this legislation but we have moved an amendment, which I am going to talk about at some length.</para>
<para>The amendment will also apply to consultant physicians so that they have an avenue for applying for recognition for the purpose of Medicare. So this legislation will make a very minor change in that area. But, unfortunately for the people I represent in this parliament, I do not believe it will make any real difference to the services they get, to the availability of those services or to the fact that there is a chronic shortage of doctors and nurses within the Shortland electorate. The Shortland electorate basically covers two areas. The first is the Central Coast, which has had a chronic shortage of general practitioners for a long time. The Central Coast urban division of GPs have been lobbying the government and I have been working with them to try to get more doctors to move to the Central Coast, but unfortunately no action that this government has taken has done anything to alleviate that situation.</para>
<para>The Central Coast has an ageing population and it is also an area that has many very young people living in it. It is an area that this government has failed when it comes to providing adequate medical services. It does absolutely nothing to change the situation that exists there. The fact that we have a shortage of GPs and specialists in areas like the Central Coast was recognised in a report brought down by the Productivity Commission. It identified that we have a real problem with a medical work force shortage, and it does not begin and end with GPs but it is an area that is causing a lot of difficulty both on the Central Coast and in Lake Macquarie.</para>
<para>The Lake Macquarie part of the electorate is an area that, for a long time, was not under the same level of pressure that the Central Coast was under. For a long time I would be talking to people on the Central Coast and hearing about how an age pensioner or a veteran had to wait for up to three weeks to get an appointment with their local doctor. I would hear about how GPs had closed their books and how people moving to the Central Coast were not able to see any GP at all. Or I would hear how there was a nursing home bed empty because we could not find a GP who would actually supervise the person who was desperately in need of moving into that nursing home or high-care residential facility. The person needed the support that they would get there but, because there was no GP who would oversight them, the bed would remain empty.</para>
<para>The change is that now that is happening in the Lake Macquarie part of the electorate. With the ageing work force, in a significant number of suburbs in Lake Macquarie, we have had doctors retiring because, as has been mentioned previously in this debate, we have an ageing medical work force. We have doctors with their books closed. In our office, when we have rung around all the GPs within the local area trying to access a GP who can supervise a person who is in a nursing home, it has taken us some two weeks to find someone to take on as a patient a person in one of the local nursing homes. This causes anxiety not only to the person who needs the doctor but to their family. They know how important it is for their relative or spouse to have the care of a general practitioner. Within the suburb of Belmont, quite a few doctors have retired recently. People living in that area are now unable to access doctors. Their doctor has retired and a large segment of the population no longer has a general practitioner.</para>
<para>They are the kinds of issues that are affecting real people every day. On the Central Coast, people are waiting long term—up to three weeks—to see a doctor. People are unable to go into nursing homes because they cannot get a doctor to supervise them. In Lake Macquarie, doctors are retiring and people are left without a doctor. Previously they had a doctor, but now the doctor has retired. It has an enormous impact on those communities. It also has an impact on the local public hospitals. People who cannot see a doctor in the community are going to the local emergency department and waiting for some hours to see a doctor. This is a health issue. If people do not get the proper medical treatment, their condition can be exacerbated. This also leads to more serious illnesses that have greater costs to our health system.</para>
<para>Linking into the fact that we have this problem with a shortage of doctors is the issue of overseas trained doctors. I have a few issues that revolve around that. Firstly, I believe that this government has a commitment to train young Australians to be doctors. Under this government, there has been a reduction in the number of training places for doctors and nurses. I know from my own community that there are many young people who would embrace careers as doctors or nurses. Unfortunately they are turned away from the universities every day.</para>
<para>The importing of skilled doctors and nurses from overseas has a downside. For me, one of the issues is an ethical issue—the fact that quite often these doctors are trained in developing countries and their skills are needed there. Many of these doctors come from countries that put a lot into training them. They get them to a level where they have a high level of expertise. Then we encourage them to move to Australia. I see that as quite an issue for doctors coming to Australia. It is important to mention also that there is a chronic worldwide shortage of doctors, nurses and others—you name the profession—within the health sector.</para>
<para>Rather than draining resources from other places throughout the world, we should be investing in our own work force. We should be investing in the young people that are leaving school. We should be making sure that our own young people have the ability to get the skills and training that they need. We should not be abdicating our responsibility there. It is very important to put on the record just how vital it is that, as a nation, if we want to thrive and grow, we have to develop the skills and expertise within our country to do so. We have to develop them, not bring them in—not take them from somewhere else. I have quite a problem with the government on that issue.</para>
<para>There is another issue relating to overseas trained doctors. We have some excellent overseas trained doctors. Within my own electorate some of the most skilled doctors are overseas trained doctors. But there have been some problems in the area of overseas trained doctors. Obviously, the most highly publicised has been the case of Dr Patel in Queensland. I put on the record that the New South Wales government has tightened the approval and checking procedures for overseas trained doctors. That is a result of the inquiry that took place in Queensland. The New South Wales system has checks and balances. It has panels of doctors interviewing GP applicants, specialist colleges interviewing specialists, supervision once the registration is approved and a move to more stringent checking of credentials.</para>
<para>Most of these overseas trained doctors go to areas of need. Quite often the patients that they deal with have serious and significant illnesses, and the doctors need to have a very high level of skill and a high level of support. I do not see that this legislation does anything to help in that area. The government has an obligation to all the people living in rural and regional areas, where the resources are scarce, to ensure that there are proper procedures in place and to look at the issue in the way that the New South Wales government has. The government needs to be putting in place some changes and working with the state governments so that that there is some sort of uniform system and a whole-of-government approach. That is one thing that this government fails at very badly. I think that is because it likes to have someone to blame when things go wrong.</para>
<para>Finally, I would like to touch on the issue that the shadow minister touched on: the failure to address the impact that the regulation of medical professionals by the colleges has on the supply and distribution of specialists. Within my electorate, and I am sure within the electorates of all members of this parliament, there are specialty areas where there is a significant shortage. These shortages are created, to a large extent, by the fact that the colleges will not allow more specialists to be trained in a specific area. I see this as anticompetitive behaviour. The restrictions that are being put in place by the colleges are affecting access to specialists by people throughout Australia. Unless the government takes some action to address this then it will escalate and there will be a further shortage of specialists, which will mean that it will be harder for people to see specialists when they need to. The government needs to get real about health. It needs to show leadership. It needs to address the real issues out there in the community—the real issues associated with a skilled work force. It needs to make sure that all Australians can access health care when they need to.</para>

<para>—I agree with the previous speaker, the member for Shortland, that we need to keep the focus. The Labor Party has now realised that the shortage of nursing and medical professionals in this country is of major importance to the government, and obviously to them as well. It is not just the <inline ref="R2381">Health Insurance Amendment (Medical Specialists) Bill 2005</inline> that addresses that issue; many bills have been passed before to try to address that major problem. The situation has, from my perspective, certainly improved from what it was a couple of years ago. I think the Minister for Health and Ageing has done a tremendous job in realising that. The basis is that the way to achieve that must be that we have a mutual understanding that we want quality, affordable and available doctors. It is not measured by the rates of bulk-billing, so I am glad there is some measure of maturity now to understand that. Competition is great and we want more of these people. We are getting more nurses and we are using them in a much more effective way.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This bill represents a minor procedural change to the Health Insurance Act 1973. It will streamline the procedures for the recognition of certain medical specialists and consultant physicians so that their patients can access Medicare rebates at the specialist or consultant physician rates. Currently, a medical practitioner is recognised as a specialist for Medicare purposes via one of three pathways. The first pathway is automatic recognition. Applicants can seek an automatic recognition if they are domiciled in Australia, have fellowship with a specialist medical college and have the relevant qualifications from a specialist medical college. Recognition is then provided by the Managing Director of HIC, following advice from a relevant specialist medical college that the criteria have been met.</para>
<para>The second pathway is alternative recognition. For those Australian-trained medical practitioners who are unable to meet the criteria for automatic recognition, an alternative pathway is available. In the alternative pathway the minister’s delegate must refer the medical practitioner to an appropriate state or territory specialist recognition advisory board. State and territory specialist boards are administered by the Health Insurance Commission and meet every two months. The Minister for Health and Ageing appoints committee members from panels of nominees put forward by the relevant professional bodies and colleges. For those medical practitioners who are seeking recognition as consultant physicians—which are a subgroup of specialists with qualifications as physicians, rehabilitation specialists and psychiatrists—this is the only pathway for recognition.</para>
<para>The third pathway is for non-domiciled medical practitioners. Medical practitioners not domiciled in Australia at the time of application may seek recognition through a determination of the Minister for Health and Ageing. Applications for temporary residents were previously considered by an overseas specialist advisory committee. These committees were abolished in July 2004. The government was able to do this administratively because there was no mention of the overseas specialist advisory committees in the act. The government is abolishing the specialist recognition advisory committees for much the same reason that the overseas specialist advisory committees were abolished—the committees have become redundant.</para>
<para>Since the committees were first established, specialist medical colleges and medical registration boards have been developed and they have implemented assessment processes which are used by the specialist recognition committees in making their determinations. That the specialist recognition committees have relied on the assessment advice of specialist medical colleges and medical registration boards in making their decisions means that the specialist recognition committees have become a redundant administrative layer in the processing of applications. This unnecessarily extends the time between the registration of specialists and when they provide services under Medicare.</para>
<para>According to an official at the Department of Health and Ageing, the HIC is reporting that, since the abolition of the overseas specialist advisory committees, it has been processing applications within a shorter time frame than was previously the case. Applications are now usually processed within 28 days, as opposed to the previous time frame of two to three months. It is intended that the decision-making powers of the disbanded specialist recognition advisory committees will pass to the delegate for the Minister for Health and Ageing in the HIC. This will streamline the application processes for special recognition by avoiding the necessity to meet cut-off dates for applications to the specialist recognition advisory committees and then wait for up to two months for the committees to meet.</para>
<para>The amendments proposed in the bill include the recognition of consultant physicians domiciled in Australia in the alternative method of recognition. Because the specialist recognition advisory committees have been the only means by which medical practitioners could be recognised as consultant physicians, disbanding these committees would remove the provision for them to become recognised. To correct this, consultant physicians will be included along with specialists in the alternative method of recognition.</para>
<para>Transitional arrangements have been provided to ensure that specialists and consultant physicians previously recognised by the specialist recognition advisory committees will continue to be recognised under Medicare. Arrangements have also been made to allow the delegate to immediately consider existing applications with the specialist recognition advisory committees at the time of abolition. This bill involves minor changes to existing procedures. The objective of these minor changes is to reduce the complexity and time currently involved in the recognition under Medicare of medical specialists and consultant physicians seeking to enter the Australian medical work force.</para>
<para>Before concluding, I implore all Australians to understand that there have been difficulties with only a very few overseas trained doctors. The large bulk of overseas trained doctors who I have had experience with are excellent doctors. I commend them and ask the Australian public to trust them and to enjoy the care that they can give them. I commend this bill to the House.</para>

<para>—I am pleased to speak on the <inline ref="R2381">Health Insurance Amendment (Medical Specialists) Bill 2005</inline> today, although I think it tinkers with a very serious set of problems. Changing the processes by which medical practitioners are registered is welcome, except insofar as it may give the Minister for Health and Ageing greater discretion to make some of the errors that we have already seen occur in this field. However, it is worth taking the opportunity to talk about medical work force planning more generally, because this is a serious problem which requires attention from this government and from all the key players—of whom there are sadly far too many.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I want to start by briefly talking about the inflation in health care costs in Australia, which, as a former health minister, I regard as scandalous. The health minister has now taken to boasting about the dramatic increases that we have seen in Commonwealth health expenditure. Previously, that would have been seen as a matter for criticism of a Commonwealth minister. In question time last week he said that, since 1996, which is when this government took office, health spending has increased from under 15 per cent to over 20 per cent of the federal budget. The federal budget has grown enormously, so that figure is large. He went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Since 1996 federal health spending has increased from 3.7 per cent to 4.3 per cent of gross domestic product.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is not counting the increase in state expenditure. He boasted that this year the federal Health and Ageing portfolio will spend $44 billion. Frankly, if this rate continues, he will bankrupt the nation. We are headed for US levels of expenditure, which are around 14 per cent of GDP, without any improvement in health outcomes and with very little investment in health care promotion and illness prevention. It is no wonder that the Treasurer has tried to rein in the health minister and has made him look like a liar in relation to the safety net.</para>
<para>It is fair to say that Australia could once boast about its moderate, middle-of-the-road levels of health expenditure and its internationally enviable health outcomes. Now we have one of the highest rates of health cost inflation in the developed world and nothing more to show for it in health outcomes than higher out-of-pocket costs for ordinary Australians; pronounced inequality in access to benefits—it is the wealthy who are benefiting from the 30 per cent rebate and safety net; soaring medical incomes, which I suppose they would welcome; and private hospital profits. At the same time, we have seen public hospitals under pressure, with growing waiting lists because of the movement of doctors to higher incomes in the private sector. I underline that because it is a serious problem in Australia. To confirm this, just last week the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed that the fees for health practitioners increased by 44 per cent between 1998-99 and 2004-05. I bet that, with the introduction of the so-called safety net, that fire has been stoked even higher.</para>
<para>For those who purchased private health insurance, premiums have increased by 7.9 per cent this year—nearly eight per cent—and this is the third year in a row that they have increased by more than seven per cent. In the same period, gap payments to doctors increased by 19.2 per cent. By any indicator, this is roaring health cost inflation. There is now clear evidence—and this is important—that the increase in private hospital activity has not taken the pressure off public hospitals. Indeed, there is evidence to the contrary. We are spending $2½ billion a year on the rebate, and an additional amount that we cannot exactly estimate on the safety net, to purchase no additional benefits in the public hospital system.</para>
<para>We are spending a lot of money as individuals, through private health insurance premiums, and as taxpayers, so what is happening with the medical work force? You would think we would be purchasing more, and better qualified, medical practitioners who are better able to provide services for Australians, but I do not think that is happening. Neither do I agree with some of the panic-stricken nonsense that is being written about this in sections of the press. As indicated by researchers from the Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine at Monash University, perceptions of the adequacy of the Australian medical work force veer from predictions of surplus to warnings of shortage with a frequency that is somewhat perplexing. Sometimes, it really does seem to depend on who you ask.</para>
<para>Back when I became health minister, the excess provision of medical services was a concern, but shortages are the concern at the moment. Media interest is mainly in the shortage of GPs in country areas, of which there is real evidence. There is maldistribution of medical resources and services in this country. But less attention has been given to what I think is, in the long term, a more serious trend, and that is the lack of specialists, especially in public hospitals. Australia is short of doctors to work in the public hospital system. Many public hospitals are now saying that they are having great difficulty in recruiting doctors and keeping them. When you look at the surveys that have been done, it is obvious that we need more specialists in general medicine, radiology and geriatric medicine.</para>
<para>In Australia we have an enviable record of work force planning. We were at the forefront of medical work force planning. To some extent it involves trying to peer into the future, so it is beset by the inevitable difficulties that poses. Nonetheless, a lot of work has been done through the Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee and the cooperation of state governments. I will not go through that history, but it is only a decade long. It has recently been reviewed—in my view, appropriately—and recommendations have been made to improve its operation and, in particular, to look at some areas where work force planning has ignored the trends we should be examining.</para>
<para>I now want to talk about the current state of the work force. It is worth remembering that health and community services is the fourth largest employment sector. It is an area in which reform of the work force is much needed, but the government have not undertaken it. In fact, the government have stepped back from it; for the most part, they have eschewed it. Health is Australia’s largest industry. It is worth $80 billion per annum, or nine per cent of GDP. It is worth observing that labour costs account for 70c in each health dollar. As at the 2001 census, the sector employed almost 800,000 people, or nearly 10 per cent of the total work force. It is worth observing that, as is the trend elsewhere, 40 per cent of people in this sector work part time.</para>
<para>We have seen steady increases in all categories of health practitioners except enrolled nurses, whose number has declined substantially—a surprising outcome in many respects. Between the 1996 census and the 2001 census, we saw a 12.6 per cent increase in the number of medical professionals. More women are employed in the sector, particularly as medical practitioners, but all doctors work, on average, fewer hours than in the past. That may be partly because they are older and taking a bit more time off, but increasingly it seems that younger doctors are refusing, quite reasonably, to work the unreasonable hours that their fathers and grandfathers were prepared to work. I have pointed to the fact that there is a maldistribution in this work force and that it is difficult to get medical professionals to work in country and remote areas.</para>
<para>What is driving the change in our health system at the moment? We have seen unprecedented changes in the supply of and demand for medical practitioners. Some of these factors have not been taken into account in work force planning. The government has been remiss in not looking at the drivers of demand. Why is the demand for health services continuing to grow? Why are we seeing a lot more procedures being undertaken, particularly in the private sector? Why are people visiting doctors more often? Are these visits actually improving their health or simply adding to the cost burden for the community? A good health minister would be asking these reasonable questions and not simply boasting about the inflation in health care costs.</para>
<para>We do know that demand continues to grow. Some of that demand is for services that some people would regard as unnecessary. Consumers are empowered, but sometimes they are ill informed. This government says nothing about consumer education. Are people in the Australian community victims of some of the disease-creation stories that we have heard about—particularly ADHD, which must be the most overdiagnosed condition among young children, who are then being medicated at extraordinary levels? The government has shown no interest in consumer education and in improving the knowledge base of the community at large so that parents, for instance, can make some reasoned judgments about what sort of care is needed.</para>
<para>The ageing of the community will generate additional demand, but again I suspect the government is prepared to just let that run out rather than look at ways of managing the health care needs of older people in ways which do not necessarily require additional surgery at every turn. Technology is a driver as well. Again, the government has taken very little interest in making sure that the appropriate technology is applied, and not just the most expensive technology available at the time. These are the things that are driving demand for services and, in particular, the demand for more doctors.</para>
<para>The government has shown some interest in the supply side, including in this bill, but it has not really paid close attention. Obviously something you could do would be to attract, retain and recruit people who can work in these fields. One of the things that I know was under examination when we left government in 1996 was the failure of the specialist colleges to pass very high numbers of people who were training for and applying for specialist positions. One particular college that I will not name, in a state that I will also not name for fear of embarrassing it, was notorious for not passing the next specialist in that field until the last one had died. It maintained very close control over the number of people who worked in that field. It was a very closed shop indeed, and the Productivity Commission showed considerable interest in looking at these restrictive practices.</para>
<para>When the conservative government took office, it very quickly changed that emphasis. But it still demands attention, because some of the colleges pass only 50 per cent of the applicants. These are the brightest of the bright. They typically go through school and university with very few failures. The ones who graduate from medical schools are certainly capable of passing into the specialist colleges but very often it takes them several tries. As I said, the pass rate in some colleges is as low as 50 per cent and the range is very often between 50 and 65 per cent.</para>
<para>The other thing this government has shown no interest in doing is actually increasing the productivity of the existing work force, extending the working life of practitioners and getting a better work-life balance. Some of those people—and this includes nurses—who are having to leave the profession altogether for quite long periods of time would be better able to maintain contact and involvement if there were better practices in our hospitals. In some cases we need to be replacing doctors with other health professionals, and the government has shown little interest in that. It is flirting with the idea of using more midwives, for instance, in the area of obstetrics to perhaps bring us up to the same level as that which occurs in other parts of the world.</para>
<para>Why do we have these apparent shortages in the system and why is there concern about them? There is some argument that we have not produced enough doctors, and you will hear that from the conservatives particularly. There have been some increases in student numbers—they take about 10 years to emerge into the profession—and there have been proposals to attract more specialists from overseas. I think the last is fated to fail because everyone is looking for more medical specialists.</para>
<para>In my view, one important problem is the lack of supervision. A lot of young doctors are poorly supervised and often left without resources, especially late at night, and in many cases, I think, that leads them to pull back into other fields of medicine than are required to be practised in our hospitals. They are poorly supported and very frequently overworked. In the case of those people who are coming from outside Australia, the same problem applies, because they need periods of supervision in order to pass the necessary exams. As we have seen spectacularly in Queensland, but I am sure it is not the only place where it has happened, qualifications can sometimes prove to be fraudulent.</para>
<para>I mentioned earlier the restrictions by colleges on pass rates, restrictions which are inevitably going to produce fewer doctors than is desirable. We are also seeing competition from overseas. We are losing doctors. It is not something that is talked about very often, but a lot of our brightest and best go overseas to get additional specialist training and sometimes to do research, and we are not doing very much to try to attract those people back. They can often earn considerably more out of Australia, which is why I think the idea that we can simply get more doctors from overseas is fated to fail.</para>
<para>We have seen changes in work practices, too, which have produced shortages. As I said, young doctors now do not want to work 60-plus hours a week in the public hospital system. They want a life outside medicine. They have families and other interests. And, of course, more women than men are graduating, and they do not work as many hours while trying to balance their family responsibilities. But it is very clear that the hospitals themselves—and this minister has not shown much interest in this issue—really do not have a good hard look at their own work force practices. It is difficult for doctors and nurses alike to find part-time and family-friendly conditions, and that has led many to move from career medicine, which was familiar in the past, to the casual medical work force. They earn more in two days than their colleagues undertaking specialist training earn in a week, so they become permanent locums. They can have a life and they can earn an income, but it is not particularly good for the hospital system.</para>
<para>One of the things that we have seen—and the government is entirely responsible for this—is growth in the private system as a result of the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate and the safety net. Some people obviously regard that as a good thing, and indeed this government has argued that it is. But what happens is that you have the movement of specialists from the public system to the private system. They can earn more in the private system because they can charge more, and there is less complex medicine and surgery to be undertaken, so they are under less pressure. But unfortunately there is little or no training of specialists in the private system—it still continues in the public system—and, as we have seen, there is very clear evidence that that additional expenditure has not resulted in less pressure on the public system. I think the jury is definitely in on that.</para>
<para>Every bit of research that I have read shows quite clearly that, while there has been an increase in the number of procedures in the private system, there has been an increase in waiting lists and waiting times in the public system and an increase in the complexity of care required, with more doctors being placed under pressure. One reviewer put it this way. He said that many doctors are ‘losing their commitments to and engagement with the public hospital system’. I think that is a tragedy, not least because those highly paid specialists contribute to the future education of doctors, particularly by providing for the supervision of doctors in their specialist programs. For the most part, they are not separately paid for that.</para>
<para>I have touched on poor work force management in hospitals. I will give a couple of examples from the work that John Menadue did. He reviewed the literature and interviewed a whole lot of people working in the public hospital system in New South Wales and in South Australia. He concluded, as Professor Goulston did, that the work force management in most of our hospitals is rigid and antiquated; that job sharing is rare; that working hours are inflexible; that leave is frequently scheduled to suit the employer—a common occurrence for many people, it has to be said; that there is poor supervision of junior staff with high levels of responsibility, particularly on weekends and after hours; and that medical staff are forced to perform many clerical and non-clinical duties which others could easily undertake.</para>
<para>Part of that is the result of another contributing factor to these shortages: unduly rigid role definitions. It is a part of our work force where everybody has a highly specialised task and no-one is allowed to move over the boundary—or very infrequently allowed to move over those occupational boundaries. In my view, the medical work force needs to be redesigned and some duties need to be moved from doctors to other health professionals. In June, COAG finally acknowledged the need for health work force reform—it was pretty belated—and there will be a report from the Productivity Commission at the end of this year. I hope it addresses some of those restrictive practices which in other parts of the work force would be condemned.</para>
<para>In the review that John Menadue conducted, he argues that we must train and employ in quite new ways in the medical work force. Most work force reform, as we know, has been in the blue-collar area, and some of it has not been reform but simply change. Menadue estimates that if anything like that level of reform were undertaken in the health area the potential productivity dividend could be as high as 40 per cent. In other words, we would not have shortages of the kind we are currently experiencing. Midwifery is the classic example, where in Australia less than 10 per cent of births are managed by midwives. That is lower than the 50 per cent in the UK and the 70 per cent in the Netherlands, and New Zealand, of course, has taken some very significant steps to involve midwives in care.</para>
<para>The descriptions by senior academics and clinicians who were interviewed by Menadue—I have mentioned a couple—are, I think, instructive. They described an archaic work structure that was incoherent and rigid. They said that no-one owns work force issues and that there is a lack of coordination and teamwork. One went so far as to say that there is not a work force shortage; the issue is how we use the work force. Menadue in his reviews, which I commend to the House, holds up the example of the UK pilot of a new generic health care practitioner who combines the role of junior doctors, senior nurses and allied health professionals and looks at patient care as the key driver. That person is required to assess the patient’s condition, to do the physical examination and diagnostic tests, to establish a treatment plan and to manage and monitor that plan; to break down the old work force boundaries. It is about multiskilling—a word we do not hear very often in the health work force—about broadbanding and about teamwork. There is a lot to be done to improve health work force practices, despite the resistance that I know will be shown by some sections of the medical profession. Doctors typically do not like to see their territory invaded or their incomes diminished. As Menadue put it, powerful sectional interests still call the shots and resist change. I think it is time this minister took some control.</para>

The member for Fremantle’s generally thoughtful and intelligent contribution had a turn of phrase in it that I fear was unhelpful and probably unwelcome. In reflecting on the economic forecasting in, I believe, the intergenerational work, she suggested that the figures she contested may start to make the owner of that work look like a liar. I notice that turn of phrase has not been used for the last four years in this House and only once in the Senate over that same time when quoting a letter. I would ask you to consider whether standing order 89 or standing order 90 is infringed upon by that turn of phrase. I understand context will matter, but I would like it not left standing as though that is an acceptable turn of phrase that we could start to see more of in this place.

<para>—The <inline ref="R2381">Health Insurance Amendment (Medical Specialists) Bill 2005</inline> has a very laudable purpose. Cutting red tape to streamline the process to allow specialists to provide their services under Medicare is certainly commendable and we support it on this side of the House. The bill constitutes a measure by the government to streamline the way in which medical specialists can be recognised to be eligible to provide Medicare rebated services. This will allow some medical specialists to become eligible for recognition in a shorter time frame than is currently the case, where you have specialists waiting for up to two months for this recognition. The streamlining of this process will allow patients to benefit from having a Medicare eligible specialist sooner rather than later.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Unnecessary red tape restricts access to specialist medical providers, and we have seen that that is one area in which the Liberal government generally excels. The members opposite have proved themselves to be champions of red tape. We saw it with the GST and we saw it most recently with small business, especially with regard to super choice—thanks to the work of the member for Watson in his former portfolio, which highlighted that. We saw it with the child-care rebates, amongst a host of other areas. So, when a bill comes before the House with the purpose of cutting red tape, I am supportive but also sceptical, especially when it comes to health, because when it comes to health in Australia under the Howard government the cutting is normally done to services. The list of services that this government has abolished or reduced funding for is ever increasing, and the government has made a name for itself over the past nine years as a mean-spirited government that cares more for the minority who are well off than the majority of the population who rely on these government services.</para>
<para>Let us not forget that this is the government that cut the Commonwealth Dental Health Program in 1996. This was a good program that had been assisting low-income Australians with quality dental health care ever since it was introduced by the Keating Labor government. In June this year I rose in the House and lamented the loss of the Commonwealth Dental Health Program and the effect it was having on my electorate. I gave the real life example of just one of the victims in my electorate after the abolition of the program, which has sentenced hundreds of thousands of Australians to years on waiting lists for necessary dental treatment. This is despite the fact that the Commonwealth Dental Health Program was so effective that even the current Minister for Health and Ageing was forced to admit that in fact the program did cut waiting lists when it was in place.</para>
<para>At the last election, Labor committed $300 million towards reinstating a program similar to the Commonwealth Dental Health Program, which would have slashed waiting lists and cleared backlogs for the 500,000 Australians waiting for dental treatment every year. But perhaps the worst cuts from this government are the cuts to training places for medical professionals, which have led to a situation where Australia is simply not self-sufficient in providing the health professionals that we need to meet the demands in the community. The resulting skill shortage is yet to have its full effect, but at the moment the effects are pretty unpleasant.</para>
<para>On 11 August, the local Rockhampton paper, the <inline font-style="italic">Morning Bulletin</inline>, had a story about a local resident, Mrs Eileen Condon. The story states that, six months ago, Mrs Condon was referred to a specialist regarding a cataract covering her left eye. When Mrs Condon took the referral to the Rockhampton Base Hospital, she was told that there could be a two-year wait before she even got to see the specialist. Mrs Condon is 69 years old and is struggling to get by with her ever-worsening vision. The two-year wait quoted by the hospital is only to see the specialist; it does not include a further wait to actually have the surgery. Sadly, Mrs Condon can no longer do the activities that she once enjoyed. Things like reading and playing hoy have become just two of the activities that Mrs Condon can no longer take part in, and this means that her quality of life is worsening. This government really does have to take responsibility for some of the shortages that are causing this hardship to people.</para>
<para>Stories such as this are becoming more and more common throughout Australia, particularly in regional and rural areas. The current medical work force shortage will continue to worsen until this government takes action and does something about the problem. What kind of message is the government trying to send to people such as Mrs Condon? ‘Go away; you’re not important enough for us to worry about. We would rather focus on attacking the union movement.’ As most Australians consider health to be their No. 1 priority area, this seems to be very limited thinking on behalf of the government.</para>
<para>Australians have the right to be able to see a doctor in a timely fashion. Waiting two years to see a specialist regarding a cataract that covers your left eye almost completely is not timely. What is worse though is the inability to see a specialist at all. This situation is a reality throughout rural and regional Australia. Places that once had specialists have lost them because the specialists have retired and the younger generation are simply not there to take their place.</para>
<para>It is not just specialists who are in short supply. My office receives numerous calls each week from constituents who have attempted to make an appointment with a GP in our local area but have been told that the clinic is not accepting new patients. It is becoming harder and harder to see your local doctor because trained doctors are just not available. Constituents in Capricornia are having to wait weeks to see a GP—as I am sure constituents in numerous other electorates are—because the doctors are simply not there in great enough numbers to meet the demand.</para>
<para>The government’s failure to address the issue of medical work force shortage is not the only area within health that is hurting this country. The government has proclaimed itself ‘the best friend Medicare has ever had’. I do not know about you, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, but, if my best friend stated in 1987 that they wanted to dismantle me, I think that would do some pretty serious damage to the friendship. But that is exactly what John Howard has been seeking to do since his time in the Fraser government—to abolish Medicare and totally destroy bulk-billing, which Mr Howard has labelled previously as an absolute rort.</para>
<para>Since just before the last election, the current health minister has been carrying out his own ideological makeover to Medicare. But, like all cosmetic makeovers, the improvements have proved to be illusory. In this case, they only lasted until the Treasurer had his way in the budget. That was when it became clear that the health minister—who had given us the ironclad, rock solid guarantee—had failed Australia on the Medicare safety net, and he is failing the people of Australia again over the medical work force shortage.</para>
<para>The health minister and this government are so out of touch with the Australian people that they also do not seem to understand how the minister’s botched negotiations over the PBS are going to affect people who rely on this scheme for necessary medications. But the two-tier PBS does not seem to concern the minister for health. The health minister’s mishandling of the PBS means that many Australians are now paying more for their medicine. For example, under the minister’s special patient contribution, lung cancer patients now pay $460 for the drug Alimta. The special patient contribution, which we did not hear anything about in the last election, also includes three other drugs. But, as we know from this government’s track record, this is clearly the thin end of the wedge. Today it is four drugs; later it will be 20 drugs and so on. The Labor Party would never allow this type of system whereby those who can afford medication get it and those who cannot afford it are left without. Labor created the PBS and we will not stand by and let this government destroy it.</para>
<para>Putting the dismantling of the PBS aside, the question remains: why is there a doctor shortage, especially in rural Australia? If we listen to the federal government, it is all the fault of the state governments. Another good one is where the health minister stated that doctors are too selfish to work in the bush. However, the reality of the situation is that this government has been caught sleeping at the wheel over the nine years this problem has been developing. The Howard government has not been training enough doctors. It has cut the number of medical places at Australian universities and, on top of that, it has put a university education out of the reach of many Australians. Individuals who may have been looking into a medical career have been turned off by the ever-increasing costs of a medical degree.</para>
<para>The Howard government is pricing Australians out of tertiary education to the detriment of the community. The medical work force shortage that we now have will only get worse as the full effect of these university funding cuts starts to bite. The government’s decision to increase HECS fees by 25 per cent will see many students who obtain the university entry score giving up their plans to study medicine or other allied health degrees because they are scared off by the fees. Any student who does continue will not be interested in working in rural Australia. They will have racked up a huge debt through the course of their studies in gaining a degree—which will ultimately assist Australians—and they will need to work where they can make the most money in order to repay it. For students in Australia, university study is now a situation that requires much soul searching and financial planning.</para>
<para>One area of medical specialisation that is hitting my part of Australia—regional Australia—particularly hard is obstetrics. While the Treasurer would like Australians to have more babies, it makes it a little hard when there are no obstetricians around to assist. Many smaller towns in my electorate are without an obstetrician and women are forced to drive many hours to see one. If you live in rural or regional Australia, you had better hope there are no complications with your pregnancy because there is no-one there to help if anything goes wrong. To have their babies delivered, women are forced to drive for hours to a larger hospital. This causes great hardship for families, as expectant mothers awaiting their baby’s birth are required to relocate to major centres on the coast, sometimes for several weeks. This is costly and inconvenient, not to mention quite upsetting for many families. It is particularly difficult if there are other children at home. The dad involved is often a shiftworker in the coal-mining towns in my electorate or he might be running a family farm.</para>
<para>At the last election, the Labor Party committed $1.5 billion to tackle the medical skills shortage by increasing the training of rural and regional specialists. Labor would have doubled the current amount spent on training in these areas, training an extra 1,000 doctors and 1,800 nurses each year. The Howard government’s response to the medical work force shortage is the same as its response to the general skills shortage facing this country—importation of workers. Instead of providing the necessary funding to train Australians, this government wants to import more and more foreign doctors to make up for the shortfall. We have seen some of the results of this policy recently in Bundaberg. This is a government with a history of short-sighted policies aimed only at getting it over the line at election time. But these short-term policies have not helped Australia’s ailing health system; rather, they have led to a blow-out in health costs.</para>
<para>In the last budget this government made five commitments to health. Two of these simply re-announced election commitments, while another two were the $499 million cut-back in the Medicare safety net and a further $1.3 billion cut from the PBS. As I said at the outset, the only thing this government likes to cut is services. It seems that this government and the health minister are totally incapable of tackling the big issues in health. They seem to wander around in a policy void on this issue, hoping the crisis will solve itself. In the meantime, since 1996, out-of-pocket health costs have skyrocketed by over 60 per cent. Patients in Australia are paying more to see a doctor, more for private health insurance premiums and more for medication. The government has ripped $1 billion from public hospitals and then blames the states for the expanding waiting lists.</para>
<para>I think everyone in this chamber will remember the Minister for Health and Ageing’s assertion that the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate would make private health insurance more affordable for Australians. The reality of it is that private health insurance premiums have simply continued to rise, helped along by the health minister’s unquestioning approval of every rise proposed by the private health insurers. In the meantime the private health insurance rebate has done little to assist people in regional and rural areas, who have little or no access to private medical facilities in the first place. In rural and regional areas like the one I represent, the public health system is the service that people rely on. My office is constantly receiving calls from constituents who are fed up with their private health insurance coverage and premiums. The vast majority of these people end up withdrawing from private health insurance, as the ever-escalating costs far outweigh any benefits. They pay their premiums for services that do not even exist in regional areas and are still left out-of-pocket, paying gap fees following even the smallest procedures. It is no wonder they give up.</para>
<para>This government needs to get its priorities straight. If only it put in the time and effort towards health and education that it does for ideological crusades against workers’ rights and students, we might be able to tackle the issue of medical work force shortages. To live in a regional area and not have access to a medical specialist is living dangerously. It is unfair to deny these basic services to a section of the population that makes an enormous contribution to the prosperity of this country. This government needs to take action to ensure that all Australians have access to proper medical treatment. No Australian should have to sit on a waiting list to see a specialist about a cataract on their eye, let alone have to wait for two years. This government owes people like Mrs Condon, those mothers travelling to see obstetricians and those waiting to have dental treatment, amongst others, an explanation as to why it has allowed this issue to escalate to crisis point in the nine years it has been in charge of our health system. I urge this government to stop placing health in the too-hard basket, to put aside its ideologically driven crusades for a while and to focus on the real priorities for most people in this country—an affordable, quality health system and an education system that trains sufficient Australians to meet the demand for health professionals right around this country.</para>

<para>—The <inline ref="R2381">Health Insurance Amendment (Medical Specialists) Bill 2005</inline> implements changes to the prerequisites for the recognition of certain medical specialists and consultant physicians. The changes will remove separate processes that these medical practitioners must undertake to access Medicare rebates. Currently there are three ways in which medical practitioners can apply to the Health Insurance Commission to provide these Medicare rebatable services. Medical practitioners can seek automatic recognition if they are domiciled in Australia or if they are a fellow or have a relevant qualification from a specialist medical college. This recognition occurs after the HIC receives confirmation from the medical college that these qualifications have been satisfied. The second way is through specialist recognition advisory committees, for those consultant physicians and other medical practitioners who do not meet the criteria that I previously outlined. These particular committees have been established in the past in every state and territory and, at the end of the day, they are appointed by the minister. The other means is, of course, recognition through a ministerial determination.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The bill that we have now before the House seeks to streamline the second of these processes and disbands the specialist recognition advisory committees. In place of the disbanded committees will be recognition from a delegate of the minister in the Health Insurance Commission. We ought to make it clear that the bill will not affect the registration process that these professionals must undertake to be recognised as specialists or physicians by the relevant medical boards that oversee the qualifications of GPs and specialists in this country.</para>
<para>I must admit up front that I do have an interest in this particular issue because my niece is currently studying medicine; she is in the Northern Territory as part of her course. Nyree O’Connor is a lovely woman and is somebody who will be a great asset to the medical profession in the future. She comes from a rural area, and in my discussions with her she has indicated that she wants to go on and become a specialist in a particular medical area and return to the country to practise. That is a commendable objective of hers. I hope she is successful and one day returns to the country to practise her profession, because rural and regional Australia simply need more doctors.</para>
<para>I support the second reading amendment proposed by my colleague the member for Lalor, as elements of that amendment go to the heart of the deep problems that are encountered by my constituents in accessing quality GP and specialist care in the Geelong region. The elements of that second reading amendment are as follows:</para>

</item>
</list>
</quote>
<para class="block">These are substantive issues that the opposition has raised in the second reading amendment. They go to the very heart of the incompetence of this government in this area.</para>
<para>After nine long years of the Howard government, we have a crisis in our health system. When we look at the government’s response in many key areas of the health policy of this nation—and I would not condemn all of the responses of the government—this government has demonstrated that it is out of touch with the needs of ordinary Australians and particularly with the needs of outer metropolitan communities such as mine. If the rising costs of health care for Geelong families were not enough for many of my constituents in Geelong, they have the additional problem of gaining access to GP and specialist services.</para>
<para>The Prime Minister talks a lot about the economic achievements of the government. I am certainly happy to debate that proposition on the floor of this House or in any forum throughout this country, because the Prime Minister periodically gets up in this place claiming credit for economic growth rates that were left to him by the Labor government. He claims credit for an inflation rate which was left to him by the Labor government after we broke the back of Liberal inflation in this country. And on it goes. But I will certainly debate that in another time and place. Here we have very substantive issues relating to the health sector and, as expressed in the second reading amendment, the government has been found significantly deficient in this area of policy.</para>
<para>The Prime Minister does not talk much about the rising costs of medical services being encountered by working people, working families, in the Geelong area or talk about the difficulty they are having in accessing even basic GP services in our community. Bulk-billing rates have significantly declined in the Geelong region, and that has imposed a heavy financial burden on Geelong families. The cost of seeing a GP has risen substantially. In September 2003, the last time those bulk-billing rates were published, the rate in Geelong was 58.4 per cent, well below the national average of 67.4 per cent. Medicare safety net costs have substantially increased.</para>
<para>Private health insurance premiums have massively increased in Geelong, the home of GMHBA. We have a very high proportion of working families who have taken out private health insurance. They are now paying through the neck for that private health insurance, contrary to the promises that were made by the Prime Minister in this policy area. The Prime Minister and his government have spent a lot of money, ostensibly to prop up the private health insurance industry in this country and to encourage people into private health insurance, on the promise that premiums would be contained. That simply has not been the case—another broken promise from a government that has been in power for nine long years and is out of touch with the real needs of ordinary Australians.</para>
<para>With regard to the statistics on GP shortages, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare published in their report <inline font-style="italic">Medical labour force 2002</inline> tables that show the distribution of full-time equivalent primary-care practitioners. These are mainly GPs. The AIHW published those tables and rates per 100,000 by state in 1997 and again in 2002. In Victoria those statistics about the full-time equivalent rates showed that the supply of primary-care practitioners declined between 1997 and 2002—albeit slightly, but it is still a decline—from 110 to 106 FTE per 100,000 head of population. When we go behind that statistic, in major cities the FTE rate for primary-care practitioners in 2002 was 105 per 100,000, while in inner regional areas it was 90. For outer regional areas the rate declined further, at 80 per 100,000. And of course it declined even further for remote areas.</para>
<para>There are many reasons why we have this shortage of GPs and other health professionals in rural and remote Australia. One reason—and this comes from the report undertaken by Access Economics for the Australian Medical Association—is the intensity of work performed by doctors in regional and rural areas. Those doctors work very long hours, especially after hours. They are on call after they have completed their normal hours and while on holidays. They are really never off duty and they suffer, as a result of that, from accumulated stress and burn-out. There are also reasons related to family conflicts and costs. It is often very difficult for the female partner of a male medical practitioner to gain meaningful employment in rural and regional communities if she is in another profession. There are the normal business difficulties of establishing medical practices as small businesses in rural and regional areas. I am appalled at the news today that the National Party is going to cave in on the sale of Telstra, because, as we know, access to high-quality communications is essential for the development of many small businesses in regional communities.</para>
<para>Another factor is lifestyle. Many people who are trained in city environments have difficulty relating to people in rural environments and establishing the social networks that would sustain them in those communities over time. This aspect demonstrates clearly the need for us to take a completely new approach, a different approach, to the training of medical practitioners and specialists. In the context of this debate, I put before this House and the minister a proposal that I hope he is well acquainted with: a Deakin University proposal to set up a new rural and regional medical school for western Victoria, providing some 147 new commencing places—including 120 Commonwealth supported and 24 full fee paying places—per year. The ask of the Commonwealth is some $18 million, to be matched by Deakin University and the state government.</para>
<para>I am heavily indebted to Deakin University for providing this fact sheet. I acknowledge up front that I am quoting from that document because the document succinctly states the case and I do not have a lot of time remaining in this debate. The proposal is to set up the first rural medical school in the south of Australia. Its major focus will be on rural medical practice, which will address the significant health needs of non-metropolitan people. This will contribute greatly to addressing the significant GP shortages that exist throughout western Victoria, in particular. The proposal will provide a graduate entry program for mature age students who will already have strong links to rural environments. The proposal offers a distinctive and complementary alternative to the metro-focused regional and rural outreach models that are used now by Melbourne and Monash universities. One of the strengths of this proposal is the partnerships that will be struck with Flinders University, Barwon Health, other health services in the Warrnambool, Colac, Hamilton and Horsham areas and other private and public hospitals and general practices in the region. There will be swift accreditation by the Australian Medical Council through curriculum licensing with Flinders University, and there is a desire to have the first intake of students in 2007.</para>
<para>Victoria has a very strong case in this regard for a third medical school, focusing on rural health. For example, there is a regional crisis in the delivery of medical services in western Victoria. Geelong needs 35 more GPs. Warrnambool will need to find 15 more GPs by 2015 just to cover retirements. The estimate for the whole of Victoria is that we are some 500 GPs short. I think it is legitimate to ask why Victoria has only two medical schools when New South Wales has seven medical schools and Queensland four. I note in the chamber today the presence of the honourable member for Kennedy. In mentioning Queensland in that regard, I certainly do not want to downplay the urgent need for GPs and specialists in Queensland, particularly in rural and regional Queensland, which I have travelled around on many occasions. It is important to note in the context of this debate that there are only two medical schools in Victoria, and they are primarily metropolitan based services with an outreach model. What is unique about the one that is being proposed by Deakin University is that this particular medical school will be provided by a strong regional and rural university with a city campus—which is quite different from the others. An important statistic to note is that there are more than 100 Victorians studying medicine interstate, and this is causing some frustration for us in our communities.</para>
<para>Western Victoria is ideally placed, Mr Deputy Speaker McMullan. As you know, Geelong is the fastest growing area in regional Victoria by population. We have fast transport links and new air services, with Jetstar at Avalon Airport. We have a wide diversity of high-quality health services, with a teaching population of some 600,000. So there are very powerful arguments why this facility ought to be located in Geelong. </para>
<para>Deakin University is very well placed to provide this medical school because it is a strong regional and rural university with a city campus. It has a network of high-quality student accommodation in major centres across western Victoria. It has a demonstrated high level of performance in health and biomedical research. It already funds a full range of health disciplines—nursing, public health, occupational therapy, disability, health promotion, psychology, social work, forensic and biomedical sciences.</para>
<para>It is very important that the minister appreciates that the infrastructure is already in place at Deakin University, in Geelong, to provide this medical school. Powerful arguments have been advanced to support the proposition. At the end of the day, it will address a burning need in western Victoria and Victoria for general practitioners and specialists who come from the country to be trained in the country so that they can go back and practise in the country. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—The <inline ref="R2381">Health Insurance Amendment (Medical Specialists) Bill 2005</inline> streamlines the current licensing of specialists to practise. The arguments used by the Minister for Health and Ageing seem to be quite valid and acceptable. Because the SRACs rely on the assessment advice of specialist medical colleges and medical registration boards to make their decision, the committees have a redundant administrative layer in the processing of applications. That would seem to be a very tight intellectual argument that all of us are who are intelligent—or despite our intelligence—should accept.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I think it is important in this debate to give the House a quick sketch of our situation in North Queensland. We are climbing up to close to one million people. In Australia’s population of 20 million, one million of those live in North Queensland. In a survey of doctors some years ago in the Gulf mid-west and Mount Isa—that north-west slice of Queensland—only eight of the 28 doctors were Australian doctors. The other 20 were doctors who were brought in to do the job because we could not get any Australian doctors.</para>
<para>The last time I looked, in my home town of Charters Towers only two of the 13 doctors there were Australian doctors. Some of them could have been naturalised by this time but they did not get their degrees in Australia and did not come from Australia. As the House is well aware, I recently had bypass surgery. In the course of having those heart attacks and passing through the surgery, 10 doctors attended to me and nine of those 10 doctors were not Australians. They were excellent, and I could not speak more highly of all of the staff. While I am on that subject, I would like to single out Dr Malick, who is the superintendent at Charters Towers. He has been very helpful in discussions on the difficulties of people coming to Australia. He and his team perform magnificently at the Charters Towers hospital. There are many like Dr Malick. However, I would like to put on record my personal thanks to him and Dr Diquer, who pioneered heart surgery in North Queensland and who enjoys an enviable reputation in Sydney and Melbourne as much as his chosen place—God bless him—of North Queensland</para>
<para>Recently an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Townsville Bulletin</inline> said that Townsville, a town of 200,000 people, was I think 60 doctors short. I will check that figure, but they were a huge number of doctors short. The previous speaker, the member for Corio—I do not want to be critical; he is an excellent member of parliament—said that there were four medical schools in Queensland. There are two in the pipeline as I understand it—Griffith and Bond universities—but there are only two in operation. I will do a bit of skiting. About seven years ago, in desperation—after we had been 11 months without a doctor in Aramac-Muttuburra—I called for about the 4,000th meeting to form yet another committee to secure a medical school for North Queensland. I think Dr Wronski was one of the major driving forces, although I do not wish to single people out here as there were many people who were heavily involved. That committee—under Lady Pearl Logan and my daughter Mary Jane Streeton, as she is now—was very proactive. We pay very great tribute to those people because not only did they secure the Townsville medical school—the North Queensland Medical School—but they broke the mould. There had been no medical school founded in Australia in 44 years. It was the first medical school in 44 years. About half of those in medical schools now are women—and God bless them for this; I am not being critical of them—but, when they become mothers, they naturally want to spend time with their children. So their hours of practice are very small indeed when they go through a mothering period of 10 or 20 years on average. Some of them do not, but most of them do for reasons that they are very good mothers. We do not criticise them for that—we praise them for that—but the hours that the doctors put into practice have diminished dramatically. The population has increased but the number of doctors coming out has not increased. On top of that, a large proportion of the doctors are ladies who, when they go through the mothering period, modify their hours of practice.</para>
<para>We had a situation which arose dramatically. Also, incomes and opportunities have dramatically increased in the cities. There are people like me and other members of parliament who would not be here except for surgery; we would probably have died in days past. There is an enormous amount of effort that has to be put into these new surgical methods, so there has been a greater demand for medical practitioners than in the past. Until James Cook University, thanks to the enormous energies of the great man Ian Wronski, came into being, there had been no expansion in the supply of doctors in Australia. We were dependent upon bringing people from overseas. In my home town of Cloncurry the last doctor I spoke to was from Nigeria. When I was a young person we had the Colombo plan: we educated doctors from the poorer countries and sent them back to their countries. Now Australia, in a most disgraceful exhibition of malgovernment, has had to go on bended knees to bring people from Third World countries, who are desperately needed in their own countries, to practise in Australia.</para>
<para>We do not come to condemn; we come to praise. I want to single out the previous health minister, Michael Wooldridge—I described him as the angel of the bush, and he was; he was one of the people who became very positive in securing JCU—Mike Horan, the minister in the Queensland government, and the subsequent Labor government who carried it forward. We thank them.</para>
<para>It is not only the establishment of JCU; there is a second problem here. I do not want to denigrate the university, but I will cite one university where I would say 30 per cent of their graduates are in need of psychiatric care. If you want to choose all these brilliant academic performers then you are going to get people whose perspectives are so narrow that their abilities to deal with other people are almost autistic; they are quite incapable of doing that. A large number of them have been removed from practice. Through their screening and entrance requirements, these universities, for their own academic prestige, chose people along lines that would develop the academic prestige of that medical school.</para>
<para>In fairness, they looked at the right of the individual, if he performs brilliantly academically, to become a doctor. They looked at their rights to aspire to academic prestige, but they did not look to their responsibility to supply doctors to the people of Australia. More praise to Professor Ian Wronski at JCU, because JCU have taken great risks in choosing people who will be caring and thoughtful—the sorts of people who will make good doctors and good medical practitioners. They see their role as supplying people who will alleviate pain and stop death, wherever humanly possible. If you even have a cursory discussion with some of the students at JCU, you will realise that they were selected against magnificent selection criteria.</para>
<para>JCU have again taken a great risk by reserving 20 of the 60 places for people from small towns. If you want to get doctors to go back to small towns, the first thing would be to get someone from a small town to become a doctor. I do not think a person from a city is going to aspire to go out to some small town, but if that is where they come from then you have a very good chance of keeping them.</para>
<para>Until that time, the people of North Queensland lived 2,000 kilometres away from our nearest medical school in Brisbane. We sent our children down there to become doctors, they married a Brisbane girl, they lived in Brisbane for six or seven years doing their training, and we never saw them again—they became Brisbane people and did not return to us. That is the reason why North Queensland and country Australia have had such enormous difficulty in securing doctors. But those things are being dealt with now, and we give praise to the current minister, who has carried on the good work of his predecessor, for the commitment that the government and he, personally, have shown to meeting the difficulties that we are dealing with head on.</para>
<para>I come from a state where we have had a terrible situation arise because there has not been proper screening of doctors: the Dr Death case at Bundaberg. The latest media reports are that 13 deaths occurred as a result of that person. There is a very important warning for anyone involved in government: if you try and shut up people, if you try and have a lock-down of a flow of information, you are taking very grievous risks. The Department of Health in Queensland did exactly that. They did everything humanly possible to shut up any criticism; no-one was going to talk. There was a regime of secrecy and a regime of—and I do not hesitate to use the word—terror. This was to a point where, when a patient’s leg had grown to four times its size and was clearly gangrenous—as a layman, when my son has had injuries and broken bones from football, I have watched like a hawk because any swelling is extremely dangerous—the nurses knew that no-one was going to speak up. The nurse who spoke up—all she did was speak to a director of nursing; it did not appear that we got very much action from that quarter either—was not game to speak up to outsiders, and the patient lost his leg. I have just quoted one terrible case where it is clearly obvious to everyone associated that the patient was in dire peril of losing his life, let alone his leg.</para>
<para>In the case of Dr Death, there was a second mechanism. The officials who hired this person did not bother to ring up the place where this Dr Death came from in America and find out why a doctor wanted to leave America and come to practise in Australia. Why would that occur? In any event, one would have thought that it was a fairly obvious thing to do. If you are relying upon a letter from a hospital in the United States or anywhere else, you should realise that letters are extremely easy to forge. We have no way of finding out who signed the letter. If something comes on a letterhead from a hospital in India or America, the letter can be very easily forged. But a telephone conversation with people in official positions in these hospitals would have indicated that there was a very serious problem with this particular doctor.</para>
<para>I want to bring something to the attention of the minister, and it is very relevant to the bill before us today. I commend the minister for this bill and the streamlining. What took place in the Dr Death case is very relevant to what the minister is doing today. Because there were three or four bodies that all had a finger in the pie in Queensland, everybody left it to everybody else to do something. They would say, ‘It’s his responsibility.’ Nobody was taking responsibility for licensing these people to practise in Queensland. I urge the minister to definitively say whose job it is to license these people to practise. However, it is a commendable and very timely action by the minister to narrow down the number of people that someone has to go to to make this decision or to verify this decision.</para>
<para>Having said that, let me mention a situation in North Queensland concerning the Queensland Medical Board. In discussions with them, I have found them to be very excellent people. But a mistake was made; I think it was a mistake. An official said to an overseas doctor, ‘You cannot renew your right to practise in Queensland because we want oversighting now.’ I bring this to the minister’s attention. They wanted every overseas doctor to be oversighted for three hours a week. I think that this was a mistake made by officials in the Medical Board. When it was brought to the attention of members of the board, they reacted very swiftly to head off the complete collapse of medical services.</para>
<para>In the town where this occurred, two doctors were up for re-registration. The first one was told, ‘You’re not being re-registered because you can’t give us an oversighting.’ We cannot get doctors to sight, let alone get doctors to oversight. The one Australian doctor in this town with about 15 doctors said, ‘I’m rolling my swag and leaving.’ I had already told the Medical Board. I said, ‘He won’t stay. He’s not going to be the lone ranger here oversighting everybody else in town. He’s not going to take those responsibilities.’ Unbeknownst to me, he had already rung up the Medical Board himself and told them that he was leaving town. He was not going to be the sole doctor.</para>
<para>The Medical Board listened. Unlike the authorities at Queensland Health in the case of the Bundaberg Dr Death inquiry, these people did listen and did act expeditiously to head off at the pass a total collapse of our medical system in North Queensland by the delicensing of all of these foreign doctors. But we still have a situation where the Medical Board quite rightly believes that there should be some oversighting.</para>
<para>I want to suggest something to the minister and the government—and to the Queensland government, the Medical Board and the director in Queensland Health. There are a lot of retired doctors. The doctor now in charge at Bundaberg was a retired doctor, Dr O’Rourke. Dr O’Rourke, a very experienced surgeon, was asked to come out of retirement and oversight—which he did. A lot of these retired doctors do not want to work full time, but they might do a month and visit a few bush towns and interesting communities. I do not think they would be averse to doing that. They would get a bit of income from it. For a figure of under $5 million—maybe the state and federal government could put in half each—I think we could supply an oversighting of those doctors for a few hours a week—say once every three or four months. I strongly suggest that the minister takes that up. Maybe there are better ideas than that, but that is the best one that I have heard.</para>
<para>I would also urge the minister to take into account the licensing for rural doctors. The ACRRM at the present moment has put itself forward to do the licensing and be the authorising body as far as practice in isolated situations is concerned. Practice in isolated situations and rural situations is profoundly different from practice in a big hospital situation such as in Townsville or Cairns. It is so fundamentally different that there should be experts dealing with it. I plead with the minister to look seriously at ACRRM as a licensing body for rural doctors in Australia. I have mentioned Professor Wronski’s name in this speech, and quite deservedly so. He was one of the doctors who founded that organisation. He is very well aware of the need for specialists in that field—specialists in the sense of people who will be able to handle the difficulties that arise when you are isolated and you are thrown back on your own resources.</para>
<para>Finally, I think the government seriously has to consider a special zone allowance. If it will not consider it for everybody, it should at least consider it for essential services. Without some sort of tax zone allowance for these people, there is just not enough money to attract them out there. Some sort of break along those lines would help dramatically as well.</para>
<para>I come here today not to condemn but to praise all of the people—the current minister and his predecessor—for the actions that they are taking and have taken. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—In summing up debate on the <inline ref="R2381">Health Insurance Amendment (Medical Specialists) Bill 2005</inline>, I should say to the member for Kennedy that I very much appreciate being praised in this place. I think there was some implicit criticism mixed up with the praise, but I guess it would be unusual if one were praised in this place and not implored to do even more good work. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline> Let me assure the member for Kennedy, as I assure many of his former Queensland National Party colleagues who make similar representations to me, both publicly and privately, that the government do take people like Professor Ian Wronski seriously. We do take the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine seriously. We meet with them regularly and we do our best to address their concerns.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This is a quite simple bill which is designed to clear up some legislation to make it better reflect current practice. The specialist recognition advisory committees were effectively disbanded in the middle of last year but, because the act refers to them, this amendment is necessary to take them out. Under the situation as it now applies, the specialist medical colleges are the relevant sources of advice for specialist recognition. Under the former regime the specialist recognition advisory committees simply went to the specialist colleges for advice. Therefore, by removing the specialist recognition advisory committees we are cutting out a redundant level of bureaucracy.</para>
<para>I will briefly refer to some of the matters that were raised in debate. The government was criticised by, amongst others, the shadow minister for health, the member for Lalor, for allegedly not doing enough to boost the medical work force. I certainly accept that over the years governments have not done enough in this area, but I point out that it was not until November 2002 that the government finally received official advice from the Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee that we had general, as opposed to particular, problems here with particular disciplines and subdisciplines. Almost immediately, the government increased the number of medical student training places by 25 per cent and increased the number of GP training places by 150, again a 25 per cent increase. I would like to see further training places for other specialists, but that is basically a matter for the states, because the number of specialist training places other than for general practitioners depends upon the number of registrar positions in the state-run public hospital systems.</para>
<para>The member for Lalor was also critical of the role of the medical specialist colleges. I simply point out that the colleges have recently been subjected to a form of audit by the ACCC to ensure that it is quality control and not job protection that the colleges are trying to ensure. It is my clear understanding that the colleges have satisfied the ACCC that in fact they are protecting quality rather than trying to restrict access to their specialties and subspecialties.</para>
<para>The final criticism from the member for Lalor was that the government was making too much use of overseas trained doctors. Obviously, all of us would prefer to see Australian-trained doctors serving the Australian community. But a medical student can start today and it will be some 11 years before that student is fully qualified to practise. In the meantime, if we want to boost the supply of doctors in Australia, we do have to make appropriate and intelligent use of overseas trained doctors.</para>
<para>Many communities depend upon overseas trained doctors. Some have been trained in the Third World. Many have been trained in countries such as England and Ireland, which have been traditional sources of overseas trained doctors for Australia—as indeed are our own doctors in practice in the UK and in Ireland. The overseas trained doctors practising in Australia are serving and helping the Australian community. This idea that anyone can migrate to Australia except a doctor is simply wrong. If someone comes to Australia who is appropriately medically qualified, it makes sense to make proper use of that person’s talents. This idea that we should artificially restrict the ability of Australian residents and Australian citizens to practise in ways which serve the Australian community is simply wrong.</para>
<para>I should finally point out that, notwithstanding the strictures of the member for Lalor, there are 10 overseas trained doctors filling positions in districts of work force shortage in her own electorate. I think the last thing the member for Lalor would want is for those 10 overseas trained doctors to be told that they are not wanted. I should also point out to the member for Lalor that 12 doctors in her electorate have taken up incentives offered by the government through the Outer Metropolitan Doctors Scheme. While I would be the first to admit that, as time goes by, the government will further finetune its policies on the medical work force, any fair-minded observer would have to say that the government has done a great deal, particularly under my distinguished predecessors Dr Michael Wooldridge and Senator Kay Patterson. I feel that I have done my best to fill their large shoes and to continue the important programs they put in place. I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para>—The <inline ref="R2402">Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Superannuation Safety and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline> amends relevant superannuation acts by changing some provisions for public servants to make them more consistent with the private sector regulation of superannuation. Specifically, the bill allows negative credit rates to be applied to member accounts in the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme. Allowing a negative credit rating will mean that the CSS, in line with other super funds, will apply a negative in a poor investment year. Currently a ‘smoothing’ is carried out in a negative earnings year by declaring a zero rate of return and transferring the losses forward to the following year or years by a reduction in the positive rate of return. This is carried out through a reserve account. Members’ accounts up to 1 July 2006 will be quarantined. Only accumulations from this date will be affected.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Maintaining smoothing is now very difficult for two reasons. Firstly, the introduction of investment choice will allow members to actively switch investments to higher risk categories. Members who do not do this subsidise members who do. Secondly, the CSS is closed and will experience a rapid decline in membership over the next 10 years. If negative earnings occur, the members who have left the fund due to retirement will be subsidised by the remaining members, who will be required to make up the losses.</para>
<para>The bill also ensures that the operation of the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme and the CSS are consistent with the requirements of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 concerning fitness and propriety standards for superannuation fund trustees. This is a commonsense approach and will ensure that a fit and proper person test, with the power of removal if an individual does not meet the test, covers public sector superannuation, as it does private superannuation trustees. It is a necessary safety improvement.</para>
<para>The bill will validate the payment of benefits from the CSS made in error to a small group of fund members. This will validate payments made by the CSS to a small number of persons, probably in the hundreds, who, on legal advice to the CSS, were paid benefits. Subsequent legal advice after the payments had been made reversed the original legal opinion and concluded that such payments were not permitted by virtue of section 111A of the Superannuation Act 1976, as the fund members were still working. Given the circumstances, it would be unreasonable to go back to the individuals concerned and request repayment, as they may have spent or reinvested the moneys elsewhere. Labor supports the bill and provisions contained within.</para>
<para>Given that this is a superannuation safety bill, Labor is greatly concerned about what is not in the bill. Labor has been greatly concerned for some years about further aspects of safety for superannuation: theft and fraud and employer insolvency. Labor has actively advanced policy to solve the gaps in protection. In respect of theft and fraud, the current law only guarantees protection for up to 90 per cent of moneys lost. The Howard government has tried unsuccessfully to reduce this even further, to 80 per cent.</para>
<para>The current compensation mechanism provides that where theft and fraud occurs, a levy mechanism is applied across fund assets, currently totalling some $710 billion, to compensate the individuals affected. Fortunately, theft and fraud is minute in the context of total savings. This levy, when activated, represents a reduction of some 30c to 40c on members’ fund balances. However, theft and fraud is catastrophic for the few hundred people who are affected each year. Given superannuation is compulsory, long term and for retirement, there is a very strong public interest argument that in these circumstances individuals should be fully compensated. Labor’s second reading amendment reflects this goal.</para>
<para>With respect to employer insolvency, the General Employee Entitlements Scheme, or GEERS, pays compensation for all unpaid wages, all accrued annual leave, long service leave and pay in lieu of notice, and up to eight weeks redundancy entitlements. Statutory entitlements and community standards are covered, except for one—that is, unpaid superannuation contributions under the superannuation guarantee act. Each year some 20,000-plus employees miss out on over $50 million in mainly compulsory superannuation contributions. Often the unpaid super is greater than other, protected entitlements. For example, a worker on a wage or salary of $50,000 a year who has, under GEERS, three weeks annual leave owing and a week’s notice would receive approximately $4,300, but the unpaid super would amount to $4,500. The statutory superannuation payment is unprotected. Labor’s second reading amendment calls on the government to consider extending the GEERS to protect this major statutory entitlement—that is, superannuation.</para>
<para>Finally, I want to comment on the validation of payments made in error to a small group of CSS fund members. There was a further small group who, on legal advice from the fund, made applications for payments but were refused after a second legal advice was received. In many cases their lives were severely disrupted. They arranged and/or entered into arrangements on the basis they would receive this money. The Howard government certainly believed they should receive special consideration. The Minister for Finance and Administration, Nick Minchin, on behalf of the Liberal member for Solomon, Mr Tollner, wrote to a number of such persons ‘inferring’ the government would assist. This has not happened. It is now clear that this was little more than a stunt during a difficult election period. Labor’s second reading amendment also goes to this very important issue. The opposition supports the bill and seeks support from the House for its second reading amendment.</para>

<para>—The <inline ref="R2402">Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Superannuation Safety and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline> will amend three acts: the Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation Act 1990 and the Superannuation Act 2005. The amendments result from the government’s ‘safety of superannuation’ reforms. The bill includes provisions to validate the payment of benefits to particular members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, allows negative crediting rates to be applied to amounts held in the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and makes a number of minor amendments. The minor amendments include the provision to allow members of the staff of the boards of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme the delegation powers of the boards and to allow the boards to send documents to employees and any document or written information that, under the relevant scheme or act or any other act, they are required to send to the member.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Under schedule 1, the bill makes amendments to provide for the application to the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme Board of the new fitness and propriety operating standard under SI(S) or Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, to provide for reduced reliance on acting members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme Board and to provide for the use of proxies at board meetings.</para>
<para>The bill will provide for the appointment of acting members to the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme to comply with the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. The bill allows the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme boards to delegate certain functions to staff and broadens the type of information that can be provided to members via their employers. The amendments will require that substantive and acting appointments to the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme board do not contravene the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 fitness and propriety operating standard. The bill will also provide that the Minister for Finance and Administration may terminate the appointment of any board member who does not meet the standard. These amendments will place the same obligations on the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme Board as for other trustees of superannuation funds in relation to having to comply with fitness and propriety requirements.</para>
<para>The proposed amendments provide for members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme Board to be able to participate in meetings when overseas, to vote and to disclose conflicts of interest at board meetings through proxies. New subsection 27N(4A) also provides that the appointment of the proxy is to be in writing and signed by the appointing member. New subsection 27N(4B) provides that the proxy is not entitled to vote on behalf of the member on a proposed decision unless there is an instrument of proxy appointment which sets out the terms of the proposed decision and indicates whether the appointing member is in favour of or against the proposed decision, and the proxy member votes on the proposed decision in accordance with the indication in the instrument.</para>
<para>The bill also makes amendments to the Superannuation Act 1976 and the Superannuation Act 1990 to broaden the type of information that can be provided to scheme members via their employers, provided that this would not breach the Corporations Act 2001 or any other act. Item 23 will amend paragraph 42A(1)(a)(ii) to allow the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme Board to request a designated employer provide to a member of the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme any information required to be provided by the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme Board to a member under any act. This is necessary as the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme Board is now required to provide information to members under other acts.</para>
<para>I turn now to schedule 2, amendments relating to negative interest rates for the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme. The bill will also amend the Superannuation Act 1976 to allow negative crediting rates, that is, negative earnings, to be applied to amounts held by members in the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme. When the proposed introduction of member investment choice was announced in 2004 the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme Board requested that the restriction on the board declaring negative interest rates be removed to bring arrangements in line with industry practice. The amendments will therefore provide the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme Board with greater capacity than has applied in the past to equitably distribute earnings on the funded accumulation component of members’ benefits between members who leave the scheme and those members who stay. The amendments will also allow the board more flexibility to accurately determine interest rates. Under current arrangements it is difficult for the Public Superannuation Scheme Board and the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme Board to equitably distribute fund earnings between the members who leave the scheme and those who stay, especially when market conditions have led to negative fund reserves. Allowing negative crediting rates brings the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and the Public Superannuation Scheme into line with usual arrangements for funded accumulation components of superannuation benefits in that members will bear the risk of their investment choice.</para>
<para>From 1 January 2006 the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme Board will be able to make negative declarations of interest; however, the board will protect a member’s account balance in line with the announcement it made in September 2004 that a member’s account balance in the fund cannot fall below a certain level. The protected amount from 1 January 2006 will generally be the member’s account balance in the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme Fund as at 1 July 2003 plus member contributions, including any transfer amounts, made between that date and 31 December 2005.</para>
<para>An example of how this will operate is the case of Jenny. Jenny had an account balance in the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme Fund of $200,000 as at 1 July 2003. She paid $12,500 in contributions for the period 1 July 2003 to 31 December 2005 and has unallocated earnings of $50,000 for that period. Jenny subsequently pays $2,500 in contributions and has $10,000 in earnings for the period 1 January 2006, when the amendment commenced, to 30 June 2006. Jenny’s protected amount is $212,500, which is made up of $200,000 plus $12,500, and if the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme Board made a determination of interest as at 30 June 2006 that distributed all of the fund earnings, giving Jenny $60,000 in interest, her account balance would be $275,000 as at that date. The protected amount remains $212,500 irrespective of whether Jenny was in the default investment option or the cash conservative option when the amendments commence and irrespective of any switches she makes between the current options. If Jenny was a Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme deferred benefit member, and had been since 30 June 2003, her protected amount would be $200,000.</para>
<para>I now turn to schedule 3, amendments relating to the validation of certain benefits under the Superannuation Act 1976. This bill will also amend the Superannuation Act 1976 to authorise a small number of Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme benefit payments that were incorrectly paid. These breaches occurred when members were paid Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme benefits without having met a condition of release under Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, such as having a termination of employment or attaining age 65. In most cases the affected members became Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme deferred benefit members when they joined an alternative superannuation arrangement operated by their employer and, after reaching their preservation age, commenced their Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme benefits, the main component being an indexed Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme pension, without having met a Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 condition of release.</para>
<para>The amendments do this by recovering the unauthorised amounts that were paid in this manner as debts due to the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme Board by set-off of these recovered amounts against benefits payable, equal to the unauthorised amounts previously paid. It is intended that the set-off is not likely to involve any actual payment. In the case of future pension payments, the amendments in effect authorise the continued payment of the amount of the original pension that was previously unauthorised.</para>
<para>The amendments also provide where act of grace payments have commenced in lieu of Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme benefits for a period of time before the commencement of the amendments that only the unauthorised Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme benefit amounts paid prior to the commencement of act of grace payments are able to be recovered by set-off against benefits payable. However, even where act of grace payments have been made, the amendments in effect authorise the recommencement of Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme pension payments of the amount of the previously unauthorised pension. Overall the amendments have the effect of prospectively authorising benefit payments, previously made available over a number of years to certain Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme members employed by certain approved authorities, in breach of superannuation law.</para>
<para>Some examples of the effect of the amendments are as follows. For example, John commenced receiving his unauthorised Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme pension of $20,000 in February 2002, and he rolled over his member contributions and interest as a lump sum to another superannuation fund. In February 2005, John met a Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 condition of release because he reached age 65 and so he is authorised to receive Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme payments from that date. The effect of the amendments on John is that his unauthorised lump sum benefit is able to be recovered by set-off against a benefit of an equivalent lump sum benefit amount that is payable to him. The amount of the unauthorised pension paid to John for three years from February 2002 is able to be recovered by set-off against a benefit equal to the amount of that unauthorised pension that is payable to him. Future pension payments are, in effect, authorised to continue at the indexed amount of the previously unauthorised pension.</para>
<para>Another example is Anita, who commenced receiving her unauthorised indexed Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme pension of $30,000 in January 1999 and she purchased an additional unindexed Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme pension of $10,000 per annum with her own contributions and interest. In March 2005 Anita was identified as being in receipt of unauthorised Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme payments and so the payment of these pensions was ceased forthwith and immediately replaced with act of grace payments of equivalent amounts in lieu. Anita meets a Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 condition of release on 1 July 2005. The effect of the amendments on Anita is that both her unindexed additional pension and her employer financed indexed pension of the period January 1999 to March 2005 are able to be recovered by set-off against benefits equal to the amount of her unauthorised pensions during that period that are payable to her. They do not affect the period when act of grace payments were made in lieu. Future pension payments are in effect prospectively authorised to continue at the indexed amount of the previously unauthorised pension. I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para>—The <inline ref="R2402">Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Superannuation Safety and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline> will amend the Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation Act 1990 and the Superannuation Act 2005. These technical amendments are a consequence of the government’s safety of superannuation reforms as well as changes required to facilitate the application of negative interest rates to the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The purposes of this bill are to amend the appointment provisions for members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme board in relation to the safety of superannuation reforms; to extend the delegation powers of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme board and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme board; to allow the use of proxies at meetings of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme board for the purposes of voting and disclosing of interests; to amend the type of information that can be distributed by employers to the members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme; to allow negative crediting rates to be applied to amounts held in the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme; and to authorise particular pension and lump sum Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme payments.</para>
<para>The amendments will ensure that the operation of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme is consistent with the requirements of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 concerning fitness and propriety standards for superannuation fund trustees. This bill will also allow negative crediting rates to be applied to member accounts of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and validate the payment of benefits from the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme made in error to a small group of its members.</para>
<para>A number of recent developments form the background to this bill, including Australia’s new superannuation safety regime and changes that have taken place with the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme itself. Australia’s new superannuation safety regime commenced on 1 July 2004, with a two-year transition for all existing trustees to apply for a new registrable superannuation equity licence and to register their funds. The new regime not only involves a new licensing requirement but also sets standards for responsible officers and directors of trustees, adequate resources, outsourcing and risk management. Trustees that are operating at the commencement of the period will have until 30 June 2006 to obtain a licence and register the entities under their trusteeship. Persons or corporations not operating at the commencement of the period will not have the benefit of the transition period and will need to be licensed prior to commencing operations. To be eligible for a trustee licence, applicants must have robust frameworks in which to identify, measure and monitor the risks arising from the trustee operations and the risks specific to the entities for which they are trustee. These frameworks must be articulated in a formal risk management strategy and risk management plan.</para>
<para>New operating standards have already been made covering the fitness and propriety of trustees, the requirement to hold adequate resources and the manner in which licensees outsource material business activities. These initiatives have brought the industry’s corporate governance and risk management frameworks in line with other industries regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority. Because of this initiative, effectively all superannuation trustees have to hold the appropriate licence by 1 July 2006. The Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme boards are in the process of applying for a superannuation trustee’s licence. The majority of Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme board members are also Public Sector Superannuation Scheme board members.</para>
<para>Another of the recent developments that form the background to this bill came about on 11 August 2004, when the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme board decided to introduce investment choice for the fund’s members. Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme members are now able to choose how their contributions are invested. This approach was implemented between November and December 2004 and was the first step in introducing a greater range of investment choices for Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme members.</para>
<para>As a consequence of introducing investment choice for members, the way in which investment earnings were allocated to the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme members’ accounts was also changed. Prior to 1 July 2003 the earnings on members’ accounts were determined by the calculation of the annual crediting rate. The crediting rate was the rate of return on a member’s account for the previous financial year. Since 1 July 2003 the members’ investment earnings have been determined on the basis of the exit rate. This is the estimated investment performance of the particular member’s chosen investment option between 1 July 2003 and the date on which they exit the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, taking into account fees and taxes. The exit rate is applied to the member’s account balance as at 1 July 2003 and to any subsequent contributions.</para>
<para>When the crediting rate approach was used to calculate the investment return on funds, if the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme fund made an investment loss, and reserves were insufficient to cover that loss, the government paid what was necessary to cover the losses to the extent of the member’s own contributions when the benefit was paid out. To reduce the financial risk to both the government and the members in the event of an investment loss, an investment reserve of five per cent of the assets of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme fund was established. If the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme made a loss, portions of the reserve were allocated to the member’s account. Once investment earnings recovered, the investment reserve was gradually rebuilt to five per cent of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme’s assets.</para>
<para>While the investment reserve was being rebuilt the crediting rate was reduced, including to zero, for that period of time. In this way continuing members shouldered a large proportion of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme’s investment risk by forgoing investment earnings that they might otherwise have earned. Also, when the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme had made a loss and a member left, that member did not take the full extent of the losses with them. The impact of rebuilding the investment reserve on the balances of the remaining members’ accounts was, in these circumstances, greater than it might otherwise have been.</para>
<para>This problem has the potential to have a significant impact in coming years. The Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme was closed to new members in 1990, and with no new members the scheme’s membership profile has rapidly aged. This will result in a comparatively rapid decline in Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme membership over the coming years. If the policy for allocating investment losses and gains had not been changed, the situation might have arisen where a significant number of members exited the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme in a period when the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme experienced an investment loss. These members would not have taken a fair proportion of their investment losses with them and would have left the remaining members with a disproportionate impact on their accounts during the period over which the investment reserve was to be rebuilt.</para>
<para>The new exit rate policy addresses these problems by applying the full extent of investment returns, and losses, continually to members’ accounts. With the adoption of the exit rate as the basis for allocating the investment earnings, the operation of the reserves is now limited to situations where members’ total credited balances exceed the total assets of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme. In such a situation, a negative reserve would be created and would need to be replenished from future earnings. The full implementation of the exit rate approach is hindered by the legal interpretation of the language used in the sections of the 1976 act to be amended by schedule 2 of this bill that the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme cannot declare a negative crediting rate to a member’s account.</para>
<para>Looking at the bill, schedule 1 contains provisions for amendments to the 1976 act, the 1990 act and the 2005 act. The schedule provides for the appointment and termination of members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme board to comply with the new fitness and propriety standard under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. This bill will also provide for the appointment of acting members to the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme board to comply with the superannuation supervision act. The amendments will require that substantive and acting appointments to the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme board do not contravene the superannuation supervision act fitness and propriety operating standard. Also, the schedule provides that a contravention of the standard would allow the Minister for Finance and Administration to terminate an appointment to the board. The proposed amendments will allow for reduced reliance on acting members of the board when substantive members are absent from Australia and provide for members to participate in, vote on and disclose conflicts of interest at board meetings through proxies.</para>
<para>Similar amendments will be made to the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme in the scheme’s trust deed and rules through an amending deed in respect of the above matters. The bill also includes amendments to the 1976 act, the 1990 act and the 2005 act to allow the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme boards to delegate powers to their staff. This will improve the administrative efficiency of the boards. Other amendments to the 1976 act and the 1990 act will allow the boards to send to the designated employer of a member of the relevant scheme any document or written information that, under the relevant scheme act or any other act, they are required to send to the member. This change is necessary as the boards are now required to provide information to members under other acts.</para>
<para>Schedule 2 of this bill provides for amendments to the 1976 act which will allow negative crediting rates to be applied to Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme member accounts. This initiative has the effect that members will bear the investment risk relating to their account balances, as is appropriate. It will also provide the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme board with greater capacity to equitably distribute earnings between those members who leave the scheme and those who stay.</para>
<para>Schedule 3 of the bill also provides for amendments to the 1976 act. This schedule will rectify the situation where a group of Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme members have received benefits in breach of superannuation laws. They were deferred benefit members who had ceased contributory membership by joining an alternative superannuation arrangement offered by their employer. After they had reached preservation age they received payment of the benefits without meeting certain conditions such as terminating their employment or reaching age 65 as required. The amendments in the bill will effectively validate these payments. This bill provides for necessary technical amendments as a consequence of the government’s reforms on safety of superannuation, as well as providing the changes to facilitate the application of negative interest rates to the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme. I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para>—In summing up this debate I would like to thank those who have participated. Indeed, it is a very important piece of legislation—one that is quite complex but of great concern to those who are growing older and need to make sure that their superannuation is safe and that they have appropriate coverage for their old age. The <inline ref="R2402">Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Superannuation Safety and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline> will amend the Superannuation Act 1976 in relation to the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, often referred to as the CSS. The Superannuation Act 1990, which relates to the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, or PSS, is also amended by this bill. Finally, the bill amends the Superannuation Act 2005, which relates to the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan, or PSSap.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Following the passage of this legislation, similar amendments will also be made to the PSS trust deed and rules under the Superannuation Act 1990 and to the PSSap trust deed under the Superannuation Act 2005. The bill primarily makes amendments to implement the government’s safety of superannuation reforms by introducing a new fitness and propriety operating standard to the government’s requirements of the CSS board. The bill also includes changes required to facilitate the application of negative crediting rates to the CSS, changes to validate the payment of benefits to particular members of the CSS and a number of minor amendments related to, for example, the use of proxies for voting and the disclosure of interests by members of the CSS board, the delegation of powers of the CSS and PSS boards and the disclosure of information by those boards to employers.</para>
<para>The Superannuation Act 1976 will be amended to provide that the appointment of a person as a substantive or acting member of the CSS board must not contravene the new fitness and propriety standards. The amendments will also provide for the minister to terminate a board member’s appointment if they do not meet the standard.</para>
<para>The bill will enable the CSS and PSS boards to allocate negative earnings to members’ accounts. The board has requested these changes to allow allocation to members of actual fund earnings, including negative earnings, when member investment choice was introduced for relevant members in 2004. This will resolve the inequity where negative earnings are not passed on to members exiting the funds but are deducted from future earnings applicable to the remaining members’ accounts. With member investment choice, it is appropriate that members bear the relevant investment risk in relation to their individual account balances.</para>
<para>The bill will also amend the Superannuation Act 1976 to authorise a small number of CSS benefit payments that were incorrectly paid because ComSuper incorrectly informed certain members that they were entitled to claim their benefits. The effect of these changes will be that recovery from these individuals will not be required. The member for Hunter was concerned about this element and, indeed, included it as one of the elements of the amendment that he put forward. So I can assure him that the amendments in this bill well and truly cover those few individuals who were concerned in this way.</para>
<para>In particular—I should elaborate a little because this was a significant issue—there were some CSS members who did receive incorrect advice but who did not ever receive payments in relation to that advice. The problem was discovered, fortunately, very early and therefore before any benefit payments were made to the members. On being informed of the situation, the CSS board instructed its administrator, ComSuper, to immediately correct procedures and member information to ensure that no further benefits payments were commenced and undertook a review to establish the number of cases where payment may have been made incorrectly. At the time, relevant members whose applications had been or were being processed were personally contacted, and the CSS board also informed the office of the Minister for Finance and Administration, the minister’s department and the relevant regulatory authorities. The issue was taken very seriously and dealt with very urgently and immediately. The other items in the amendment moved by the member for Hunter are not actually relevant to this particular bill.</para>
<para>The bill will also make a number of technical amendments to enable CSS board members to appoint another board member as proxy, to clarify that CSS board members may participate in meetings by electronic or other means, to enable the CSS and PSS boards to delegate administrative functions to their staff and to broaden the type of information that can be provided by the CSS and PSS boards to scheme members via their employers. I commend this most important bill to the House.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I have recovered from that vicious attack by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration bringing into question the integrity of my amendment to the last bill and I am very pleased to be speaking on the bill before the House. The <inline ref="R2369">Corporations Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005</inline> amends section 197 of the Corporations Act, effecting the potential indemnity of directors of corporate trustees from the liabilities of trusts. The intent behind the amendment is to ensure the directors of corporate trustees have a level playing field with regard to indemnity from liability as do directors of other entities. This is a clarification of section 197, and Labor supports the change.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Specifically the amendment will clarify the potential personal liability of the directors of corporate trustees following the South Australian Supreme Court case in 2003, Hanel v O’Neill. In that case the court found that a director of a corporate trustee could be responsible for liabilities of the trust if the trust did not have sufficient assets to cover its liabilities. The effect of the decision in Hanel v O’Neill was that the liability of directors of corporate trustees could include the paying of all trust debts. This is a level of liability that extends beyond that of directors of other corporations and certainly beyond the original intent of section 197 of the Corporations Act.</para>
<para>In assessing the need for this amendment, it is important to consider the recent legal history in this area. The current section 197 of the Corporations Act was preceded by section 229A of the companies code. Section 229A of the companies code, which was introduced into law in 1986, sought to ensure that on the insolvency of a corporate trading trust unsecured creditors did not have direct access to the trust’s assets. Trading trusts had become popular business structures in the 1970s and there was recognition of the need both to limit the potential exposure of directors of corporate trustees to personal liability and to ensure that directors of corporate trustees were only indemnified from liability to the extent that they had acted properly and within the terms of the arrangement with the trust. Section 229A addressed this dual need by limiting the liability of directors of corporate trustees to obligations for which the trustee was not entitled to indemnity by reference to descending conduct which constituted a breach of trust between the corporate trustee and the interest of the trading trust.</para>
<para>Section 229A later became section 233 when the Corporations Law came into effect in 1990. Then, under the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Act 1999, the new section 197 was introduced, with effect from 13 March 2000. When the Corporations Act came into effect on 15 July 2001, section 197 in its current form became law. The original section 229A of the companies code and later section 197 of the Corporations Act had operated in some obscurity until the interpretation by the South Australian Supreme Court in Hanel and O’Neill, where a broader interpretation of the potential liability of directors of corporate trustees was introduced. The effects of this interpretation I have already outlined.</para>
<para>Given the history of these laws and the reasonable right of the directors of corporate trustees to indemnity from liabilities if they have met their obligations to the interest of the trust, the opposition accepts this amendment as a reasonable clarification of the intent of section 197. It is a change that will provide clarity to directors of corporate trustees and remove a potentially onerous burden on their business dealings. From the opposition’s perspective, it is important also to note that this amendment to section 197 will not indemnify a director of a corporate trustee from liability if they commit a breach of trust or an act against the interests of the trust as per the trust agreement. This interpretation is in line with the original intent of section 229A of the companies code and a position which should be maintained. Labor has always sought to ensure that the Corporations Law balances the need of business proprietors for reasonable protection in the conduct of their business affairs whilst ensuring that there are adequate safeguards in place to prevent the abuse of those protections.</para>
<para>This objective and intent of section 229A was foreshadowed by the then Attorney-General, Lionel Bowen, on 11 October 1985, when in his second reading speech on the Companies and Securities Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 1985 he said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Currently persons contracting with a trustee, whether an individual or a corporation, are entitled to be subrogated to the trustee’s right of indemnity out of the trust assets to meet liabilities properly incurred. However if the trustee acts in breach of trust or in a manner which is not authorised by the terms of the trust, the trustee’s right of indemnity, and therefore the creditor’s right of subrogation, is lost.</para>
<para class="block">The problem this creates for creditors has been exacerbated by the widespread use of business structures involving a nominally capitalised corporate trustee to carry on business on behalf of a trust, together with other refinements, such as the careful siphoning of funds into the trust business. In such cases the creditor’s primary right to sue the corporate trustee for the debt may well be worthless.</para>
<para class="block">I think there is a general recognition in the business community that the legal system cannot tolerate the continued use of artificial legal contrivances which result in the deliberate avoidance of liabilities legitimately owed to other persons. It is proposed to amend the Companies Act to impose personal liability on directors of companies acting as trustee when a debt has been incurred but the trustee company is not entitled to be indemnified out of the assets of the trust.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">With this considered view in mind, the opposition initially held reservations about the implications of the drafting of the current amendment set out in the bill. In particular, we were concerned that the terms of the amendment would limit its application to very narrow circumstances and thereby work against the objective of ensuring these provisions could not be abused. Labor have received advice from the office of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and have consulted with commercial lawyers familiar with Hanel and O’Neill. We are advised by the government that the intent of the amendment is not to diminish the potential liabilities of directors who have not met their obligations to the trading trust. On this basis, we do support the bill.</para>
<para>Ensuring the right balance between the rights of directors and the rights of business stakeholders remains as important an objective now in Corporations Law as it ever was. Given these considerations, the proposed amendments to the potential liability of directors of corporate trustees bringing it into line with that of other directors is a sound objective. Labor has sought to cooperate with the government on this bill, recognising that certainty for many directors of incorporated trustees should be addressed as quickly as possible. As a result, Labor agrees with the amendment. It is a welcome clarification of the application of section 197 and should provide some certainty that directors of corporate trustees are seeking in this regard. Relationships between directors and other directors, directors and creditors and of course directors, creditors and administrators are an important part of our Corporations Law and crucial to the good operation of our economy. I should also include in that group the relationship between directors, creditors, shareholders and, of course, ASIC.</para>
<para>Despite the best attempts by this parliament, too often these laws have let down participants in the system. I use as an example the case of Singleton Earthmoving. Singleton Earthmoving has now been trading as a corporate entity for some 25 years. For all of that time I think it has been controlled by two directors, Mr Bernard Wood and his wife. According to Mr Wood, late last year his wife unilaterally appointed a third director. I have not yet been able to determine whether this was done lawfully in terms of the corporation, and ASIC refuses to offer any opinion on the matter.</para>
<para>I do know that around September 2004 the second director was appointed and the two directors—other than Mr Wood—put the company into voluntary administration and appointed Mr Stuart Ariff as administrator. This was despite the fact that Singleton Earthmoving was a viable ongoing concern which was meeting all of its financial obligations to its various creditors. Around September Mr Ariff held a creditors meeting, which was subsequently adjourned. I understand that Mr Ariff assured creditors attending the meeting that no action on the company would be taken until such time as that meeting had been reconvened. Despite this, some weeks afterwards Mr Ariff took the action of having Singleton Earthmoving’s plant and equipment seized and its phones disconnected. This of course resulted in Singleton Earthmoving no longer be a viable and ongoing concern. Indeed, it led to the retrenchment of 25 employees, some of whom were not paid for the month of September as a result.</para>
<para>By 17 December, at a third meeting of creditors, Mr Ariff was recommending that the company be wound up. The creditors were amazed at this suggestion—these are creditors that had a good relationship with the company, in most cases for some 25 years—but, feeling that Mr Ariff was the expert in these matters and that they were very much in his hands, particularly given that the company was obviously not a viable ongoing concern any longer, and concerned about every opportunity available to them to secure the money owed to them, they decided that they would accept his recommendation and allow the company to be put into liquidation.</para>
<para>On that point I would like to refer to parts of a letter that has been penned by all of the creditors to Mr Bernard Wood’s former company. All of them believe that they have been mistreated and that the administrator—and now the liquidator—has acted inappropriately and they also believe that they collectively represent all of the creditors to the former company. They make 10 points. The first thing they question in point 1 is the very legality of Mr Ariff’s appointment as the administrator and, I suppose by implication, the legality of the appointment of the third director who, with the second director, used their majority to put the company into administration.</para>
<para>They then go on to say in point 2 that at the first creditors meeting: ‘He’—that is Mr Ariff—‘was retained as administrator on the understanding that there would be no significant changes to the company’s operation until the next meeting.’ I take you back to my original point: there was that promise but, despite that promise, the plant and equipment of the company were seized and the phones disconnected. They go on to say that 10 days after the first meeting ‘without notice he forced the company to cease trading’ by doing those things I have just mentioned.</para>
<para>The third point they make is this: they complain about how he tried to prevent their client of over 20 years—that is, Mr Wood—from trading. They say that despite Mr Ariff’s attempts to stop their client trading, not only has he prevailed successfully with the new company but they feel sure that without the administrator’s actions the company would still be going on. They go on in point 4 to talk about how he successfully and quite callously without malice attempted to put 25 long-term employees out of work—and I made that point earlier on.</para>
<para>In point 5 they talk about how, when the director who instigated the administration—that is company director two in particular—realised her mistake or that a mistake had been made and tried to end the administration, Mr Ariff threatened her with Supreme Court action if she continued with her attempts to reverse the situation. They complain in point 6 about how, on 16 November 2004, Mr Ariff informed the creditors committee that one of the reasons for cessation of trading was that there were no formal contracts in place with customers. The creditors say that their investigations showed that this was incorrect and there were indeed formal contracts in place.</para>
<para>In point 7 they talk about how Mr Wood unsuccessfully tried to put in place a deed of company arrangement, which Mr Ariff blocked by various means, including harassment of various creditors to the company. In point 8 they talk about the December meeting at which Mr Ariff’s solicitor threatened five creditors with Supreme Court action if they did not agree to his fees. In point 9 they talk about the three-month period after that meeting in which Mr Wood took a loan from the National Australia Bank to secure the assets again, a situation which, without Mr Ariff, would not have existed. In point 10 they complain about the continued strife for clients’ businesses in that Mr Ariff had auctioned the property that their client had purchased from the National Australia Bank. I suspect that our Mr Ariff is a bit of a cowboy. It is very unfortunate because what we had here was an ongoing viable business employing 25 people and there was never any suggestion of the company’s inability to meet its obligations to its various creditors, including the finance company which held liens over the plant and equipment of the business.</para>
<para>The last point the creditors make is that Mr Ariff is now asking for some $251,000 for fees in kind for the wonderful work he has done with respect to Singleton Earthmoving. I have made some inquiries of ASIC and I am still awaiting a response from ASIC. I hope that ASIC will be able to intervene in this case to the satisfaction of both Mr Bernard Wood and, of course, the creditors that have been burned by the actions of Mr Ariff. If ASIC is not prepared to act, then I will be asking the Treasurer to exercise his authority under section 14 of the ASIC Act to investigate Mr Ariff and direct ASIC to take the appropriate actions against him.</para>

<para>—On 11 August the Manager of Opposition Business asked me to reflect on rulings on the content of questions, suggesting that there may have been inconsistency in my rulings. An analysis of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for both days shows no inconsistency. The rulings were consistent with each other and consistent with longstanding interpretation of the standing orders. The rule applied in all examples cited is:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para>A minister can only be questioned on matters of public affairs, administration and proceedings pending in the House for which he or she is responsible or officially connected.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Therefore, the question on 10 August by the Manager of Opposition Business to the Treasurer about health expenditure was in order. The questions or parts of questions which were ruled out of order did not seek information from a minister which related to the minister’s responsibilities. Examples of such out of order questions or parts of questions include: asking the Deputy Prime Minister for an opinion on his performance without referring to any particular aspect of his responsibilities; asking the Minister for Education, Science and Training to comment on a quotation from a senator; and asking the Deputy Prime Minister if his policy related to the views of a senator.</para>
<para>Furthermore, questions or parts of questions which relate to the minister’s official responsibilities are of course in order. However, it is out of order to ask a minister to comment on a statement made by another person. The only exception to the rule is that the standing orders specifically allow a question to the Prime Minister on whether a minister’s statement in the House represents government policy.</para>

<para>—I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for his question. I can inform him that the labour price index for the June quarter of this year showed a slight acceleration of wage costs, rising four per cent through the year to the June quarter of 2005, which was marginally up from the 3.9 per cent through the year to the March quarter of 2005. These wage costs show that there are real wage increases going on in the community but they are restrained and consistent with low inflation, provided the economy maintains productivity growth. Indeed, the Reserve Bank governor, in his testimony last Friday, noting that the wage cost index was 3.9 per cent, described it as ‘remarkably well behaved’.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The member for Corangamite also asked about measures to improve labour market outcomes. I know that this is of real interest to him because he asked the Governor of the Reserve Bank questions to this effect in Melbourne on Friday. The governor was asked why Europe was showing slow economic growth compared to Australia. The Governor of the Reserve Bank said:</para>

<para class="block">One of the forms of heavy regulation in Europe is labour market regulation. It is extraordinarily heavy labour market regulation, most of which has the effect—as a lot of regulations do—of protecting the insiders at the expense of the outsiders. So the people in the jobs are very heavily protected, while people trying to get in find it very difficult. That is why they are all running 10 per cent unemployment.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The Reserve Bank governor’s view that heavy labour market regulation leads to higher unemployment is not his alone; it is also the view of the IMF, the OECD and this government. It is not the view of the Australian Labor Party, who believe that they know more than the OECD, the IMF or the Reserve Bank governor. The Australian Labor Party believe that ‘the lemon has been squeezed dry’, to use the phrase of the Leader of the Opposition, and that you cannot do any more with labour market improvement. They have given up on creating more jobs and they have given up on having a stronger economy here in Australia. If you want to get outcomes, you have to engage in reform. It is not enough to sit there and prattle on, as the Leader of the Opposition does, and give the game away. Labour market reform in this country will create more jobs, more opportunities and better wages for Australia.</para>

<para>—I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. What I can guarantee is that the government will continue, as we have done over the last nine years, to deliver good services to Australia. We have already delivered over $1 billion in telecommunications infrastructure in Australia. What the government have announced today is a plan to continue to invest billions and billions of dollars in telecommunications services in Australia—in particular, regional Australia—so that we can structure a mechanism that will give certainty and security, not just on the funding of services but also on competition and consumer protection into the future. The package announced today strengthens some of the fundamentals that we, not the Labor Party, put in place. The Labor Party did not put in place the universal service obligation. The Labor Party did not put in place the customer service guarantee. We are going to strengthen those things as part of this package to ensure that telecommunications services are delivered equitably across Australia.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for O’Connor for his question. He represents a large part of Western Australia, and a lot of rural exports go out of his electorate. The most important thing we can do is to continue to maintain the competitive edge of Australia’s producers and exporters right across the nation, whether they be in the cities or in regional Australia. In regional Australia, which is where the member for O’Connor comes from, despite ongoing drought in some areas, our farmers have been making an enormous contribution to Australia’s export effort. Remember that over the last 12 months Australia has exported $162.3 billion worth of goods and services. That is a record as far as Australia is concerned. In 1995-96, it was $99 billion, and it has gone up to $162.3 billion. Out of interest, the Australian beef industry has contributed $4.8 billion in exports, thanks to the 70,000 Aussie beef farmers, some of them in the member for O’Connor’s electorate. The Australian lamb industry has contributed $1.2 billion to that effort, thanks to the 38,400 lamb producers across Australia, a lot of them from Western Australia. That is a very important contribution.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The government are working on a number of fronts to help Australian farmers to export their products and to improve their competitive edge. Obviously, we need to maintain our focus on opening up markets across the world. We also need to maintain our focus on a competitive and efficient environment in Australia, and that includes the telecommunications system across regional Australia. The government’s investment in telecommunications in the past, and what we have proposed today for the future, will continue to help Australia’s exporters to remain globally competitive. A critically important element of this debate is that, under the announcements made by the government today, services will be delivered and guaranteed into the future. Fundamental reforms are needed, and will be delivered, to fund new infrastructure, encourage competition and safeguard services—all important elements of the package.</para>
<para>We are not resting on our laurels. We are not in a policy vacuum, unlike those on the other side of politics. All the ideas for reform and improvement are coming from this side of the House. We will continue to deliver good policy, sound economic management and strategic investment in essential infrastructure so that we can maintain the competitive edge for Australian industry and Australian exporters.</para>

<para>—I thank the honourable member for Dobell for his question. I can inform the honourable member for Dobell that the proceeds of privatisation which have been received under the administration of this government have been used to retire Labor Party debt—that is, the capital sum has been offset by a reduction in capital liability. When this government was elected the Commonwealth debt was $96 billion. By the end of the financial year just past, this government had reduced Commonwealth debt in net terms by $80 billion.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>There is no difference between the government and the opposition on privatisation policy. Just to prove the point, I will table the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> of 25 August 1994, which has this headline: ‘Privatisation vital: Beazley’ The article says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Minister for Finance, Kim Beazley, made a spirited defence of privatisation in his address to the National Press Club yesterday.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The Labor Party do not actually oppose privatisation. In fact, they used to give spirited defences of the practice. But there is a big difference between the privatisation practised by the Labor Party and that practised by this government. When the Labor Party engaged in privatisation—and I was reminded of this by the member for Melbourne yesterday—they spent the entire proceeds in the year of receipt.</para>
<para>Let me give you an example. In October 1993, under Labor the first tranche of the Commonwealth Bank was sold off for $1.7 billion. The Australian Labor Party government spent the full $1.7 billion in October 1993 and then, after they had spent the full $1.7 billion, borrowed another $15 billion to actually finance their budget. Let me give you another example. In July 1995 the Australian Labor Party government privatised Qantas and received $1.5 billion. In the year of receipt, which was 1995-96, they spent the lot so that by the end of the financial year they had no shares and no proceeds and, after spending the lot, borrowed another $12.3 billion to finance their budget.</para>
<para>In relation to all of the privatisation conducted by the Australian Labor Party, they sold the shares, spent the money, ran the budget in deficit and borrowed to fund it as a consequence. There is not one dollar in either asset or reduced debt to show for Labor Party privatisation. In fact, during those privatisations net debt ran up to $96 billion. This government has a very different view. This government has always applied the proceeds of privatisation to the reduction of debt. Net debt, as I said, has been reduced under this government by $80 billion. With the proceeds of the privatisation of Telstra, this Commonwealth government will become debt free in net terms. What a legacy that will be for future generations—not paying back Labor’s debt but building a financial position.</para>

<para>—Of course the government is not a distressed seller. The government does not sell Telstra because it needs money. It is not like the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party sold assets, spent the money and still had to borrow to cover a budget deficit. This is a government—and this is a very important point—that has the budget in surplus. It has net debt which will be totally eliminated and therefore it is not a distressed seller. So that puts the government, on behalf of the Australian taxpayer, in a strong position. It puts the government in a position where it can choose to offer the Telstra shares at a time which will maximise benefits for taxpayers and give a decent investment for private investors. These are matters which will be the subject of commercial judgment. They will be made at an appropriate time, and they will be done in a way in which the government can do it without being rushed into a particular timetable.

<para>—I thank the honourable member for Mackellar. I know that she, for one, is a very strong supporter of the evolution of democracy in Iraq, even if not every member of this House is. I think it is well understood by the House that the people of Iraq are working on putting together a constitution which reflects the general wishes of the people of that country. They have made good progress, although I note that the National Assembly of Iraq, which is a democratically elected body, voted on Monday to give a week’s extension to these negotiations.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>There has been a constructive outreach process which has been supported by the United Nations in putting a constitution together. Indeed, honourable members might be interested to know that a quarter of a million Iraqis have joined in meetings to help draft the constitution, so it has been a very open and inclusive process. There are now around 550 voter registration centres enrolling voters for a constitutional referendum which is scheduled to be on 15 October. If that takes place, that will be another act of democracy which will come on top of the 8½ million people who went out to vote on 30 January.</para>
<para>I know the situation in Iraq is still difficult—no-one has any illusions about that—but I also know one thing about our approach to this, and that is that we are champions of democracy. We are on the side of democracy and we want to see the evolution of democratic institutions in Iraq. That is what we want to see. I think that slowly but surely Iraq is heading in that direction.</para>
<para>Let me just say in conclusion that some people, such as the Leader of the Opposition—and I was asked about alternative views—think that the international community should set a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq of military forces. I think that is the wrong policy. I think that is a policy which is wrong-headed. I think the right policy is to set benchmarks to make sure that we achieve certain objectives and, when those objectives have been achieved, we should, of course, be able to withdraw. That is what many people have said. We hope that the time when those benchmarks, such as the training of the Iraqi defence forces, will all have been achieved will be sooner rather than later, but we will wait to see.</para>

<para>—The Leader of the Opposition constantly interjects. On this issue, he is profoundly—and I say there is one word that sums up his approach—weak. That is what you are—weak. There are 20 million people out there who know it. The member for Griffith, by the way, I think has some sympathy for our view, and that was revealed in Bernard Lagan’s book. That book has not had much of a run but it is a good book. On 25 May 2004 the member for Griffith said: ‘When we took the decision about troop withdrawal by the end of the year, we took it because we felt it was the right thing to do.’ The member for Griffith said that they took the decision because it was ‘the right thing to do’. That is what he told the Australian public. But Bernard Lagan revealed that Rudd ‘desperately wanted to persuade the Labor leader not to set a Christmas deadline,’ and, when he did, ‘Rudd was infuriated.’ The member for Griffith said one thing to the Australian public, but behind the scenes he was pursuing a completely different policy. What are we left with? We are left with the shambles of a policy on Iraq by a Leader of the Opposition whose greatest pretence is that he knows something about international security.

<para>—It is nice to get a question of substance from this side of the House. I thank the member for Mitchell for his question. It was a delight to be in his electorate a couple of weeks ago and to meet with many of his supporters and the small business people in the electorate of Mitchell.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In reply to the member for Mitchell, I inform the House that currently there are six state and federal IR systems that operate in Australia. That means that we have more than 4,000 awards operating in this country, which means that there are an estimated 40,000 different wage rates in Australia. In fact, it was recently estimated that there is around one award wage classification for every 27 employees in Australia. This is a system that is strangled by red tape. Imagine for a moment that Australia had six different income tax systems with 40,000 different tax rates. We would say that that was a system which was absolutely absurd—and that is true of this system of workplace relations.</para>
<para>Figures in the labour movement recognise this problem. This week the Premier of Victoria, Mr Bracks, argued:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... let’s fix the duplication, let’s fix the different systems. In doing that you can take about a quarter off regulation, and that’s pretty useful for our productivity.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So here is the Premier of Victoria saying, ‘Let’s fix this sort of duplication.’ Unfortunately and disappointingly, we have the Premier of Victoria, on the other hand, out there supporting the other states to retain their duplicated workplace relations systems. But Premier Bracks is not the only person from the labour movement who recognises the problem.

<para class="block">That is what the Secretary of the Australian Workers Union was complaining about in a speech to the National Press Club a couple of years ago. Just recently we saw the Leader of the Opposition on the same platform with Mr Shorten saying, ‘We’ve got many union leaders in parliament and there are going to be many more.’ One of them wants his job, I know. But if the Leader of the Opposition is going to listen to the likes of Mr Shorten about the absurd confusion and duplication of legislation that we have now, then he ought to listen to us on the subject. Having a single system of industrial relations in Australia is something whose time has come, and it is something on which we will act, in the national interest, to seek to achieve.</para>

It follows the previous question to him, which asked for his attitude to alternative approaches to those of the government on industrial relations policy. Has the minister seen comments by Western Australian state National Party President, Wendy Duncan, that the extreme policy changes he proposes could create instability for businesses, particularly the plan to exempt businesses employing fewer than 100 people from unfair dismissal laws, and that:</para>

<para>—The reality is that these are not extreme laws. What the government is proposing is the further, incremental improvement of workplace relations in Australia. When these proposals are passed through the parliament, Australia will still have a more regulated system of industrial relations than countries such as the United Kingdom and New Zealand. That is the reality. Those countries which have adopted a more flexible system of workplace relations—and the United Kingdom is an example of this—have lower levels of unemployment and have more of their people in work. That is the reality.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The UK has lower levels of unemployment. Tony Blair, the modern Labour leader in the UK, told the first meeting of the Trades Union Congress when he became the Labour leader that he was not going to make changes to what Margaret Thatcher had put in place. He said he was not going to make those changes, because it had led to a better outcome for the working men and women of Great Britain. That is what we are on about as well. The contrast to that are those countries that still retain inflexible and rigid workplace relations systems. Look at Germany, France and Spain, which have unemployment—</para>

<para>—I do appreciate the member for Wakefield’s question, Mr Speaker. My lip-reading skills were required at times! As this House knows, this is a government which does not just talk about Medicare; this government put in place the sensible improvements necessary to make a good system even better. Thanks to the government’s bulk-billing incentives, I can inform the member for Wakefield that almost 85 per cent of GP consultations with people over 65 are now bulk-billed, thanks to the policies of the Howard government. And, thanks to the Howard government’s higher private health insurance rebate for seniors, fewer older people need hard-pressed beds in public hospitals.</para>

<para>—I certainly have been asked about alternative policies, and that is well and truly in accordance with the practice of this House. The only policy of the member for Lalor is something called Medicare Gold. She told <inline font-style="italic">Meet the Press</inline> recently that everyone in Labor believes in the principles of Medicare Gold. That is quite odd, because the former chief of staff for the Leader of the Opposition called Medicare Gold ‘a strategic disaster’. The Labor intellectual Peter Botsman said of Medicare Gold that it was a policy with the head of a donkey and the body of a wombat. The President of the Labor Party himself, Barry Jones, said that Medicare Gold was a ‘turkey’, and even the Leader of the Opposition said about Medicare Gold that it ‘disappeared with Mark’. So everyone, according to the member for Lalor, believes in it, except unimportant people like the party president and the party leader—</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Casey for his question. Obviously, ASIO’s questioning and detention powers were developed with an awareness of the need to protect our community from the threat of terrorism without unfairly encroaching on the rights of individuals. Questioning warrants are particularly useful where the threat of terrorism is immediate and other methods of intelligence collection will be either too slow or ineffective at obtaining information about suspicious activity. The questioning and detention process is subject to quite strict legislative requirements, which include clear time limits as well as the following safeguards. Strict criteria must be satisfied before a warrant can be issued. A warrant is issued by an independent issuing authority who is a federal judge or a magistrate. Strict time limits on the period of questioning apply—up to 24 hours, or 48 hours if an interpreter is required. The length of detention, to ensure that people remain available for questioning, can be for up to seven days—the period in which questioning in that 24- or 48-hour period can proceed. There is a right to seek a remedy in the Federal Court at any time. Supervision of questioning by an independent prescribed authority occurs, and that is a person who has had judicial experience. Criminal offences for officials who breach safeguards are included in the act. The ability of the subject of a warrant to contact the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security or the Commonwealth Ombudsman at any time to make a complaint about ASIO or the Australian Federal Police is also available as a remedy.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Unfortunately, there is a good deal of misinformation and, some might say, misunderstanding about the way the powers operate. If people perpetuate these myths, it could lead to unjustified concern in the community. For example, the suggestion that the laws allow the authorities to ‘disappear’ somebody is completely without foundation. Warrants authorising detention must permit the person to contact others, including a lawyer of the person’s choice. ASIO is a very professional organisation. It uses its powers to protect the Australian community judiciously and effectively, and only as a last resort.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Kingston for his question. He is working hard for Reynella East and Hackham West primary schools in his electorate. The Prime Minister and I announced early last year the conditions that would be placed on Australian government funding for schooling over the next four years: firstly, national consistency in Australian schooling from starting age to common testing throughout the milestones of school education; secondly, that the performance of Australian schools will be published and made available for the communities within which those schools are based; thirdly, that there would be plain language reporting to parents about the progress of their children so that parents have a very clear idea about how their children are performing at school.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Something seems to have happened over the last generation in that the educational bureaucrats and ideologues have grabbed control of the school bus and forced parents to sit in the back seat with commonsense, so much so that today in Australian schools many parents are receiving language neutered, politically correct, meaningless reports that tell them absolutely nothing about the progress of their children. The Australian government’s legislation, which was passed late last year, requires plain language reporting to parents. That means that parents will receive reports next year that tell them that their child will be rated A, B, C, D or E in specific subjects. Further to that, Australian parents in any school that receives funding from the Australian government will be told how their children are performing compared to other children in the class and across Australia.</para>
<para>It was rather interesting that I read yesterday in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> about the announcement of the recently installed Premier of New South Wales, Mr Iemma, in response to the Australian government’s initiative that the New South Wales government will require A, B, C, D and E reporting for primary schools. I should inform the New South Wales government that they are ‘moving in the right direction’, to use their terminology. However, they will also need to do it for the compulsory years of schooling, which means up to and including year 10. The Premier said this at his announcement:</para>

<para class="block">“Where is our daughter in maths and English in relation to her schoolmates in her class?” Mr Iemma said</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">When looking at a New South Wales school report today, the Premier would be forgiven for having that attitude. Kids are ranked ‘working towards’, ‘almost achieving’ and ‘achieved’. An ‘A’ in modern education speak is ‘achieved’. Imagine the Prime Minister ringing Bob Jane during the Bathurst 1000 and asking, ‘How’s Skaifey going?’ He does not want to be told he is ‘almost achieving’. What does that mean? Is he off the starting line or can he see the chequered flag? If the foreign minister rings Richie Benaud and asks, ‘How’s Ricky Ponting going?’ he does not want to be told that he is ‘consolidating’. In response to these conditions of funding, New South Wales, Western Australia and Tasmania have basically signed up for these conditions. Unless they have these plain language reports by New Years Eve this year, they will not receive a dollar of Commonwealth funding for schooling next year.</para>
<para>I notice that the Tasmanian Essential Learnings report card—I do not know why they cannot just say ‘subjects’, by the way—says ‘being literate’. The average parent would say, ‘What does being literate mean? Does that mean reading and writing? Why can’t they say it?’ There is also ‘reflective thinking’—something that perhaps the member for Franklin is doing at the moment. The reality is that Mr Mark Latham had many faults, but when he delivered his assessment of his Labor colleagues, he did so in plain language—A-grade something or other—because he knew that everyday Australians trying to feed their kids and pay their car loans knew exactly what that meant.</para>

<para>—Mr Speaker, I wish add to an answer. Earlier in question time, the member for Wills, as part of the Labor Party’s scintillating attack of the government on Telstra issues, asked me a question about Norlink Communications. I am now in a position to be able to provide a comprehensive answer to his inquiry.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The history and background of this is that Norlink Ltd was formed by the Lismore City Council, together with other councils in the region, the Southern Cross University and several other community bodies from the Northern Rivers district. It in turn formed Norlink Communications Ltd as the operating company for the telecommunications business. The project received seed funding of $1½ million, announced in July 2001, from the Networking the Nation program to improve telecommunications in this region. Importantly—the member for Wills may not know this, or he omitted to include it as part of his answer—the New South Wales state government also contributed towards funding of the project. The purpose of the project was to provide high bandwidth data and voice services over wireless local loop to three towns in the region, Kyogle, Maclean and Mullumbimby.</para>
<para>The member for Wills will be interested to know, as part of the background and make-up of the issue, that difficult terrain between Lismore and Kyogle delayed construction of the Kyogle base station. Equipment to achieve this connection was purchased early in 2005. Norlink provides enhanced telecommunications services to 17 towns, well in excess of the target of three towns. Telstra’s early provision of ADSL to Maclean enabled Norlink to give priority to other communities.</para>
<para>Norlink chose to call in administrators to take over management of the company, I am advised, because of the concerns it had about a long-term dispute with one of its suppliers, Soul Pattinson Telecommunications, regarding payment for its services and issues that Norlink Communications Ltd had in terms of those services. I am advised that yesterday, 16 August, creditors signed a deed of arrangement in regard to Norlink Communications Ltd, so it is now under administration. Norlink’s fixed line service based on the resale of Telstra services has been sold as part of the restructure. This was an additional business activity beyond the purposes for which Norlink was granted Networking the Nation funds.</para>
<para>In conclusion, I am advised that it is the intention of the administrators to continue to run and further develop the high bandwidth data and voice services over wireless local loop for which Norlink received Networking the Nation funding.</para>

I have today received an email and fax from Mike Berwick, Mayor of Port Douglas Shire Council, threatening legal action should I raise certain matters in this House relating to allegations I put before the Crime and Misconduct Commission. By way of background, on 3 August I met with Peter Jones, principal complaints officer, and Russell Pearce, acting director of the Queensland Crime and Misconduct Commission, in their Brisbane office. At that meeting I presented a 19-page submission containing 16 serious allegations and supporting documentary evidence outlining corruption, abuse of power, misappropriation of federal funds and conflicts of interest involving council matters and federal funding.</para>

<para>—by a number of members of the community, including concerned people from my area in the Hunter Valley. Last night I submitted the matter to Peter McGauran, the federal Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, to investigate the allegations of misappropriation of federal funds. I consider that the Crime and Misconduct Commission and the minister’s office are at this stage the best avenues through which to conduct the investigations. However, it is my duty, both as a member of this parliament and in my capacity as Chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, to refer this matter to both the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit and the Auditor-General for further investigation.</para>

<para>—Mr Speaker, could I ask you to reflect on a number of the rulings that you made in question time today. Could I put to you the very simple point that it cannot be in order for questions to invite a minister to speculate on the alternate views of persons unnamed if it is out of order for a question to ask a minister about the alternate view of persons named. Either both are in order or both are out of order. We have got to the absurd situation where the government’s formulation—and, Mr Speaker, you are familiar with it, as am I—asks ministers to canvass alternate views whereas, on your present rulings, it is impossible for the opposition to ask ministers about the views even of people within their own parties. That cannot be a consistent interpretation of the standing orders. I am not asking you to rule on it now. I think it is a matter which requires reflection. I would ask you to do that, and we might be able to discuss it further later today.</para>

<para>—Today we have heard that the government is getting set to sell Telstra and that the National Party is all set to fall into line, in particular Queensland National Party senator Barnaby Joyce—Backdown Barnaby. This must be a world record for the shortest time ever spent as a maverick in the Senate. They should put it on that Sunday night TV show <inline font-style="italic">Australia’s Guinness world records</inline>. Barnaby Joyce arrives in Canberra last week. He gets shirt fronted by Senator Heffernan and the member for O’Connor, old Ironbar. Five minutes later, what remains? Barnaby Rubble. Five minutes of political sunshine, Barnaby. Hope you enjoyed it.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The National Party is always ready to sell out its constituency provided the price is right. We on this side of the House always knew they would sell out, because that is the nature of the National Party. Now they are led by a former auctioneer. Some people might think this is highly appropriate—a political party that will sell anything provided the price is right being led by an auctioneer. But he is a strange kind of auctioneer: Telstra offered $5 billion and he sold for $3 billion. I don’t know about you, but I would not want him selling my house. The pity and the tragedy of it is that the Leader of the National Party is selling off something of far more value—an asset Australians have built up over the course of a century and something which, once it is lost, can never be regained.</para>
<para>The members of the National Party will be out there trying to claim that this is a win. At least Backdown Barnaby has the grace to still maintain that Telstra should not be sold, that the best interests of Australians would be served by Telstra continuing to remain in majority public ownership. But the rest of The Nationals will be out there claiming that there is now $3 billion available to compensate country people for the loss of the publicly owned Telstra—$1 billion for capital investment and $2 billion for a fund to pay for upgrades to the rural telecommunications network.</para>
<para>The first point that ought to be observed here is that telecommunications is not just an issue for rural and regional Australia. The sale of Telstra is not just bad for country Australia; it is bad for all of Australia. There is no suggestion that the outer metropolitan areas, for example, are going to get anything out of this. All they will get is poorer services and higher charges. But the National Party will be out there spruiking this $3 billion in a ‘never mind the quality, feel the whip’ selling job. But wait, haven’t we heard this before? What became of the money that they got from the first sales of Telstra, which brought in $17 billion and $16 billion respectively? Back then they set up the Natural Heritage Trust to enlist the support of the green groups for the sale. The green groups fell for it and were duly conned—as you always are when you deal with this government.</para>
<para>Firstly, the government slashed spending from the environmental part of the budget on the basis that it was no longer needed on account of Telstra and the Natural Heritage Trust money. Secondly, they turned it into a government slush fund, with the vast majority going to Liberal and National Party held electorates. Thirdly, they wasted the money and failed to deliver real improvements for the Australian environment, which has continued to deteriorate on all the objective measurements during their time in office.</para>
<para>The Auditor-General found it impossible to work out what benefits, if any, Australians got from the Natural Heritage Trust because the government—oops—forgot to monitor the projects and collect any genuine data about the outcomes. They simply handed the money over and walked away—no monitoring, no evaluation.</para>
<para>I have talked about that before. Today, I want to talk about Networking the Nation. As the Howard government prepares to sell the remainder of Telstra, the House needs to ask: what do we have to show for the $3 billion distributed to groups in regional Australia following the T1 and T2 Telstra sales under the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund? Very little of it in fact resulted in infrastructure. Instead, the government handed out large numbers of grants to groups in regional Australia for services rather than for infrastructure. Many of the groups had little expertise or track records. Most were unable to establish viable projects. The opportunity to build regional infrastructure was blown away with a host of grants that have been of little lasting value to regional Australia.</para>
<para>Networking the Nation was one subprogram of the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund, funded with around $500 million of Telstra sale money. In one scathing audit report—and there were several—the Auditor-General found that the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts did not have an appropriate management framework in place to monitor the efficiency and effectiveness of Networking the Nation programs and that it had inadequate needs assessment and risk assessment, a lack of measurable targets and significant numbers of outstanding project reports and acquittals. That was in Audit Report No. 12 2003-04.</para>
<para>Investigations show that much of the money from the first two Telstra sales was wasted. For example, there were 130 taxpayer grants to New South Wales rural projects after the first Telstra sale, but one in four of those grants did not add a single telephone or internet service to the bush. Instead, 27 per cent of the grants funded studies, strategies, needs assessments and training programs. More than $95 million of the telecommunications funding promised to the bush was later withdrawn by the government and counted as savings or spent on other projects.</para>
<para>An audit report into the programs was highly critical of the lack of accountability imposed on those who received the grants. It found that administration costs soaked up 27 per cent of one program to set up 500 rural transaction centres. Yesterday, the well-respected <inline font-style="italic">Byron Shire Echo</inline> gave a detailed report of what had happened on the North Coast of New South Wales:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Nats made Networking The Nation, in part set up as a ‘social bonus’ of earlier Telstra sales, a very useful pork barrel from 1997 to 2004. The north coast was awash with NTN funds in its heyday. It was probably no hindrance that the chairman of NTN was Doug Anthony, father of then Richmond MP Larry Anthony.</para>

<para class="block">In relation to this failed $894,000 project, there are plenty of questions to be answered by the government. The businessman associated with this grant, Mr Christopher Sanderson, will now not field questions from journalists about the project. When the government is asked to account for this expenditure, it simply emails a link to the Grower Direct web site, which itself has links to other company sites. Those companies have told various media outlets that they never had any association with the company. So the question is: just how was that $894,000 grant money spent? Has any of it found its way into Jindi-Net, a wireless broadband network run from Jindibah—an ‘intentional community’, whatever that means—by none other than Mr Christopher Sanderson, the recipient of the grant money?</para>
<para>Labor will be taking up the fight on this issue. We will require that this and many other Networking the Nation acquittals lodged with the department are produced. It seems that the only thing the community has to show for almost $1 million to improve regional telecommunications is the digital ghost of the Grower Direct web site. It is a shameful legacy that does not augur well for other regional projects meant to compensate the bush for the ghost of Telstra public ownership. Australians throughout country Australia need to be warned. They have been sold a dummy on regional telecommunications infrastructure before and it will happen again.</para>
<para>One of the things that you can be absolutely guaranteed of is that Telstra money will be used to fund a government advertising campaign—money from the sale of a national asset paying for Liberal and National Party propaganda. Last year, the campaign Working to Keep the Country Connected—don’t you love those Orwellian titles?—hit rural and regional airwaves from May to July. Of course it was entirely coincidental that this was in the lead-up to the federal election. That campaign swamped rural and regional TV and radio stations, as well as newspapers, with advertisements to inform people about their telecommunications rights. I am asked about the costs. The total advertising campaign cost in 2003-04 was $5 million. In 2004-05 it was $953,000. So nearly $6 million was spent in total, yet only $73,000 of this amount was spent on printing the booklet—<inline font-style="italic">Your Phone Service. Your Rights</inline>—that this advertising campaign was supposed to promote.</para>
<para>As it happens, an answer to a question from Senator Faulkner indicates that, despite over $3½ million of taxpayers’ money being spent on TV, radio and newspaper advertising placements, as of 1 June 2004 only 971 calls had been logged at the tel:info helpline. This means that between 9 May and 1 June on average only 40 people per day right across Australia—that is two people per hour—called the helpline at the peak of the advertising campaign. That it is a pathetically low response for a campaign that cost almost $6 million. Since the 2004 election, it has all melted away and is no longer available online—so much for keeping the country connected.</para>
<para>The partial sale of Telstra was a mistake; the complete sale will be a bigger mistake. It is being proposed by people who ought to know better. Networking the Nation simply turned into a National Party pork barrel and millions of taxpayers’ dollars were wasted. If the Howard government privatises the rest of Telstra, the National Party will again turn as much of the proceeds as it can into a National Party slush fund. It will be another massive waste of public money. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I am absolutely staggered that Labor would invite the public to hear what they did in their 13 years in government for telecommunications across this great country and what the John Howard led government has willingly undertaken since 1996 to bring back a more equitable system of telecommunications, one that is competitive and one that delivers world-class opportunities to those who have to communicate to survive.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I was amused that the member for Wills spent a lot of time in his remarks on the spending of some of the first partial sale of Telstra funds, saying what an appalling thing it was to spend these funds on the biggest environmental program Australia has ever seen. I was parliamentary secretary to the environment minister while the member for Wills was the opposition spokesman for the environment. I remember that he said again and again—it is the only contribution he ever made to environmental debate—that the problem with the Natural Heritage Trust was that Labor seats were not getting enough of it and that there should have been more spending on that magnificent program in Labor held seats. As various reviews showed, the relationship of the allocation of funds matched almost exactly where the seats were in the landscape. It is a simple case that rural and regional voters do not vote for the Labor Party. The seats which have the environmental issues tend to be in the hands of the coalition.</para>
<para>I suppose that is why we were not so surprised that in 1996, when the Labor Party’s telecommunications policy was revealed for all to scrutinise, the word ‘regional’ appeared but once. Not a cent of the Labor Party’s telecommunications policy was committed to telecommunications for rural or regional people—not a cent. Was that because Labor had built up, in the previous 13 years, a magnificent system that served rural, regional and metropolitan Australia? Let us remind ourselves of what telecommunications in Australia was all about under Labor.</para>

<para>—Businesses went broke. People gave up and walked away. There were domestic tragedies. There were people who could not cope because, under Labor, they could not get the phone connected at their new home for over two years. That is disgusting. Under a Liberal led coalition, today only 20 days are required to get a new service hooked up to your new home or business. And we are expecting to see that number come down even further. That 27 months compared to 20 days is just one example—and a pretty interesting example—of what happened with telecommunications under Labor. They presided over a Telstra-Optus duopoly that was uncompetitive. The money made went back into those outfits rather than into new technology. There was no universal service obligation in place to make sure that country or suburban people got a fair go; hence, there was a two-year waiting time for a new phone. It was absolutely disgraceful. Let me remind those on the other side of the House what we on this side know—and, because you do not represent rural and regional people, you probably did not realise—that, under Labor, mobile service coverage actually contracted in rural and regional Australia.</para>

<para>—I suspect it was just that they did not understand what it meant not to be able to use telecommunications in rural and regional areas. So, in a deal done in 1993 with Vodafone, Labor said: ‘We’ll let you do a certain sort of business. We’ll make it viable for you by withdrawing the analog mobile service. It will have to close by the year 2000.’ When we came into government in 1996, we could not undo that contract; the cost to the taxpayer would have been too great. So, right across the country in 2000, analog services were shut down. Thank you, Labor. That was a most appalling decision you made back in 1993. We saw mobile services contract under your regime.</para>

<para>The member for Wills was most excited when he listed project after project that had been funded through the partial sale of Telstra in addition to the magnificent environmental program. Let us look at what has been done by the Howard led coalition since 1996 by way of improvements in telecommunications. We tackled the problem that we inherited from Labor with three major strategies. The first strategy was to encourage competition to deliver innovation, cheaper prices and greater choice. As a result of our work, the price of phone calls in Australia has come down by 20 per cent since 1996. I will be reminding those opposite of that figure quite a few times.</para>

<para>—Our second plank was to establish and maintain a tough regulatory consumer safeguard regime with price controls, a customer service guarantee and the universal service obligation. We do not believe you should simply leave it to the carriers to do as they will. We have put in very tough safeguards and they will continue to be there. That is why we have given a better go for rural, regional and outer-suburban people when it comes to their services. The third plank is targeted funding to improve services, particularly in areas that are not served, or not well served, by the market because, for example, they are very remote or have a very low population density.</para>

<para>What have we achieved through the three main planks of our policy? Firstly—and I have already mentioned this—the price of services has fallen by 20 per cent. Customers have greater choice of service provider than ever before. This continues to drive competition, which brings down prices and stimulates innovation, leading to new services being rolled out all the time. We have had some independent evaluation—not in house as the member for Wills suggests—from the Allen Consulting Group. The evaluation was authorised by the Australian Communications Authority and it looked at what the telecommunications reforms have delivered to Australia since 1996. It found the telecommunications reforms have increased the size of the Australian economy by $12 billion. It found we have created approximately 4,000 new jobs with the new competition and the expansion of services, and we have delivered benefits to small business of $1.8 billion. We have not denied them a phone for two years; we have actually delivered benefits to small business of at least $1.8 billion. On average, each Australian household is $759 better off as a result of our telecommunications strategy since 1996.</para>

<para>—That is a very significant saving for households, indeed. There are now more than 100 telecommunications carriers operating in Australia and I am sure there are going to be more. Of course, they compete and help with innovations. There are more than 16 million mobile phones in operation in Australia. People can now choose whether they even install a landline phone in their house or apartment: they can just rely on mobile phones. The number of broadband subscribers in Australia is now well over one million.</para>

<para>—This is an example of the competitive environment we now have: almost half of Telstra’s ADSL subscriptions are wholesale services that are being resold to competitors. Since 1997 the Howard government has committed more than $1 billion to improving telecommunications infrastructure and services in Australia. As I have just shown with that independent evaluation, the $1 billion investment has delivered in manifold ways, in terms of added value and choice, to our great Australian nation.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>This expenditure has covered programs including Networking the Nation and the social bonus, which came about as a result of our very intensive Besley and Estens inquiries. We always listen hard and we will continue to review. The most recent commitment was for more than $180 million in response to the Estens inquiry. So we have delivered, in the way that I have just described. And what an extraordinary achievement, given what we had to deal with—the neglect of telecommunications under Labor, particularly for rural and regional people who were in despair when it came to trying to do business and run social lives and communities when they simply could not connect.</para>
<para>Today there has been an announcement. It is probably one of the most significant announcements for telecommunications since our initial policy launches in 1996. It is a continuation of the magnificent work that has been ongoing since 1996. It is called Connect Australia. I want to applaud our Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Helen Coonan, who has done a magnificent job, and all of the committees, the Liberal and National Party backbenchers, the middle benchers and the ministers who have worked to make this new policy one of the most significant announcements that we have ever seen in telecommunications services in Australia.</para>
<para>We have reannounced our commitment to first-class communications services for Australia. We will continue to deliver on that promise, with a $1.1 billion roll-out of broadband, new regional clever networks, mobile services and special telecommunications services for Indigenous communities, who are often in the most remote parts of our great country. As well as that $1.1 billion, there will be $2 billion dedicated to a communications fund. This will be established, and the earnings from the fund will be used to provide new communications services for rural Australia.</para>
<para>The government will also provide a more robust regulatory framework for the telecommunications industry. We will not do what Labor did: simply hope and pray that something good will happen. Quite simply, you need a watchdog in this world and we will maintain the strongest of safeguards to protect our consumers. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline> Let me say in these last few seconds that you will have to do better than that to shut down the fact that telecommunications in this country were a disgrace before 1996. They were appalling. Now Australia has some equity, some good cost products and some innovative technology. I want to commend our government and particularly Senator Helen Coonan for the magnificent job that she has done. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

Christmas may be coming early to the bush, but it is the rest of Australia that will be putting the presents under the tree. There is no doubt that Telstra will be sold. Australia will be sold out, and Australian mums and dads will be paying more for poorer services.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The interesting thing during most of this debate, one which you would think the National Party would have some real interest in, is that the National Party has been outnumbered in this chamber by the Independents—and there are only two of them. What an absolute disgrace! The sale of Telstra is bad for the bush, bad for the budget and bad for Australia. I pose this question to the government members: if the sale of Telstra is not in the interests of Australian families, how can it possibly be in the national interest? I also want to put this to the government members: if the partial sale of Telstra has been good for Australia, let us see the tangible benefits of the proceeds of that partial sale. Where are they? I challenge the government to tell and show not just the residents of my electorate in the northern suburbs of Perth but all the Australians who live in the fringes of our cities where the benefits of the partial sale have gone.</para>
<para>The government cannot or will not answer that question, but I will. The proceeds of the partial sale have been squandered. They have been squandered on buying votes in the bush and through the bulbous pockets of the government’s spendthrifts, who have wasted countless opportunities for proper and prudent investment in our infrastructure, our services and our future. The proceeds have been squandered by the biggest pork-barrelling government in the history of Australia—squandered and wasted, not invested. The government have not invested in infrastructure, in growth, in their loyal clientele, in the future of our nation, in Telstra’s employees or in the growth of Telstra. Indeed, Telstra has been downgraded and its services have been downgraded by the government in their rush to sell the asset and get their hands on the money.</para>
<para>I had a look at some figures that I used in an earlier debate, which showed that capital expenditure in Telstra had fallen from a peak of $4.75 million in 1999-2000 to an estimated $3.25 million in 2002-03. Where did the investment go? We also know that, during those same years, staff were shed at a rate of some 4,000 full-time employees per year. Is it any wonder that the government benches are almost bare? They certainly do not like to be reminded of these facts.</para>
<para>I recently made some inquiries in Western Australia, because we are constantly, daily, getting complaints from small business people who work from home, from small business people in the industrial areas in the northern suburbs of Perth and from mums that their telephone services are not up to scratch. I was told that there is a department within Telstra called the CNI, which stands for customer network improvement. This department is for the more major faults, not for average repairs. I am told that if a technician attends a fault complaint they often find that the problem is more serious than just fixing the line at one person’s home. If this type of fault is located, the attending technician tries to temporarily fix the problem with the line and then reports the fault to the CNI, the customer network improvement department, and this department fixes the major faults.</para>
<para>There are currently 8,000 to 9,000 outstanding CNI fault reports in the Perth metropolitan area. That is incredible. Where is the investment? Where has the money from the previous, partial sale of Telstra gone? Where is the growth of Telstra? What we have seen is not a growth but a decline. Infrastructure and investment have not kept pace with technology and growth, and not just in urban parts of our cities. They have certainly lost ground when you compare the growth with small business, which relies on Telstra and its services to enable it to compete. It is a bit hard trying to get more specific figures out of Telstra because, quite frankly, Telstra is embarrassed at its lack of infrastructure investment, its lack of services, the number of faults that it has to deal with and the amount of time it takes to deal with those faults.</para>
<para>About 18 months or so ago the government ran a Telstra seminar in the northern suburbs of Perth. The then minister, Daryl Williams—since retired—told that meeting that Telstra is not responsible for supplying broadband services. That was the view of the minister who had responsibility for Telstra—that Telstra is not responsible for supplying broadband services.</para>

There is sufficient demand. That demand is in our cities and it is in the bush—it is right across Australia. It is a great pity, a great shame, that this government has chosen not to invest in the future of Telstra and chosen not to invest in the future of Australia. It has turned its back on Telstra and it has turned its back on Australia. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak today on this matter of public importance. In my discussion I want to touch on three points: firstly, the government’s record in delivering telecommunications improvements to the people of Australia; secondly, the announcements made today on the $1.1 billion Connect Australia program and the $2 billion Communications Fund for the future; and, thirdly, the track record of the ALP on both telecommunications and privatisation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>On the first point, the government’s track record since coming to power in 1996, the coalition has delivered unprecedented benefits to Australian consumers and businesses through the development of a highly competitive telecommunications regime. We as a government have been focused on equity and access to high-quality telecommunications services across Australia, no matter where you live. There have been three planks in the government’s approach to achieving those objectives: firstly, to encourage competition, to deliver innovation, to deliver cheaper prices and to deliver greater choice; secondly, to maintain tough regulatory and consumer safeguards such as price controls, customer service guarantees and universal service obligations; and, thirdly, to provide targeted funding to provide services in areas which would not normally be catered for in a commercial market.</para>
<para>The government’s approach has delivered real benefits to consumers: prices have fallen, customers have been offered a choice of providers and new services such as broadband are being rolled out across the country. Since the introduction of competition in 1997, consumers have seen a decrease in prices of some 20 per cent in real terms for telecommunications services. Now Australians can choose between different service providers and different telecommunications products. Australians have the option of dealing with 100 carriers across Australia, and there are now more than 16 million mobile phones in operation. Broadband subscribers now number well over a million, with half of them being serviced by operators other than Telstra.</para>
<para>Regional Australia has benefited in particular from the improvements under this government, with over a billion dollars being spent to date on a range of programs, such as Networking the Nation and improvements under the Besley and Estens reviews, including the highly successful HiBIS program which delivers broadband to small communities right round the country. There is also the $50 million metropolitan black spot program. This government has invested over $140 million to support the extension of mobile phone coverage to 98 per cent of Australians. Under the coalition, 40,000 customers living in remote Australia have access to untimed local calls for the first time, and they have been given the opportunity to take up subsidised two-way high-speed satellite internet services.</para>
<para>I would now like to turn to the announcement made today. This additional commitment will build on what has gone before under this government. The $1.1 billion Connect Australia program will provide a huge boost to our national infrastructure, with $878 million for the Broadband Connect program to provide more Australians with affordable broadband services; $113 million for the Clever Networks program, which will roll out new broadband networks to provide innovative applications to improve delivery of health, education and other essential services; $30 million for the Mobile Connect program to further extend terrestrial mobile coverage to areas not adequately catered for and to build on the subsidy for handheld satellite phones; and $90 million for a comprehensive package to provide telecommunications services to our Indigenous communities, which are so lacking in telecommunications services.</para>
<para>The government believes that good telecommunications services need to be assured not only now but into the future, and that is why there will be a system of regular reviews of services. There will be a requirement for Telstra to produce a local presence plan to ensure that Telstra services are available in regional and rural Australia and that there will be access to Telstra representatives at the local level. A $2 billion fund will be established, the revenue from which will be invested to ensure that we will be able to roll out improved technologies in telecommunications as they occur. That is a vitally important factor: future-proofing regional and rural areas to ensure that they have the adequate services they need not only now but into the future.</para>
<para>We believe that better competition is the key to better services and lower costs. As part of this proposal, the government will require the operational separation of Telstra’s wholesale and retail business units. If we are going to have proper competition other carriers will need to have a level playing field and, through operational separation, the National Party and the Liberal Party believe we will be able to achieve that. The government seeks to ensure transparency in pricing for wholesale customers. There will also be price controls: the 22c untimed local call will be maintained, there will be no large increases in line rental, there will be restrictions on the cost of new connections and there will be measures to protect low-income earners. This government is encouraging a reduction in telecommunications costs to the Australian community.</para>
<para>I would now like to turn from the bright future to the dark past of Labor’s history, to Labor’s appalling record on telecommunications, particularly in regional and rural areas. It is difficult to recount their strategy on regional services because I do not think they really had one. The word ‘regional’ barely appeared in their policy. Not one cent was committed to improving services in rural and regional areas. As I said, ‘regional’ was mentioned only once in their policy. Labor’s record on mobile phones was a disgrace, switching off the analog service and putting nothing in its place.</para>
<para>As the member for Murray said previously, services were actually reduced under Labor, not increased. That amounts to vandalism of the community’s telecommunications services. It took this coalition government to roll out the replacement CDMA network. When Labor was in government it placed no requirements on Telstra to fix or install services within time limits. Waiting for over two years for a landline connection is deplorable but it was part of the day under Labor. People were waiting for two years for a phone connection. These days there is a 20 working days maximum.</para>
<para>Labor did not encourage competition in telecommunication markets as there was a duopoly between Telstra and Optus. This did not see substantial reductions in prices, as we have seen in the recent past. It was a coalition government that delivered price competition. Some try to argue that quality of services can be delivered through the control of Telstra. Actually, Telstra is controlled by regulation, not through ownership.</para>
<para>Labor’s plan for Telstra, as far as we can see, would see a return to the bad old days of having a monopoly. Labor do not seem to have a forward vision for telecommunications. Their only response to the telecommunications argument is that of public ownership. They think public ownership is the key—back to the days of the PMG. This government is looking forward. Labor have no vision for telecommunications. Labor have no vision to take this country forward with telecommunications infrastructure. Their only policy initiative is to look backwards, to try and retard the government in its efforts to provide improved services—to try and replace its forward vision with an idea that takes us back to the past.</para>
<para>If you ask people around my electorate, perhaps in South West Rocks or Wooli, whether they like the roll-out of mobile phone towers, I am sure they would say they do. I am sure the people of Bonville are pleased to have the broadband that has been delivered under the broadband rollout. It is a ridiculous notion that this government is not delivering. The National Party and the Liberal Party are absolutely committed to delivering quality telecommunications services. Labor have squandered the proceeds that they received through the privatisation of Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank. They privatised those companies and still could not run a balanced budget. This government has been able to invest the proceeds of the sale of Telstra into improved telecommunications services.</para>
<para>The member for New England is in the chamber. He obviously does not have a vision for telecommunications in his electorate. He wants the bad old days of full public ownership. He wants to provide steam powered internet services for his electorate! He does not see the benefits of improved telecommunications services, as this government do. We want to take this country forward. We do not want to see steam powered internet services, as is the vision of the member for New England. We want to see high-quality, high-speed broadband rolled out across the country as quickly as possible. We want to see a competitive regime for the provision of telecommunications services, providing access to a range of carriers and providing cheaper prices and better services. We want to see the introduction of new technologies, when they become available, right across this country. The proposed programs announced today are going to go a long way to seeing that happen. We, as a government, are very much focused on delivering the very best telecommunication services for the people of Australia.</para>

<para>—I think we have just heard a speech in favour of the retention of part-government ownership in Telstra! Contrary to what some of the Labor speakers have said, I believe that the government, as a partial owner of Telstra, has introduced some good initiatives. I think that has been driven by the political imperative—the capacity and the ability of members of parliament to drive some of the issues, particularly in regional Australia, to some degree of fruition and to create some political pressure. Regrettably, given the decision of today, that pressure will be taken off. If you listened to the Treasurer and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry yesterday—and others from the government side—you would have heard them say that they recognise that, for a fully privatised operation to exist, there has to be a profit imperative, not a service imperative, for those in remote and rural areas.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I think it is a very sad day for country Australia and a very sad day for this parliament. Although members of the government, particularly the National Party, are very excited about this initiative, there is not one member of the National Party in this chamber—other than you, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, and you are here in an official capacity. So quite obviously those members are fully aware that they have been run over by the Liberal bus on this decision. They are in disgrace in their electorates. They are in disgrace in Australia generally, with over 70 per cent of people not wanting this to happen.</para>
<para>This is the ‘no excuses’ parliament. There is no excuse for poor regional policy any more. You cannot blame the Greens or the Democrats for poor policy in the Senate. If the Senate takes this decision to alienate rural and regional Australia from the most important piece of infrastructure that exists—a piece of infrastructure that has the capacity to negate distances being a disadvantage for people living in Australia—it will be on the heads of the National Party.</para>
<para>I noticed that the messiah of the nation last week, Senator Barnaby Joyce, has suddenly turned into the Judas goat of Queensland. He has come into the parliament and made wild claims about opposing the sale. He received my admiration for doing that because I thought: ‘Maybe for once there is a member of this party who will actually stand up for what the constituents in rural Australia are saying. Maybe for once there is a person who is prepared to stand up.’ He did stand up for a little while, but he sat down again today. I think that is a real shame for the people of Queensland. It is a real shame, probably, for the individual. It is a great shame for this nation that he has not stayed firm on this issue. I encourage him to rethink his position. But, Senator Joyce, do not go around this parliament saying, ‘I don’t agree with the sale of Telstra but I had to accept something because Senator Murray from the Democrats or Senator Fielding from the Family First Party would vote for it.’ Do not discredit those individuals to try and garner some sort of impression that you have done a good deal. This is a disgraceful deal.</para>
<para>One thing that we have found out today is what is up to scratch. This term ‘up to scratch’ has fascinated me for years. Senator Joyce and others have said that they will relate to experts in terms of what is required. The expert was down here last week: the new CEO of Telstra. He made a point that there had been a $5 billion underinvestment. There had been far too much of a focus on sale rather than service. He made the point that $5 billion is required. The minister has brushed that aside, the government has brushed that aside, Barnaby Joyce has brushed that aside and the National Party has brushed that aside. They have said, ‘You can have $1 billion now or over the next few years to look after the underinvestment that has been in place in current infrastructure and you can have the interest off this $2 billion fund.’ In the Leader of the National Party’s words, the interest is about $100 million a year, which is $25 million a year less than what they have spent over the last eight, so it is a reduction in government spending in terms of ongoing future proofing of the instrumentality.</para>
<para>If we assume that the CEO knows something about telecommunications, he believes that $5 billion would need to be invested immediately to bring it up to scratch. If we look at how that is going to come about now, it will take 40 years to get Telstra up to scratch in 2005. There is the $1 billion that they are giving now and the other $4 billion will come over 40 years at $100 million a year. That is what this parliament is looking at doing. That is what the National Party and other country members in this parliament are prepared to do to their constituency. We will be up to scratch in 40 years time. That is assuming that the $5 billion underinvestment is true. But the CEO is the closest expert and should be the closest expert in terms of the decision-making process. So all of those who have stood up in here and said, ‘We won’t do anything until it’s up to scratch,’ should come back in 40 years time—and the line in the sand is 2005. I think that is the disgraceful act that is being perpetrated on the people of Australia and regional Australia today.</para>
<para>No wonder there is not a member of the National Party in this room. No wonder they are not boasting about it, because they have been done over like a dinner. I have been speaking to the Liberals and they are laughing at this. This is a far better deal than they ever contemplated. They have got the sale.</para>

<para>—On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th and 15th reports for 2005 of the committee relating to: Holsworthy program—special operations working accommodation and base redevelopment stage 1; proposed CSIRO entomology bioscience laboratory at Black Mountain, Canberra; operational upgrade of Darwin detention facility, Berrimah, Northern Territory; upgrade of patrol boat facilities, HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Coonawarra</inline>, Darwin; and redevelopment of Kokoda Barracks, Canungra, Queensland.</para>

<para>—by leave—The committee’s 11th report of 2005 addresses the construction of working accommodation for special operations forces and stage 1 of the redevelopment of Holsworthy Barracks, New South Wales. The proposed works will facilitate the establishment of the Army’s full-time commando capability, based upon the 4th Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment (Commando); the Tactical Assault Group (East) becoming an organic element of the 4th Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment (Commando); the Incident Response Regiment; Special Operations Combat Services Support Company; and the first stage of the redevelopment of Holsworthy Barracks. Having investigated the proposal, the committee is satisfied that the works will improve amenity for and operational efficiency of the important Army units accommodated at Holsworthy. The committee therefore recommends that the works proceed at the estimated cost of $207.7 million.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The committee’s 12th report of 2005 examines the proposed construction of a new entomology bioscience laboratory at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation’s (CSIRO’s) Black Mountain campus in the ACT. The CSIRO reported that the Division of Entomology currently conducts scientific research in buildings that range in age from 32 to 76 years old. These buildings: do not meet contemporary research standards; have, in some instances, structural constraints which prevent them being refurbished to a level commensurate with current and evolving laboratory standards; do not meet current OH&amp;S standards; and cannot accommodate anticipated division growth. To redress these deficiencies, the CSIRO proposes to: construct a new two-storey, 2,313 square metre entomology bioscience laboratory; refurbish two existing buildings; construct covered walkways to link the new and existing buildings; and carry out associated site works and landscaping, including demolition of redundant buildings and sheds.</para>
<para>Noting that some of the redundant buildings contain asbestos, the committee recommends that the CSIRO take all necessary steps to identify and ensure the safe removal and disposal of hazardous materials from the site. The committee also recommends that the CSIRO continues discussion with the National Capital Authority to resolve any outstanding design issues. Having considered the proposal in detail, members are satisfied that the works should proceed at the estimated cost of $12.7 million.</para>
<para>The committee’s 13th report of 2005 deals with a proposal by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, DIMIA, to carry out an operational upgrade of the detention facility at Berrimah, Northern Territory, at an estimated cost of $8.21 million.</para>
<para>The primary purpose of the proposed works is to establish a safe and secure land based detention facility for illegal foreign fishers apprehended in Australia’s northern waters. The department reported that illegal foreign fishing in Australia’s northern waters has been increasing in recent years and that current boat based detention arrangements have proven unmanageable. It is envisaged that, in addition to illegal foreign fishers, the facility will accommodate Northern Territory immigration compliance cases and unauthorised air arrivals, some of whom the department told us would be women and children.</para>
<para>The committee notes that the department’s proposal contains a significant number of undetermined factors which may be expected to impact upon the project cost. Whilst cognisant of the difficulties associated with estimating project budgets under modern procurement arrangements, the committee requests that agencies supply the most robust and comprehensive costs available in order that the committee can fulfil its statutory role as a scrutineer of public expenditure. The committee therefore recommends that DIMIA supply regular updates on expenditure throughout the course of the project.</para>
<para>Having viewed both the existing facilities at the Berrimah detention centre and the plans for the upgrade, the committee remains unconvinced that the proposed family area represents the best use of available space or provides a reasonable level of amenity or security for detainees. Despite the recent changes to the government’s policy in relation to the detention of families with children, the department explained that it may be necessary to hold people for a very short period of time for initial assessment. Given the inadequacy and inappropriateness of the proposed family area, the committee recommends that families including women and children are not detained at the facility.</para>
<para>In the event that there is a demonstrated need for the short-term detention of families at the facility, the committee recommends that, in order to ensure appropriate provision of security—particularly separation from the large number of fishers that may be held at the centre—amenity and space for families, women and children, the department should better utilise the space available. The family area should be enlarged and should provide appropriate separation of all facilities, which is a major security issue, adequate indoor recreation space and a secure outdoor area of a suitable size to accommodate play equipment relocated from the existing large, grassed recreation area. The committee hopes that there will not be an occasion to keep families with children in this particular facility.</para>
<para>The committee also wishes to ensure the reliability of DIMIA’s project delivery strategy and recommends that the department supply the committee with an update on the chosen delivery methodology and the application of Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines to this process, when this information becomes available.</para>
<para>Further, in the interest of transparency and good community relations, the committee recommends that DIMIA consult with the local community and with relevant Northern Territory government agencies in respect of the proposed works. In particular, the committee wishes DIMIA to consult with the office of the Northern Territory Chief Minister to find an appropriate name for the facility. Having given careful consideration to the proposal, the committee recommends that the works proceed at the estimated cost of $8.21 million.</para>
<para>A further referral from the Department of Defence, namely the upgrade of patrol boat facilities at HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Coonawarra</inline>, Darwin, forms the subject of the committee’s 14th report of 2005. The upgraded facilities, estimated to cost $19.17 million, will facilitate the introduction into service of the Armidale class patrol boat and will also provide a new facility for the Darwin Port Services Organisation.</para>
<para>The committee notes Defence’s efforts to minimise the environmental impacts of the proposed works and, in respect of any future dredging activities, recommends that the department maintain close consultation with the Northern Territory Department of Lands, Planning and Environment to ensure minimisation of damage to the marine environment.</para>
<para>In view of the importance of fire protection and evacuation measures, the committee recommends that Defence supply it with details of the fire protection system proposed for the standby crew and port services organisation building, including any departures from the requirements of the Building Code of Australia, when these have been determined. The committee is satisfied with the evidence supplied by Defence and is happy for the works to proceed at the estimated cost of $19.17 million.</para>
<para>The 15th report of 2005 presents the committee’s findings in relation to the proposed redevelopment of Kokoda Barracks at Canungra, Queensland, for the Department of Defence. The purpose of the proposed work is to provide the working and domestic accommodation, and engineering services infrastructure required, for the ongoing delivery of effective training at the Canungra Military Training Area.</para>
<para>The redevelopment entails: correction of working and training accommodation deficiencies; rationalisation of messing facilities; improvements to living-in accommodation for trainees; upgrade of the engineering services infrastructure; and disposal of redundant, high-maintenance facilities.</para>
<para>During its inquiry, the committee investigated a range of barracks services; the design of the proposed new facilities; the removal of asbestos; heritage issues; and traffic management. The committee recommends that the works proceed at the estimated cost of $86.7 million and requests that Defence continue consultation with the Department of the Environment and Heritage regarding any heritage issues that may arise from the redevelopment project.</para>
<para>These reports examine works representing some $336.28 million worth of Commonwealth expenditure. It has been a very heavy workload for the committee secretariat. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my committee colleagues and to thank Hansard and our committee secretariat for helping to facilitate this work in a timely manner. I commend the reports to the House.</para>

Just before proceeding and giving the call to the member for Gorton, the chair indicates to the minister at the table, the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads—I know that he might not have been directly involved—that for a period that might have been described as lengthy by some there was no member of the executive at the table. Whilst I do not think that this afternoon would have been exactly the time to have directly and immediately acted upon that, the chair notes that. I ask the minister, especially with his experience as the Chief Government Whip, if he could assist the House by ensuring that others that are on the roster are in the chamber.</para>

<para>—by leave—I want to supplement the comments made by the member for Pearce in relation to these public works—namely, the Holsworthy program special operations working accommodation and base redevelopment stage 1; the proposed CSIRO entomology bioscience laboratory at Black Mountain, Canberra; the operational upgrade at Darwin detention facility, Berrimah; the upgrade of patrol boat facilities at HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Coonawarra</inline>, Darwin; and the redevelopment of Kokoda Barracks, Canungra, Queensland.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As the chair of the committee has indicated, the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works has an enormous workload. The committee members share the workload well. Indeed, the work is made that much easier as a result of the diligence and professionalism of the secretariat of the committee. I would like to express particular appreciation for their work.</para>
<para>I support the comments made by the member for Pearce in relation to these five works. In particular, I would like to emphasise in relation to the operational upgrade of the Darwin Detention Facility Berrimah the need for DIMIA to take the committee’s concerns on board in relation to what we are to do for children and families if we find them in a position to be enclosed behind fences—given, as I understand it, the shift in government policy in that regard. We have made it clear that we do not consider it appropriate for families and children to be placed in that situation. We hope that there is a capacity for that never to happen. The department has raised the point that there may be occasions on which emergencies require such detention, but we think that should be unnecessary. Indeed, we ask the department and the minister to look at that matter with a view to ensuring that that is avoided at all costs.</para>
<para>Finally, in relation to that project, I again ask the department to make contact with the Northern Territory government. They have raised a concern that they do not want the detention centre in Darwin to be entitled ‘Darwin Detention Centre’. There are good reasons for the name change, we accept, without going through the reasons now. We understand why there is the need to change the name. However, committee members accepted the view that there is no need to call a detention centre ‘Darwin Detention Centre’. The Chief Minister and the Northern Territory government believed it was not in the interests of people residing in Darwin, in the Northern Territory. Other than the Perth detention centre, I think it is true to say that all other centres in capital cities—Villawood, Maribyrnong—are not named after the city in which they reside. Therefore we hope that the department are able to consider the recommendations of the Public Works Committee in light of the request made by the Northern Territory government to ensure that that centre is not named the ‘Darwin Detention Centre’.</para>

<para>—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties I present the committee’s report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled: <inline font-style="italic">Report 66—Treaties tabled on 7 December 2004 (4), 15 March and 11 May 2005</inline>, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.</para>

<para>—by leave—Report 66 contains the findings and recommendations of the review conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties of nine treaty actions tabled in parliament on 7 December 2004, 15 March 2005 and 11 May 2005. The treaty actions relate to the matters identified in the title of the report. I will comment on a selection of the treaty actions considered.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The United Nations Convention against Corruption is a multilateral agreement designed to enhance international efforts to combat corruption. Although no changes to Commonwealth legislation are required to implement Australia’s obligations under UNCAC, the committee raised two issues with this treaty. One issue, relating to whether a provision of the treaty is mandatory, discretionary or optional, changes the extent of the Commonwealth’s power to legislate for it. The major issue the committee considered was the degree to which this treaty confers additional jurisdiction on the Commonwealth through the use of the external affairs power under section 51(xxix) of the Constitution.</para>
<para>The committee considers that the external affairs power is not always an ideal head of power from which to legislate, particularly where the treaty has the potential to significantly impact on the states and territories. Evidence to the committee suggested that the use of the external affairs power is limited to some extent by the Melbourne Corporation doctrine—that is, it is unlikely that the Commonwealth could enact legislation which relates to corrupt conduct of members of state parliaments, state executives and state courts in the discharge of their functions as state officials. Even so, the committee has made two recommendations asking the Attorney-General to advise the committee that there is no intention to use the external affairs power and UNCAC to pass legislation not foreshadowed in the NIA.</para>
<para>The amendments to the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement add a further two universities—Murdoch University and the University of Tasmania—to the list of Australian universities whose graduates are recognised for admission as qualified lawyers in Singapore. As a South Australian, I am pleased to see Flinders University on the list of 10 and I look forward to the day that the University of Adelaide is added.</para>
<para>Since 1995, Singapore armed forces have used the Shoalwater Bay training area. The committee supports the agreement between Australia and Singapore, which will allow the continued use of the Shoalwater Bay training area by the Singapore armed forces for five years from 31 December 2004. Report 66 also recommends the entry into force of a treaty between Australia and New Zealand that defines maritime boundaries between our two countries. This treaty serves as a model for bilateral cooperation on maritime boundaries. Lastly, the committee has recommended that a treaty which establishes a permanent and independent secretariat to administer the Antarctic Treaty consultation meeting enter into force. Australia has a large territorial claim and an extensive research program in Antarctica. The secretariat will be in Buenos Aires, Argentina.</para>
<para>In conclusion, the committee believes it is in Australia’s national interest for the nine treaties considered in report 66 to be ratified. I commend the report to the House.</para>

<para>—by leave—The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties’ review included treaty actions from a diverse range of subject areas. Similarly to previous reviews, the committee’s findings were based on an examination of the benefits to Australia of each treaty action. This included examining each of the nine treaty actions with regard to their impact on the political, diplomatic, security, economic and social ties between Australia and the treaty parties. Of particular interest in this batch of treaties is the United Nations Convention against Corruption. I will not talk about each of the treaty actions, because I thought I would complement the comments that the chair has already made.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The United Nations Convention against Corruption will provide for a number of measures relating to corruption prevention and criminalisation, international cooperation in combating corruption, asset recovery, training and technical assistance and the establishment of a conference of the parties to the convention. In addition to recommending that binding treaty action be taken, the committee made two other recommendations. These recommendations relate to issues surrounding the Australian government’s potential use of its external powers to override the will of the states and territories where implementation of this treaty is concerned. These recommendations are particularly important as the committee has encountered a similar situation with other treaties.</para>
<para>Another treaty of interest is one that will establish and define the exclusive economic zone and continental shelf boundaries between Australia and New Zealand in the Tasman Sea and adjacent areas of the south-western Pacific Ocean. There are currently no agreed maritime boundaries between the countries, and I welcome this treaty, which will sort this matter out. I am particularly disappointed, though, that it would appear that many of the criteria used to determine these particular boundaries were not used in the case of East Timor. It was put to us by the department that we had to look at each case on its merit. I believe that some of the criteria that were used in determining the boundaries between Australia and New Zealand could in fact have been used when we were looking at the East Timor-Australia delineation.</para>
<para>The Agreement on Cooperation in the Fields of Energy and Mineral Resources with the Republic of Korea will provide a framework to pursue areas of mutual benefit and interest in relation to energy and mineral products. The agreement includes provisions on the exchange of energy and mineral resources information; the promotion and facilitation of technical cooperation in the fields of energy and mineral resources; cooperation and facilitation of bilateral trade and investment in energy and mineral resources, including value added products and services; and the development and implementation of greenhouse gas mitigation projects in the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.</para>
<para>The final treaty I would like to make mention of is the Mutual Recognition Agreement on Conformity Assessment in relation to Medicines Goods Manufacturing Practice Inspection and Certification with Canada. The treaty will provide for reciprocal recognition of goods manufacturing practice certificates of medicines between Australia and Canada. Under the current pharmaceutical inspection scheme, countries are not legally bound to supply information nor to do so in any specified time period. The treaty would afford certainty to Australian exporters of medicinal products and eliminate uncertainty and any delays or costs associated with retesting batches of medicines on import into Canada.</para>
<para>I would like to comment on the agreement between Australia and Singapore on the use of the Shoalwater Bay training facility. I commend this particular move, having been to Shoalwater Bay and seen what is on offer there and the sorts of facilities that are being built by our partners. I think they are great facilities and it is a great treaty. I commend that to the House also. I would also like to send thanks to those who put forward submissions in relation to these matters and to the committee secretariat who have, once again, done a fantastic job.</para>

<para>—by leave—I am pleased to present this report on independent contracting and labour hire arrangements. This inquiry was conducted at a time of increasing debate on the conditions of Australian workers, with possible changes to federal workplace relations legislation affecting the coverage of state legislation, including proposals to develop legislation to support independent contractors. In a highly competitive global market, flexibility and response times are crucial. As a result, demand from companies for labour hire and contractor services has increased over the last 20 years. Currently, over 10 per cent of the work force identify themselves as being independent contractors and nearly four per cent identify themselves as labour hire workers. These types of working arrangements are found across a wide variety of industries.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Supporting labour hire and contracting arrangements is essential for a number of reasons. These include: meeting shortages of labour or fluctuating demands across industries and occupations; providing avenues for mature age workers to remain in the work force and transition employment opportunities for those seeking to enter the workforce; achieving efficiencies that enable us to compete in the global marketplace; and offering a range of working arrangements that may provide different lifestyle and remuneration benefits from those offered through direct employment options.</para>
<para>It has been a challenging task for the committee to examine current state and federal workplace relations systems to identify strategies that provide a balance of freedoms and protections—and to do so with greater consistency across Australia. There are 16 recommendations included in the report, and they are: to address the occupational health and safety of labour hire workers and independent contractors; to improve access to skill development and training for labour hire workers; to establish a voluntary code of practice for the labour hire industry; to create greater consistency across federal, state and territory legislation in differentiating between independent contractors and employees; to improve access to information to outline the rights and responsibilities of independent contractors; to regulate independent contractors under commercial law; and to improve access to different dispute resolution procedures for independent contractors.</para>
<para>The committee investigated whether labour hire and contracting arrangements are, in some instances, being used to evade responsibilities, particularly in the areas of occupational health and safety and employee entitlements. The committee does not condone the creation of artificial structures to avoid regulatory compliance by host businesses, labour hire agencies or contractors and it does not condone the creation of artificial independent contracting arrangements to avoid the incumbent responsibilities of an employee-employer relationship.</para>
<para>Key to curbing possible sham arrangements is the national need for greater clarity and consistency in distinguishing between an employee and an independent contractor. The committee has opted for a pragmatic strategy—one that combines existing national approaches to achieve an Australia-wide national outcome. Essentially the strategies recommended are to provide assistance for establishing genuine arrangements and to reduce opportunities for establishing artificial arrangements that seek to avoid responsibilities. Considering independent contractors within commercial relationships provides the appropriate framework for supporting and developing independent contractors as businesses. It is important that these legitimate business relationships and choices are honoured and are not subject to excessive protectionist regulation.</para>
<para>Improved access to relevant information on rights and responsibilities is key to ensuring there is informed choice in selecting working arrangements. Additionally, when a dispute arises regarding a contract for services, more accessible, affordable resolution procedures are necessary, such as use of the Federal Magistrates Court. Labour hire and independent contracting arrangements are a vital element of the Australian work force. A balanced approach of flexibility and protections has been sought to recognise the needs of labour hire agencies, workers, employers, principal contractors and independent contractors.</para>
<para>Once again the members of the committee demonstrated considerable commitment to working together to report in a reasonably short time. I thank the deputy chair, the member for Gorton, and other members of the committee for their cooperation and dedication to the inquiry. While there has been dissent on party lines on some of the recommendations, overall there is unified support for the majority of the report. I also take this opportunity to thank the inquiry secretariat for their counsel, assistance and patience throughout the process—particularly Dr Anna Dacre, Alison Childs and their very hardworking team.</para>
<para>In conclusion, I would like to thank the many individuals and organisations who provided evidence to this inquiry through submissions or by appearing before the committee. The strategies outlined in this report are designed to make labour hire and independent contracting arrangements work for Australians and for Australian businesses. Together these strategies work to make a competitive Australia, offering a range of working arrangements to suit industry, occupation, employer and worker requirements. I commend the report to the House.</para>

</talker>
<para>—by leave—I rise to add to the comments made by the member for Deakin. Firstly, I would like to say that there was indeed a very short time frame for the committee and great regard was given to the pressures of time. It is true to say that therefore the committee members and the secretariat worked expeditiously to arrive at this outcome.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>But this afternoon I have to emphasise the concerns raised in the dissenting report. It is true to say that good work was done, as has already been expressed by the member for Deakin, the chair of the committee. Indeed, there was goodwill shown by committee members. However, it is important to note that <inline font-style="italic">Making it work: inquiry into independent contracting and labour hire arrangements</inline> made a total of 16 recommendations, of which nine were agreed to unanimously. A dissenting report provided alternatives to seven of the recommendations and made seven additional recommendations for the government to consider.</para>
<para>It is the view of the dissenting members that, in some respects, the committee missed a golden opportunity to clear up the growing confusion as to who is an employee and who is a genuine contractor in the Australian work force. The committee’s report, tabled today, also failed to provide any real clarification regarding the rights and responsibilities of labour hire agencies, employees and host employers.</para>
<para>The report’s findings, we argue, were prejudiced by the interference of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, who chose to release his own paper and set up his own closed inquiry on the same matter soon after referring it to the committee. In our view, the minister’s disregard for the parliamentary committee process had an adverse influence upon the findings of the committee. In our view, the minister treated the parliamentary process with contempt. Having referred the matter to the committee in the first place, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations then chose to pre-empt the committee’s findings and prejudice its deliberations by releasing a paper with loaded assertions and opinions and by establishing his own closed inquiry on the same matter. This behaviour was another example of the government’s abuse of parliamentary process and, in the view of the dissenting members, may have adversely affected the committee’s recommendations. It was, in our view, an attempt to sideline the parliamentary committee and influence the views of, in particular, government members of the committee.</para>
<para>I now turn to the substantive matters raised in evidence given to the committee, starting with disguised forms of employment. Another way to expose workers to unfairness is to call them ‘contractors’ and take away their employee entitlements. The dissenting report sought to clarify the delineation between an employee and a genuine independent contractor. The committee heard comprehensive and compelling evidence of sham arrangements and forms of disguised employment but, unfortunately, failed to recommend any concrete solutions to the growing problems of confusion and exploitation. Evidence showed that many workers were being forced to work as so-called independent contractors in order to avoid taxation and traditional employer responsibilities such as the payment of superannuation contributions and workers compensation insurance premiums.</para>
<para>The evidence highlighted an absence of taxation laws to properly distinguish employees from independent contractors for the purpose of collecting the nation’s revenue. Some witnesses asserted that the amount of revenue lost as a result runs into billions of dollars each year. Evidence given by Treasury underlined the inability of the Commonwealth to determine the extent of tax avoidance by employees wrongfully described as ‘contractors’. Although the personal services income legislation sought to prevent tax avoidance, its effectiveness is unknown because, as confirmed by Treasury, well over 99.9 per cent of tax claims in this area are self-assessed. It is therefore not known whether these provisions, weak as they are, are being enforced properly. The extraordinarily high proportion of self-assessing PSI applicants fails to instil in the dissenting members any confidence that the current system is an effective means of distinguishing genuine independent contractors from employees.</para>
<para>The committee was concerned by the significant evidence highlighting the extraordinary growth of labour hire employment in the last 15 years. All committee members accepted the possible benefits of labour hire employment, but the report failed to recognise the intrinsic difficulties with labour hire arrangements. In particular, the committee failed to address the extremely high proportion of labour hire workers who are precariously employed. The rate of casualisation amongst labour hire employees exceeds 75 per cent, or more than three times the work force average. The committee received evidence of labour hire employees working for more than 10 years and still being described as casuals. The report failed to propose any relief from indefinitely being precariously employed.</para>
<para>Furthermore, the committee received evidence that the triangular relationship involving labour hire agencies, host companies and labour hire workers has led to a blurring of legal obligations and entitlements in a number of areas such as occupational health and safety and return to work policies. Although the committee did identify some areas of concern, in our view it failed to provide solutions to the problem of assigning responsibilities in this area of work.</para>
<para>Finally, I will describe in general terms the additional recommendations that the dissenting members felt the need to add as a result of a deficiency in the report. The dissenting members also recommended additional recommendations in order to fill the void left by the report. The recommendations include: proposals to prevent employees working for unreasonable periods as casuals, when they could appropriately be classified as permanents; shared occupational health and safety responsibilities for labour hire agencies and host employers; and the right for a contractor to choose their representative, whether that might be a trade union or not.</para>
<para>Today I had the good fortune to meet with officials and members of the New South Wales branch of the Transport Workers Union. I also had the good fortune to listen to some of the members talk about their plight at a seminar held today at Parliament House. That was particularly relevant to this matter. I therefore think it is very important that the government consider ensuring the right to be properly represented in the appropriate forums—which, the dissenting members would say, are the state and federal industrial commissions of this country—and that unions do not have limitations placed on their right to represent small businesses, which would be the case if the <inline ref="R2282">Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005</inline> were to be enacted to limit those rights of representation. No government should remove the right for small businesses to choose a union as their agent—their representative. Therefore, in the dissenting report we make specific reference to removing that restriction and ensuring that the trade unions have the right—as every other body would have—to represent contractors or small businesses, if they so wish it.</para>
<para>I thank the Transport Workers Union for waiting through many divisions and being here this afternoon to witness the tabling of the report. I thank them for their contribution as a union. They presented many witnesses—many workers, not just officials. I think all committee members were impressed by the organisation’s ability to provide evidence from people directly affected by the laws of this land, and we certainly wanted to respond to their concerns in the form of this report.</para>
<para>I will finish by saying that an effort was made by all members to find common ground. We can say that nine of the 17 recommendations in the body of the report were agreed to. There are certainly some good policies that could be adopted by government if those recommendations were agreed to. I guess where we differ is that we say that the seven alternative recommendations made by the dissenting members and a further seven additional recommendations that are to be found in the body of the dissenting report should be adopted by government to ensure that the contractors, employees, labour hire companies, principal contractors and the like know exactly where they stand in the law.</para>

<para>—Before being interrupted by question time, the MPI and subsequent interesting events, I was speaking to the <inline ref="R2369">Corporations Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005</inline> and drawing on the extraordinary experience of a company known as Singleton Earthmoving Pty Ltd to make some important points which relate to the Corporations Law. I will briefly recap the story about this very viable company which was unnecessarily forced into administration by a person whom I would describe as a rogue liquidator. As a consequence, the main director of the company, Mr Bernard Wood, and all the unsecured creditors have lost their money. The only person who seems to have done well out of the decision to put the company into administration and consequently wind up the company is the liquidator himself, Mr Ariff.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>There is some good news at the end of all this. Mr Bernard Wood, a highly respectable character, has got back up on his feet and started a new company doing the same sort of work as he was doing previously. He has taken the resources of that company to attempt, at least, to pay back some of the money to the unsecured creditors. Of course, the original company is no longer a viable concern because, firstly, the liquidator seized all the plant and machinery of the company and, secondly, the liquidator is now owed up to $200,000 for his services.</para>
<para>I am delighted to say that a week or so ago the creditors called another meeting to challenge the original decision of the creditors’ meeting to pay this amount of remuneration to Mr Ariff and, indeed, to challenge the decision to wind up the company. Mr Bernard Wood and a number of creditors now claim that a Mr Gary Phillips, who apparently is the solicitor to Mr Ariff, was the person who either moved or seconded a number of these motions, including the motion to pay the remuneration to Mr Ariff, even though Mr Gary Phillips apparently had no status as a non-secured creditor and nor was he holding a proxy of an unsecured creditor.</para>

<para>—No, I do not think I need to, thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker; I have quoted extensively from the document. I am just amazed by this story. A good bloke had a good business that had been operating for 25 years, but a rogue director decided to seek to put the company into administration without any good reason. The administrator rolled up in Singleton in his Mercedes Benz and Zegna suit and recommended to a group of only partly informed, non-secured creditors that the company should be wound up. He seized all the possessions, rendering the company a non-viable concern. He has charged them a fortune to do so and, as a result, it is losers all around—other than for one Mr Ariff.</para>

<para>I will close by repeating my call for the Treasurer to use his power under section 14 of the ASIC Act to intervene and instruct ASIC to revisit the issue if ASIC does not come up with any answers. I also call upon Mr Ariff to complete and make available the company’s taxation returns for the year ending 2004 and 2005, which I am advised will show that there is no doubt that this company, Singleton Earthmoving, was very much a viable, ongoing concern.</para>

<para>—I take an interest in a law that affects directors and their conduct, and I think that most Australians do in a cursory way, because they expect our company directors to be full of integrity. They expect them to be dynamic and good at their work and to make profits, but they do not expect them to make profits at the expense of others in the way we have just heard described and in the way in which Australians have observed in the HIH affair with Larry Adler and Mr Williams.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The issue we are looking at today is a process whereby we are seeking to relieve directors of an inadvertent responsibility which was placed on them by an understanding of the Supreme Court in South Australia. It was not intended by the legislation when it was introduced, not intended by any comments of ministers at that time and not intended by this government or the opposition. The <inline font-style="italic">Australian Credit Management Law Bulletin</inline> is hardly bedtime reading, but, in this instance, it is interesting in that it gives a clear explanation of why the government is moving to make the changes to the trustees’ responsibility in a case where they are liable for the trust debt.</para>
<para>This is the story. John O’Neill owned the shopping centre on the Belair Road in Kingswood, South Australia. Daroko Pty Ltd was a tenant, and Mr Kerry Hanel was the sole director of Daroko. Daroko was the trustee of the Daroko—<inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline> I thank my colleagues for supporting me in such great numbers for this important debate on the <inline ref="R2369">Corporations Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005</inline>. I know they cannot wait till this bill passes the House so they can take it back to their electorates, filled with excitement about explaining to their electors and their constituents how significant this legislation is.</para>
<para>In the field of corporate law, this is a significant bill. I have just described the way it became necessary for the government to proclaim this amendment, following the case in 2003 of Kerry Stirling Hanel and Anor v John O’Neill. A clause in the trust deed of the Daroko Unit Trust provided a comprehensive indemnity to Daroko, the company. The lease was for a term of five years from October 1998. It was due to expire on 30 September 2003. However, Hanel lost his Wendy’s franchise business, so Daroko gave notice that it intended to vacate the premises on 30 June 2001. Before then, the Daroko Unit Trust—which had made a profit of $512,617—paid out all its fund to Hanel’s personal trust, which left both Daroko and the Daroko Unit Trust without assets.</para>
<para>In July 2002, O’Neill obtained judgment in the Adelaide Magistrates Court for $23,132.62, which he said were the costs associated with obtaining a tenant to replace Daroko. O’Neill sought to enforce this judgment but, in September, Hanel informed the court that, without any assets, Daroko was unable to pay the judgment. O’Neill then applied for an order under section 197 of the Corporations Act. This section says in part:</para>
<quote>
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>A person who is a director of a corporation when it incurs a liability while acting, or purporting to act, as trustee, is liable to discharge the whole or a part of the liability if the corporation:</para>
<list type="loweralpha">
<item label="(a)">
<para>has not, and cannot, discharge the liability or that part of it; and</para>
</item>
<item label="(b)">
<para>is not entitled to be fully indemnified against the liability out of trust assets.</para>
</item>
</list>
</item>
</list>
</quote>
<para class="block">This is so, even if the trust does not have enough assets to indemnify the trustee. O’Neill argued that, as Hanel was the sole director of Daroko, Hanel was personally liable for the debt. O’Neill claimed the judgment debt of $23,132.62 plus a further $15,928.51 for a shortfall of rent. In December, O’Neill was awarded summary judgment against Hanel for the $23,132.62. Hanel appealed. Hanel argued that section 197 of the Corporations Act did not apply, as the trust deed contained an indemnity for the trustee against the assets of the trust.</para>
<para>What we have here is a guy who has lost his franchise and wants to get out of the business. I understand that he had replacement lessees willing to come in and take over his lease, without any damage to the lessor. The lessor was slow in making up his mind whether to accept the new lessee. Time expired and there was a gap in the rent. The original lessee said: ‘I had this person ready to go, but you were not prepared to make the decision to accept them; therefore, I do not owe you that money. I haven’t got anything to back you up.’ The lessor said, ‘I’m going to get the money out of you one way or another. You have a trust but it is bare, so I am going after you personally because that is where the trust money finished up.’</para>
<para>Hanel appealed against the decision that awarded the costs of $23,132.62 to the lessor, Mr O’Neill. Hanel argued that section 197 of the Corporations Act did not apply, as the trust deed contained an indemnity for the trustee against the assets of the trust. O’Neill argued that Hanel, as trustee, could not be indemnified because the Daroko Unit Trust did not have the assets to provide the indemnity, which was a situation in which Hanel had been involved. By a two to one majority, the Supreme Court agreed that section 197(1)(b) was to be interpreted so that a director could not escape personal liability merely by ensuring that a clause was written into the trust deed which could operate as a shield against personal liability, even though the director had caused the trust to be without funds to avoid paying the debt.</para>
<para>The wash-up of it is that the accounting community, the credit management groups, the government and the opposition—in fact, all those who understand the responsibilities of directors—think this is an unusual and very broad decision that the court in South Australia has taken based on a single case. It is therefore necessary for the government to make an amendment to restore the situation to what it was previously. To clarify the act, we are moving the amendment today. I am very pleased that the government has sought to bring commonsense into the situation. It recognises that we must have in Australia an impeccable set of directors running Australian businesses who have the confidence of the community—who are the investors—the confidence of their workers and the confidence of all the arms of government that are there to regulate the process. If we can achieve that, we will have great export sales and a vibrant business community, where people can invest with confidence and businesses can steam ahead and employ people—which in part is their purpose. I have great pleasure in supporting this amendment. I think it is sensible and within the philosophy of the government.</para>

<para>—in reply—I thank members for their participation in the second reading debate on the <inline ref="R2369">Corporations Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005</inline>. This bill will clarify the scope of the personal liability of directors of corporate trustees. It will address concerns that have arisen in the light of the recent decision in Hanel and O’Neill, which extended the personal liability of these directors under subsection 197(1) of the Corporations Act 2001.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Prior to the December 2003 decision of the Full Court of the South Australian Supreme Court in Hanel, section 197and its predecessors had traditionally been interpreted as applying in very limited circumstances. These were where the corporate trustee’s right to be indemnified out of trust assets was lost due to the trustee’s conduct or where the terms of the trust deed were designed or could operate to deny creditors’ access to trust assets to meet liabilities incurred by the corporation. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline>
</para>
<para>Hanel and O’Neill significantly expanded the potential personal liability of directors of corporate trustees, from large superannuation trusts through to trading trusts running a small business. In essence, that decision effectively made directors of corporate trustees guarantors of trust liabilities. The proposed amendment contained in schedule 1 to this bill will, therefore, operate to restore the longstanding interpretation of subsection 197(1).</para>
<para>In addition to the clarification of subsection 197 of the Corporations Act, this bill also contains a technical amendment to clarify the operation of a transitional provision in the CLERP 9 legislation. This will ensure that the auditor independence provisions which applied before the enactment of that legislation continue to apply to financial years commencing prior to 1 July 2004.</para>
<para>I note that the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee has commented on the retrospective commencement of the amendment in schedule 2 to this bill. The committee noted that the amendment did nothing more than preserve and give effect to the intention of the pre-CLERP 9 legislation. In concluding, I take this opportunity to note that this bill will work to rebuild business confidence. Importantly, it will also preserve the application of the auditor independence provisions of the pre-CLERP 9 legislation. I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para>—Labor oppose the <inline ref="R2388">Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment Bill 2005</inline>. We do so for the following reasons. Firstly, the bill proposes to remove the need for government agencies to negotiate occupational health and safety agreements with unions and employees, through the introduction of so-called management arrangements. Secondly, the bill will remove all references to ‘unions’ and replace them with references to ‘employee representatives’, defined as either a ‘registered organisation’ or a ‘workplace staff association’, which must now be invited into the workplace by an employee. Thirdly, the bill will require that an employee invite an employee representative to initiate an occupational health and safety investigation, where previously a union could make directly to Comcare such a request to investigate a workplace. Fourthly, employee representatives involved in developing occupational health and safety management arrangements must be issued with a certificate by the CEO of Comcare, valid only for a 12-month period. Finally, the bill empowers employers to conduct the election of employee health and safety representatives, a role previously conducted by a union or a person specified by the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission, which the government proposes to abolish through legislation passed through this House yesterday.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Regrettably, Australia continues to have a poor record with respect to work related death, injury and illness. It is estimated that there are around 3,000 work related deaths in Australia each year—more than the national road toll. When one breaks this down, the true gravity of the situation becomes apparent. Nearly 450 of these work related deaths, an average of nearly 10 per week, are the result of a traumatic incident at work, including work related road deaths. A further 150 deaths occur while Australian employees travel to or from work, with another 200 people dying each year as a result of someone else’s work activity.</para>
<para>In 1996, National Occupational Health and Safety Commission researchers arrived at a conservative estimate that at least 2,300 people died each year as a result of work related exposure to chemicals. This does not reflect the current extent of death from occupational disease. In the near future, this figure may rise due to the expected increase in asbestos related deaths, a tragedy that for many decades has continued its macabre assault on working Australians, particularly through the Wittenoom disaster and the James Hardie disgrace. Australia has the highest incidence of asbestos related disease in the developed world. The incidence in Australia has been rising steeply since 1970, and it is estimated that the total number of asbestos related deaths will reach at least 40,000 and perhaps as many as 60,000 by 2020.</para>
<para>More broadly, approximately 480,000 Australian employees experience a work related injury or illness each year. That translates to approximately 2.8 million Australians suffering from work related long-term health conditions. Each year there are around 140,000 compensated work related injuries resulting in an absence from work of one or more weeks. In comparison, there are over 13,500 road accidents involving casualties each year in Australia.</para>
<para>That provides the context and background to the government’s proposed changes to occupational health and safety arrangements. The Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment Bill 2005 proposes to amend the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991. That act provides the legal basis for the protection of the health and safety of Commonwealth employees in departments, statutory authorities and government business enterprises.</para>
<para>This amendment bill is the government’s third attempt to introduce the provisions contained in this bill—namely, the removal of unions from workplace occupational health and safety institutions. As such, it is instructive to consider the legislative history of the preceding bills and the reasons for their previous rejection by the parliament.</para>
<para>The Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991 is similar to its counterpart state and territory legislation, in that it follows the Robens model of occupational health and safety. The Robens model stems from the report of the committee on safety and welfare at work commissioned by the United Kingdom parliament in the early 1970s as a means of reducing the incidence of workplace death and injury.</para>
<para>Essentially the approach by the Robens committee recommended greater self-regulation in the workplace through a collaborative approach between employers and employees. Importantly, the Robens model recognised the role unions play as employee representatives. As such, the principle of freedom of association was an important part of the Robens approach. The Robens model was largely followed in subsequent and similar inquiries conducted by both the states and the Commonwealth. Consequently, occupational health and safety committees have now become a familiar part of the industrial and workplace landscape across Australia.</para>
<para>The effectiveness of the Robens approach was supported by the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission when it stated in November 2002:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... there is indirect but strong evidence that employee participation, either direct or representative, is an essential component of effective occupational health and safety management.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The government’s first attempt to remove the role of unions in occupational health and safety matters was its Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment Bill 2000. The 2000 bill lapsed with the prorogation of the parliament for the 2001 election. Before the lapse of the bill, the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee prepared a report on the bill’s provisions. The essence of the Labor senators’ report was threefold. Firstly, there was a rejection of a reduced role for unions, under the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991. Labor senators took the view that the government’s position was driven by ‘ideological rhetoric associated with labour market opposition’. Moreover, there was evidence presented to the committee that where ‘unions back members of health and safety committees, the results will be lower workers compensation claims’. Secondly, there existed concern over the vagaries of the proposed safety management arrangements, especially given the ongoing success of the existing policy approach. Qualified support was given for a more flexible, dual civil and criminal system of occupational health and safety enforcement and compliance.</para>
<para>Democrat senators took the view that that 2000 bill should be passed with amendments. Senator Murray’s report stated:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">A key area of concern to us is the place of unions in the maintenance and advancement of workplace health and safety. Unions supplement the regulatory and inspectorial roles of State OH&amp;S departments in an irreplaceable way. Unions as a whole sometimes get criticised as a result of the actions of some unionists in misusing the provisions of the various State health and safety Acts. Such unionists raise non-existent H&amp;S issues to achieve other industrial objectives, and misuse entry and search provisions under the pretext of H&amp;S. Such behaviour needs to be addressed. However the way to deal with these abuses is not to clamp down on legitimate useful or effective union H&amp;S activity.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The government’s second attempt was in June 2002 with the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment (Employee Involvement and Compliance) Bill. That bill was referred to the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee, with Labor senators again recommending the amendment of the bill to remove provisions designed to reduce or remove union involvement in health and safety outcomes. Democrat senators stated that their position remained unchanged because the 2002 bill did not address the concerns raised in the 2000 Senate report. Some elements of that 2002 bill were subsequently enacted in the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment (Employee Involvement and Compliance) Act 2004, which introduced a more flexible compliance regime. Senate amendments supported by Labor and the Democrats significantly diluted the original intent and key provisions of that 2002 bill.</para>
<para>With that legislative summary, we come to this 2005 bill. Its proposed amendments are modelled on provisions unsuccessfully brought before the parliament in 2002, in particular as part of the employee involvement and compliance bill of that year. Let me refer to the bill’s proposed provisions in respect of management arrangements. The bill proposes the introduction of management arrangements to replace occupational health and safety agreements traditionally developed through tripartite processes between unions, employers and employees. These management arrangements replace the requirement for government agencies to negotiate health and safety agreements with unions and employees to govern occupational health and safety matters. Current legislation provides for occupational health and safety committee meetings every three months, with committee meeting minutes kept for three years. These time frames will now be decided by the management arrangements.</para>
<para>The bill also intends to remove all references to ‘unions’ and replace them with ‘employee representatives’, defined as either a ‘registered organisation’ or a ‘workplace staff association’. The bill defines a workplace staff association as an:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... association of employees, a principal purpose of which is the protection and promotion of the employee’s interests in matters concerning their employment.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Additionally, the bill also proposes that employee representatives must be invited into the workplace by an employee. Furthermore, under the provisions of the bill, an employee must invite the employee representative to initiate any investigation into occupational health and safety matters. Under the current act a union is able to directly request Comcare to investigate a workplace.</para>
<para>The bill also proposes that employee representative organisations request the right to be involved in occupational health and safety consultations by submission to the chief executive of Comcare. The Comcare chief executive may or may not then issue a certificate with whatever conditions are deemed necessary, with validity for a fixed period of 12 months. Finally, the bill also provides for employers to conduct the election of employee health and safety representatives, a role previously conducted by a union or a person specified by the soon to be abolished National Occupational Health and Safety Commission.</para>
<para>In 2000 and 2002 the government failed to outline a sound analysis as to why the current provisions and policy approach of the act needed to be changed. In 2005 nothing has changed. In his second reading speech on 23 June, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations stated:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Australian government believes strongly that safe and productive workplaces rely on a cooperative approach between employers and employees to identify and eliminate hazards that may cause injury or death.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Obviously this cooperative approach does not extend to the inclusion of unions in public sector occupational health and safety matters and institutions. Occupational health and safety matters are best developed through the tripartite processes involving unions, employers and employees based on the longstanding Robens model. This bill dismantles this tripartism and that approach, making it more difficult for employees to be adequately represented in these vital occupational health and safety matters.</para>
<para>Academic evidence suggests a very strong link between union presence and involvement and improved occupational health and safety outcomes. In his July 2003 paper entitled <inline font-style="italic">Workplace arrangements for health and safety in the 21st century</inline> Professor David Walters outlined international research that clearly demonstrates that active and organised workers’ representation is effective in ameliorating workplace hazards, that better standards are achieved in unionised workplaces than in non-unionised workplaces, that trained representatives stimulate and participate in workplace occupational health and safety structures and procedures and tackle new occupational health and safety issues, that work force participation in health and safety decisions is one of several factors related to lower claim rates and, finally, the empowerment of the work force was shown in Canadian studies to be one of the organisational reasons consistently related to lower injury rates. Empowerment in this situation includes the presence of unions, union support for worker members of joint health and safety committees and general worker participation in decision making.</para>
<para>These conclusions are further supported by Johnstone, Quinlan and Walters in their 2004 report <inline font-style="italic">Statutory occupational health and safety workplace arrangements for the modern labour market</inline>. They quoted a range of international and Australian studies. They said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">While there is considerable variation in the detail of these findings, taken collectively, they all lend support to the notion that joint arrangements, trade unions and trade union representation on health and safety at the workplace are associated with better health and safety outcomes than when employers manage occupational health and safety without representative worker participation.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This bill proposes to remove all references to unions from the act. This effectively means that the role a trade union currently fulfils may be replaced by workplace staff associations. A workplace staff association may merely be a social club and may not fulfil the requirements mandated of a trade union, such as being democratic and independent. As such, by devolving responsibility from unions to employee representatives, as this bill proposes, strong occupational health and safety processes and outcomes will become increasingly difficult to enforce.</para>
<para>The government intends to throw employees back on their own resources instead of using the occupational health and safety expertise built up by unions and their membership over many years. Employee representatives will lack the independent information and assistance currently provided by unions, while representatives themselves are likely to be less forthcoming in occupational health and safety negotiations with their employers. As an example, unions currently protect workers who may be afraid to raise certain occupational health and safety issues with their immediate supervisors. At present, workers can take such issues to the union and protect themselves from any personal repercussions. This will no longer be the case under the provisions of this bill.</para>
<para>Furthermore, the proposal that a union member must seek permission from a public official—the Chief Executive of Comcare—who may or may not agree to involve a union representative in occupational health and safety matters is more likely than not to be a breach of the terms of ILO Convention 87, freedom of association, to which Australia became a party in 1973. Finally, the bill proposes that employers, not employees, control the election of employees’ occupational health and safety representatives. This provision is a blatant attempt to ostracise unions from the occupational health and safety processes within Australian public sector workplaces.</para>
<para>In the area of workplace relations the Howard government consistently talks about choice. It is ironic then that this bill seeks to curtail the choice of Australian employees working in the public sector to be represented by a union in occupational health and safety matters. This bill represents the government’s third legislative attempt to deny Australian employees the basic and fundamental right to be represented by a union, if they so choose, in occupational health and safety matters. As such, it is driven by the government’s extreme ideology rather than by any sense of sound public policy outcomes.</para>
<para>Australian trade unions have a strong track record of protecting employees from unsafe work practices and places. It is clear that health and safety outcomes are dependent upon higher levels of worker participation and union support. Based on the research that I referred to earlier, removing the role of unions and replacing them with management driven processes will lead to less safe and less healthy workplaces.</para>
<para>Unions have a legitimate role to play in the monitoring and enforcement of occupational health and safety matters in the public sector. Unions exist as a very important and necessary safeguard. I use the word ‘safeguard’ because many occupational health and safety issues are already dealt with on a one-on-one basis in the workplace, between employees and/or between employees and their managers or supervisors. There are already many examples where occupational health and safety issues arise on a daily basis and employees, between themselves or with their managers, resolve them efficiently and expeditiously.</para>
<para>In such cases, the involvement of unions as a third party is not a prerequisite and often does not occur because it is often not required or requested. There is no mandatory involvement of unions in such issues as the government would have us believe. We already have both union and non-union employees working cooperatively with management and achieving successful results in improving occupational health and safety standards, so the government’s attempt to ostracise unions entirely from these matters is comprehensible only if one appreciates the government’s ideological approach in these matters.</para>
<para>The changes contained in this bill are so unashamedly anti-union, based as they are on that extreme ideological view, that neither an individual trade union nor the organised trade union movement has a role to play in occupational health and safety matters in the workplace. Mr Deputy Speaker, I simply put to you the illustration of the trade union movement coming to the assistance of the victims of James Hardie. Just ask yourself this simple question: where would the asbestosis and mesothelioma victims of James Hardie have been without the assistance of the trade union movement? I did not see employer associations come to the rescue of the victims of James Hardie. I did not see the Prime Minister, I did not see the Treasurer and I did not see the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. It fell to the organised trade union movement to come to the defence of fellow Australians to ensure some semblance of justice was done. If for no other reason, that in itself is justification of the legitimate role of the trade union movement in today’s economic and social affairs—in particular, involvement in today’s workplaces and especially when that relates to occupational health and safety.</para>
<para>The government does not see it this way—a point that becomes clear when one examines this bill. That should come as no surprise to those who have followed the Prime Minister’s 30 years of public life and views about public policy. Workplace health and safety must be a priority. It must be adequately resourced for employers and employees to enforce effective occupational health and safety rules and regulations. This is incumbent upon everyone in the workplace because no-one wins if working conditions deteriorate or when workplace accidents or fatalities occur. This bill is ill-conceived. It is nothing more than an ideological attack on unions, with no public policy benefit. This parliament should reject it.</para>

<para>—The <inline ref="R2388">Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment Bill 2005</inline> supports the people who are most important to the government—the workers of this country—and delivers to them a choice. I want to underline to the parliament that the Howard government are not against unions; we are not union bashers. There is a place for unions in this country, and the government will always ensure that there is a place for unions in this country. But there also has to be a place for those who do not need the services of a union or who do not want the mandated services of a union. What is wrong about that? That is fair. The opposition, of course, is in a position where it has to toe the union line. Everything it does and says is to support the continuation of a system which is now way out of date in this country—the world has moved on; the country has moved on. Certainly the union movement has laid the seeds of its own irrelevance by the way that it has operated politically rather than in the interests of the members it is supposed to represent.</para>

<para>The government believe in safe workplaces. It will come as a surprise to the member for Perth and others that these days workers and employers believe in safe workplaces. Why is safety the most important thing in a workplace? Because it is in nobody’s interest that the rules of safe workplaces be ignored. It is not in the employer’s interest, because productivity falls if there is a workplace accident. It is not in the employee’s interest, obviously, because nobody wants to have an accident. These days, if you go into a modern workplace, you will find, whether you are talking to the employer or to the employee, that safety is number one on everybody’s agenda. I have been into many workplaces, both large and small, and have confirmed for myself that, in formerly solidly unionised workplaces which now have no union membership at all in the workplace, safety is still number one for both employers and employees.</para>
<para>What does this bill do? In workplaces in the Public Service, where unions currently have a mandated right, this bill allows employers and employees, not just the unions, to consult with each other about workplace practices and to determine OH&amp;S arrangements. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline>
</para>
<para>The member for Shortland clearly does not want to hear that the union membership in Centrelink in my electorate has now fallen to less than 50 per cent. That is because unions are irrelevant now in the Commonwealth Public Service. The member for Shortland wants the unions to have a mandated right to determine OH&amp;S arrangements in the Public Service.</para>

<para>—Fair go, Mr Deputy Speaker. Labor will oppose this bill because they are doing the bidding of the Commonwealth public sector union. I do not know why in this modern day and age they do not understand and recognise that the relevance of unions in the public sector is diminishing, and that it is diminishing because the employees themselves do not feel that they are getting value for money in being a member of a union.</para>

<para>Labor is saying that unions should have a mandated and preferential role in every workplace regardless of the wishes of the workers. I have news for the Labor Party: the government has an opposite view. The government believes that workers and businesses should have the freedom to choose all their working arrangements to best suit their needs. As the member for Hume has observed, this benefits all Australians. Labor wants union membership to the exclusion of all other options.</para>
<para>In relation to choice, an issue raised by the member for Perth, Labor is contemptuous of workers’ rights to choose an alternative to union representation, simply because for Labor—the member for Shortland—there is no alternative. Open your mind. Open your mind and understand that Australia is different these days. There are other models. Choice is good. There is no clearer example of that than in relation to Labor’s attitude to Australian workplace agreements. What marvellous agreements they can produce between employer and employee at the workplace, without the interference of unions.</para>
<para>As I said earlier in my contribution, the government is not opposed to unions. If an employee wants a bargaining agent in an AWA to be a union member or have union membership, they can. That is how flexible the government’s workplace relations program is. I think that Labor is still very much opposed to Australian workplace agreements.</para>
<para>But think of this too. Because it is tied up with the unions, as explained by its approach to this bill tonight, Labor would allow union bosses to walk into any business any time under the guise of a suspected OH&amp;S breach even when there are no union members in the business. We cannot tolerate that. That is unfair. It gives the unions a privileged position to which they are not entitled.</para>
<para>The government has presented this bill to the parliament tonight because it recognises that members of the Australian Public Service want to have a say in OH&amp;S arrangements in their workplace. I challenge the Labor Party to explain to me and to the government why they should not have a say—why individual members who are not union members should not have a say in OH&amp;S arrangements in their individual workplace. Surely that is sensible. The position that the Australian Labor Party has adopted on this bill is indefensible. That is why I will be strongly supporting it in the parliament when the vote comes tonight.</para>

<para>—Australian workplaces are changing. Workers are working longer, which has implications for workplace safety. The longer hours that they work place increased physical and psychological demands on them. Here we have a situation in the workplace with longer hours, and we are looking at the legislation before us today, the <inline ref="R2388">Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment Bill 2005</inline>.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Safe workplaces are important to employers and to workers. They can be achieved only through good occupational health and safety. All research and authoritative information shows that this is best achieved through a tripartite process involving employers, workers and unions. Poor occupational health and safety leads to an unsafe workplace, which leads to increased injuries in the workplace, which in turn leads to costs for employers. It also leads to disability for workers. Everybody involved in the process is disadvantaged. It is a cost to all parties. I believe that it is strongly in the interests of everybody in every workplace to work together to see that there is good occupational health and safety within those workplaces and that workers are protected, not only for their benefit but for the benefit of employers. It is in the interests of all parties to avoid injury and promote a safe workplace. This is achieved not by sitting back and waiting until people injure themselves but rather by a proactive approach to occupational health and safety.</para>
<para>Currently the situation that exists in workplaces covered by this legislation is proactive. The question that I ask myself when I look at this legislation is: what will this legislation do to make workplaces safer, to reduce injuries, to reduce disability and to make sure that there are no lost working hours? Unfortunately, I cannot see that this will achieve any of that. Rather, I think it may make the workplace a little less safe than it is now. Unfortunately, I believe this legislation that we are considering in the parliament tonight is not driven by occupational health and safety best practice. Rather, it is driven by a pathological hatred of unions.</para>
<para>I think that members on the other side of this House need to look at the way the system is operating at the moment. At various times workplaces covered by this legislation have actually been models for employers, employees and workplaces throughout Australia. I find it very disturbing that there has been a series of pieces of legislation introduced into this parliament to change the way very safe workplaces, workplaces that are models, are operating.</para>
<para>I have had to come to the decision, very reluctantly, that this legislation is not about occupational health and safety. It is not about creating a workplace that is safe for all people. It is not about protecting the interests of employers by ensuring that hours are not lost through injury in the workplace. Rather, this legislation is about the government’s extreme industrial relations agenda. It is driven by ideologues who are not interested in safety, and I think they have lost their perspective. When you are looking at the purpose of occupational health and safety and the roles of all the parties involved in occupational health and safety, you are looking at creating a safe workplace; you are not looking at union bashing. I am rather saddened by the fact that this parliament has taken occupational health and safety to this level, with the belittling of occupational health and safety within workplaces, putting it down to an issue of whether or not unions are involved.</para>
<para>This legislation removes the need for employers in government agencies to negotiate occupational health and safety agreements with unions and employees, through the introduction of management arrangements. Management arrangements can address consultation, training and risk management. All references to unions are removed and replaced with ‘employee representation’—either a registered organisation or a workplace staff association. Why the paranoia about unions? Is it some sort of a crime now to mention unions? Is it some sort of a crime for unions to be involved?</para>
<para>I think that unions have played a very important role in occupational health and safety. As somebody who has worked in that area before becoming a member of parliament—and I am not talking about working in the area of unions; I am talking about having worked in occupational health and safety, in rehabilitation and with people who have been injured within the workplace—I know how important that tripartite arrangement is. I also know how good the occupational health and safety has been in organisations and departments that have been covered by this legislation. That is why I am so disappointed with the direction that we are taking. We are not looking at what will have the best outcome for all parties; rather we are being driven by this ideological hatred of unions.</para>
<para>In addition, under this proposed legislation employee representatives must be invited into the workplace by an employee. That is hardly a proactive approach. I think one of the best aspects of a good occupational health and safety policy within a workplace is to have a proactive policy—one that looks at the whole of the workplace, makes recommendations and ensures that workers observe the proper safety procedures within that workplace. Workers can become very complacent too. They can be in a workplace and not take into account their proper rest periods. They may not sit properly on their chairs. They may not have the computer workstation set up properly. I am sure that the members of this House, when they are working, do not all always take into account the proper occupational health and safety approach. That is where being proactive and having someone come into the workplace is very beneficial.</para>
<para>Previously, a union could make a request to Comcare to investigate a workplace under the provisions of the existing legislation. Under this bill, an employee must invite them in. So no longer can a union say, ‘We’d like to come in, check out the workplace and make sure that the proper safety standards are in place.’ Now they need to be invited in—and they will not be invited in until such time as there is a problem. This is the wrong way to approach occupational health and safety. You should be able to anticipate problems that will arise in the workplace. That way you prevent injury and lost working hours through injury, and at the same time you reduce the cost to the employer—in this case, invariably that is government.</para>
<para>I think that this bill is a retrograde step. It is something that the government really need to address, instead of getting caught on the hang-up they have about unions. This is not about unions; it is about a safe workplace. It is about protecting workers, protecting employers and having a safe working environment.</para>
<para>Also, under this legislation employee representatives involved in developing occupational health and safety management arrangements must be issued with a certificate by the CEO of Comcare, valid for only 12 months. It allows employers to conduct elections of employee health and safety representatives, a role that was previously conducted by the union or a person specified by the commission. Once again, I feel that this bill is being driven wholly and solely by this government’s hatred of unions—something that I really do not think occupational health and safety is about. I ask the government to look at it very reasonably and consider its implications.</para>
<para>In the last parliament, I was involved in an inquiry conducted by the Standing Committee on Employment and Workplace Relations. The committee’s report was called <inline font-style="italic">Back on the job: report into aspects of Australian workers compensation schemes.</inline> The terms of reference for that inquiry were geared strongly towards fraud—the incident cost of fraudulent claims and fraudulent conduct by employees and employers. It was directed toward fraudulent behaviour, and it also looked at issues related to workers compensation. One of the things that I found most upsetting at the time was that, when some members of the committee tried to get occupational health and safety written in as a term of reference, the minister would not include it. The committee looked at rehabilitation programs and the benefit of these, but once again I emphasise to the House that occupational health and safety is imperative in any workplace. Minister Dutton was also part of that inquiry. I certainly hope that he learned from that inquiry the importance of occupational health and safety and that it is an issue that has an impact on each and every person involved in the workplace. That is what occupational health and safety is about. It is not about a union, employer or worker; it is about a safe workplace. Every piece of legislation, Minister, should be designed to develop that.</para>
<para>This report detailed some of the important issues related to occupational health and safety—the kinds of things that I think occupational health and safety legislation should include. One of the recommendations was that there be a commitment to the national occupational health and safety strategy that was put in place for the years 2002 to 2012, to address the unacceptable level of workplace injuries and fatalities. That is what occupational health and safety is about. It is not about attacking unions and getting unions out of the workplace; it is about creating a safe workplace.</para>
<para>There were five national priorities: reducing high incidence and severity of risk; developing the capacity of business operators and workers to manage occupational health and safety effectively; preventing occupational disease more effectively; eliminating hazards at the design stage; and strengthening the capacity of government to influence occupational health and safety outcomes. Nowhere does it say that you get better occupational health and safety outcomes by getting unions out of the workplace. That is why I have a problem with this legislation: it is not about occupational health and safety; it is about attacking unions. Even this report highlighted the fact that unions did have an important role to play—</para>

</quote>
<para class="block">The report found that unions contributed to safety within the workplace. From what I have read in this legislation and from what I have seen of the performance of Minister Dutton, I can only say that this is not about occupational health and safety. Having good strong occupational health and safety procedures benefits all parties. All government approaches to this issue should be driven by developing and adopting legislation that will deliver the best outcome—fewer injuries and deaths in the workplace. This delivers a benefit to all parties.</para>
<para>Occupational health and safety is not about industrial relations, which is what this legislation is about. Rather than being about creating the safe working environment that I have spent so much time talking about and that I have emphasised to such an extent, this legislation is about the government having another go at the unions. Occupational health and safety is not about attacking unions; it is about creating a safe working environment which benefits all. Evidence demonstrates that this is best achieved through a tripartite approach involving workers, unions and employers.</para>

<para>—It is interesting to hear the words of the member for Shortland. When I picked up a newspaper the other day—I think it was the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline>—I read that a major export program under construction in the north-west of the state was stopped for the day when 600 workers went on strike because somebody implied that a box of gaskets might have had some asbestos in them. The gaskets might have had some asbestos in them, but surely it is purely industrial action when 600 people, some of whom would not have got within a bull’s roar of that box of gaskets, all knock off for the day. The member for Shortland says that the <inline ref="R2388">Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment Bill 2005</inline> is some sort of ideological witch-hunt of the trade union movement, but of course that claim is refuted by the minister’s second reading speech, in which he said:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para>The government is committed to improving health and safety outcomes in Commonwealth workplaces, and this bill follows amendments to the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991 in 2004, which introduced a strong new compliance regime.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is the role of government and it is registered in black and white in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. Of course, this raises the question of who should be responsible for looking after employees under that regime. The member for Shortland tells us that she once had a job on behalf of the trade union movement in this area. She seemed to be very vague about what she did when she had that job. She did not spend 10 minutes of her time giving us a rundown on the sorts of issues she had to deal with and on her knowledge of the act and how it should be applied in the workplace. She dropped a few crocodile tears about the fact that, in this government’s view, it might be better if other people were the preferred supervisory agent. That is what this legislation is about. It gives employees—the people who, as the member for Shortland said, need to be protected—the right to say, ‘We don’t particularly want somebody who’s got no skills in this area and who’s not a representative of the department that is responsible for policing these requirements.’ <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline>
</para>
<para>I thank my colleagues for giving their attention to what will be a brilliant speech. The Chief Opposition Whip should have worked out a revised schedule, because his own shadow minister had 30 minutes to speak but only spoke for 15 minutes—because he could not think of anything else to say from a rational point of view. I was going to keep my contribution as brief as possible and give his side a bit of a go. But the reality now is that I will take my time. If he wants to call a couple more quorums, that is his business, but it will just delay the time at which the next speaker on his side will have an opportunity to speak in this place. So that is the point we should understand in all of this.</para>
<para>It is interesting that the member for Shortland wants to call us ideologues. We have a pretty broad agenda on this side of the House. The ideology seems to come from the other side of the House: if it is not in the interests of trade union bureaucrats then it is wrong. Nothing else matters. It does not matter that family people would rather deal directly with their employer. It does not matter that, as I mentioned a minute ago, 600 people went off work in the Pilbara the other day because of a box of gaskets which were possibly made of asbestos and were maybe touched by about three people. If that is not industrial action, I will go ‘Hee’.</para>
<para>We are told by the member for Shortland that longer hours are unsafe—I wish she would do something about them in this place—and that safe workplaces are good. I have already read from the minister’s second reading speech where that fact is confirmed. But I ask the question again: what does that have to do with somebody in the trade union movement who does not know anything about industrial safety law but who just uses it as an opportunity to get in and try to sign up a few members? The workplace is quite able to understand whether it is at risk. The member for Shortland said: ‘And those workers do not even try to do this themselves. We’ve got to teach them a lesson. We’ve got to get Tom Domican or someone in there just to get people to understand what it is all about.’ I am amazed.</para>
<para>This legislation simply says that there is no special right for union representatives to walk through the front door of a probably safe workplace when they feel like it. It recognises the fact that, within the Commonwealth government and, for that matter, the state governments, large numbers of people are employed to police this sort of activity. And they get around the place. I was sitting in a factoryette the other day waiting for the delivery of an item that was being put together outside in a large warehouse with two people working in it, and two girls with clipboards came in. I thought, ‘Here are a couple of government inspectors.’ They said: ‘We’re from OH&amp;S WA’—or whatever—‘Can we look around the place?’ They had a look around the place, and they came back to the girl at reception and said, ‘We can smell cigarette smoke here.’ That was apparently all they could find, but at least they were government inspectors and they had a legal right. But this legislation says that you do not get a legal right by being a trade union heavy. It says that, if you have a good reason, you might be invited by someone who has a genuine concern. And what is wrong with that? We do consider ourselves to be living in a free country.</para>
<para>The member for Shortland says, ‘You’ve got to do this to make the workplace safer.’ We agree with that, but Sharan Burrow does not. She says, ‘The quicker we can have someone killed this week, the better the case we’ll have to put.’ She says, ‘It would be pretty handy if someone got killed this week.’ Can you believe that the second school teacher to lead the ACTU would be pleased if someone got severely injured this week so that she could make a political point and protect her job? What are we talking about, when people are so fixated on their own survival that they would propose the death or injury of a fellow Australian and, when questioned about it, stick their chest out and say: ‘I stand by what I said. It’s all in the interest of the cause’?</para>
<para>We know all about causes. They had those sorts of things in Russia and murdered millions of their own people. And we are supposed to have some pathological hatred of unions? I have been in a union—until they discovered I was there and asked me not to come back. We do not have a pathological hatred of unions, but we see they have a place.</para>

<para>—Yes, the Transport Workers Union brought me in as an owner-driver. The bloke went back very happy about that—he’d got my fee—and then they found out in Perth who was in the team. But that is all right. What I am saying is that I understand unions. I have worked with unions, I have worked with the people and I have seen them come in and try to heavy someone who says: ‘I’m working as a barmaid in Carnarvon. I hope to be a typist in Port Hedland. How many unions do I have to join to have a trip up the north-west coast?’ OH&amp;S is the last bastion for trade union bureaucrats. Unions have been rejected by the general work force. They think they can invest their money better. But now they are going to be heavied by people coming in and saying, ‘I’ve come to save you.’ It is ridiculous. This legislation is not an attack on unions. It is a protective measure for people who do not want their company, and I cannot see that there is anything wrong with that.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>It goes further. I am a great advocate for single mothers and others. I think it is more important in this day and age, and I am sure the minister would admit that I raised it with him only a little while ago. We would like to see single mothers in the work force. They would benefit from being in the work force, but they have family responsibilities—and it might not only be single mothers—and I constantly put a case to find opportunities to let them work from home. They send you emails, so you know they are computer literate. But, when I put this up, the first thing that people say to me is: ‘What about the OH&amp;S problems in their homes? You’ve got to go and inspect them. You’ve got to get the union in there.’ Unions hate home employment because it is too hard to organise. If that is the truth, if a home is so unsafe, no person should be able to carve the family meat without a steel glove on. It might help my wife, I have to admit. She has a bit of a problem with knives.</para>

<para>—She is more inclined to cut herself than anyone else I know. I do not know why. If someone is happy in their own home environment and an employer says to them, ‘I can help you stay at home to work,’ why do people say, ‘Don’t you dare do that because OH&amp;S will say that their house is totally unsafe’? I find that a bit ridiculous. But, again, it is only because the trade union bureaucracy is terrified that people who work from home might be a bit hard to find, a bit hard to sign up and a bit hard to get the union dues out of.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>This is the point. There is no reason whatsoever to give any segment of the community a right of entry to a workplace under the guise that they are going in to save the workers. That is a role for a government inspector. The next thing is that we will be saying that the trade unions are allowed to come into your house because a burglar got in yesterday. We have a police force for that, and there are plenty of inspectors—I do not know how many—for workplaces. The state governments and others have ample processes for ensuring that from time to time there are checks on workplaces to see that they are meeting the laws as written by the parliaments of Australia. There is no reason in the world for there to be a special role for trade unions, particularly considering most of them have no idea what the particular legislation is. In Western Australia, I saw an inspector talking to an employer, and he had a book which was probably 50 millimetres thick. I bet the average trade union official is across all that—the only book he would have with him is a receipt book.</para>
<para>These are ridiculous arguments to put forward, but they come, of course, from the party that sits opposite and, if they are not already of the trade union movement, they know that their existence depends on that 50 per cent vote in every preselection. Where else do you have that sort of domination in politics? It used to be 60 per cent, and a previous Leader of the Opposition reduced it to 50 per cent. That is pretty tough: you just have to find one other person to vote with you. Excuse me: it is just ridiculous.</para>
<para>With regard to the opposition of the members opposite to this legislation, as I have said, their shadow minister could find only 15 minutes to talk about it. That is how serious their opposition is. This is a proposal that underwrites OH&amp;S throughout the work force but gives the work force the right to say who might come and do inspections—if they think that should be another public servant, good luck to them. Why should it be a self-appointed person who has a job and an ulterior motive?</para>
<para>I do not think I can add any more to my comments, but I was astounded at the effort of the member for Shortland, who just seemed to want to say that this legislation is a product of pathological hatred and ideology. There is no ideology on this side; there is just a practical sense of responsibility to represent the people of Australia. The ideology that has been delivered to us and will be again in another couple of minutes is about why there is something special in this day and age about an organisation and a culture which is rejected by 75 per cent of Australians—and, let me say, half the remaining percentage are only there because it is a case of no ticket, no start. They have to pay the fees to get a living, and I hope we are able to deal with that matter too.</para>
<para>If unions are so good—and they could take a bit of a lesson from their superannuation funds, which seem to be popular because apparently they give a good service, and I am very comfortable about that—and want business, they ought to get out and do the things workers truly want. Workers want them to give them services and representation in this modern world. They do not want the unions to oppose working from home, if that is convenient to people. They do not want them coming around and harassing them when they are trying to complete a report or something for the government—which, of course, will judge their future prospects in promotion. They do not want these people hanging around. But we know why they come around; it is to try either to cause trouble or to get more business for themselves.</para>
<para>Of course, as the member for Shortland said, safe workplaces are good. Nobody is contesting that. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations referred to that in the first couple of paragraphs of his second reading speech, but the reality is that this is about saying that nobody has an automatic right to enter someone else’s workplace. Who was it—Kingham or whoever they eventually put in jail—who went and belted up women in a workplace? How much damage does that do, when people like that—</para>

<para>—I will take the opportunity in addressing the <inline ref="R2388">Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Amendment Bill 2005</inline> to condemn the appalling statements made in this debate by a number of members on the other side of this parliament about the President of the ACTU, Sharan Burrow—and also in relation to Mr Martin Kingham—have been. Those statements display the pathological hatred that members of the government have for the trade union movement—the organised labour movement of this country. The legislation before us here today is just another example of a pattern of behaviour on the part of this government, which is trying to destroy any and every activity of unions in our society and in our economy.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The truth of the matter is seen in relation to superannuation, which I will go to immediately. The government wanted superannuation choice because it did not want unions involved in compulsory superannuation. In the area of occupational health and safety covered by this bill, again the government wants no role for unions. It has been trying to get this legislation through since 2000, but now, with its control of the Senate, we see the full colours of this government on display, in its pathological hatred for the trade union movement of this country.</para>
<para>In relation to the asbestos debate, the previous speaker said that there was no role for the trade union movement, which has done a great job—Greg Combet has done a great job in that area.</para>

<para>—Regrettably, today we have had one of the greatest sell-outs in telecommunications policy that Australia has ever seen. We have seen the National Party, which championed the interests of rural Australians, go for an easy price in the debate that has been held in the coalition rooms.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>There is no case for the full privatisation of Telstra, the telecommunications company. At least while it is held in majority public ownership, there is an opportunity for government to influence it. When it is fully privatised, there will be no pressure points to ensure that people in the regions get services equal to those in metropolitan areas or that people in outer metropolitan areas get services equal to those in the CBDs. Long have I put on the record in this place my concern that, in outer urban electorates like Scullin, the services provided are not up to the same standard that we see provided to CBDs and other areas within cities. These are the things that have been forgotten by the government in the continuation of its want to sell the whole of Telstra.</para>
<para>For outer metropolitan areas, the lack of infrastructure based competition means there is a need to find other ways of providing alternative metro fibre rings to ensure competition with Telstra. Many outer areas have black spots, as they lack the equivalent CBD broadband infrastructure. New advances in infrastructure technology are always applied first in CBDs and inner metropolitan areas, with delays in their implementation in outer metropolitan areas. These are the facts as we confront them now, and they will be made worse with the full sale of Telstra. We will see the community getting a poorer service at a higher charge. The government needs to realise that the Australian people know this. Polling that has been done indicates opposition at levels of approximately 70 per cent to the full sale of Telstra.</para>
<para>And what do we see? In 1996 the government first established the Natural Heritage Fund, out of which $1.2 billion over five years was to be set aside for the environment. What was the reason for this? The government was dealing with the Democrats and the Greens and needed to buy them off. Now we see the government having managed to convince The Nationals to support the sale of Telstra for $3 billion—$1 billion to repair the current infrastructure, and the interest from a $2 billion trust to fund upgrades to services after Telstra is sold. What a joke. Compare that to the $5.7 billion that Sol Trujillo has identified as being needed to bring Australia’s infrastructure up to world standard. Even with the partial privatisation of Telstra, we have seen line rentals rise from $11.65 to around $30. Australia with its broadband performance of 7.7 subscribers for every 100 people—the worst performance of any major industrialised country—is ranked 21st in the developed world. This is what we see from this government: short-term decisions, decisions that are not thought out in the long term in the national interest.</para>
<para>I am talking about local conditions that confront the people I represent, such as the difficulties that have been seen in new greenfield urban developments. An example is the Botanica Park development. It was not until the community came together that Country Wide, the Telstra program, was extended to take in outer metropolitan areas like the northern suburbs of Melbourne and, under HiBIS funding, we saw broadband services put into that community. We can see it in South Morang and we can see it in Epping North. If the developer does not put the infrastructure in at the time of subdivision, these people are left behind. As has been said, they are cut out of having proper businesses at home because, when it comes to competition, they are behind the eight ball.</para>
<para>These are the sorts of things we really need to see addressed. Citizens and businesses fear the consequences of a predatory privatised Telstra operating unchecked, with no obligation except to its shareholders. When it comes to decisions about investment in new equipment and technology, a fully privatised Telstra will make decisions that optimise the return for its shareholders and not for the community itself. It is these problems that the government must address in the national interest. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—This Saturday a by-election will be held for the state seat of Chatsworth, which falls within the federal electorate of Bonner. Although it is a different level of government, I take a great interest in state politics because many of my constituents often contact me to tell me about the serious problems they are experiencing with our state run hospitals, schools and roads. It is a sad fact that the poorly managed and underfunded Queensland health system is responsible for more deaths than the London bombings. The by-election on Saturday will give the people of Chatsworth an opportunity to send a clear message to the Beattie government that it needs to get its priorities right.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The by-election will also present an opportunity for residents to elect an effective and articulate new member to the parliament. The person I am referring to is a colleague of mine, Michael Caltabiano. Over the past nine years, Michael has served as a councillor for Chandler and has earned the reputation of a hardworking community representative who gets things done. I urge the voters of Chatsworth to give Michael the opportunity to build on what he has already achieved for the area as their councillor. I know that Michael has the right priorities. He will not stand for neglect of our hospitals and schools. He will ensure that the Beattie government does not take the people of Chatsworth for granted. On a personal note, I also wish to point out that Michael’s decision to stand for Chatsworth meant that he had to resign from his job as a local councillor. The fact that he has put everything on the line for this by-election shows his true commitment to the people of Chatsworth. I know that it cannot have been an easy decision for him to step down from his job, with a wife and two daughters to support—and I commend him for his courage.</para>
<para>Local residents may have lost a councillor, but I am confident that they will gain an effective new state member in Michael Caltabiano. I am also confident that the great work Michael has done over the past nine years in council will be continued by Adrian Schrinner, who has been endorsed as the Liberal candidate for Chandler. Like Michael, Adrian is both a colleague and a close friend of mine. Adrian grew up in the ward of Chandler and attended a local school for 12 years. He is someone who knows the local area and understands the issues that are important to local residents. Having worked closely with Adrian for a number of years, I can speak personally of his abilities and his commitment to the community. With a state by-election being held this Saturday and a council by-election being held on 10 September, residents within the Bonner electorate have a wonderful opportunity to elect two hard-working and effective representatives at two different levels of government. I urge them to support Michael Caltabiano and Adrian Schrinner.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I rise this evening to talk about some of the work of the House of Representatives that is often not well spoken of or promoted in the Australian community. I refer specifically to the work of the standing committees of the House. I am pleased to say that I have the privilege at the moment to serve on two standing committees. The first committee is the Standing Committee on Industry and Resources, which is currently conducting an inquiry into the development of Australia’s non-fossil fuel energy industry, with a particular focus on the strategic importance of Australia’s uranium resources. That issue is not new to me, as I have been involved in the debate since March 1977, when I first visited the uranium province in the Northern Territory as a very young trade union official, to recruit workers to my old union, the Federated Miscellaneous Workers Union of Australia.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The second committee I am serving on is new to me. It is the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. I have been pleased to be involved in the current inquiry into the impact on agriculture of pest animals. It is fair to say that in recent times we have heard a lot about the impact of the drought on the rural community, but we should not lose sight of the fact that there are ongoing problems which the primary industry community has to confront on a regular basis as droughts come and go. That is why the Standing Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is currently conducting a significant inquiry into the pest animal issues which have an impact on the industry. One of the objectives of the inquiry is to promote better community understanding of, and involvement in, the pest animal problems which confront the rural community in Australia. Obviously at the moment the Australian community is exceptionally worried about the impact of cane toads, as their march into Northern Australia seems unstoppable at this particular point in time. Evidence already suggests that the ecology of the Northern Territory is changing as the toads set up strongholds in an environment that is ideal for the propagation of this feral pest.</para>
<para>But the cane toad also reminds me of two other problems that we have created in Australia through the introduction of species from beyond Australia’s shores. The committee recently visited the north-west of Western Australia, where we were confronted with two particular problems: the problem of the feral donkey and the problem of the feral camel—a problem that I do not think is really appreciated and understood by the Australian community. I raise these today because I think it is about time that we as a community took seriously some of the problems that are confronting our rural sector, with a special focus on the problems of feral animals.</para>
<para>I refer this evening to a visit to Warrawagine Station, which is a station of approximately one million acres, located in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. That station is run by Robin and Lyle Mills and their family, and they employ a significant number of young people. I am pleased to note that during the visit we were also enlightened on the nature of the training that those young people are given the opportunity of undertaking. I do not believe that we as a community properly understand the major problems that confront not only the owners of that station but also the nation with respect to our requirement to actually protect our desert environment in the years to come.</para>
<para>History will show that thousands of camels were imported into Australia between 1840 and 1907. They were used for riding and as pack animals, for exploration and in the construction of the rail and telegraph lines throughout Northern Australia. The problem is that by 1930 rail and motor transport became popular. The reaction of those responsible for the camels was to abandon them, the end result being that they bred well and spread across parts of the Northern Territory, Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland.</para>
<para>The number of these feral animals in Australia is now estimated to be in the order of 800,000 to one million. The problem that we therefore confront is the fact that these camels eat most plant material, including fresh grasses and shrubs. They also live up to 50 years and breed actively for about 30 years, so you can imagine the problem that is confronting our primary producers. It is also creating a huge challenge for us to protect our desert environment. The camels severely damage native trees such as the quandong native peach. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Last month I attended the 98th annual general meeting of the North Bondi Surf Club—Australia’s largest surf club, with over 1,800 members. I was delighted to present 50-year Surf Life Saving Association awards to Ralph Clark, Michael Gray, Tony Rule, Terry Schofield and Keith Snell. I was especially delighted to see Jim Spencer receive his 75-year service award, his vigorous address-in-reply testifying to the preservative qualities of salt water.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Although founded in 1906, North Bondi does not claim to be the oldest surf club. There is a contest for that title, between Bondi Surf Bathers’ Life Saving Club, a few hundred metres south along the promenade, and Bronte Surf Club, two beaches further south again, whose AGM I also attended recently. North Bondi was part of my life almost from the time I could walk, as my father was a member. It was where, too many years ago, I earned my bronze and instructor’s certificate.</para>
<para>Bondi Beach is Australia’s best-known and most popular beach. It is a world-famous tourist icon, a must-see and must-swim location for millions of visitors. The Australian surf, however, is often as treacherous as it is alluring, and without the surf lifesaving movement our great surfing beaches would have to be closed to the public. The cost of hiring full-time lifeguards to patrol Bondi on a busy summer’s weekend would be unaffordable. Our greatest tourist destinations, our greatest places of recreation, therefore depend entirely on the volunteer service of hundreds of lifesavers to keep them safe.</para>
<para>In 2005, the 410 proficient lifesavers of North Bondi performed 522 rescues, bringing the total number of rescues performed there since 1906 to 12,425. On Easter Sunday the dangers of the surf were demonstrated once more when 12 swimmers were caught in a sudden rip. Eleven were saved, but despite the best efforts of the lifesavers one was never found and is presumed drowned. Each of those rescues represents a life saved, and in many cases lives of swimmers are saved because lifesavers put their own lives on the line. The life lost on Easter Sunday could have been 12 lives lost were it not for the lifesavers of North Bondi. Indeed, they save lives not only in the surf, as they demonstrated only last weekend when they were called on to revive a person who had collapsed at the end of the City to Surf.</para>
<para>The surf lifesaving movement has an important role in promoting a healthy outdoor lifestyle for young Australians. There are over 5,000 Nippers in the Sydney branch area, and 650 of them are at North Bondi. Each surf club relies on a strong and enthusiastic committee to put in many hours of time in administration, in addition to the hours spent on patrol. North Bondi’s team is led by Grant McMah as president and kept in line by a superefficient club secretary, Michael Wright.</para>
<para>In my first speech last year I spoke about the very Australian egalitarianism of surf clubs. The surf clubs of Australia attract the broadest range of members: the wealthy and the battlers, judges and garbos, policemen and villains, teachers and truants. My own electorate is one of the most diverse in Australia, and that diversity and the easygoing, tolerant way in which we delight in it is epitomised by the surf clubs of Wentworth.</para>
<para>All surf clubs are always short of money. They always need new gear and new buildings, and for the most part they can rely on support from their community, local councils and state governments. I have written today to support North Bondi’s application for a $500,000 grant from the state government through the Surf Life Saving New South Wales Surf Club Development Program, to be spent on the refurbishment of the North Bondi surf club.</para>
<para>The federal government historically has made very few contributions to support surf clubs, other than some grants from the heritage budget. The federal government obviously cannot fund every good cause, but there are few that are more deserving than that of lifesaving. The surf clubs of Australia will always deserve our support and Australia’s support.</para>

<para>—I rise tonight to raise a matter of concern in this House that should concern not only the members of this House but also parents from all walks of life, from all corners of this country. It relates to the capacity of children in our publicly funded libraries to access internet pornography.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I attended a very important seminar last week that was sponsored by a gentleman called Warwick Marsh, who is doing great work on behalf of the Australian Fatherhood Foundation. At that function I heard very harrowing reports from an American academic about the effects of pornography, particularly on children.</para>
<para>Imagine my concern when I returned to my electorate to read an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Berwick Leader</inline>. It was written by a journalist called Dimity Barber, who is a very good and capable journalist from this particular paper. This article said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Libraries across Casey and Cardinia have been urged to install Internet filters to stop children viewing pornography.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Effectively, their survey indicated that, in a number of these libraries—which are publicly funded libraries in an electorate in a growth-belt area with a large number of young families—children could actually access pornography via the library. This journalist questioned a person from the library corporation named Prue Menzies, who was the library spokesperson across Casey and Cardinia, and she said that the staff monitored computers and asked people to be considerate of others. However, when this journalist went into the libraries, the journalist was able to access pornography virtually unchecked for as long as they wanted.</para>
<para>I do not know about you, but as a responsible parent and a responsible legislator I think it is our task in this place and across the country to lay markers. I say as a parent and a politician that this is unacceptable. I notice that my friend and colleague the member for La Trobe has come into this place, and he is quoted as saying the same thing. So in this place tonight I am calling for any federal government funding that goes to public libraries, particularly in the Casey-Cardinia library corporation, to be tied with the proviso that there has to be an internet pornography filter installed.</para>
<para>Some may say that this is a draconian measure, a measure that goes too far, but this is a measure that has been successfully trialled in America. It has been tried by concerned parents who experienced similar difficulties in the United States. One may say: ‘Well, this is isolated just to, say, libraries in the Casey-Cardinia library corporation.’ But if you look at some statistics you will see that in late 2002 the Australian Library and Information Association conducted a survey of internet use in public libraries—91 library services, all of which were institutional members of this organisation. The findings indicated that most libraries are providing unfiltered access to the internet and found that public libraries are significant centres for internet access for children.</para>
<para>If that is the case—if a lot of Australian children are going to libraries across the country—surely it is our job as legislators to protect the children from exposure to something that we know will cause them harm. Anecdotally, I have heard stories of people going to those libraries in the Casey-Cardinia library corporation and watching others download pornography. It is not acceptable. Any responsible government—state, federal or local—will mandate that the appropriate internet pornography filters must be installed. They must be installed to protect our kids.</para>
<para>And I go further than just the call for internet pornography filters to be installed in public libraries. I call for them to be installed in child-care centres, because again there is no demand from governments that Internet pornography filters be installed there. That is completely inappropriate. Having spoken to some of my friends from the other side, I know that they will support this.</para>
<para>In closing, it is our job as legislators and as parents to set community standards. It is unacceptable for public libraries and child-care centres to not protect our children. I call in this place at this time for the appropriate filters to be installed and, if necessary, to have that mandated, particularly by the federal government. There are precedents in federal education funding of tying money to conditions being met. I call on all other forms of government to do the same thing to protect our most treasured asset in this place, our children.</para>

<para>—Those of you who know the Sunshine Coast region of Australia will know of its attraction as a holiday destination. But the good things in my electorate, such as the lifestyle and the beaches, are also responsible for a very high population growth rate in the region. The weather is also attractive all year round, although we did have a cold snap late last week—and would you believe the temperature actually got down to 10 degrees in some spots. Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that population growth in the Sunshine Coast between 1998 and 2003 was 3.53 per cent, which places it as the third highest growth rate in Australia, behind Mandurah, 74 kilometres south of Perth, with 4.02 per cent and the Gold Coast-Tweed area, with 3.67 per cent. High growth is nothing new in the south-east of Queensland. We have an influx of some 1,000 people per week from other parts of the country. The growth has brought extra cars to the Sunshine Coast, thereby putting extra pressure on the road networks.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I am pleased today to announce that real progress is being made in the construction of a new road in the busiest business and shopping hub of the region, the Maroochydore Central Business District. Maroochy Boulevard will link the major arterial Sunshine Motorway to Plaza Parade. It is associated with a major interchange construction and the Maroochy Boulevard bridge, which was completed some time ago, has already been a medium-term white elephant in that it is totally ready but it needs a road constructed to it. Together these three roadwork components will help relieve the growing burden on Sugar Road and Maud Street to the south and Maroochydore Road to the north as well as Plaza Parade and Evans Street.</para>
<para>Mr Speaker, as you would expect, I have closely monitored the preliminary planning and lent my weight to help avoid stagnation of this joint private developer, local government and state government project. The Maroochy Boulevard project has been of particular interest to me because of the need to find a solution to the traffic problems in the region. I am particularly pleased that the project is now moving much closer towards completion.</para>
<para>Unfortunately, a Queensland Labor government project of widening the Sunshine Motorway from single lane to double lane between Buderim-Mooloolaba Road and Maroochydore Road has been delayed. Public consultation is well under way, with letters posted to landowners and business people whose properties may potentially be impacted upon by the new Maroochy Boulevard and associated projects. These landowners have been invited to speak with consultants in the state government to discuss their issues and concerns. In addition, neighbouring landowners whose properties may not be directly affected have also been sent letters by the state government. In the coming weeks, around early September, the preliminary designs for the project will be taken to the wider community in Maroochydore, located in my electorate of Fisher, and to the surrounding areas. It is expected that this will comprise newspaper advertisements and staffed public displays, which will give interested residents the chance to give feedback on this significant project.</para>
<para>I have campaigned for several years—in fact, since before 2001—for the urgent need for a link road from Sunshine Motorway to the Maroochydore Central Business District. It has been a long, hard slog but the residents of Fisher can now almost see light at the end of the tunnel. With this project now having been discussed in various forms for at least a decade, some locals have suggested that the past years of high population growth in the area have caught up with the need and that the proposed road as a single lane each way as suggested might already be inadequate. I have to say that that is my personal view. However, I would also comment that Maroochy Boulevard is better late than never. I call on the state government to take those sensible concerns on board and if funds can be released I suggest that the road be made at least two lanes each way. I am pleased to be able to support the Maroochy Boulevard project so far and look forward to the day when the road will open up access into the Maroochydore Central Business District.</para>
<para>Mr Speaker, I suggest that you on occasions have been to the Sunshine Coast. You know what a wonderful area it is, and you know how important this new infrastructure is for our local community. What we need of course is to make sure that roads keep up with the population. I want to urge the state government to put a much better proportion of their funds into road improvements on the Sunshine Coast. The Sunshine Coast is close to Brisbane. Eighty per cent of people travelling to the Sunshine Coast do so by road. But we do need better investment from the state government. I am, however, pleased that Maroochy Boulevard is under way. It is a major step forward and it will dramatically improve the congestion in the Maroochydore Central Business District. It will make our area an even more desirable place in which to live. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I will continue my remarks on the feral animal problem confronting rural Australia. As I said, camels endanger our desert environment not only by the destruction of native trees but also by degrading areas with drinkable water which provide a refuge for native animals and plants. For pastoralists they also have a serious impact on the operation of our cattle stations. They cause major damage to fences and infrastructure such as cattle watering points and, unfortunately, camels are also potential carriers of tuberculosis and brucellosis.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The problem is that at the moment the current methods of control are largely ad hoc and have had little impact on overall camel populations. It is therefore the responsibility of the Commonwealth government, in association with state and territory governments, hopefully with the assistance of some well-focused recommendations of the report of the House Standing Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, to actually do something serious about reducing the number of feral camels that exist in Australia. Obviously control methods include shooting, trapping and fencing, but to date they have proven to be an absolute failure.</para>
<para>I therefore briefly refer in passing to the success of the donkey telemetry system for the control of feral donkeys in the east and west Pilbara, which was also brought before the committee during its trip to north-west Western Australia recently. This involves a ‘Judas animal’ being fitted with a radio transmitter. The collared animal seeks outs other donkeys in its home range. The collared animal is then tracked by helicopter and all donkeys found with a Judas animal are culled in the most humane and, dare I suggest, the only proper way to deal with this particular problem. Since the introduction of the Judas program in 1994, over 81,000 donkeys have been culled and 38 pastoral leases have been declared free of donkeys as a result of this program. The program has the advantage of enabling control and doing it properly.</para>

<para>—Last week the member for Greenway, who is in the chamber today, made a statement about how important transport issues are to the people of Western Sydney. She went on to praise the federal government’s spending on Westlink, the M7 project. The member for Greenway could not be more correct when she said the people of Western Sydney have transport at the forefront of their minds. In saying that, people are looking for action from this government on petrol prices. They are looking for more than praise of expenditure programs which are already under way. Efficient and effective infrastructure are part of the transport issues that the people of Western and south-western Sydney are concerned about, but that is not all they are concerned about.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The transport issue that sticks most in the minds of people in Western Sydney at the moment is petrol prices. While the Westlink project represents welcome investment in transport and economic capacity in the greater Western Sydney area, constituents of my electorate are screaming for relief from high petrol prices. Monday’s <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> reported that for people from south-west Sydney who work in the CBD it can cost up to $300 a week, not including parking, to get to and from work because of surging petrol prices. To most people it seems that this government does not have a clue about what to do about rising petrol prices. It does not seem to have a plan to provide any form of relief to motorists.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Labor have outlined a plan to provide relief to motorists. We know what the government can do to make things better. The opposition know that, in order to give motorists relief, action needs to be taken and taken now. The opposition have already released details of steps that would start addressing the problem of higher fuel costs. We know there is not one single solution to this problem, but we also know that something needs to be done. Australia needs to reduce its reliance on imported oil and develop its own liquid fuel market. We must provide a real future for biofuel industries and give consideration to the use of ethanol blended fuels. Competition should also be increased in the fuel industry, using it to achieve the lowest possible prices at petrol pumps. Instead of helping people in Western Sydney, the government is more interested in extending welfare to millionaires and pursuing its extreme industrial relations agenda. This government is out of touch. It needs to do something about high fuel prices now and not simply wait until the next election.</para>

<para>—Today I rise to mark the 60th anniversary of victory in the Pacific, and I also want to pay tribute to the amazing World War II veterans of Riverstone. Victory in the Pacific Day was a chance to celebrate the courage of the Australians who fought to secure our freedom. It was a chance to celebrate everything we hold dear in our community and our country. I spent VP Day with the Riverstone-Schofields RSL sub-branch. There we unveiled a plaque funded by the federal government as part of the Saluting Their Service program. We also honoured six very brave World War II veterans, and I wish to name them today. Eric Martin, Joe Counter, Gordon Martin, George Drayton, John Hazell and Bernie Abbott fought for the ultimate cause: the freedom of millions of Australians and, indeed, millions of people around the world.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Some of these veterans served in Papua New Guinea and one of them was held in a prisoner of war camp. These six gentlemen are unassuming—they do not seek praise or attention—and yet they are heroes to us all. John addressed a number of students during the ceremony. He spoke with honesty, integrity and a sense of humour. He spoke of his wish that a war like the one he witnessed never occur again. The many school students who were present responded with warmth and compassion to hearing stories that they had never heard before. It was indeed a very moving moment.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Between 1939 and 1945 nearly one million Australians like George, John, Eric, Gordon, Bernie and Joe served in uniform. To put it in perspective, that was one-fifth of Australia’s population at the time. Although Australians were stationed across the Middle East and throughout Europe, some of the most important work was done in the Pacific, notably in Papua New Guinea. The battle at Milne Bay saw the Australian Army achieve the first defeat on land of the Japanese Imperial Army. When Prime Minister Chifley announced the end of the war there was dancing in the streets of cities and towns all across Australia. Many of the women present at Monday’s meeting served in a munitions factory, having to leave their homes and travel interstate. They remember the celebration and dancing in the streets.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">On Monday I encouraged the people of Riverstone and Schofields to give thanks to the service men and women who fought to protect our very unique nation. In this nation we value friendship, family and community. We believe that life is a mixture of hard work, conviction and laughter. In his words to the Harrow School in England in 1941, Winston Churchill said:</para>

<para pgwide="yes">Do not let us speak of darker days ...

<para>—Last month I attended the AGM of Chelsea Red Cross—a great group of people doing some good work in Chelsea.  At the AGM, awards were made to two members for long service. Gwen Walker was awarded a medal for 20 years service.  Gwen is in her 80s and is still a very busy member of Chelsea Red Cross. She was Regional Chairman and Regional Secretary of area 8b, and she was Treasurer and Secretary of Rosebud Red Cross for some time. She is the Secretary of Chelsea Red Cross and has been for the last eight years. Gwen does emergency registration and emergency catering and does duty on the mobile blood bank when it visits Chelsea. George Brain was given a medal for 10 years service to the Red Cross. George sets up the tables for street stalls, sets up the tables and chairs for Red Cross functions and attends the fun auction. I am told that the Red Cross men do not like attending meetings but are always happy to support their wives. This is very true of George, who is generous with his time and muscle in support of his wife, Ann, and her work at the Red Cross. I congratulate and thank both Gwen and George for their contributions to our community.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I have had a rash of school principals in my electorate leaving or resigning recently, and I want to thank each of them for their contribution not only to their schools but also to education generally. Jenny Stuart left Aspendale Primary School after 14 years as principal and 37 years in education. Jenny was the longest serving principal Aspendale has had. She has a very strong commitment to the link she sees between a student’s welfare and academic achievement. Jenny has left behind a school proud of itself and its 80-year history and it is looking forward with enthusiasm to the future. Jenny was one of the first principals to ring me in outrage when the Prime Minister made his notorious comments about government schools being value free.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Anthony Levett has left St Patrick’s School in Mentone after eight years as principal there.  Anthony managed two building projects while he was there which have added enormously to the school. He refurbished the junior school, including a multipurpose room and a new resource centre including an IT room. Anthony got himself involved with all aspects of the school such as doing his bit at the school fete. Anthony has moved on to St Dominic’s in Camberwell. John Jackson has left Edithvale Primary School after four years as its principal. His colleagues describe John as a person who can and does do anything around the school and can cope with any emergency—with calmness. At the same time, John cares for his students, knows who they are and what they are up to. Finally, Lee Murnane has left Mordialloc Primary School after six years at the helm and is now at Brighton Beach Primary School. Lee is always aware of the importance of community and generous in his support by offering school facilities for community fund raising. Lee started an extensive building program at Mordialloc, which is due for completion later this year. I would like to put on record my thanks to each of these four principals for their work at their individual schools.</para>

My congratulations go to Brian Bensley and the team at the Seaford RSL and Ross Pulling and Len Streets at the Frankston RSL for their excellent arrangements on the day.</para>

<para pgwide="yes">The day was also an opportunity for Vietnam veterans to come together to mark the 39th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan, which actually falls tomorrow on 18 August. On that day in 1966 D Company of 6RAR was engaged in a ferocious action in a rubber plantation against the main body of the Vietcong regiment. The Vietcong regiment numbered at least 1,500 soldiers. Our soldiers were severely outnumbered more than 10 to one and the enemy attacked with mortars, rifle and machine gun fire. In torrential rain the Australians fought back with support of artillery fired from the Nui Dat base. Air support was called for but was unable to identify targets due to the difficult conditions. D Company held firm and, as support arrived, the enemy retreated as darkness descended. Morning revealed 245 Vietcong soldiers and 18 Australians had lost their lives, with 24 Australian soldiers wounded.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This brings me to last Sunday at the Frankston ceremony commemorating the Battle of Long Tan.

<para>—Today I would like to raise a matter on behalf of my constituent Mrs Sheila Cahill of north Rockhampton. Tragically, Mrs Cahill’s husband, Michael Cahill, went missing in Malaysia seven years ago. This week marks the seventh anniversary of his disappearance. Michael has been registered as a missing person for that period of time but has not been declared dead, and no death certificate has been issued. Mrs Cahill is in contact with Interpol, who call from time to time to check if there has been any contact from her husband but, sadly, she has not heard from him since his disappearance and she believes him to be dead.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">After seven years it is quite understandable that Mrs Cahill would like some closure. Apart from ending the emotional anguish of living in limbo, she would like to be able to take the practical steps that would allow her to move on with her life. Right now, that is very difficult because her house, bank accounts, and numerous other personal affairs are in both her name and that of her missing husband. So Mrs Cahill is unable to do anything until her husband, missing now for seven years, is officially declared dead. What a run-around that process is proving to be for my constituent.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The department of foreign affairs advised Mrs Cahill that the processes involved in having a person declared deceased are the responsibility of the relevant state or territory authority, and to contact the state coroner, suggesting that he may order a death certificate to be issued. However, the Queensland State Coroner’s office has written back to say that his jurisdiction to investigate the disappearance of a person in Malaysia is questionable. The state coroner did, however, obtain a report from the Federal Police, which stated in part:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Lengthy inquiries conducted by Interpol Canberra with the assistance of Interpol Kuala Lumpur and the Australian Federal Police overseas liaison officer attached to the Australian embassy in Kuala Lumpur have been unsuccessful in locating Mr Cahill. In February 1999 the AFP’s international liaison officer at Kuala Lumpur visited the Interpol Bureau in Malaysia and liaised directly with case officers in relation to the disappearance of Mr Cahill. They provided full access to their files and stated they had done everything possible to trace Mr Cahill.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">However, the state coroner’s advice to Mrs Cahill on this report was less than flattering to the procedures undertaken by the AFP. The state coroner states in his letter:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I am of the view that it is inadequate.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Mrs Cahill has had to live with this for seven years, and now finds that her life is yet again left on hold because it appears that the Federal Police have not been sufficiently thorough in either their investigations or their reporting of the conclusions reached in respect of Mr Cahill’s disappearance. Earlier this month I wrote to the Minister for Justice and Customs, Chris Ellison, as the minister responsible for the Federal Police, seeking an immediate and adequate investigation into Mrs Cahill’s missing husband. I trust that the minister will respond promptly to that request so that Mrs Cahill can finally put this matter to rest.</para>

<para>—Every so often one is privileged to know a person who is an outstanding individual and a role model for his fellow citizens. In the parliament today I would like to recognise the outstanding service of Mr John Frank Rourke of the Sunshine Coast. Mr Rourke has been very much involved in the dairying, livestock and rural real estate industries between 1949 and 1985, and particularly since he has been on the Sunshine Coast but even earlier in Victoria he has worked very hard on behalf of veterans and their dependants.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Mr Rourke’s service to the rural community began in 1946 after his discharge from operational service in the Royal Australian Air Force. He joined the RSL in 1949. His voluntary activities as an Agricultural Show Society arena and sheep shearing commentator at the Melbourne Royal Show, the Sydney Royal Show, the Royal Brisbane Show, the Royal Adelaide Show and in country towns has earned him honorary life membership of the Royal Agricultural Society Victoria and other agricultural societies.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I have got to know Mr Rourke very well, particularly since he has been on the Sunshine Coast working on behalf of the ex-service community. He was instrumental in establishing a regional office for Legacy in Maroochydore and held the position of secretary of the Sunshine Coast Legacy from 1990 to 1996. From 1994 to 1998 he was president of the Maroochydore RSL subbranch.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The RSL segment of a veteran’s funeral is a moving part of proceedings and Mr Rourke has delivered dedications on numerous occasions with honour and respect. Mr Rourke has taken part in local secondary school pre-Anzac Day celebrations and has been the representative of the Returned Services League at cadet services.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Mr Rourke has had a very interesting career in rural industry. When many people retire, that is exactly what they do. But, if anything, when Mr Rourke retired he became more and more active, and the list of recognitions that he has received is most impressive. The RSL has given him the RSL Meritorious Service Award for 25 years outstanding service, the RSL Service Award for 50 years service and RSL life membership for outstanding service. Mr Rourke is a remarkable individual. I greatly admire him. I am pleased to have this opportunity in the parliament to salute his service. If Australia had more Frank Rourkes then this wonderful country would be an even better place.</para>

<para>—I rise today to say a few words about a recent visit I made to France. I want to speak particularly about a location I visited in northern France that holds a special place in the history of our country, and that is the town of Fromelles. Fromelles is a small village in northern France not far from Lille. It is a place where in 1916 the Australian forces were first engaged in a heavy sense on the Western Front in what was, frankly, a disastrous battle but a battle which outlined the bravery and courage of our troops on the Western Front at that time and through to the end of that war in 1918.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The battle of Fromelles was a particularly devastating encounter. It went for just over a day. It involved very heavy casualties for the Australian troops and also for others. Places such as Fromelles still, so many years later, have memorial services. If you tell them you are an Australian you are always treated with a great deal of respect. The museum at Fromelles is a credit to those involved. It is an excellent little tribute to the war effort in that area and particularly to the diggers.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">A range of people have been dedicated to celebrating that effort over the years. I would particularly like to note my appreciation to Monsieur Martial Delebarre, the president of the ASBF, the Friends of the 15th Brigade, who was very helpful to me during the time I was there; Monsieur Hubert Huchette, the Mayor of Fromelles; and Monsieur Francis Delattre, the president of the local veterans’ affairs organisation. They made me most welcome. I was able to present a wreath at the Australian memorial and to inspect VC corner in the cemetery there. It is an unusual cemetery. It is the only cemetery where there are no individual gravestones. It is an entirely Australian cemetery, and it is a very moving place to visit.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There are also a range of investigations going on in the area about the potential for finding some additional Australian graves there. The hope is that, with an investigation at a location called Pheasant Wood on the outskirts of Fromelles, which I visited, they may well be able to discover additional places where a large number of diggers have been interred and this will lead to a proper burial and a proper recognition of their sacrifice. To all those involved, thank you very much for the support you gave me while I was over there. I would particularly like to recognise Charlotte Seillier, an eight-year-old girl who played the clarinet at the service I attended there. It was a moving occasion and to all those involved I offer my thanks and respect.</para>

<para>—I wish to give praise to the opening of the St Francis Xavier College on Friday, 5 August 2005. I had the privilege of opening this great new education facility in the electorate of La Trobe. The special guests of the day were Bishop Coffey, the Bishop of Sale; Father Hugh Brown, Chairperson of St Francis Xavier College board; Father Peter Slater, Vicar General, Parish Priest of St Michael’s, Berwick; Father John Allen, Parish Priest of Our Lady Help of Christians, Narre Warren; Father Thomas Karamakuzhiyl, Assistant Priest of Our Lady Help of Christians, Narre Warren; and, of course, the principal of the school, Mr Paul Desmond. There were other special guests there but I have confined my comments to the local ones. I would also like to acknowledge the great work of the school captains from the senior school, Tim McKay and Melanie Van Diemen—they did a fantastic job MCing the entire day. Also, thanks must go to the principal’s secretary, Mrs Leslie Lancaster, the business manager of the school, Dominic Langdon, and the head of campus, Malcolm Joseph. I would also like to acknowledge the singers and the band; they did a fantastic job on the day.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The opening of St Francis Xavier College is a very important addition to the educational services in La Trobe. St Francis Xavier will offer a new junior campus catering to years 7, 8 and 9 for approximately 900 students. It is great to see. The buildings consist of 12 general-purpose classrooms, a science room, art, drama, music, technology rooms, home economics, library, hall, and administration facilities. The grand total project cost was $14.6 million. I am very proud to say that the Howard government contributed $3.6 million.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The original campus was developed in Beaconsfield and, as a result of recent growth in the local community, the site now caters to years 10, 11 and 12 students in Berwick. As the south-eastern corridor continues to expand—we are actually part of the fastest growing corridor in Australia—all of these new educational facilities are absolutely fantastic for our area. The school will focus heavily on literacy standards, as emphasised by the Howard government. It is a drug-free school and it has excellent facilities. The students there are going to have a great future. I commend the staff and the parents for their professionalism. The opening was a great day. It was very professional and there was a fantastic service. It was a privilege and an honour for me to be there on the day.</para>

<para>—I am always keen to celebrate the success of the community in the Shortland electorate. At the moment, I have Phill Pallas, a social work student from the University of Newcastle, working in my office and he wrote the speech that I am presenting today. He is working closely with the youth sector in the Wyong shire to identify the recreational needs of young people living in the southern end of my electorate. With one of the fastest growing populations in our nation, the Wyong shire is popular for young families and families with teenagers. There are some 9,000 young people living in the northern part of the Wyong shire.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The issues affecting these young people are diverse and varied. They include mental health concerns, access to alternative education, job creation and family violence. Through consultation with local youth services and young people, we have identified that a major issue for young people is the availability of social and recreational activities in the area. One local youth service operates up to seven youth centres with four part-time workers. Often these centres are only open for a few hours per week. Whilst the youth workers are some of the best in their field, everyone would agree that it is a tough task to build positive rapport with the young people in the local community with such limited time and resources. What is required is more funding for youth services to be able to offer quality service provision for young people throughout Wyong shire.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Even more of an issue is access to the services that do exist to serve young people. There are many pockets of young people who are unable to access services, due to the deplorable state of our transport system, which is basically a private bus company that operates in the area. In one such place, Mannering Park, there is one bus in and one bus out of the suburb on the weekend. With no youth specific activities organised in these areas, young people are placed at an extreme disadvantage. Affordable frequent transport is required if we are to demonstrate to young people that they are a valuable part of our society. Despite the lack of services and transportation, there lies within the community a real strength to band together, to draw upon the assets they have and to move forward. There is an emerging generation of young people within the Wyong shire who are committed to positive contributions to the wider community. It is indeed sad to see the media focus on the small percentage of young people who seem to be doing the wrong thing and to see how it never promotes the strong movement of young people committed to building the community which makes our nation.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I am a big believer in giving honour where honour is due. It is a joy to see Wyong Shire Council receive a local government award for the second year in a row. That award this year was for the most innovative youth week program—a program in which 7,000 young people were involved. The youth development officer of Wyong Shire Council, Sarah Masters, is to be congratulated on her consistent and dedicated approach to her role. Young people are the future of Australia, with their creativity, enthusiasm and zeal for life. We must support and foster their many talents as they contribute to our nation. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I am very pleased to speak on this important motion. The debate opened with appropriate remarks from both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. It is appropriate that this House marks the end of the war in the Pacific. This is an opportunity for the generations who came after the generation who won World War II to say thank you. The Leader of the Opposition referred to the generation who won World War II as ‘Australia’s toughest’—something I certainly endorse. World War II was the only period in our history where our very existence as a nation was brought under threat. There is a historical debate about whether there was any real prospect of Australia being physically invaded. That debate will never be resolved. Historians on both sides have legitimate points of view, but I think this is largely hypothetical and irrelevant. There is no doubt that, if Great Britain had fallen, at that stage it would have been unsustainable for Australia to continue as a sovereign nation. The generation that won World War II can say, ‘I saved my country.’ There are not many people who can say that, but the one million Australians who served in our armed forces could say that and the 200,000 of those who are still with us still can say that. We should take every opportunity to say thank you to these people.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">A few months ago I was struck by how quickly generations can leave us. I was looking through pictures of the commemoration in Gallipoli in 1990 when former Prime Minister Hawke took a group of World War I veterans with him to celebrate and commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings. About 30 World War I veterans—heroes—accompanied Prime Minister Hawke, and it struck me that none of those gentlemen are with us any longer. That was only 15 years ago. It is very easy to think that World War II veterans will always be with us. Of course they will not. Their numbers thin every day. We should take every opportunity to thank them for their service and to thank them for saving our nation.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We took the opportunity in my electorate on Monday of thanking our veterans who served in World War II. I was honoured to present medallions marking the 60th anniversary of the end of the war to Ellen Ashcroft, David Barnett, Cecil Boland, Mark Bush, Gwen Chaumont, Thelma Daley, Anthony Ebejer, Dan Goadsby, Enid Harris, June Hudson, Samuel Hull, Doreen Hunns, Lesley McHenry, Hugh Morrison, William O’Connell, Sidney Payne, Clifford Reid, Raymond Sansome, Freda Scarboro, Colin Smith and George Winch. There are, of course, many other medallions to present in coming months, but those are the ones I presented on VP Day. I thank Fairfield RSL for hosting the ceremony in the evening and Fairfield council for hosting the ceremony in the morning.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is a time when we remember all those who served and those who made the ultimate sacrifice. We remember the names of people like Sir Roden Cutler and Keith Payne who won the nation’s highest military honour for acts of bravery that remain inspirational to this day, six decades after they occurred. We remember a similarly inspirational character in Weary Dunlop, and we remember all his mates and colleagues who served in the prisoner of war camps with stoicism and sometimes with humour—and with that showed they were better men than their captors.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We remember the thousands of heroes who did not win high honours but who made the highest sacrifice. I can think of no more eloquent exposition of the legacy of these heroes than that of former Prime Minister Keating, who on 11 November 1993 spoke at the interment of Australia’s unknown soldier. He said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">On all sides they were the heroes of that war; not the generals and the politicians but soldiers and sailors and nurses—those who taught us to endure hardship, to show courage, to be bold as well as resilient, to believe in ourselves, to stick together.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Unknown Australian Soldier whom we are interring today was one of those who, by his deeds, proved that real nobility and grandeur belongs not to empires and nations, but to the people on whom they, in the last resort, always depend.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Those remarks, of course, refer to World War I but the principles equally refer to World War II.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We remember some of the great battles in which Australians cemented their reputation as great warriors but, more importantly, as good men who would make the final sacrifice to help their mates. We remember Kokoda. The Japanese there were fanatical warriors; it was a campaign with colossal casualties. More Australians died in that campaign than any other. The average age of soldiers who died in that campaign was between 18 and 19, a very sobering thought. Between July and November 1942, 600 men were killed and over a thousand were wounded.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We should also take this opportunity to pay tribute to the natives of New Guinea who have been immortalised as the ‘fuzzy wuzzy angels’. I think that it is a matter of some regret that this nation has not formally recognised the efforts of the fuzzy wuzzy angels. I know this is a matter that the Hon. Charlie Lynn, a Liberal member of the New South Wales upper house, has been pursuing and I support him in that campaign. I believe that we as a nation should give recognition through a medal or some other form to those fuzzy wuzzy angels who are no longer with us. I once had the privilege of meeting one of them—funnily enough, at an AFL game which he was brought down to watch as part of the AFL’s tribute to the fuzzy wuzzy angels. I think that we can do better. This nation needs to pay tribute to the natives of New Guinea who saved so many Australians.</para>

<para>—I always take the opportunity to watch the AFL. We remember, of course, the Battle of the Coral Sea, fought between 5 and 8 May 1942. The Japanese hoped to attack Port Moresby, but they had to gain the advantage in the south-west Pacific first. This battle was an important boost to the morale of our allies around the world. It was the first significant victory of the Allies over the Japanese and, of course, it followed Pearl Harbour and the surrender of Singapore.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para pgwide="yes">We remember the Battle of Midway. Here our friend and ally, the United States, heavily outnumbered, won an amazing victory. This was a battle that the United States can be proud of. Australians, of course, played a vital role through naval signals and intelligence. It was a vital battle in heading off any potential invasion of Australia. We remember Milne Bay. This battle ended any chance of the Japanese taking Port Moresby. The Japanese landed on Milne Bay on 25 and 26 August 1942. Within 10 days the allies had turned them back.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">These battles, together with the Battle of the Beachheads and the Battle of Wau, represent the battle for Australia. On 5 September, Smithfield RSL in my electorate will be holding a commemoration of the Battle for Australia, which I hope to be present at, with the permission of my chief whip—parliament is sitting that day and I may be a couple of hours late for parliament. I hope to be present at Smithfield RSL to mark that important commemoration.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I want to make brief particular mention of the role of women in World War II. We often talk about our brave soldiers, as we should, but women played a vital role in securing our country through attachments to the services, the Women’s Land Army, the Red Cross, St John Ambulance and a whole range of other organisations, in often dangerous circumstances. They won the victory just as much as anyone else.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I have spoken about the brave service of Australian men and women; I also want to take a moment to talk about the political leadership of the Allies and the service provided to the cause of freedom by three men in particular. It has often been said that three of our greatest leaders were brought forward during the war. By universal acclamation, the greatest Prime Minister that Great Britain has ever had was Winston Churchill—that is certainly a remark that I endorse. He, as John Kennedy said, ‘mobilised the English language and sent it into war’. He certainly played a role in motivating the English people when it seemed that all was lost. He was a hero, and today we pay tribute to him. He also, of course, made mistakes, but at least he was trying to find strategic ways of beating the biggest threat to Western civilisation ever, when others were prepared to give up. From the other side of the world, we pay tribute to Winston Churchill.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Again, Franklin Delano Roosevelt is often regarded, with Washington and Lincoln, as being amongst the best presidents the United States has ever had. He showed great leadership, was a great motivating force and had a great strategic mind, and we are thankful that he was there to lead us at that stage in World War II.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Then there was our own John Joseph Curtin: in my mind, he was the greatest Prime Minister this nation has ever had. He warned that this crisis was coming and he was ignored. He felt very keenly the loss of any Australian serviceman. There are legendary stories of him walking at night around the gardens of the Lodge, less than a kilometre away, worrying about the deaths of Australian soldiers on the transports bringing them back to Australia. He has been criticised for that. I note that David Barnett wrote an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> a few months ago criticising him for that, saying he was a lesser man because he worried about the deaths of Australian soldiers.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">That is an argument I reject completely. He was a greater man for that. He took the tough decisions. They were not easy decisions: he knew he was risking Australian lives. He did it because he felt Australia was under attack, but he did not do it in a blase manner. He did not do it in a manner which indicated that he was relaxed about the loss of any life; he did it in a manner that shows he knew the value of human life, and he worried about his decisions. I think that made him a greater man. He was prepared to make those tough decisions but also prepared to worry so deeply and personally about the consequences.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">VP Day on 15 August represents an opportunity for Australia to remember and to give thanks, and that is what we do. As a parliament and a nation, we will remember them. Lest we forget.</para>

<para>—I welcome this opportunity to provide my support for the 60th anniversary of VP Day—the end of the war in the Pacific—on 15 August 2005 and, of course, my support for our wonderful World War II veterans, widows and families. More than one million Australians served in one form or another in the Second World War. That is a quite amazing figure when you consider that the population of Australia was estimated by the ABS at that time, in 1939, as just under seven million. Tragically, 40,000 Australians lost their lives and 30,000 were imprisoned as prisoners of war during the six long years of World War II. Those significant losses meant that almost every Australian family was in some way affected by the war.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I think it is very important on the 60th anniversary of VP Day to recognise both sacrifices of the young Australian men and women who lost their lives and also the lives and achievements of those returned soldiers who not only lived through the dark days of World War II but also rebuilt their lives and rebuilt Australia following the war. I would like to thank the Prime Minister and parliament for having suspended parliament on Monday, 15 August. Parliament was due to sit, and the suspension enabled all members and senators to return to their electorates or home states to participate in the presentation of medallions or in other events to commemorate the 60th anniversary of VP Day.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It was certainly my great honour to host a function at the Central Coast Leagues Club in Gosford for some 94 veterans and war widows and many of their children, grandchildren and other family members. There were around 300 people at that function, and it was a very moving experience for me. I was very honoured to have the opportunity to say thank you to the veterans in the speech I gave at that ceremony. I highlighted the fact that the presentation of the 60th anniversary medallions was, in some very small way, a way of saying thank you from the Australian parliament and, more importantly, the Australian community, as well as personally from me on behalf of the constituents of my electorate of Robertson. It was saying thank you for the effort that these men and women had made during World War II, for the sacrifices they had made, for the losses they had taken and, more importantly, for what they had done to rebuild their own lives and Australia.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">They are a very special generation. Most if not all of them are now aged over 80. I believe my electorate of Robertson has one of the highest populations of surviving World War II veterans anywhere in Australia. The Department of Veterans’ Affairs estimates that I have 1,700 World War II veterans in Robertson and I know there are a similar number in the neighbouring electorate of Dobell, so around 3,400 World War II veterans are living on the Central Coast of New South Wales. So it was very important that we had the opportunity to present these medallions.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As I said, some 94 veterans, as well as widows and families, turned up at this event. It was a very moving occasion for them, for me and for the other people who participated. It was very moving to see those very proud old men stand when their names were called to come forward. We had only one step for them to step up onto the stage; some of them needed assistance to do that, and we had TS <inline font-style="italic">Hawkesbury</inline> naval cadets there to give that assistance. Some of them could not even manage to come onto the platform so I came to them. You could see many of them had tears in their eyes. They said, ‘It is such an honour to receive this medallion.’ In return I was able to say to them: ‘No, it is a great honour and a great privilege for me to be able to present this medallion to you on behalf of the Australian people.’ Obviously it paled into insignificance compared to the war service medals that many of them were proudly wearing at the time.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I would like to thank very much a number of people involved in the organisation of this event. It was a very large event and it was important to the community and me that it ran smoothly. I would like to thank the board, management and staff of the Central Coast Leagues Club Pty Ltd for their hospitality and for providing the room and the venue for our ceremony free of charge. There was also a donation and floral tribute given by the Creighton, Palmdale, Greenway Group in support of this occasion. The senior students and players from the Sydney Conservatorium of Music travelled from Sydney to the Central Coast to provide music from the forties and fifties. That was certainly enjoyed by all who attended. I would like to thank Dr Rod Bain from the Gosford RSL sub-branch who contributed in a very significant way by arranging for the players from the Sydney Conservatorium of Music to attend and also the cadets from the TS <inline font-style="italic">Hawkesbury</inline> naval cadet unit. The fact that we had the naval cadets who were able to provide the flag party to come into the hall was certainly a highlight of the event. It was an inspiration to the people who were there, to the veterans and their families.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We hear a lot of negativity about young Australians but overall I believe that our younger generation are a fantastic generation. They will do our country proud as they grow into adulthood, and among the great examples of that are the young men and women who join our cadet units—our Army, Air Force and Navy cadets. I have known the cadets of the TS <inline font-style="italic">Hawkesbury</inline> for a very long time and back in about 1998, with the assistance of the then Minister Bronwyn Bishop, secured funding for the establishment of a new headquarters for TS <inline font-style="italic">Hawkesbury</inline>. I am very proud to be associated with that naval cadet unit. They are a wonderful group of young men and women and they did themselves proud by providing the flag party on the day and also supporting and assisting the veterans, widows and their families to come to the stage to have the medallions presented to them.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is a day of reflection. It is a day of commemoration. It means a great deal and different things to many people. Those people who were actually there at the time when we celebrated victory in the Pacific, when we celebrated the end of that terrible war, must have mixed emotions. I know when I speak to many of the veterans they do have mixed emotions. Of course, there is sadness when they remember the mates, the colleagues, the family members who were lost or injured in the conflict. Even now, as the years have gone by, many of the veterans are saddened by the loss of so many of their friends whom they had known for so many years. As the years go by, many more of them are passing on.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">So VP Day means different things to different people, but the one thing that it means to me is that, as someone from a younger generation, I try to pass on to those who are even younger than me, the kids and teenagers on the Central Coast, that we must never forget the sacrifices of those men and women not only in World War II but in all the major conflicts that Australia has been involved in. Without their struggle, without their sacrifice, we would not enjoy the freedom and privileges that we have in what is a wonderful country. The fact that we can stand in this parliament and we can debate and argue over issues that we believe are important and have our own views is a testament to the success of those men and women who fought in World War II for freedom.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Every day we should give thanks to those men and women because without their sacrifice we would not have the freedoms, we would not have the country that we have and we would not have the opportunities as we go into the future. I appreciate the opportunity to be able to put my comments on the record. Obviously, there are limited opportunities in the parliament for ministers to speak on electorate issues or issues of this nature, so I really appreciate the opportunity to provide these comments today. As I said, it was a very moving service and it was a great opportunity for me to say, on behalf of the constituents of Robertson, thank you to those very wonderful, proud men and women who served and fought in World War II.</para>

<para>—I am very pleased to be participating in this debate. The end of the Second World War obviously brought about a great change to the way in which we viewed ourselves as a nation, to the way we viewed our neighbours and to our relationships with other countries. Most importantly, the war once again demonstrated the resilience, commitment and sacrifice of young Australians, their ability to comprehend the moment and to seize their opportunity to ensure that this country would have a future which was based on the fundamental principles of democracy and freedom. That is what this war was all about.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">There is dispute and a live debate about whether or not the end of the Pacific war was necessarily immediately due to the dropping of the bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima. There is certainly debate about whether or not the dropping of those bombs and the killing of so many innocent civilians—hundreds of thousands of them died as a result of those two atomic explosions—was necessary to end the war. There is a live debate about whether or not the dropping of those bombs was as much about politics in terms of preventing the Soviet Union being involved in Japan as it was about getting the Emperor of Japan to declare an end to the war.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It was clear in the lead-up to those horrendous two days that conventional bombing was having almost as devastating an impact upon the Japanese civilian population as was eventually brought about by the use of these two nuclear weapons. I have to say that, for me, the end of the war symbolises a great change in the way in which the world viewed itself. We saw ourselves, as a result of those bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, entering a new era, one which continues today in the continuing debate about the issue of nuclear proliferation.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The end of the war brought about peace, but at huge cost. We in Australia lost 40,000 killed. And when you contemplate that almost 30,000 were held as prisoners of war, that is a huge number of people. There were a million people under arms out of a population of seven million.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I talked briefly about the attacks on civilian populations in Japan. Let there be no doubt about it, this war saw a real change in the way in which we treated each other, from the horrendous abuse of civilian populations by the Germans and the use of gas chambers to the very unheroic bombing of Dresden by the British and, I might say, the unheroic bombing of civilian populations by both sides during that war. I regard those as very sad things. While there will be people who rejoice and say that the bombing of Dresden was really important to bring the Germans to their knees and that the use of atomic weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was ultimately the catalyst that brought about the defeat of the Japanese, the human impact of those exercises should not be forgotten, just as the human impact of the war on this country—our nation—should not be forgotten.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I speak as someone who was not born, not even in the mind’s eye of my parents, at the time. But, like my grandfather and his brothers who served in the First World War, my father and his brothers served in the Second World War and my mother’s family served in the Second World War, fighting overseas for this nation. And they did so with the most heroic of motives. Those are the things that are important to me. Remember the impact of this war on civilian populations and the moral arguments about whether the carpet bombing of civilian populations in Germany and in England by the English and the Germans was appropriate. There was also the carpet bombing, effectively, of Japan by the United States and the attacks in China—the killing of hundreds of thousands of civilians by the Japanese. As human beings, we should all be very concerned. But that is what happened during this war.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Its end was a time of great joy and, for us allies, a time of great triumph. But I think it is lost on many Australians, especially the current generation, that this war had an immediate impact on this continent. From 19 February 1942, when 188 Japanese aircraft touched the Northern Territory coastline to bomb Darwin, until the end of the war, Darwin was bombed 64 times. Elsewhere in Northern Australia there were 37 other raids. In the course of those raids, 900 people lost their lives. Australia lost 77 aircraft and the Japanese lost 131.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I am sure that when you talk about the war to most kids, and even to people of our generation, very few know or understand how close we were to an occupation of this country. Very few know how our territorial integrity was abused by a foreign nation’s forces in an attempt to subjugate us—to horrify the bejesus out of us, to the point where there were midget submarines in Sydney Harbour. The war was very close. In the Top End, there were many people who would not normally have been part of this. My own town of Alice Springs, where I live, was integral to Australia’s war effort. It was a staging post for soldiers going up to the Top End. Towns along the way such as Larrimah and Katherine were extremely important to our war effort. We know that Darwin was a point of embarkation for some of the most heroic moments of Australia’s involvement in the Second World War.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Who will forget—many do not know but if they do know they should not forget—Z Force, Gull Force and the 2nd/2nd Commandos who embarked from Darwin in January and February 1942 to act as a guerrilla force in Timor? They lost very few people over a nine- or 10-month period and then were brought back. They were replaced by the 2nd/4th Commandos in November of that year. We know about this because that particular effort left a legacy with us: we were protected by the East Timorese, and it is to those people that we owe such a great debt. I am pleased to say this has partly been honoured, but we have a continuing obligation because of our historical relationship, brought about by the events of World War II.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">My father, as it happens, served with the 2nd/2nd Commandos, but not in Timor. He joined them after that and fought with them in New Guinea. I met these men over many years at their unit reunions—ordinary blokes, shearers, truck drivers, carpenters, office workers, painters and decorators.</para>

<para>—They are ordinary people who had ordinary lives before this cataclysmic event. And my friend is right: they performed extraordinary deeds for our welfare, and for that we should never forget. I add just one example. I have recently been reading the history of the Kokoda Trail, and I have to say I am dumbstruck by the efforts of Australian personnel on the Kokoda Trail and the way they rebutted the overland advance of the Japanese, the tragedies that befell them and the hardships they endured. I wonder whether we will really ever understand. I do not know about your experience, Mr Deputy Speaker, but my experience is that my father very rarely spoke about the war. But I know the horror has tormented him and I know it has tormented his comrades. The survivors of that unit meet regularly. They are hosted by the SAS in Perth. There is a grove of trees in Kings Park commemorating their performance in the war. They are a substantial Western Australian unit, although my father was from Victoria. They are just one example and there are many others.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para pgwide="yes">We had people going to war aged 15, 16 and 17—some even younger. They did not have to be conscripted; they volunteered to go away and fight for our freedom. I do not think that fact should be lost. Next week I and some others will be spending some time with and observing Norforce, a largely Indigenous unit working out of Darwin. The forerunner to Norforce was Donald Thomson and the Nackeroos. These people used horses and the land to look after Australia’s coastline during the Second World War. They are unsung heroes. They caught prisoners and saved pilots, but there they were, Indigenous Australians, working with the expertise of the military to provide a very important cog in our border protection. The history of Australia needs to be understood by young people. I was talking to some humanities people this morning. Why is it that this part of our history is not so solid in the minds of all of us? It ought to be.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Then there is the role of that Indigenous person on the Tiwi Islands who captured a Japanese person. He walked up to him and said, ‘Stick ‘em up all the same, Hopalong Cassidy,’ and took a prisoner. A moment of levity, yes, but we can take great joy in the celebration of the end of the Second World War, VP Day. However, there are those moments when you have to think about the moral dilemma that is created by the killing of civilians. We ought to celebrate the heroism, the commitment, the courage and the tragedy that confronted so many of us, but really we should celebrate the commitment of Australians to Australia. </para>

<para>—We are here today to talk about a most extraordinary generation, a group of people who in every way, shape and form in fact shaped the sort of Australia that we have today, and who certainly fought on the principles of freedom and democracy and sought to spread them to places that many of them, perhaps, had never found until they actually arrived there. People who were quite extraordinary in their deeds but very ordinary in their circumstances and background rose to every occasion with a very Australian sense of approach and spirit.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">This is not a tradition that is lost on the generation of today. As I look back on the VP commemorations that took place in my electorate of Moreton over the weekend, I think that there is an enormous understanding by everyday citizens, and particularly young citizens, about just how extraordinary these people were and how thankful we all should be as a nation. We should never take for granted for a moment that we can stand here and make the claim today that we are the sixth oldest continuous democracy in the world had it not been for the many generations of Australians who served this country in uniform in places well beyond our shores.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Unlike some of the other speakers, I am not talking about the generation of my own parents—they were youngsters. I am talking about my grandparents’ generation, my two grandfathers. Robert McKinnon served in the Middle East and Percy Hardgrave served in Horn Island and Charters Towers, providing support for the RAAF in their effort in Papua New Guinea, as the member for Lingiari mentioned. Neither of them talked very much about their time at war. In fact, my late grandfather Percy never sought the medals; he never saw a need to get them. I think there are something like 200,000 sets of medals still unclaimed in Australia today, many from that particular conflict.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I found out a few years ago that my great-grandfather, who had served at the Western Front—the battle of Polygon Wood of September 1917—and was severely hurt and psychologically traumatised by it, served again back here in Australia at barracks in Sydney after my great-grandmother coerced him to do something for their sons. He never claimed his Second World War medals either. And my grandfather Percy never wore his medals. He died about a week before the medals arrived in the mail.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I found others around who have similar stories to tell about their own grandparents or, indeed in many cases, great-grandparents. I found them on the weekend, including at the Moorooka Sports and Community Club where they hosted a fantastic bowls day—and it was a shout; they shouted. They organised some funds from us, as the Australian government, but they organised some funds from the local community as well. The Allen brothers’ butchery at Clifton Hill provided about 80 meat trays and everybody went home with a prize. It was a way of bringing the community together. It was a way of saying: ‘We are in Australia. Let us just value each other, but also let us not forget those who gave us the chance to have that kind of value applied.’</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It was the Vietnam veteran generation who ran the day over the weekend. It was the Vietnam veteran generation who paid particular homage—because of the leadership they bring to the RSL these days—to those who are now very old by comparison and very doddery, unfortunately, in a physical sense but very, very sharp about the memories, and those ranks are so thin.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Rob Lippiatt from Sunnybank RSL presided over a magnificent memorial service which brought together a variety of people, many of whom I grew up with. Bob Davis was the groundsman at Runcorn State School when I was there and I got the chance to present his medallion to him. This is a bloke I had a lot to do with when I was in years 6 and 7. He is a guy who had an extraordinary story to tell because of his involvement in the Second World War, but he went on and served the community in other ways. Jim Pringle—the Pringles were amongst the first teachers at my old high school, MacGregor high school—taught science and other subjects; he was a teacher of mine. I got to present him with a medallion. It was very humbling for me as a private person, who happens to hold a representative office in this country, to be able to say to people I grew up with, ‘Thank you.’</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Vi Thomas’s late husband, George, passed away many years ago but Mrs Thomas has been so involved with the RSL at Sunnybank. I grew up with her kids. She was there. She had received her medallion in the mail and did not want to make a fuss about the presentation, which is very typical of the generation that we are talking about in the motion before us today.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We saw Meg Arthurs OAM from the Red Cross there laying a floral tribute. The scouts and the guides with Judy Ellerington, MacGregor State School, Sunnybank High School, St Thomas More College and Eight Mile Plains State School, along with the Sunnybank and District Brass Band, presented a couple of very moving songs which brought tears to the eyes of heroes through their fine performances that day. I saw grown men proud and tall—in a lot of ways I guess the survivors were conscious of the mates that they had lost both through the attrition of the years and at the time of direct conflict in service—with tears in their eyes as they received medallions from me, just a mere inheritor of their service and of their sacrifice. I am afraid that I too had a few tears. It is not hard for any of us to think about people we know, because that conflict of all those years ago, like all conflicts, touched us in direct ways.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Wally Sefjack, who served with the American forces and came and lived in Australia and for many years, through Sunnybank RSL, helped and gave enormous currency and importance to the cadets, particularly the air cadets, passed away on 3 August, but his family was there to join in on what I know Wally himself would have liked to have been a part of. I last saw Wally on Anzac Day. We helped to wheel him up the ramp at the Sunnybank RSL, but to think that he just missed out on the 60th anniversary by a week or so.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">John Strachan OAM is the President of the Stephens RSL, and on Monday he brought together a lot of people, including Padre Roy Wakeling. Roy Wakeling is a Baptist minister. He was one of the Darwin defenders, and he wore a very proud badge that day that said he was one of the Darwin defenders. He has some of the service medals out of the Second World War, but not the full set. He missed out on active service by just a number of weeks, because he was in Darwin when things dropped. As the member for Lingiari reflected upon, hundreds of bombs were dropped on Darwin. Darwin was bombed more than Pearl Harbor was, but it is never really talked about because the government of the day—I guess rightly—kept it all a bit of a secret. Roy Wakeling continues to serve, providing spiritual help, and he is the honorary padre of Stephens RSL.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I listened to Nev Francis OAM, who was on Fraser Island on VP Day. He said, ‘I really did not do any of the running down the streets and jumping in front of trams like that famous fellow does in all the footage we see as we talk about VP Day. We were actually away from the celebrations and we still had work to do.’ Nev has gone on to work on Neighbourhood Watch and so many other community ventures. His sense of service has never declined as the years have gone on. Nev shared with us some of his reflections of that day.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Then there was Bill Moody MBE, MC, ED (retired). He won his Military Cross obviously for bravery. He said he was actually up on the Kokoda Track leading up to the declaration of peace, still defending the line. That is the way he tells the story. He tells of how there were days of uncertainty until the white flags came out. Until the word had actually been passed on that peace was now certain, none of them moved from their posts. That is the way he told the story, and I am not going to question the recollection he gave us the other day.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There were kids from Yeronga State High School and Rocklea State School. It is only a small school, but the kids were there. They were all paying tribute to these chaps, and rightly so. I think Australia has got better at saying thankyou to people who made a difference. I believe that it was the Australia Remembers year of 1995 which helped to redefine, and almost outed, the sacrifice that many of my grandparents’ generation kept to themselves. They did not really want to share or burden young blokes like me with all the information. Right from the time I could stand I was at Anzac Day marches. When I think back and look at the faces of people to whom I presented medallions over the weekend, I realise that there were so many people who served in so many ways who are part of the society which shaped who I am today. It just adds to the sacrifice and the service they gave during the war years.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The peace years and the way in which they built a great country is equally something that we should celebrate today. I look at the political leadership of this country, the many faces on both sides—people who were prisoners of war and people who fought with great gallantry, be they people like former prime ministers Gorton and Whitlam, be they people like Jim Killen, my predecessor, be they people like Sir William Knox and so many others who were part of my political party in Queensland for so many years—who came back, after facing all that they had during the Second World War, with a determination that they had an opportunity to now assert themselves and to shape a future for this country.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The many faces that make up the nation we have today are in themselves an often not spoken about testimony to the way Australian service personnel have served. Our cultural diversity reflects often where Australian service men and women have served. They saw people up close and personal in the defence of, or the promotion of, the ideals of freedom and democracy in their countries of birth, and that they have migrated to this country to be among those people is something that we should note in this discussion today.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">My large Taiwanese-born community have reflected to me that they were the ones who fought the Japanese first and that the armies of China were very much in a conflict during what they called the ‘Japanese war’. Just a week or two ago I was in China and Vietnam around the time leading up to the 60th anniversary of the dropping of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs, and there was a lot of talk about the ‘Japanese war’.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">World wars impact on each and every one of the people of the world. The traditions that we have today—and I hope we can maintain the focus on VP Day that we were able to build over the weekend—are built very much on the great service that others have given to this country to create the sort of nation we have. Our freedom and our democracy should never be taken for granted. Those who have served have delivered it to us, and it is right that we say thank you to them. I commend this motion to the chamber. Our constant tribute to these people will ensure that other generations that come on—the generation of my children and, in time, my children’s children—will prove that Australians will never forget. Lest we forget.</para>

<para>—In speaking in this debate I want to record my thanks and appreciation to all who contributed to the war effort in Australia, from those who went away from as early as 1939 to all who served overseas in the Middle East and Europe and to all who served closer to home in neighbouring countries, on the ground, on the sea, under the sea and in the air in the defence of our nation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I want to acknowledge too those who stayed at home and mobilised in support of those who went away. I know that it was a difficult period for many at home in the services who wanted desperately to get overseas, who wanted desperately to be there with their mates fighting the enemy. For many of course they were man-powered. For many the opportunity just did not arise where they could go overseas, but they were there, they were available and, had the opportunity arisen, they would have gone without a moment’s hesitation. I also want to acknowledge those who waited at home for news of their loved ones—the parents and the wives, particularly those who did not know whether their sons, daughters or spouses lived or died. These were indeed difficult years for Australia.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">My father was one who went away, leaving a wife and a baby daughter. I was born in 1946, an early member of the baby boomer generation. But my dad had been knocked around during the war, and I grew up seeing him suffer. I saw him fighting for health and battling the authorities at the repatriation department, and all of this time he was trying to run his own business. My mother, indeed the whole family, spent many a day and many a weekend visiting Dad at Hollywood hospital. One of the enduring memories of my young life is the sound of my mother’s high heels as she walked on the duckboard towards where Dad was in a ward with six or seven other people. It was a sound that I know my father used to wait for and listen to, just as the other blokes used to wait for that all-important visit, perhaps once or twice a week, when their wives or other loved ones would come down and see them.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The suffering lingered long after the war was over, not just for those who went but also for those who loved them, those who looked after them, those who nursed them and those who tried to understand what they had gone through. The wives who nursed their husbands in the way that they did, without thanks, for so many years, are some of the great heroes of our nation.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I also want to speak briefly of some of the heroes that I knew as I grew up, some of the people like Weary Dunlop. If ever there was a greater Australian, I would like to know who it was. Weary Dunlop was a man of immense courage. He was one of those who should have been back in Australia. Because of the blue between the then Prime Minister of Australia and Churchill, who wanted our deployed forces kept overseas—it was not until Curtin stepped in and overrode Churchill; he said, ‘I want these people back here to defend Australia’—for some of them it was too late; they were captured. We know the dreadful story of so many of our young boys and young women who were captured. We know the dreadful things that they suffered. But people like Weary Dunlop were great men—great men in difficult times. What a wonderful Australian he was.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Anyone who knows the story of Sister Vivian Bullwinkle would have to put her on the same pedestal that you would put Weary Dunlop on. What a wonderful woman. What a wonderfully brave, warm-hearted, kind, courageous woman Vivian Bullwinkle was. She ended up living in Western Australia and I saw her just a few days before she passed away. They are two Australians that I put up on a pedestal, and I think that every Australian—every young Australian—should learn their stories and learn the true story of leadership, courage and sacrifice.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I also want to touch on the story of Teddy Sheehan. We all know that, in the history of the Royal Australian Navy, not one of its members has ever been awarded a VC. What a dreadful oversight that is, and what a slight it is on the Australian Navy. You would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in those days captains of ships could not make direct recommendations for certain medals. There was an Englishperson allocated in Australia. All they could do was to get those recommendations and forward them to London. As a result of that, Teddy Sheehan is one who perhaps should have received the VC, but never did. He was a young man—I think of 18 or 19 years of age—who was in the water with his mates when the <inline font-style="italic">Armidale</inline> was sunk. They were strafed by Japanese planes. He went back to the ship, strapped himself into the gun and fired at the planes as they were strafing his mates in the water. Even as the <inline font-style="italic">Armidale</inline> sank beneath the seas, he was still at his post, still firing that gun, still trying to defend his mates. That is so typical of the bravery, the courage and the mateship of so many of those men and women both overseas and at home who were determined that Australia was never going to fall into Japanese hands.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I have been involved in the HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Sydney</inline> Foundation for a number of years. Although we have not been as active in the last 12 months or so as we were in the past, others have carried the fight on. I want to say that I am absolutely thrilled at the Prime Minister’s decision to allocate $1.3 million to the search for the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney</inline>. It is something that I and others have argued for for some time, on a very strong bipartisan basis. Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, you would be aware of the wonderful work that was done by the defence subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee. They held an inquiry and travelled across Australia. They listened to all sorts of arguments—some of them reasoned and some of them not so reasoned—put forward by people who have one thing in mind and that is to find the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney</inline>.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It may well be that when the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney</inline> is found, because of the nature of the ship, the depth of the water, where she might lie or how she might lie, she will never tell us the story of what actually happened. But what is incredibly important to me and to others is that we, as a nation, should never stop searching for the HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Sydney,</inline> because we have a spiritual duty to bring those men home. We do not know where the ship lies but we do know that she is within a certain area off Geraldton and Carnarvon on the coast of Western Australia. It is a massive task. I remember the book by Tom Frame, where he said it is not as if we are looking for a needle in a haystack; we have not yet found the haystack. So good luck to everyone who is involved in that search. I certainly hope that they find the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney</inline> and bring those men home spiritually. I compliment the Prime Minister and the government for that grant.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In closing, I want to refer to the VP Day celebrations in my own electorate. We organised a concert at one of my local high schools. It was a concert organised by me, our local RSLs—we only have two RSLs, one established and one still being formed—and all of our local high schools, bar one, and colleges. We invited some 140 veterans. Unfortunately, we were a bit limited in those whom we could get along but we invited them to Girrawheen Senior High School, which is fairly central in my electorate. Other schools and colleges, like Ballajura Community College, Warwick Senior High School, Morley Senior High School, Kingsway Christian College, Greenwood Senior High School, Woodvale Senior High School and Mercy College, sent young people along to perform a few items to entertain and pay their respects to these veterans, war widows and others who contributed to the war effort during the Second World War. I was absolutely overwhelmed by the quality of the performances that these young people put on. I was absolutely overwhelmed at their determination to entertain, honour and show respect to the people of that Second World War generation. They did a fantastic job and I am incredibly proud of those young people.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I would like to record my thanks to Milton Kirk, the President of the Wanneroo Joondalup branch of the RSL; Steve Francis and Dave Howe from that RSL, who worked with us; Scotty Alcorn from the newly forming Ballajura RSL; Aurilie Bergin from the EDA association, who works strenuously for her members; Wayne Austin, the deputy at the school; Bill Mann, the principal of the school, who, when I approached him about this idea, said, ‘Graham, we’ll do anything and everything we can to do it, to host it and to make sure it is a success’; and Liz Chambers, the teacher who looks after the hospitality class—young people from the hospitality class provided the lunch.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It was a wonderful day and I felt very proud to be Australian, very proud of the way these young people conducted themselves and very proud of my father’s and mother’s generation, who did so much to defend Australia and the principle of freedom and to enhance the character of Australia—the character of our nation—and who did so much collectively to ensure that following generations would know peace and not war and would be able to live and pursue their lives without the horror and suffering of the era they went through.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In closing, I would like to say that I have an immense regard for young people today. They do not get a lot of good publicity, but I think they have as much courage and character as any previous generation of Australians. Let us hope and pray that they are not called on to show that courage and character in foreign lands on foreign soils in foreign battles.</para>

<para>—American broadcaster Tom Brokaw referred to the World War II generation as ‘our greatest generation’. In Australia we can only echo similar comments. Almost a million Australians served in uniform during World War II, and you cannot have something like that happen without the whole ethos of selfless service being passed on to the community—and that is what we saw. When the war ended and this generation returned to civilian life, they took on leadership roles in their community. They ran the community organisations. Many ex-service men came into the parliament in 1949. They have taken that spirit of selfless service and they have been running our voluntary organisations and community groups for so long.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">They served in the Army, the Air Force and the Royal Australian Navy, and they were attached to the Royal Air Force in the United Kingdom. There were women serving in the auxiliary and the merchant navy. Going to the Anzac Day march this year really gave me a sense of what it meant for an entire generation to be involved in this effort for six years. All I can say is how much I really honour those who served during the Second World War and how much I respect their service, their commitment and the way they gave up what they were doing in their own lives to give something to their country.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Like many other members, I have been to a number of functions for Victory in the Pacific Day. There were two that really struck me as being very far sighted. One was the dinner I went to with the Pioneers Battalion. There were four Pioneers Battalions during the Second World War—one for each of our divisions. Allan Olson and Bill Thiele asked each of the World War II veterans attending the dinner to organise a table and bring their children, their grandchildren and some close friends. They have really fostered an understanding amongst these families of what their grandparents and parents went through. I also went to a lunch with the Ex-POW Association. Len Croxton, president of that association, Ron Zwar, its secretary and Bill Schmidt, a former president of the association, have built a memorial at an Adelaide school. They hold annual services there on 15 August and on 11 November and they spend a lot of time talking to the students about what it was like to be a prisoner of war.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I have three messages for young Australians. Firstly, take the opportunity to go to an Anzac Day march. Secondly, learn as much about your family history as you can. Speak to your grandparents; speak to your great-grandparents, if they are still alive. Thirdly, take the opportunity to visit the Australian War Memorial, or at least visit the War Memorial’s web site. As the member for Boothby and a member of parliament, it has been one of my great privileges to meet many people from this generation. I think of Lew Francis, who was in the 2/10 Australian Infantry Battalion that served in New Guinea and Borneo. I think of John Mathwin, a former state MP who was a veteran of the landings at Normandy. I think of Bernie Belfrage, who served with the Royal Australian Air Force. I think of Charles Hurl, a great supporter and one of my first campaign managers, who flew Lancaster bombers during the war. Sadly, they have all passed on.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I also think of current leaders of veterans groups in my electorate. I think of Ralph Aston, who was also part of the Empire Air Training Scheme. He does a very effective job of running the Mitcham RAAF Association. I think of Allan Olson, who runs the Pioneers Battalion Association. I think of Colin Hetzel, who served with the Australian Army and who is a former vice president of the state branch of the RSL. I think of Iris Crawford, one of my volunteers, who served in the women’s auxiliary. And I think of a great friend of mine and a former member of federal parliament, Jim Forbes, who won the Military Cross in Bougainville.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The war in the Pacific started later than the war in Europe. We had the sinking of HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Sydney</inline> in November 1941 and then the campaign in Malaya and Singapore, which saw most of the 8th Division captured. We had the Battle of the Java Sea, which the previous speaker mentioned. This is, to my knowledge, the largest naval battle the Royal Australian Navy has been in. We were there with American, British, Dutch and Australian ships. HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Perth</inline> was there; it was sunk and many of the survivors ended up as prisoners of war. We had the battle for Java. The ship, the <inline font-style="italic">Orcades</inline>, with the 2/3 Machine Gun Battalion and the 2/2 Pioneers, parts of the Black Force, landed in Java. They fought effectively in Java, but were captured in March 1942. We remember the veterans of Kokoda in New Guinea. What they did was simply magnificent. As previous speakers have said, and as Slim remarked in his memoirs, it was the first time that the Japanese were stopped on land. In Borneo, the Australians were involved in the landings at Balikpapan and Tarakan.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Of course, in this motion we remember those who were prisoners of war of the Japanese. I commend to other members many of the books that have been published recently: <inline font-style="italic">Hellfire</inline> by Cameron Forbes, <inline font-style="italic">One Fourteenth of an Elephant</inline>, by Ian Denys Peek and <inline font-style="italic">A Doctor’s War</inline> by Dr Rowley Richards. But one of the best books ever written about this is by Rohan Rivett. It came out a couple of months after he returned from being a prisoner of war. It is called <inline font-style="italic">Behind Bamboo</inline>.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In speaking on this motion, I would like to focus on two specific parts of the Second World War. Firstly, I would like to speak about the No. 1 Squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force. This was the first squadron to go overseas. They went overseas in July 1940 and were based at Sembawang in Singapore. They were later transferred up to Kota Bharu, which was the northern airfield in Malaya. This squadron was the first to sight the Japanese convoy heading towards landings in what were then Siam and Malaya, and it was also the first in action against the Japanese.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As everyone will remember, the Japanese coordinated attacks right across the Pacific. No. 1 Squadron, which was a reconnaissance bomber squadron, was in action against the Japanese one hour and 20 minutes before the attack on Pearl Harbour. They later went back to Sembawang in Singapore. Before the fall of Singapore they went to an airfield in Sumatra, and they ended up at airfields in Java. In March 1942 the No. 1 Squadron was asked to return to Australia. They were going to return to Australia by flying boat. The flying boats were from Broome, and they were destroyed in Japanese attacks. Members of No. 1 Squadron remained in Java, were captured and spent time as prisoners of war in Batavia, in Burma and in Thailand.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Keith Neighbour, a constituent of mine, was a pilot and a member of that squadron. So was my grandfather. When we remember this, 60 years after the end of the war in the Pacific, we should remember that 60 years ago my grandmother still did not know whether my grandfather was alive. She got a message in September that he had been reported safe in Siam on 19 August, and he did arrive back in Adelaide on 6 October 1945.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The second part of the Second World War that I want to talk about is the battle of El Alamein. In talking about the 9th Division, I am indebted to Mark Johnston’s book, <inline font-style="italic">That Magnificent 9th</inline>. El Alamein was one of the turning points of the war in the west. Churchill once said that we never won any battles before it and we never lost any after it. It went from 23 October to 4 November 1942. Australians were involved in the capture of a landmark called Trig 29. That involved incredibly intense fighting. After a week of holding the position, the 2nd/24th had only 80 soldiers who were able to walk out and the 2nd/48th had only 41 still standing after that battle. On Saturday night I was privileged to meet one of those individuals who walked out. On 31 October and 1 November there were ferocious attacks by Rommel’s best troops. There was an area called ‘the Saucer’ which was defended by the 24th Brigade. The 24th Brigade suffered 500 casualties from 30 October to 2 November. Mark Johnston, in a speech at the Australian War Memorial, said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">With victory in sight, Brigadier Arthur Godfrey was holding a conference when a shell scored a direct hit on the dugout, mortally wounding him and killing three other officers.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">One of those officers was my wife’s great-uncle, Captain Keith Bishop of the brigade’s staff.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I have mentioned some of the people it has been my privilege to know who were part of this generation and some of their stories, just to show how widespread the impact still is, 60 years on. In closing, I would like to utter the words which have appeared on memorials including the memorial to Weary Dunlop: ‘When you go home, tell them of us and say: “For your tomorrow, we gave our today.”’</para>

</talker>
<para>—I rise to endorse the Prime Minister’s motion, which was seconded by the Leader of the Opposition, regarding the 60th anniversary of the end of the war in the Pacific. Over the past few days, as Australia recalls that national sense of elation which followed the end of hostilities in the Pacific 60 years ago, some of us may well have been confronted by what we have heard. On radio, on television and in the newspapers, Australian men and women with first-hand recollections of those times have frequently used phrases and words which assault modern Australian sensibilities. Words went off like 303s in the air—racial tags and horrific stories; words such as ‘nips’ and descriptions of the enemy as much less than human. To the average Australian of 2005, these words come pretty close to what we would now call racial vilification. If we dared use this language today to describe the nature and actions of an enemy, the radio chatback waves would be awash with indignation and demands for public apologies. But I have to say that these words and stories serve to remind us how different our world is now and how utterly unthinkable it is for Australia to be, yet again, facing a real and present danger of being occupied by a foreign force and potentially placed under a cruel and violent military regime.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">To those people recalling their first-hand memories in recent days, these words, terms and phrases were and are profoundly real. One of the aspects that we inheritors of the hard-won peace have difficulty remembering is that, to the men and women of Australia in the 1940s, war was not a vague concept fought somewhere else by someone else. It was not about other people’s sons and daughters dying for any ill-defined objective. These were Australians fighting for their homeland in an extremely real and literal sense. Australia had been attacked and was under threat of imminent invasion. In 1942, the darkest days of the war, we knew the enemy had crossed the vast seas and was now at our gates. Indeed, he had been detected inside our nation’s fortress. We know that plans had been drawn up to try to maintain an Australian enclave in the south-east of an otherwise Japanese controlled continent. It was and will always be a defining moment for Australia. The reality and proximity of the threat to our existence was felt in every Australian city, town and home.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Even in my home town of Bendigo, there was an almost personal fear of what might be about to happen. You could be forgiven for thinking that people in a country city hundreds of kilometres from the coast and thousands of kilometres from the bombed port of Darwin might feel a little remote from the conflict, but that was not the case. You can read newspaper reports of the day about schoolchildren being taught how to dig antistrafing trenches in Rosalind Park in the centre of Bendigo. Schoolchildren were being trained in how to protect themselves from attacking enemy aircraft. You begin to see just how real this was to everyone.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Bendigo’s sense of the nearness of war was amplified by the many hundreds of men and women who worked around the clock in the great Bendigo ordnance factory, pumping out the tools to try and equip our defenders. There are reports of chalk messages being scrawled onto the weapons and armaments coming out of the Bendigo factory, addressed to the unknown soldiers who would rely on them for their very survival and even to the more anonymous soldiers who would be their intended victims. If you talk to the locals who experienced first-hand the local aspects of the time, you cannot help but be overwhelmed by the way the war in the Pacific reached out to every corner of life. Air-raid sirens were installed, blackouts practised and so many normal activities of a country town cancelled. Manpower was scarce as more and more Bendigonians joined the battle for Australia.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The war was brought home to Bendigo in another equally shocking way. While the people of the city hosted visiting US soldiers as valiant defenders, there came with it a price. A Bendigo woman, Pauline Thompson, was one of the three victims of the notorious US Army’s Edward Joseph Leonski, who was later hanged for his awful crimes. It must have seemed as though the world was spinning off its axis.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">But from there we move to 1945 and the realisation that a fierce enemy had been defeated. The surrender aboard the USS <inline font-style="italic">Missouri</inline> was felt in a real and personal way by all Australians. There is a delightful report in Bendigo of a city gone mad with delight: endless scenes of raucous celebrations in the street, of cars full of people zipping around and around the city—with suddenly procured petrol, of course—towing great lines of kerosene tins to add to the din. Bonfires were started and the city voted itself a day off. An estimated 10,000 people attended a thanksgiving service in Rosalind Park—the same park where, three years before, children had dug defensive trenches—and, while celebrating a great victory, there began the official mourning for so many lost in so many unknown places.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I was particularly affected by the situation of George Morgan, of St Andrews Avenue, who went to Melbourne to accept the George Cross not for himself but for his brave son, Lieutenant RG Morgan. He had been one of that selected and vital band of men who had set up communications in villages in the islands ahead of the Japanese advance. He had been sent to the Gilbert and Ellice Islands to report on the Japanese and, when all other Europeans were secretly evacuated, he opted to stay. He was killed at Tarawa in 1942.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The end of the war in the Pacific, 60 years ago, was just the start of a new way for the world. It was the start of the new Japan, which rammed home two words down the throats of its military: ‘Never again.’ It was the start of the new world in which Japan quickly learned the benefits of technology, democracy and trade. After the party ended on VP Day, many knew that the daunting task of reconstruction was just about to begin at all levels in our home towns, states, across the nation and, indeed, across the world. This was clearly understood then. For example, there is a report of the thanksgiving service at St Paul’s Cathedral in Bendigo when Canon Pickford warned that many thousands of Australian troops, civil servants, teachers and aid workers would have to live a lifetime in Germany, other parts of Europe and Japan to help build a world we could all live in.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I often wonder, as I think do many others, what sort of place we would be in now if the loss of 40,000 Australian lives, the imprisoning of 22,000 more and the sacrifices of millions had not achieved peace in the Pacific in 1945. It is as unthinkable now as it probably was then. I also sometimes wonder what character the Australian people would have adopted for themselves if the world had found diplomatic solutions to the issues which led to the world wars of the 20th century. Some of the battles can be seen in terms of the failure of diplomacy, but I am not sure if that could ever be said of the war in the Pacific. Was there a point at which our politicians of the time could have resolved the conflict before the killing began? I do not know, but we can never retreat from a democratic philosophy which regards war as the ultimate failure to find solutions. We must learn from the past.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">On the 60th anniversary of VP Day, we say to those men and women of earlier generations and to those serving presently that we did learn something: we learnt to value freedom, democracy, the Australian way of life and our place on this planet and to understand that the things we could so easily take for granted were won with blood, sweat and tears. This was the first time that global warfare reached our shores and threatened our homes and, hopefully, it will be the only time. We responded to the threat in a way which even our former foe now says was magnificent.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Even in the most terrifying situations there are always lighter moments. I am indebted to Mr Jack King of Kangaroo Flat who provided me with a book entitled <inline font-style="italic">It Had to BU</inline> compiled by James H Harding. It is the life story of the RAAF 80th Squadron of Kittyhawks on duty in the Pacific islands during World War II. Also I am reminded, as a result of a passage in this book, about the Australian servicemen’s ingenuity and some of the completely amazing feats that they performed. There is no greater evidence of ingenuity, when it comes to keeping beer cold, than from the Australian serviceperson. As you would imagine in the Pacific islands, refrigeration was virtually non-existent or very limited. You would be aware of the long military socks that servicepeople were issued with at the time. They put the bottles of beer issued in their rations—we call them longnecks these days—into a sock, tied the sock with the beer bottle in it to a tree, suspended a small container of aviation fuel above it, which would drip down onto the sock, and the evaporative chemistry would then cool the beer down to a drinkable temperature. Of course, we can only shudder to think what would have happened if that base had come under attack—the tree would have exploded and so would the beer.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I would like to conclude by reading a passage from the book, which illustrates some of the other lighter moments that could have been a tragedy in those times. The passage relates to a Kittyhawk pilot who was undertaking a strafing mission or operation during that time. His name was John ‘Shorty’ Carroll. I quote:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">John pressed home his attack too low, pulled up but was below the trees. He saw an opening ahead of him so flew into it. It turned out to be a road and he flew along it with the jungle forming a roof overhead. After about 300 yards, he thought “this is stupid” so pulled up through the canopy. Circling above, we thought he had bought it, but where are the flames, then his plane burst out through the trees! Somebody gave vent to an expletive but nothing else was said. At debriefing, still nothing was said, but when an armourer brought in a small branch which he had found in a gun barrel, everybody roared laughing.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">So there were lighter moments. I guess all that remains now, in conclusion, is for us to say that we will never forget and to give our thanks.</para>

</talker>
<para>—It is a pleasure to speak on the Prime Minister’s motion remembering VP Day. When I sat down with local RSL presidents six or eight weeks ago and asked them how they would like to commemorate VP Day in the electorate of Casey the four of them said that they wanted to have a function that involved their RSL representatives but also local schoolchildren. They wanted to pass on the message of service and sacrifice to the next generation to ensure that the deeds and the contribution of their generation and what those who had lost their lives sacrificed would go on in the minds of the next generation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">So on Monday that is exactly what we did in a function co-hosted with the RSLs and the Shire of Yarra Ranges. A function was held in Lilydale with representatives of 28 schools and we heard moving reflections from a local historian, Mr Anthony McAleer, from a local veteran from the Croydon RSL, Bill Lipscombe, and from two family members who gave a perspective on what it was like waiting for the return of their loved ones—from Cath Hill and from Sylvia Morse, both from Lilydale. We also heard from the Mayor of the Shire of the Yarra Ranges, David Hodgett, and from Bob Richardson from the Lilydale RSL. The four RSL presidents from Croydon, Lilydale, Monbulk and Mount Evelyn presented each of the students with a commemorative plaque and a native sapling that will stay in each of those schools as a lasting reminder of World War II and VP Day.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I particularly thank Ron Buisman from Lilydale Trophies and Engraving Services, who produced the plaques and did so in a short space of time, and Len Cox from Correa Nursery in Montrose for providing the native saplings. I thank all of the RSL presidents—John Surridge from Monbulk, Ken Gibbons from Croydon, Bill Sibley from Mount Evelyn and particularly Bob Richardson from the Lilydale RSL, who worked tirelessly to bring about the event on Monday and to make it the success it was. I also thank all of the school students, the principals, the teachers and the parents who came along and made the day the success it was.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It was a time to look back on the local contribution from Lilydale, Croydon, Mount Evelyn and the entire Casey electorate and to remember the fact that local communities paid an incredible price and made an incredible sacrifice as part of our national contribution to the Second World War. Anthony McAleer, the local historian, spoke in great detail of what Lilydale—still very much a country town but one that has grown—was like at the start of the war, through the war, and on VP Day in 1945 when news that the war was over reached the town. He spoke of the celebrations that occurred in Lilydale and in Croydon in the main street. Those celebrations are very particular to those local towns in some ways but really just reflective of what would have happened across Australia 60 years ago in the streets of every town, be it in the electorate of Casey or in my colleague’s electorate of McPherson, where local communities united as part of a national story.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">And what a national story it was that we look back on! Sixty years ago Australia emerged from its greatest and longest conflict. Australians fought World War II from beginning to end to defend Australia, to defend our allies and to defend our free way of life. Through this motion, as we remember the end of that war 60 years ago, we rightly reflect on a truly special generation of Australians. We remember of course those brave Australians who gave their lives. We remember them first. We remember and thank those Australians who fought in the war and returned safely. As previous speakers, including the member for Bendigo, have done, we remember those who fought on the home front ensuring that our troops overseas had all the supplies they needed and keeping our economy going so that we could fight the war and win.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We thank both of those groups not just for everything they did during the war but, as the member for Boothby said, for everything they did after the war as well—for rebuilding Australia and for setting it on the path to success and opportunity that we all enjoy today and see 60 years on.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is often rightly said that the diggers of 1939 to 1945 were very much like the Anzacs of World War I. There is a lot of truth in that. In many ways, they were. They went to war to defend the same principles. Like the first Anzacs, their character comprised courage, valour, selflessness, sacrifice and so much more. And like them, as previous speakers have referred to, they displayed that same unstinting mateship that has been part of our defence forces from day one. They also displayed that quintessential Australian ingenuity as they went about their duties—an ingenuity that was first on display in bucket loads on the shores of Gallipoli.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">What is not so often recognised is that the diggers of 1939 to 1945 were in many ways different from the original Anzacs. It is these differences that make them special in our history—differences that make their feats and their service something that was a first for Australia. Unlike the original Anzacs, they went to war in 1939 and through the early 1940s with no illusions about war. They did not go to war wondering what it was like. Those who fought in the Second World War knew exactly what they were getting into. Those who fought in the Second World War had grown up knowing that fathers, uncles, brothers and family friends had been killed or maimed in the First World War. The diggers of World War II did not leave our shores with the romanticism the first Anzacs had. They did not leave with any innocent curiosity. They left knowing that war was not an adventure. They knew that it was a costly, awful and bloody business.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Many of the first Anzacs sailed from our shores with a tragic underestimation of what lay ahead in foreign lands, but the diggers of World War II left our shores with a tragic and stoic knowledge of precisely what lay ahead. The debt we owe all of those who served in that conflict—a massive conflict that reached our shores and was fought in our region as well as across the globe—can never be repaid. The contribution of those people has provided much to our nation and to other nations as well.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Like the first Anzacs, those who fought in the conflict and who paid the ultimate sacrifice and gave their lives may have thought—they certainly would have hoped—that they were fighting a war that would end all wars. They would be sad to know that that was not the case. They would be sad to know that there have been other conflicts and that the challenges to democracy, freedom and our way of life always continue in one form or another. But we can be sure that they would be humble that Australia has remembered them in the way it has this last week and that we are recognising them in the way we are in this parliament.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">They would be proud to know that the principles that they fought and died for have been defended by brave servicemen and servicewomen of Australia in other conflicts. They would be relieved that the Australia they grew up in and loved and defended is today still a free and democratic country of opportunity. They would be amazed at the progress Australia has made in the past 60 years. But I think they would also be particularly proud that the nations of Germany and Japan and Italy, nations whom we fought against in the Second World War, are today also nations of freedom and democracy. To them, I think that would be confirmation that their gallant efforts did not just defend our way of life but spread opportunities and freedoms and the principles and values of democratic societies into other nations around the world so that the people of those nations today can have opportunities that did not exist 60 and 65 years ago.</para>

<para>—We are here today to consider VP Day and the experience that we have had over recent days commemorating and remembering the sacrifices that so many made so many years ago. It has been a time that I have found most rewarding as a member of parliament, actually getting out into the electorate and meeting veterans and their families and hearing about what life was like 60 years ago, the circumstances of struggle and sacrifice, some of the terrible memories but also some of the good times that were had. It was a time well before I was born, but it was a time which was crucial in determining the type of world we have today. There is no doubt that many of the freedoms we now enjoy and the circumstances we now have as a nation date back to that time and to what so many did to ensure that the modern world was able to develop in the manner in which it has. As earlier as speakers have said, even though we now face plenty of problems, with threats and challenges that people 60 years ago would never have thought could occur, the fact is that the challenges then were challenges that were immediate, that were very definite and that went to the very fabric and fibre of life at that time.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I would like to go through some statistics about Australia’s part in that war effort. They are statistics which highlight the massive commitment of Australians and of Australia as a nation, both in humanity and resources, at the time of the Second World War. I will also give some comparisons of costs to highlight different aspects. In defence expenditure, the Second World War cost Australia just over £2 billion, as against expenditure in the First World War of some £188 million. We all know in comparing pounds of those days with dollars today that that is a massive explosion of resources required and spent.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The figures which bring home the nature and size of the two world wars as tragedies are those for casualties. Battle related deaths in the Second World War were 19,235 versus 53,993 in the First World War. The figures I found fascinating were for non-battle deaths, which were 20,194 in the Second World War versus 7,727 in the First World War. The figures for wounded in action were: 23,477 in the Second World War versus 137,000 in the First World War. Thankfully, in the Second World War we did not have ‘gassed’ as a casualty figure to deal with. But the number of prisoners of war was 28,756 in the Second World War versus 3,647 in the First World War and the number of prisoner of war deaths was only 109 in the First World War but 8,031 in the Second. And when we consider where Australians fought overseas and of the experiences many of them had as prisoners of war in places like Sandakan and Hellfire Pass, we get some idea of the nature of the tragedy.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">One of the things I found fascinating in the VP Day functions in my electorate and through some of the work done on oral history was finding out from individuals their experience. I found that a particularly moving aspect of the proceedings and certainly a great way to get a better personal understanding of what people went through.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">On Sunday, I had the privilege of attending an ecumenical church service at St Andrew’s in Canberra. It was one of the most moving church services I have been to. Three special guests focused on different aspects in memory of VP Day. One was a gentleman, a veteran, who had fought in the Middle East, in New Guinea and in the islands. He told of his experience and related some particularly touching stories regarding the circumstances around the time of VP Day when, effectively, hostilities had ceased but guns were still being fired and people were still being killed. He told a very moving story of a young man, a recent reinforcement who had been very keen to do his duty and play his part, who was killed at Tarakan after the effective end of hostilities and became another casualty at a time when it was hoped tragedies had ended. Another lady, a daughter of a veteran, told stories about what it was like at home, the circumstances faced by families while breadwinners were serving elsewhere in the country or overseas in the military. She told of pitching in with economic activities and work, of rationing and of the psychological pain and suffering which those at home went through while waiting to find out what had happened to their loved ones. She told of the relief and joy when eventually the Japanese surrender went ahead and how, for many people, the realisation that loved ones would not be coming home meant that the nature of that struggle and sacrifice would live with them forever and a day.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Probably the most moving story was that of the sister of a serving airman who died over Europe as a crew member of a Lancaster bomber. This young man had written a letter to be sent to his family on the event of his death and it was duly passed on as part of his personal effects. This lady read from that letter and showed an enormous amount of poise and dignity in doing so. The letter was a phenomenal piece of writing from an obviously very gifted 20-year-old, who would have had an incredible life in front of him had he the opportunity to live it. It was a letter of simplicity and clarity which went through the reasons he was there, why he felt the need to be there and why he was content to do what he believed needed to be done. He said it was a cause worth fighting for and spoke of the camaraderie and positive aspects he found in his Air Force service. He recognised the likelihood that it would end in his death and stated that, although he knew they would grieve, he wanted his family to know that he felt what he was doing was worth while. It was a very touching moment and really did go to the essence of the sacrifice of so many—those who died, those who were wounded and those who came back.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">That letter encapsulated the necessary nature of that conflict—the fact that the forces that had to be opposed in that war really had to be dealt with and the fact that many ordinary Australians as well as many ordinary men and women from the allied countries recognised that and were prepared to step forward into the breach to do what had to be done.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Sixty years later it is important that we do remember that. We still have a lot of World War II veterans out there, but as they grow older, as each significant anniversary passes, there will be fewer of them around. It was great to present commemorative medallions to quite a number of veterans in my electorate on Monday. It was just great to see them get up when they could—and sometimes they could not—stepping forward, shaking their hands and thanking them for what they did. And war widows need to be remembered. They suffered for a long time, given the sacrifice they and their husbands made. Theirs was a very special penalty.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It was not just men who served but also women. Our Army nurses particularly ought to be remembered as doing a great job in difficult circumstances, having themselves been casualties. The valour displayed by Australian forces in so many locations throughout the Pacific, Europe, including Crete, and the Middle East highlights the tremendous effort undertaken by so many on behalf of the great cause of democracy. I am sure many of them, when looking at world events over the last 60 years, would be disappointed that, although we have not seen conflagrations the size of World War II since, there have been some rather terrible conflicts. It is sad that that is the world we live in, but that does not take away from the sacrifices made and the tremendous effort that went to ensuring that the Second World War was won by the forces of good.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">When we look at what has happened to those who were our enemies at that time—Japan, Germany and Italy—we can say that there is hope for the world. They are countries that were rebuilt in a manner whereby they have become good citizens in the world of nations and have shown that from bad things good things can come. In these circumstances I think we owe a debt to all those involved in the effort around World War II in helping to bring that good to pass and for providing the basis for a modern democratic world which, despite its problems, we can build on and be proud of. I take the opportunity today to register my gratitude and thanks to all those involved. It was a tremendous effort by so many in this country at that time. It is a great honour to be in this place to honour them on this occasion.</para>

<para>—Who can forget Ben Chifley’s famous words in 1945 when he said, ‘Fellow citizens, the war is over,’ or the statement of President Harry Truman of the United States when he said, ‘This is the day when fascism finally dies.’ Indeed, the Second World War was an extraordinary global battle against fascism in every corner of the world, from Europe to Asia.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">On that day, 15 August 1945, at noon, Japan Standard Time, Emperor Hirohito announced that Japan would surrender to the allied forces and thus end the Second World War, which had raged for six long years. The war in the Pacific, whose end we commemorated a few days ago, had been an especially brutal one. The cruel and often sadistic treatment of Australian prisoners of war by the Japanese gave Australians an experience of a kind of war that they had not experienced in prior conflicts.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Only a few weeks ago, I dined with one of my constituents, Dr Frank Mills—now well into his 90s. He was a prisoner of war at Sandakan and was one of only six out of 2,000 who survived a final death march at the war’s end. Dr Mills returned to Sydney and went on to pioneer open-heart surgery. Like so many of his generation, he recognised then and recognises today that the answer to war is not revenge and hatred, but forgiveness and love. For the generations that came after, surely the Second World War generation was the greatest generation. We who contemplate the achievements of that greatest generation stand in awe of their heroism, tenacity and dogged determination to survive against all the odds.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">But we should also stand in awe of their forgiveness. When we consider how many conflicts around the world are grounded, are sourced, in battles and resentments and hatreds from centuries past, it is remarkable that it was the veterans of the Second World War—this greatest generation—who, as the Prime Minister said, barely 12 years after the end of that terrible war and barely 12 years after experiencing cruelty of a kind that had been unknown in the Australian experience entered into the first commerce agreement with Japan. That forgiveness is the most remarkable achievement. It is a lesson that all of us would do well to learn from and it is a lesson that I hope other people in other countries would learn from. If they did, our world would be a more peaceful one today.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It was a great time to rejoice in 1945. Tens of thousands poured onto the streets of Sydney, dancing and waving flags. Their joy, of course, was overshadowed by the loss of so many young Australians who we remember today. One million Australians served during the war. Almost 40,000 were killed and 30,000 were taken prisoner. In the ensuing months, Australian service men and women returned home. They were closely followed by a new wave of immigrants from Europe, the new wave of immigration that was driven by the extraordinary turmoil of the Second World War. Many Greeks, for example, left their homeland and came to Australia, and many settled in the electorate of Wentworth—as did many Hungarians and many Jews. The demographic face of my electorate is, in large measure, a consequence of the massive movements of peoples that followed the Second World War. As all of them left unhappy situations in their own countries, they too came to Australia, just as our servicemen returned, with forgiveness and optimism in their hearts. They worked together to create the wonderful, diverse community that we have both in Wentworth and across Australia.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">More than 100,000 people, almost a third of this city’s population, attended Monday’s Salute to Veterans event in Canberra, which culminated at night with magnificent fireworks and two F111 fighter planes swooping over the lake, their afterburners leaving a trail of fire against the darkness of the Canberra sky. Earlier in the day the Prime Minister and other distinguished VIPs, including Japan’s ambassador, laid wreaths at the cenotaph at the Australian War Memorial to honour those who fought and died. It was a gesture of acceptance, but only one of many that have been made over the decades, between old enemies who had now become close friends. In Tokyo, the Japanese Prime Minister, Mr Koizumi, reiterated a sincere apology: ‘Our country through colonial rule and aggression caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries.’ That type of acknowledgement is one that is all too rarely made.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The electorate of Wentworth was attacked in the Second World War. We often think of Darwin as being the only part of the Australian mainland that was attacked. But in May 1942 several Japanese midget submarines entered Sydney Harbour and fired shells into the surrounding suburbs, including Rose Bay, and torpedoed a ferry killing 19 sailors and thereby brought Sydney right into the front line. Wentworth has many World War II veterans, but of course every year sadly there are fewer.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Last Sunday, this significant event in our wartime history was commemorated by the Bondi Junction-Waverley RSL sub-branch at a morning service, which my wife, Lucy, and I attended, at the Waverley Park cenotaph. It was followed by a lunch at their headquarters in Bondi Junction, just across the road from my electorate office. It was an invaluable opportunity to publicly thank the club’s 320 World War II veterans for their contribution in the war, for fighting to protect our freedom and democracy and for their continuing contribution to our community in the years subsequent.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">On Monday, the Rose Bay RSL sub-branch also held a commemoration and service and a lunch at their club on the Rose Bay foreshore, where 63 years ago there were shells flying through the air from the Japanese submarines. I was delighted that $5,000 was made available to the Bondi Junction-Waverley RSL sub-branch and $2,000 to the Rose Bay RSL sub-branch for these important events under the Howard government’s Saluting their Service program of 2005. Bill Harrigan, the President of Bondi Junction-Waverley RSL, and John Fraser, the Honorary Secretary of Rose Bay RSL sub-branch, should be congratulated, together with their committees, on these initiatives.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Events such as these heighten community awareness about Victory in the Pacific Day and its place in Australian history. The Howard government, in partnership with these two RSLs, made certain that the Wentworth community remembered and honoured the men and women who defended our nation at its time of greatest danger. The Anzac spirit which began in Gallipoli and which continued through all of Australia’s conflicts, most especially in the Second World War, glowed brightly in Wentworth on Victory in the Pacific Day.</para>

<para>—At the outset I want to congratulate a number of organisations for their commitment and work in my electorate. Included amongst the activities that occurred over the last week or so were a tree planting by Lidcombe RSL yesterday and the repositioning of a war memorial in the Holroyd council area at Merrylands, a project undertaken by the council in conjunction with the RSL. Previously, individuals were commemorated by trees and small plaques positioned along Memorial Avenue. There was a view that, over recent years, maintenance had been inappropriate and that those commemorations really did not stand out. I congratulate all those involved in the new memorial.  It is very futuristic and, with its general visage looking towards the council chambers, which itself was built in recent years, it is quite impressive. Last weekend the Granville RSL held a dinner dance, at which wartime music was played. That function was organised by the Granville Historical Society in conjunction with Rotary. Most importantly, a video was made for all schools in the Reid electorate about the Second World War and victory in the Pacific. The Granville RSL will hold another function next week.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I have to put on record my appreciation of the work of the Granville Historical Society. Given the nature of the area where it exists and the people it attracts, it is quite an enterprising and competent group which has now had about six publications. It is always ready to drop all other jobs and follow up an interesting, quaint or esoteric suggestion that I make about exploring the history of an individual et cetera. On the basis of what was presented at the dinner last Friday night, the video will be extremely impressive. Those are the main events in the electorate. I place on the record my appreciation of the work undertaken by all those involved.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Coincidentally, I received an email from my aunt yesterday which gave some indication of the day itself. She recalls, as a young schoolgirl, walking down Guildford Road from the local church, passing the hotel in Guildford Road and the owner, a Mr Inch, rushing out to say, ‘It’s over.’ She suggested to her mother that they should all go into the city to join everyone else in the celebrations. It was only later that she thought that her mother, after a hard day at work in a munitions factory at St Mary’s, would not be as enthusiastic as she was. Obviously we are commemorating the end of these events.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Perhaps it is a bit left field, but I would also like to commemorate the deaths at Hiroshima. By August 1946, it was estimated that 118,000 people had already died as a consequence of the bomb, 30,000 had been severely injured and another 48,000 were missing. In the interim, of course, the number of deaths has increased greatly, to almost a quarter of a million people now, of whom 5,000 last year were regarded as victims. Their deaths were consequent upon the destruction at Hiroshima. Just to give one description of it all, it is said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The blast of furnace heat flattened forty-two square miles of Hiroshima, and set what was left on fire. About 78,000 people died immediately, over 40,000 were horribly burned and some 14,000 were missing. Of 76,327 buildings, about 48,000 were completely destroyed and more than 22,000 severely damaged. Some 180,000 survivors were homeless, many of them soon to develop a deadly new illness they called atomic disease.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Obviously you hear about many of the victims of Japanese atrocities, such as the people that were jailed after Singapore and captured in Timor. They have a view that they would not be alive today but for the decision by Truman. There is a very strong contention that the war might not have ended as early but for the dropping of the bomb. I do not contest that, but I have read in the last few years a very interesting series of essays by Gore Vidal, the acclaimed American writer. It is worth while sometimes being challenged in your perceptions of what is a set history. I do not say that he is correct, but he puts forward the very interesting contention that the peace party in Japan was far stronger than has been portrayed in later history. There were significant forces in a very undemocratic government which saw the writing on the wall and had a belief that Japan should capitulate. He puts forward the proposition that, whilst there might have been an element that sought to conclude the war—and that is quite viable: the Americans, Australians and others might have thought it at the time—there was also the possibility that this was meant as a warning signal to the Soviet Union, in its expansion into eastern Europe, that America had possession and that the Soviet Union should understand the repercussions of its aggression into Germany and other parts of Europe. That opened up the possibility of the atomic age. We are now seeing that many other countries are on the verge of or involved in the nuclear weapons industry.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Obviously, it also opened up the atomic age, and we now see a situation where so many other countries are on the verge of or involved in the nuclear weapons industry. The cynicism in international affairs was demonstrated this week by an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> which exposed that Britain a few decades ago secretly supplied the Israelis with requirements for their nuclear program, not telling the Americans—keeping it secret from America. And Britain supplied this material on totally commercial grounds—there was big money in it for the nuclear industry in Britain and it went ahead.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As I said, the common belief is that dropping the bomb was necessary, that the war would otherwise have gone on for longer and that these people were collateral damage. There are strong points to that argument. We know about the Japanese aggression, we know it was a militaristic society and we know that those implicated in the aggression in China and other parts of Asia and in the move towards Australia were not easy to talk to, but there is a possibility that elements in Japan were realistic about where things were going.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I forgot to mention one of the events held in my electorate, and that was the very worthwhile service at St Mark’s Anglican Church at Granville on Sunday involving the RSL club, the Anglican congregation and other interested parties. It is worth noting that that church was designed by Blacket and is one of the most impressive churches in the whole of Sydney. In his address at the service there, the Rev. James McPherson repeated the famous words attributed to William Tecumseh Sherman at the Michigan Military Academy on 19 June 1879:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">War is at best barbarism ...Its glory is all moonshine. It is only those that have neither fired a shot nor heard the shrieks and groans of the wounded who cry aloud for blood, more vengeance, more desolation. War is hell.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">That was the theme of what I thought was a very good sermon on Sunday.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The other point we should remember is that the victory over Japan and the Axis powers was against tremendous odds. I have recently been reading a few books about early post-war France and also about the Vichy period, when De Gaulle had to flee to Britain and was basically regarded as a traitor to the French for disobeying the Vichy government’s capitulation to the Germans. And I think it was only in early 1944 that MacArthur actually had more Americans under his command than Australians, because American public opinion after the First World War and the isolationist push had rejected President Wilson and American involvement in the League of Nations and in the world. It was a very difficult situation for Britain and Australia, joined by the vestiges of Polish, Dutch and Belgian forces. As I said, there was very late involvement by the United States and there was great suspicion between the Soviet Union and the Western powers. The non-aggression pact between Hitler and Stalin at one stage was a very disturbing move by the Soviet Union. On the other hand, there had been the failure of the allies to support the republican government in Spain against fascist intervention there.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">So it was a close thing. But the effort of this country, on a per capita basis, was monumental. We had a situation where for the first time women were largely encompassed in the non-household work force, including working in munitions. There was major rationing throughout the period. People had to make enormous sacrifices in their own country. People in auxiliary industries were not allowed to change their employment. My mother recalls the blacking-out of windows, the lights out, the shortages through the whole period. There were wardens. Schools had trenches dug through the school grounds for air-raid protection. All of those things indicate the degree of commitment in the country and the fact that it was not only the soldiers at the frontline but other large parts of Australian society that were involved.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This week, of course, has seen widespread commemoration of the 30,000-plus who were killed and the 180,000 who were wounded, but, as I said, at the same time we do not want to underestimate the efforts of those who supported the war effort. There was a need for armament construction and for homeland protection.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I want to join with all the other speakers in recognising the particular contribution of this country, which in per capita terms was very significant. It was significant in very real terms at Milne Bay and El Alamein et cetera. If you take an overview of the Second World War, Australia did play a very major role and that is what we recognise today—the contribution of individuals and of the broad Australian population in the defeat of the Axis powers.</para>

<para>—I want to acknowledge the service of the Australians who are commemorated on the 60th anniversary of Victory in the Pacific Day, and I want to do that in three stages. Firstly, I want to discuss the contribution of the many veterans who now reside in my electorate; secondly, I want to commemorate the nature of the conflict—the service, the struggle and the sacrifice that Australians and the war generation in particular made during the course of the Second World War; and, thirdly, I want to examine briefly some of the consequences and long-term challenges which we face even today as the echoes of that conflict continue through our world.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I was fortunate to have the honour of representing the Australian government at nine Victory in the Pacific 60th anniversary commemoration celebrations within my electorate of Flinders during the course of the weekend. They were held at Phillip Island, Sorrento, Rye, Rosebud, Crib Point, Hastings and Dromana-Red Hill RSLs and, in addition, at Jean Turner Lodge, Lotus Lodge and Koorootang Retirement Village. I was able to meet with veterans and to present them with 60th anniversary commemorative medals. At that time, they told me their stories. They told me stories of Milne Bay, Kokoda, the Philippines and Ambon. They told me of service not just in the Pacific but also at Tobruk, in the Middle East more generally, in North Africa, in the Mediterranean, in the European conflict and in the Atlantic. These men and women were in just one electorate, one small part of Australia, and they served Australia in different ways during the Second World War.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">To a person, they were modest about their achievements and their contributions. To a person, they had a tremendous respect for and remembrance of those who had served with them and whom they had lost. All knew young Australians who never saw middle age. All had friends and family who had been involved in the conflict but who had not returned. It is that personal element, combined with the sense of getting on with life, which I think symbolises not just the Australian contribution but the Australian spirit during the Second World War, that sense of energy, commitment, personal humility and respect for and remembrance of their colleagues, their friends and their families. It was an extraordinary contribution. But the conflict as a whole, as we look back over 60 years, represents the defining moment of the 20th century.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The 60th anniversary of 15 August represents 60 years since the Japanese surrender. The end of World War II recalls to mind the fact that there were 40,000 Australians who lost their lives, 30,000 Australians who served as prisoners of war and, by some records, 150,000 Australians who suffered serious injury of some form or other. There was an entire generation of Australians who served directly in the military, who worked in support of military activities or who had friends and families who maintained the country during the time in which it was entirely on a war footing.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The threat to Australia was real. Australians played a critical role at Milne Bay, where there was the first defeat of Japanese forces in the Pacific—led by Australians, conducted by Australians and with Australian casualties. The message from Milne Bay was that the conflict could be turned around. It was a critical time. The threat, had that not happened, was that Papua New Guinea would be used as a staging base for attacks against Northern Australia. There was no doubt that one of the objectives was the colonisation of Australian soil. It was a different time; Japan was then a different country from the one it is today. So we take no issue with and we have enormous respect for contemporary Japan. But it is critical that we acknowledge the depth of the threat and the strength of resolve and courage of those who placed themselves in harm’s way—many knowing that the risk of death was exceptionally high and there was virtually no likelihood that they themselves would survive. Sadly, that was the case for 40,000 Australians during the conflict. In the Pacific the places where they served—places such as Balikpapan; Sandakan; Ambon, which I mentioned earlier; Timor; the Philippines; Burma; Singapore; Malaysia; and so many other, different places—echo still today with the remembrance of service given, of conflicts fought and of lives lost.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">On behalf of not just the Australian government but also succeeding generations within my electorate of Flinders, I want to express the profound gratitude we have for the service of those people within that Second World War generation. There was, of course, the bravery, skill and commitment of the soldiers. On the civilian front there was an extraordinarily powerful, galvanised nation. There was bipartisan support, for the most part, during the course of the Second World War. Politics, sadly, was not completely shelved, but there was a whole-of-nation approach. So the way in which the nation was led, firstly under the government of Prime Minister Menzies and secondly under the Labor Party, served Australia in its capacity to deal more generally with the outside world and in its capacity to deal internally with what could otherwise have been divisive issues.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I note in particular that Australians played a critical role not just in the Pacific but also in the North African campaign. The Rats of Tobruk, famous for their stoicism, were part of the resistance which ultimately allowed allied forces to retake North Africa and, from there, to move on to Italy, to Greece and to southern France. That was a decisive part to play in the European theatre of conflict. The strength of character shown, the extraordinary resilience and the good humour of Australian troops meant that the Allies maintained a foothold and a base at a critical juncture during that conflict.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Throughout the war, Australians were not only killed and injured but taken prisoner. So we remember now the Burma railway and Sandakan and we remember the hardship. There are famous incidents such as the wartime service of Sir  Edward ‘Weary’ Dunlop. Those incidents and those names speak not just for themselves but for all of those other Australians who suffered during the war as prisoners of war. I was fortunate during my time at Melbourne university to come to know Sir Edward ‘Weary’ Dunlop. He was an extraordinarily warm and generous person. He carried no rancour for those who had interned him during the course of the Second World War, and he carried a great goodwill and generosity. The fact that as an individual he had those capacities shone very brightly. It said that Australians—and in a sense he exemplifies Australians—have the capacity to look forwards rather than backwards. So, whilst we look backwards today to remember, to honour and to recollect, none of that generation would want us to wallow in the past.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">What is of profound importance is that within barely a decade the Australian government, particularly through the work of John McEwen, was able to forge with Japan, which had been 12 years before a bitter enemy, the 1957 Japan-Australia trade agreement. That was not just a critical economic step for Australia but also an extremely important diplomatic step in establishing Australia’s foothold within North Asia and also in moving forwards from that conflict. It was a controversial action. It was an action which received criticism within Australia and was the subject of debate and opposition within the parliament, but it spoke of a willingness, a commitment and a resolution to go forwards rather than backwards. In 1957 the government was not willing to let Australians be held prisoner to the past. Firstly, it wanted to help secure the economic future of Australia; secondly, it wanted to move forward in a way which represented a new world, not an old world.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This brings me to the third point that I wish to make today, and that is in relation to the consequences of the Second World War. There was the immediate consequence, after the extraordinary toll of human suffering—and Oxford academic Alan Bullock, in his book <inline font-style="italic">Hitler and Stalin</inline>, estimates that about 40 million lives, both military and civilian, were lost over the course of the Second World War. Beyond that extraordinary human toll, the consequences were twofold: there was the division of the world into the Eastern and Western blocs, in geostrategic terms, and, under Stalin, the Soviet Union extended its influence into eastern Europe and parts of central Europe. The result was that for the best part of half a century the world potentially faced the third great conflict of the 20th century. That we were able to avoid that conflict was in large part due to an absolute commitment by people, certainly on the allied side, not to repeat a cataclysmic conflict and to make that commitment from a position of strength, not weakness. They had learnt the lesson of the 1930s that, yes, history should work on a cooperative basis and diplomacy should be a primary tool, but when you are dealing with authoritarian regimes there must be a recognition that the currency, the language, is of resistance and strength, not acquiescence.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">That brings me to the message which faces our world today. We live in a world where there is extraordinary cooperation. Japan, Germany and Italy are all integral parts of the community of advanced developed nations. They are nations of great good faith; they are nations of economic prosperity. They each face their own challenges, but they are an integral part of the world. They are an integral part of the world because of the resistance of the generation during the Second World War and because of the foresight of those who were involved in the reconciliation and the reconstruction after the Second World War. The lesson of the First World War was fortunately adhered to, and that was not to ‘beggar thy neighbour’ after the conflict.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">So today, in dealing with a new type of conflict, there are two lessons that we draw from both the First World War and the Second World War. The first is that we cannot take a position of weakness in relation to terror and in relation to hostility and conflict. The only way of preventing wholesale slaughter and of preventing attacks is through a position of strength. If we are to withdraw from fronts and leave a vacuum, then that vacuum will be filled by those of hostile intent. Iraq and Afghanistan will be used as a staging point and a base for hostile activities. That was the case with Afghanistan prior to September 11. A weak internal structure was used as the basis for an international movement. It gathered its pace by, and sourced its strength from, preying on the host of a weak internal regime. So the first of the lessons we have to take from World War II is that we must show strength in resistance to hostile forces. They must understand that there is good intent and goodwill but an absolute commitment of resolve.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The second of the messages is that there must be an alternative for people so that they can find their dignity, find their future and have a sense of what is possible. We see that the descent of Germany, after the First World War, during the late 1920s and early 1930s, into an authoritarian state was in large measure due to the fact that the people had been denied economic opportunity. So we have a responsibility to help in the development and promotion of economic freedom and individual hope and capacity within Middle Eastern states, and within those areas where radical Islam would challenge. That must also be tied to the process of giving them a chance for individual freedom. That is why democratisation, slow as it may be, is fundamentally important in the Middle East, and why activities in Afghanistan, Iraq and Lebanon are fundamental to the future. The challenge remains for Saudi Arabia, Syria and Iran to take those steps. That is, ultimately, the legacy which we must pursue if we are truly to honour the veterans of World War II. In summation, I acknowledge, respect and honour the debt of gratitude which this generation owes to previous generations, and I thank all of those veterans who served Australia in World War II. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—On Monday this nation commemorated 60 years since World War II was finally won on 15 August 1945. While our military personnel have fought wars on foreign soil between then and now, in this country of ours we have enjoyed 60 years of peace since that day. We have seen children born and grow up to become parents and then grandparents in a world of security and safety. That world was paid for by the courage and blood of another generation—the men and women who served our country in World War II—and by the courage, tenacity, fear and grief of those that remained behind.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">From a population of seven million people, 993,000—almost one million—men and women enlisted for service, which was almost one in seven people. Thirty-nine thousand Australians gave their lives, and their names are recorded on the Australian War Memorial Roll of Honour. Forty-seven thousand Australians were wounded, and 22,000 captured as prisoners of war.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In Parramatta, we commemorated the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II at the Lancer Barracks, which is the oldest working barracks in Australia, situated right in the heart of the CBD. It is fitting that we did. In recognising service to the country, you will not find a finer example than the men and women who have served and who currently serve with the Lancers in our local community. It is the nature of Australia that to its people, living in peace without hostile borders, war is a distant thing. For those of us born post World War II—and most of us were—we can and do live our lives without any real awareness of the level of commitment and service of our military men and women. There are men and women who stand ready to fight today, ready to risk their own lives for my life and for yours. That is an extraordinary thing. Even though I was raised in an army family, with my father joining the army when he was about 30 and serving as a musician in the 1st Military District Band, I still find it quite extraordinary when I meet the military men and women who serve in my community.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Following Australia’s decision to join the coalition of the willing in Iraq, I visited the war graves in Singapore. It was my own personal ritual: my own way of acknowledging, somewhat distantly I have to say, the consequences of engaging in a war, whether right or wrong. It seemed to me slightly amoral to be so far from the consequences of a war, yet to enjoy its possible benefits. When I visited those graves I found that the vast majority of epitaphs said, ‘beloved son’ or ‘beloved brother’. There were very few that referred to a ‘beloved husband’, and I came to realise only then how young these men and women were. They were cut down before they enjoyed the benefits of marriage, and quite often before they were even in love. They were incredibly young. Many of the people who paid in that war were the parents of those young men and women. Those parents, of course, passed away quite some time ago—probably 10 or 15 years ago—so we commemorated on Monday with the widows and the veterans who live 60 years later. We should remember that, at the time, and for the last 60 years, parents have lived without their sons and daughters. Many lived 40 or 50 years without their sons and daughters.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Several of the veterans who attended the commemoration and service on Monday told me that they had enlisted at the barracks on the very spot where we acknowledged our debt to them some 60 years later. They were by no means the first. The regiment dates back to 1885 and it is one of the longest continuously serving units in Australia. The Lancers were one of the very first colonial troops to arrive in South Africa in 1899, before Federation, for service in the Boer War. In 1935, they were given the title of ‘Royal’ and a year later they went from serving as a mounted cavalry battalion to serving as a mechanised machine gun regiment. In 1942 the Lancers were incorporated into the AIF as an armoured regiment and equipped with Matilda infantry support tanks. The Lancers have successfully secured their place in Australia’s military history as one of the key battalions who pioneered the use of tanks in jungle terrain as they did in Borneo and New Guinea in the Second World War.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Having served in South Africa, Rumani, Jerusalem, Jaffa, Jericho, Jordan, New Guinea and Borneo, as well as a number of other key conflicts since 1899, and with 21 battle honours, the battalion is the most highly decorated unit in the Australian Army. The Lancers played a significant role in World War II and had many actively serving men who celebrated the end of World War II in the Pacific while on active duty on 15 August 1945. They fought in Borneo and New Guinea and most significantly were the only amphibious battalion to have served in a battle in the Pacific, as they did in Balikpapan. The Lancers role in Balikpapan saw them launch Australia’s heaviest tank attack of the war.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The barracks held an open day last Saturday as an opportunity for the people of Parramatta to come and see at first hand Australia’s oldest serving barracks. The barracks are in the middle of the CBD in Parramatta. In fact, Parramatta has literally grown up around the barracks. I realised this while standing in the parade ground in the middle of the barracks during the commemorative service. The juxtaposition of the newly built office towers around the smaller, squat, heritage listed buildings of the barracks is quite astounding. For me it served as a great reminder that the men and women who fought for our country have truly given us the opportunities that we have today.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Lancer museum, which is located in historic Linden House at the barracks, provides a fitting home for Australia’s oldest regimental museum. In keeping with the origin of the regiment, it is the product of the voluntary efforts of ordinary Australian citizens devoted to preserving our history and traditions. Over 400 people attended the open day at the barracks—a fantastic turnout to remember and commemorate the 60th anniversary of VP Day by the people of Parramatta.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">On Monday the barracks coordinated a moving commemorative service to remember those who had fallen during the war and to honour those who were with us on Monday. This was a great opportunity to truly embrace the 60th anniversary and I was honoured to present the commemorative medallions to the 45 veterans and widows who came to the service. The barracks was the perfect setting for the ceremony—an operational barracks where the soldiers of the present and the greater community joined together to honour the lives lost and the lives lived in building the country which we so easily enjoy today.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We honoured on Monday one of the toughest generations of Australians—a generation who wrote the rule book of jungle warfare under the worst conditions of the war. Australians served wherever the battles raged, but the Pacific was a diabolical struggle in the most heartless of terrain—mountainous jungle and swamps—faced with tropical heat, humidity, jungle rot, malaria and new standards in savagery. They faced an unseen enemy that believed in victory or extermination. These are really the toughest of Australians.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">On Monday we gathered with the greatest respect, affection and gratitude to honour this tough generation: those who served, those who suffered and those who gave their lives in service of our country. We gathered to give thanks to the veterans of World War II—those who fought and the men and women who loved and lost them in unimaginable circumstances. By this act of remembrance we reminded ourselves that this special place we live in and the way of life we enjoy has been hard won through the commitment and sacrifice of those who served, paid for with lives cut off too young, with hopes and aspirations destroyed. It is a very precious inheritance willed to us by the men and women who stood with us on Monday and the men and women who fought and died at their side.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The horrors of war do not end with the war. Wives grieved for decades and children grew up without their parents. For those that returned, even families that were reunited suffered from the years lost and from the experiences and horror of their men, which were never shared in many cases, and through illness, both physical and emotional. Father-child relations were forever changed by the absence of the fathers. Our lives now were paid for not just in the lives lost but in many cases by the lives altered and lived through the last 60 years.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The service and open day would not have been a success without the work of some important people, and I want to extend my thanks on behalf of the Parramatta community to John Howells and Len Koles from the Barracks museum, both retired servicemen who served in the Lancers; Colonel Don Tate, retired; Commanding Officer Lieutenant Colonel Brett Barlow; Regimental Sergeant Major Warrant Officer Class 1 Bill Baxter; Warrant Officer Class 2 Mark Byrne from the 1/15 New South Wales Lancers Battalion; Colin Smith, President of Parramatta RSL sub-branch; Maurice Greene, Deputy President of Parramatta RSL sub-branch; and Bob Durbin, Honorary Secretary of Parramatta RSL sub-branch. Without the important work of these people, we would not have been able to commemorate Victory in the Pacific Day in Parramatta in the way we did. We would not have been able to give the honour to our veterans that we gave to them on Monday. For those who served their country, those who gave their lives, those whose loved ones lie in foreign soil and those who lived through the mud and horror to stand with us 60 years on, on behalf of the people of Parramatta I honour them and thank them.</para>

<para>An Australian citizen has claimed that in 1997 he reported to a consular official in Bali that he had discovered drugs in his luggage when he opened it on arrival at his hotel. A consular official who was in Bali at that time recalls being contacted about the reported incident. He suggested a number of options the Australians might consider but did not advise a specific course of action.</para>

<para>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Canberra spoke about the incident described in the answer to Question 3 with Ms Corby’s Australian lawyers, Hoolihans, on 31 March 2005.</para>
</item>
<item label="(6)">
<para>The conduct of Ms Corby’s defence is primarily a matter for Ms Corby and her legal team and not the Australian Government.</para>
<para>The Australian Government has responded to all reasonable requests for assistance from Ms Corby’s lawyers. At the request of Ms Corby’s lawyers on 12 May 2005, my department informed them on 13 May about a police investigation into the involvement of baggage handlers in drug-trafficking through Sydney Airport. The letter noted that the police believed the baggage handlers that they were investigating had been on duty on 8 October 2004, when a large shipment of cocaine had been brought into Australia. Ms Corby’s lawyers submitted the letter to the judge on 16 May.</para>
<para>On 27 June 2005, the Minister for Justice and Customs wrote to Qantas, the Sydney Airport Authority and Brisbane Airport Corporation passing on requests from Ms Corby’s lawyers for access to possible witnesses. The Minister for Justice and Customs wrote again to Qantas and Sydney Airport on 15 July 2005 passing further requests for information. On 13 July 2005, the Minister for Justice and Customs wrote to the Victorian Minister for Corrections and the NSW Minister for Justice passing on requests from Ms Corby’s lawyers for access to possible witnesses currently in custody or on parole in those two states. On 13 July 2005, the Minister for Justice and Customs provided contact details for the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions and relevant authorities in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland to Ms Corby’s lawyers. Also on 13 July 2005, the Minister for Justice and Customs wrote to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to advise him that Ms Corby’s lawyers may approach him with an application for immunity.</para>
<para>On 8 July 2005, the Minister for Justice and Customs advised Ms Corby’s lawyers that the Australian Government would provide video link facilities in Australia for anyone who wished to give evidence but was unable or unwilling to travel to Indonesia. This offer was reiterated on 13 July 2005 and addresses of facilities in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane were provided to Ms Corby’s lawyers on 19 July 2005. This assistance follows the extensive assistance provided by the Australian Government prior to and during her trial, which included making arrangements for a Victorian prisoner to travel to Bali to give evidence in response to a request for mutual assistance from the Indonesian Government.</para>
<para>Ms Corby was informed that she could apply for further assistance under the Special Circumstances (Overseas) Scheme, administered by the Attorney-General, for legal and related costs, including the out of pocket expenses (travel expenses, video link expenses and the like) associated with the attendance of witnesses to give evidence in foreign countries. An application for further assistance will be assessed in the usual way to determine whether it meets the Scheme criteria.</para>
</item>
<item label="(7)">
<para>Before Ms Corby’s conviction on 27 May I raised her case with my Indonesian counterpart, Mr Hassan Wirajuda, on 17 March, pointing out that the Australian Government was following the legal proceedings closely. The Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice and Customs met with representatives of Ms Corby’s legal defence team on 18 March 2005, as did the Australian Federal Police. The Minister for Justice and Customs also wrote on 23 March to his Indonesian counterpart, the Minister for Law and Human Rights, Dr Hamid Awaluddin, about the case. On 7 April 2005, in Jakarta, the Minister for Justice and Customs again met with Ms Corby’s defence team and also spoke with the Indonesian Attorney-General, Abdul Rahman Saleh.</para>
<para>During President Yudhoyono’s visit to Australia on 5 April 2005, the Attorney-General raised the case with him in the presence of the Prime Minister. President Yudhoyono said publicly during his visit that, while he could not intervene in independent judicial processes, he believed the process and outcome must be fair and recognised as such both nationally and internationally.</para>

<para>Notes to the Tables:</para>
<para>The most recently published statistics on individuals and families who have reached Extended Medicare Safety Net thresholds, and on Extended Medicare Safety Net benefits, have regard to claims processed by the Health Insurance Commission (HIC) up to and including 31 July 2004. Statistics relating to families registered are as at 29 August 2004.</para>
<para>The statistics were compiled from postcode level data (postcode of the head of the household, otherwise postcode of the oldest member of the family) and are based on 2001 electorate boundaries.</para>
<para>Where a postcode overlapped electorate boundaries, statistics were allocated to electorate using a concordance file derived from population census data. This can result in some data being erroneously allocated to an adjoining electorate. Data for people using post office boxes or private mail bags are excluded from electorate reporting as this cannot be appropriately allocated. Data have also been excluded if postcodes were not present on the concordance files.</para>
<para>The statistics on families and individuals who appear to have reached the Safety Net thresholds, include families and individuals who need to verify that they have paid the full fee charged, where claims have been lodged with the HIC prior to paying the treating practitioner (unsubstantiated claims).</para>

<item label="(1)">
<para>and (2) Job Network is administered on the basis of 19 Labour Market Regions and 137 Employment Services Areas (ESAs), the boundaries of which do not align with those of Federal Electorates. Job seekers choose Job Network members for a variety of reasons including location, proximity to transport routes and Centrelink offices, or the satisfaction of friends and others. Job seekers residing in one electorate or ESA may elect to be assisted through Job Network sites located in adjoining electorates or ESAs. For illustration, job seekers residing in the electorate of Werriwa may be assisted through Job Network sites located in the electorates of Hughes, Lindsay, Macarthur, Prospect and Fowler. The Fairfield/Liverpool and Macarthur ESAs are most closely aligned with the electorate of Werriwa and, therefore, answers are provided with reference to these ESAs.</para>
<para>There are currently 25 Job Network members and other Job Placement Organisations operating in the Fairfield/Liverpool ESA and 16 in the Macarthur ESA. Their names, office locations and the number of job seekers on their caseloads are shown in Table 1.</para>

The number of participants refers to all job seekers assisted in Intensive Support in that year.</para>

<para>In view of the 12 month duration of Intensive Assistance it is not practical to report on the numbers of job seekers who participated on multiple occasions in 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003.</para>
<para>Delivery of Intensive Assistance ceased on 30 June 2003. From 1 July 2003, improvements to the delivery of Job Network services were introduced through implementation of the APM. While Intensive Assistance allowed for multiple episodes of assistance, the new APM arrangements provide for job seekers to be assisted by a single Job Network member for the full duration of their unemployment, allowing the service provider to develop a detailed understanding of each job seeker’s needs.</para>
</item>
<item label="(6)">
<para>The Post-Programme Monitoring (PPM) survey conducted by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) measures job seekers’ outcomes three months after they have left assistance. PPM survey results are an estimate of outcomes levels based on responses from a sample of clients rather than the full population.</para>

<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Each year the Federal Government provides financial assistance grants to Local Government paid through the States under the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995. The financial assistance grants have two components – general purpose grants and identified local roads grants – and both components are untied in the hands of the receiving council. This means that councils are able to spend the grant (including the local road grant) according to the priorities of their communities.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Act specifies how the quantum of the grant is determined and how it is distributed between States. Within States, the grant is distributed to councils according to the recommendation of the respective Local Government Grants Commission established by each State as a condition of receiving funding under the Act. Further details are provided in the Report on the Operation of the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995 (commonly known as the National Report) tabled in Parliament as soon as practicable after 30 June each year.</para>

<para class="smalltableleft">Purpose: The InnovationXchange is an initiative of the Australian Industry Group and its charitable education trust, the Tyree Foundation. The objective of the project is to provide a ‘one stop shop’ for innovation and technology diffusion for Australian industry. The project seeks to help Australian firms, particularly small and medium sized enterprises, improve their: (a) understanding of, and access to new technologies; (b) access to information networks; (c) access to resources promoting a more innovative management culture; and (d) access to resources for staff training in entrepreneurship and innovation.</para>

<para class="smalltableleft">Purpose: The InnovationXchange Trusted Intermediary Services Pilot (to be known as BRIDGE services) is designed to test the concept of intermediated innovation services with a consortium of small and large organisations in and around the life/health sciences sector.</para>
<para class="smalltableleft">Sharing between small and large organisations is a notable problem that slows down and often cuts off small firms from critical opportunities. The objective of BRIDGE is to help small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) overcome the intellectual property barrier when trying to attract strategic partners among other SMEs, large firms and global players. It seeks to achieve this through the use of trusted intermediaries - knowledgeable experts employed by a non-profit organisation such as the InnovationXchange Network, who are able to forge connections between different firms without exposing intellectual property between them until an appropriate win-win opportunity is found.</para>

It will include a provision that the Future Fund can only be drawn down when the assets in the Fund are sufficient to offset the unfunded liabilities.

There is no distinction between capital (assets) held in the Fund and earnings on those assets with respect to draw down arrangements.</para>

<para>¹ The FaCS Staff Turnover rate has been calculated using staff turnover divided by Headcount. It includes all separations from FaCS - resignations, transfers/promotions to other APS agencies, death, invalidity, voluntary redundancy and end of temporary contracts.</para>
<para>² Following the formation of FaCS in 1998, the department continued to use a Centrelink Mainframe system called ADMINS for payroll and reporting purposes until 30 September 1999. FaCS then moved to its own SAP HR Information System. ADMINS is now a legacy system, with dated technology that is no longer capable of producing staffing reports. Consequently the department is unable to provide a response to (2)(c).</para>

<item label="(1)">
<para>According to initial United Nations’ estimates, more than 200,000 people in Zimbabwe had their homes demolished under Operations Restore Order and Murambatsvina (drive out rubbish). In a later estimate, the International Organisation for Migration put the number at approximately 370,000. The majority of demolitions have occurred in the capital, Harare, and other urban areas, although there are reports of some demolitions occurring in rural areas. As a general rule, Zimbabweans who live in urban areas have shown a greater tendency than rural Zimbabweans to vote for the main opposition party, rather than the governing Zanu-PF party.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>Media reports in late May 2005 and in early June indicated that in some areas non-government organisations (NGOs) were being prevented by the Zimbabwean police from assisting those evicted from their homes by the campaign. It was reported that police were obstructing distribution of aid and confiscating relief items in some areas. Further, in late May 2005, President Mugabe publicly condemned and warned NGOs against providing assistance to the victims. In early June, the Government of Zimbabwe stated that all humanitarian aid must be channelled through government structures or else aid delivery would be viewed as “resistance” or “obstruction”. In mid-June 2005, under mounting international pressure, the Government of Zimbabwe gave permission for local and international non-government organisations to provide relief to the victims of the campaign. Currently multilateral agencies and non-government organisations are coordinating their aid responses with government departments, churches and other charitable groups.</para>

<para>Australia continues to take a strong stand against the human rights abuses and undemocratic practices of the Zimbabwe Government and has strongly condemned its actions under Operations Restore Order and Murambatsvina.</para>
<para>My media release of 14 June condemned the massive destruction of homes and livelihoods under Operation Restore Order and called upon the Zimbabwe Government to immediately halt the operation and provide food and shelter to those in need. I also announced the removal of transit-without-visa privileges for Zimbabwean passport holders, an additional measure to reinforce our existing smart sanctions against the Zimbabwe Government.</para>
<para>On 24 June, Mr Billson called on the Government of Zimbabwe to halt the operation and allow all willing organisations to provide assistance to those in need. He also announced the provision of emergency relief aid for the victims of Operation Restore Order, to be delivered through the International Organisation for Migration and CARE Zimbabwe.</para>
<para>On 2 July, I met with New Zealand Foreign Minister Goff to discuss, among other things, the situation in Zimbabwe. We jointly announced a range of actions designed to increase international pressure on the Mugabe regime. Those measures are discussed in more detail below.</para>
</item>
<item label="(5)">
<para>The Government has consistently raised its serious concerns over human rights abuses in Zimbabwe in international forums, including the UN Commission on Human Rights. We have made these concerns clear in our Item 9 country statements before the Commission (available on the DFAT website) and we have been strongly supportive in past years of EU efforts to have the Commission adopt a resolution condemning human rights abuses in Zimbabwe.</para>
<para>The Government has also sought to raise Australia’s opposition to the current activities of the Mugabe regime in other international forums.</para>
<para>In the lead up to the African Union Summit in Libya, 4 to 5 July, representations were made to countries in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) urging that a statement be made at that summit calling on the Government of Zimbabwe to halt these activities, provide adequate food and shelter to those who have lost their homes and allow NGOs to provide assistance to those in need without hindrance. Unfortunately, those efforts appear to have been unsuccessful in generating such a statement, though they did provide an opportunity for Australia to reiterate its concerns with Zimbabwe’s neighbours in southern Africa.</para>
<para>On 2 July, I jointly announced with my New Zealand counterpart, Mr Phil Goff, a range of additional actions in international forums that our Governments will pursue in order to increase international pressure on the Mugabe Government. These include:</para>

</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>Locally Engaged Staff (LES) are employed under the provisions of local law in all posts. The principle observed is that LES are offered salaries and conditions of service that are competitive in the labour market of the host country, and which either meet or exceed the requirements of local labour laws.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>Posts are required to ensure that LES employment conforms fully to local legal requirements at a minimum. In addition, posts are required to ensure that LES employment practices adhere to Australian Public Service (APS) Values and uphold the principles of workplace diversity and anti-discrimination.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>All posts are required to ensure that their arrangements for the employment of LES are updated as necessary when changes in relevant local laws occur.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>As indicated in (1) and (2) above, posts may apply conditions of service to LES which exceed the requirements of local law. To provide details of which conditions are above and beyond those provided by local laws in the posts mentioned would entail an unreasonable diversion of resources.</para>
</item>
<item label="(5)">
<para>All posts are required to be in regular contact with local labour lawyers on questions relating to the employment of LES.</para>
</item>
<item label="(6)">
<para>LES recreation leave entitlements at the posts mentioned are as follows:</para>
<para>Jakarta: 15 days per annum</para>
<para>Bangkok: 15 days per annum, 20 days for staff with 10 or more years service</para>
<para>Manila: 15 days per annum. Staff employed on or before 1 May 2002 are entitled to 20 days per annum after 10 years continuous service</para>
<para>Phnom Penh: 18 days per annum. Staff who have been continuously employed for 3 years receive an additional day of recreation leave on 1 January immediately following completion of 3 years service. For every additional three years of continuous service, an additional day may be accrued.</para>
<para>Vientiane: 20 days per annum</para>
<para>Hanoi: 20 days per annum</para>
<para>Rangoon: 20 days per annum, 25 days for permanent staff with 15 or more years service. 16 days per annum for fixed-term contract staff.</para>
</item>
<item label="(7)">
<para>LES at all posts listed in the question are paid overtime where officially required to work beyond normal hours. In many posts LES may elect to take time off in lieu of payment for overtime, or a mixture of both. To provide details of overtime paid in the last six months would entail an unreasonable diversion of resources.</para>
</item>
<item label="(8)">
<para>Compensation arrangements for locally engaged staff in all overseas missions are in accordance with section 117 of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (the “SRC Act”). As stipulated by section 117 of the SRC Act, benefits are provided for persons in the event of their death or incapacity due to an injury or disease occurring in circumstances connected with their employment in accordance with an applicable local workers’ compensation scheme. Where no local workers’ compensation scheme applies locally engaged staff are paid in accordance with the provisions of the SRC Act.</para>
</item>
<item label="(9)">
<para>DFAT takes seriously its duty of care under the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1991 and obligations to take all reasonable practicable steps to protect the health and safety of employees at work, including through cooperative consultative relationships with locally engaged employees on health and safety issues. Any concerns raised by LES of a health and safety nature, including travel in dangerous locations, would be considered accordingly.</para>
</item>
<item label="(10)">
<para>As a good employer, DFAT is committed to providing salary increases for LES from time to time, in line with movements in local market salaries in the host country, and in accordance with the capacity of DFAT and other agencies to pay. Posts are responsible for monitoring the employment market in whatever way is appropriate to local circumstances. Inflation would normally be taken into account as part of this monitoring process.</para>
