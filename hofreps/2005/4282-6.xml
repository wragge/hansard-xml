<para class="block">The purpose of this <inline ref="R2453">bill</inline> is to put beyond doubt the Commonwealth’s power to make arrangements for the safe and secure management of the small quantity of radioactive waste produced by Commonwealth agencies from the use of nuclear materials in medicine, research and industry.</para>
<para>Radioactive waste management includes all of the activities that are involved in the handling, treatment, conditioning, transport, storage and disposal of radioactive waste.</para>
<para>Successive Australian governments since the Hawke Labor government have endeavoured to make responsible arrangements for managing Australia’s radioactive wastes. In doing so they have been defeated by the attitude of state and territory governments who fully agree with the need for such facilities providing they are ‘not in their backyard’.</para>
<para>In an attempt to deal with such parochialism, an objective, scientifically based study to find a highly suitable site for a national low-level radioactive waste repository was initiated in July 1992 by the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Hon. Simon Crean MP. After considerable effort and expense this process ended last year following action in the Federal Court by the Rann Labor government to oppose use of the selected site near Woomera in South Australia.</para>
<para>In response to the intransigence of the South Australian government, the Prime Minister announced on 14 July 2004 that the national repository project would be abandoned and the Australian government would examine sites on Commonwealth land, both onshore and offshore, for a co-located facility for management of low and intermediate level radioactive waste produced by Commonwealth agencies. State and territory governments are now expected to make their own arrangements for managing radioactive wastes in their jurisdiction, in a manner consistent with Australia’s international treaty obligations.</para>
<para>In July 2005 I announced that, following a significant desktop examination of Commonwealth sites, including offshore territories, the Australian government will undertake detailed on-site investigations at three sites on Commonwealth owned land in the Northern Territory.</para>

<para>—Recent statements from the Northern Territory government that it will attempt to obstruct the project reinforce the need for this legislation in the interests of responsible management of Commonwealth radioactive waste. This is a national interest issue.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Part 2 of the bill provides clear and express powers for the Commonwealth to proceed with activities necessary or incidental to further investigating the three sites the government has identified in the Northern Territory. This is necessary because the Territory government has introduced a specific law purporting to prohibit the Commonwealth from establishing a facility, which could include activities essential to the process of selecting a site for the establishment of a Commonwealth facility. Further, they have made it clear they will do everything possible to halt or frustrate the Commonwealth’s actions.</para>
<para>Because of these very real concerns about politically motivated obstruction of the Commonwealth’s activities and the need to progress this important project, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 will not apply to the site investigation phase of the project.</para>
<para>Part 3 of the bill provides that the responsible minister may declare one, or part of one, of the specified sites as the place where a facility may be established and operated, subject to the Commonwealth regulatory processes I have mentioned earlier. Part 3 also allows for an access route to be declared in order to provide for all-weather road access to the site.</para>
<para>Part 3 of the bill also effects the acquisition or extinguishment of all interests, if any, which the Commonwealth does not already hold in the site selected for a facility. Part 5 of the bill, importantly, provides for affected parties, if there are any, to be compensated on just terms.</para>
<para>A number of existing state and territory jurisdictions purport to prohibit or regulate the Commonwealth’s activities in establishing and operating a facility and/or transporting radioactive material to a facility. State and territory jurisdictions may introduce additional legislation purporting to prohibit or regulate the Commonwealth in these activities.</para>
<para>Notwithstanding any state or territory legislation, part 4 of the bill provides the Commonwealth with the express authority to do anything necessary or incidentally required to proceed with the establishment and operation of a Commonwealth facility at the selected site, and transport waste to the facility. To ensure there is no suggestion that the Commonwealth would seek to circumvent proper Commonwealth regulatory scrutiny, the bill explicitly provides that the processes under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act 1998 and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987, must be complied with.</para>
<para>In particular, the operation of the facility, including transport of radioactive waste, will proceed in accordance with licences issued by the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, known as ARPANSA. The highest standards of safety will be applied to ensure that operation of the facility does not present a hazard to people or the environment in the Northern Territory or along interstate transport routes. Transport of radioactive material has an excellent safety record internationally and in Australia, with around 30,000 packages of radioactive material transported safely around the country each year.</para>
<para>The government would have preferred to act with the cooperation of the states and territories, whose citizens receive direct and life-saving benefits from the Commonwealth’s activities in this field. It ought to be remembered by the House that every Australian, every member of this parliament, will at least once throughout his or her lifetime benefit from a medical procedure with a radioisotope sourced from Lucas Heights and that waste needs to be securely and properly stored in the longer term. As a measure of this government’s intentions we have offered to allow access to the new facility by the Northern Territory for management of its radioactive waste. The Northern Territory currently has 16 cubic metres of low-level radioactive waste at the Royal Darwin Hospital in the middle of Darwin, and also intermediate-level waste at Mount Todd in the vicinity of one of the proposed three sites. However, despite the lack of cooperation, the government will not shy away from doing what is required in the interests of all Australians. It is worth noting that the scientific basis for safely operating a facility such as the Commonwealth is proposing is well established and widely applied internationally. I have yet to hear a sensible, practical alternative from those opposed to the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Facility. Those opposed to it might reflect on the fact that there are 124,000 cubic metres of nuclear waste stored in Champagne, one of the most beautiful areas of France and highly acclaimed internationally.</para>
<para>It is extremely important that all Australians understand that we cannot expect to receive the benefits of nuclear sourced radioisotopes and then totally disregard or even actively oppose the need for facilities for the safe, long-term storage of low-level and intermediate level waste.</para>
<para>On average, every single Australian will benefit at least once from a medical procedure to either diagnose or treat a cancer or other disease using a radio-pharmaceutical sourced from Australia’s only nuclear reactor. Every year more than 400,000 Australians undergo medical procedures that use the isotopes produced by Australia’s only nuclear reactor and save people’s lives every day.</para>
<para>There are also a host of applications of radioactive materials that we rely upon and indeed take for granted, in areas as diverse as sterilisation of bandages, syringes and women’s hygiene products, minerals exploration—particularly in the Northern Territory—and processing, ensuring the safety of oil and gas pipelines and accurate filling of bottles and cans containing food and beverages. Every Australian, including Northern Territorians, benefits substantially from these initiatives.</para>
<para>To ensure that these medical and industrial procedures and products are available in the future, we have a responsibility to provide the facilities needed for managing the small quantity of radioactive wastes that arise in their production and use. We are looking at 0.00002 per cent of the land mass of the Northern Territory on Commonwealth owned land. Passage of the bill is essential if Australians are to continue to realise the benefits of the wide range of uses of radioactive materials in our daily lives.</para>
<para>Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum that has been circulated to honourable members. I commend the bill to the House. It is in the interests of this country.</para>

<para>—Before the interruption of yesterday’s debate on the <inline ref="R2430">Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005</inline> and the <inline ref="R2428">Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005</inline>, I was speaking about two young women who represented New South Wales at the recent international university games, they being Belinda Battistel and Ali Hudson. This was the first team that Australia had sent to the games in almost 20 years. If the Minister for Education, Science and Training continues with his destructive approach to VSU legislation, this could well have been our last effort at the international university games.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Recently two young female hockey players were photographed near the minister, holding signs indicating that their sporting teams would no longer be able to compete because of the minister’s issues about VSU. I think that was pretty widely circulated via email communications. I am quite certain that the skills of our young basketballers, like Belinda Battistel and Ali Hudson, will suffer the same fate. I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate both Belinda and Ali on their successes and I would like to assure them that federal Labor will continue to fight for their right to participate in sporting events like the university games into the future. We will strongly oppose the introduction of VSU.</para>
<para>I am proud to stand in this place today and support the continued existence of student services, particularly the student services provided by the University of Western Sydney through its student association. As the member for Chifley said yesterday, Western Sydney Labor MPs are very proud of the university and very proud of the level of services that it provides. It goes without saying that we are very proud of the students that we produce through the University of Western Sydney.</para>
<para>I hope that the member for Macarthur, in whose electorate the Campbelltown campus of the University of Western Sydney resides, can tear himself away from toeing the party line long enough to come out in support of the university and its campus in his electorate. I hope that he is willing to stand up to his minister and say no to VSU. I know that local students in south-west Sydney do not want VSU and I am sure that, like me, the member for Macarthur has received many approaches from students in the electorate, and probably from the student association itself, to discuss their concerns over VSU. If the member for Macarthur votes in support of VSU, I hope that he will at least be willing to meet with the representatives of the students association and tell them why VSU will be better for them and why it will be better for students studying at the Campbelltown campus.</para>
<para>The minister has failed to convince the party room of the merits of VSU and he has failed to convince the public. Delaying this bill is not going to fix it and it is not going to make the issues go away. Despite the minister’s best efforts to defend the decision in question time, we all know—and the public knows—that the VSU legislation cannot be passed, because it is lousy legislation and it is very poor public policy. No matter how long the minister decides to delay, the VSU legislation will not be passed. According to the minister, VSU legislation is off the agenda until 2007. Waiting until 2007 is not going to change the fact that it is bad policy.</para>
<para>The attack on universities in the outer metropolitan and regional areas—universities like the Campbelltown campus of the University of Western Sydney—is now delayed, but I call on the minister to go further and abandon the legislation completely. I call on members opposite who claim to have a commitment to higher education, and who are more than willing to visit university campuses in their electorates for photo opportunities, to support Labor’s amendment. Do not dodge the issue; throw the legislation out and keep it out. Do not come into this place and vote down Labor’s amendment to support services to local students and follow it up by voting in support of changing conditions for charging international students for those very same services. At least members opposite should have the courage to vote consistently.</para>
<para>There are some members opposite who have privately expressed concerns about the VSU legislation to the minister. That must be the case. It cannot just be those coalition senators. There must be concerns about this. I encourage those members to use their vote later today to express those private concerns in a very public manner and have their vote recorded as supporting services for all students, not just international students. They should vote for a rational approach to the provision of student services for all students, not just selected ones.</para>
<para>I call on the government to drop the VSU legislation. If they did that, they would not even have to amend the Education Services for Overseas Students Act. I know that many international students need these services, and I support their provision. In addition to the normal trials and tribulations of students during their time at university, international students have the added challenge of living in another country far away from their personal support network. They should have appropriate support services in place. That is not contested. I cannot help but wonder why, if these services are so valuable and important to international students, we would consider them to be any less valued and less important to local students. I also have to wonder why the minister believes that such services will be able to adequately operate for international students after the infrastructure and networks that have been established for local students are torn down.</para>
<para>Any business operator will tell you that if you have something up and running for one group of customers there are economies of scale to be achieved by using the same set-up to service a new set of customers. Today is a victory for all those student groups that have actively campaigned against VSU. It is a victory for the student organisations, regional communities, university staff, vice-chancellors, campus activists and sporting organisations, and for all the other people who lent their support to the anti-VSU campaign. It is certainly a victory for the estimated 4,200 people employed by service providers at Australian universities who were set up, quite frankly, to lose their jobs as a result of VSU.</para>
<para>But let’s have a full victory. Let’s do away with the prospect of VSU once and for all. I would like nothing more than for the minister to come into the chamber today and announce the removal of the VSU legislation. The minister should admit that he has been defeated and stop clinging to the faint hope that, if he delays the passage of the legislation until 2007, those much needed extra votes might suddenly emerge.</para>
<para>I will not be opposing the legislation before us today, because I believe that it is important that all students be given the same opportunity to maintain the support services provided by student organisations. I will be supporting Labor’s second reading amendment calling on the government to withdraw the VSU bill, and I encourage all members opposite to do the same.</para>

<para>—I rise today to speak in opposition to the <inline ref="R2430">Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005</inline> and the <inline ref="R2428">Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005</inline>, and I speak in favour of the second reading amendment to be moved by the member for Jagajaga which will call for the withdrawal of the voluntary student unionism bill. As we saw yesterday, the Minister for Education, Science and Training was forced to delay his extreme attack on student services. The minister’s boyhood dream appears to have been shattered by Senator Barnaby Joyce. It appears that Backflip Barnaby has found his footing just in time. The delay to this legislation is an enormous victory for students on university campuses around this country. It is a victory for student organisations, regional communities, sporting groups and the arts community. These are groups in our community who vehemently oppose this legislation because they know what the VSU bill would do and how much damage it would inflict on student services and student life around this country.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The minister should listen to his parliamentary colleagues and drop this bill altogether. A delay will not change their minds, nor will it change the minds of those groups and communities that have fought so hard against it. Indeed, the National Union of Students and student organisations around the country have vowed to continue the campaign against this legislation until it is off the minister’s agenda forever. It is time that the minister listened to reason rather than pandering to fringe elements and extreme voices in his own party. The VSU legislation is motivated entirely by conservative political ideology. As the Leader of the Opposition rightly pointed out recently, instead of real reform and support for the higher education sector Minister Brendan Nelson has offered only his own ideological indulgences.</para>
<para>The government continues to paint itself as a reasonable reformer. It continues to assert that this debate is a matter of black and white and that the abolition of universal student unionism will be a simple matter of changing only a student’s enrolment options. By clouding the debate in its favourite rhetoric of ‘choice’, the government hopes to disguise the real outcome of the introduction of VSU. It is deeply misleading to assert that this legislation will not abolish student organisations. Funds will not miraculously appear to replace student contributions nor will private enterprise suddenly jump in to fill the voids left by defunct catering outlets and other services, including in child care, run by student organisations. Universities will not be able step in and fill the $161 million nationwide black hole that would be created by this legislation, given the government’s cuts to university funding in general.</para>
<para>In reality VSU means the closure of thousands of essential services. It will take choices away from Australian students. The arguments for VSU are spurious. The debate surrounding this issue has been shallow, slogan ridden and full of misconstrued facts. The government is muddying the waters of truth by asserting that it is this bill that will ensure freedom of association, when the vast majority of campuses already have opt-out or conscientious objection clauses. Membership is only available to those who have been accepted to study in a higher education institution and, most importantly, students are made fully aware of student union fees prior to their enrolment. No breach of freedom of association occurs—a fact reinforced through judgments made by both the Victorian and South Australian Supreme Courts in 1999.</para>
<para>The government is ignoring these facts. It is an arrogant government set on using its newly acquired Senate majority to implement a policy that not only has been opposed time and time again by the Senate but also proved disastrous when it was introduced at the state level. Both at home and abroad there are clear examples of the failure of VSU, the subsequent reduction in student services and the inevitable closure of student organisations. In 1994 the Victorian state government’s Tertiary Education Amendment Act 1994 prohibited universities from collecting fees from students on condition of enrolment but allowed institutions to voluntarily collect amenities and services fees. In 1994 the WA state government introduced the Voluntary Membership of Student Guilds and Associations Act, which prohibited universities from making student association membership a condition of enrolment and from imposing fees that were not directly related to their curriculum. In 1999 the Howard government tried to introduce the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill through the then education minister, the Hon. David Kemp. This was overwhelmingly opposed by the Senate and the Australian community.</para>
<para>The experience in Western Australia illustrates the disastrous effects of VSU. By 1999, the membership take-up rate by students was as low as six per cent on some campuses. The student guild at Edith Cowan University was forced into voluntary liquidation the same year. Even WA’s sandstone university, the University of Western Australia, was forced to slash its clubs and societies program, and the disabled student department was closed.</para>
<para>Let us not pretend that VSU does not mean the death of student organisations. New Zealand is the only other country in the world to allow VSU, legislating for universities to hold individual referendums in 1999. Only two campuses voted for a voluntary system. The University of Waikato reverted to universal membership a year later, citing a decline in student services and representation. The University of Auckland still charges a fee for student services which are now provided by the university. If the government’s argument of choice was anything other than shallow rhetoric, this legislation would implement campus referendums like those used in New Zealand. This would be a real choice for students. Instead, choice is only a slogan bandied around by the education minister to justify the closure of student organisations and to silence dissent.</para>
<para>Unlike the education minister, our international competitors recognise the value of universal membership of student organisations. Across England, Europe and, yes, North America, the universal levying of fees for student services and representation is the norm; it is a given. In the United Kingdom, membership of student unions is a condition of enrolment. Even the Thatcher government, while urged to take action to stop compulsory student union membership, rightly decided against it. America’s most prestigious institution, Harvard University, charges $US1,900 in an annual universal student levy. This fee does not include residential or health costs but goes in its entirety towards the provision of student services and representation. This kind of a fee is far from the $100 to $500 fees charged by Australian student organisations. If the education minister really wants our universities to be amongst the top 20 in the world, alongside the likes of Harvard, Oxford and Yale, then examining the student structures that these institutions protect and foster would be a valuable exercise. If our institutions are to continue to compete on an international stage, let alone rise to be amongst the top 20, then Australian students must not be denied the provision of similar welfare, study support, campus experience and personal development opportunities as enjoyed by students studying overseas.</para>
<para>The international reputation and competitiveness of our universities will suffer under the restrictions of VSU. It will act as a barrier in the free trade of higher education. In 2003 international students contributed approximately $1.7 billion to higher education institutions in tuition fees, an amount which adds up to 13.8 per cent of total revenue. Recently, concerns have been aired regarding the stalling of the international student market. While there are a number of contributing factors to this potential downturn, the introduction of voluntary student unionism will leave our institutions out in the cold. Australian universities market themselves internationally on the extracurricular opportunities available to students. Especially considering the emerging competitiveness of our neighbouring Chinese universities, with robust and vibrant campus cultures, international students will choose to stay within their region, or opt for an American or European institution, rather than bringing their scholarship and tuition fees to our shores.</para>
<para>This is not a debate about students being compelled to join trade unions. Student unions are not industrial unions; they are organisations that provide services and representation for a direct constituency. They do not work against or seek to undermine universities. Rather, they play a vital role in assisting universities to achieve their goal of providing a quality educational experience to all students. A far better analogy is likening student unions to local councils. Just as members of a local government area must pay fees for local services in the form of rates, members of a university community have a responsibility to pay for university services. While not every local resident may use the local library, child-care centre or park, it is compulsory that every resident pays, because unless that occurred the services simply would not exist. If given the choice, most residents of course would choose not to pay. However, the result would be no garbage collection, no child-care centre, no public library, no community functions, no swimming pools, no community programs and no support for residents, particularly the elderly. The same can be said of university campuses. Student unions can provide subsidised services. Unlike a private enterprise, the union’s aim is not to derive profit from provision. Similar to tax, services can be provided to students on a needs and costs price basis. As a member of a local community, we contribute rates. As a member of society, we pay taxes. As a member of a university community, students pay fees. The principles and outcomes are the same: a viable and fully-functioning community which looks after the interests of all.</para>
<para>Critics of student union services argue that students should have the option to pay for what they use and not pay for services that they do not. However, without universal membership students would not have the option of choosing different services because they simply would not be there. The government assumes that student services will be replaced. That simply would not be true for many campuses under VSU, particularly those in regional areas. Most students are only on campus approximately 30 weeks of the year. There is no rule against McDonald’s or some other institution or corporation setting up shop at the University of Sydney. They do not do it because it is not financially viable for them to do it—to have, for 20 weeks of the year, essentially no custom.</para>
<para>Things are much, much worse for Australia’s isolated campuses. Amber Jacobus, President of the University of Western Sydney Students Association, comments that vending machines would probably replace food outlets and says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Why would you come out to UWS, where there is no food on campus and no buses? That’s sort of degrading ... we already suffer that stigma of coming from the west.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">VSU will further divide the have- and have-not campuses. While the sandstone and Group of Eight universities will be able to attract some private enterprise, campuses like UWS will suffer. The introduction of VSU will only further the education minister’s agenda of creating a two-tiered higher education system in this country. The minister is intent on driving a wedge between the rich city campuses and those struggling in isolated areas.</para>
<para>In rural and regional areas young people often have little access to cultural and social opportunities. Student organisations currently fill the gap. At Monash University’s Gippsland campus the student union contributes funds to run the local leisure centre. At the University of New England the students association is the sole administrator of the student employment database and works with the local community to find jobs for students. The UNE students union partly funded the town’s local cinema and runs a 24-hour radio station—one of the oldest regional community radio stations in Australia.</para>
<para>Across this country student organisations often provide the only forms of these types of services in these rural and regional communities. The education minister continues to make the suggestion that student organisations are run by left-wing radical students who are misappropriating the funds of their peers. This is simply not true. Student organisations are democratic organisations. As with all democratic organisations, all members have a right to vote for their leaders and they have voted for leaders in the past, such as Joe Hockey, Peter Costello and Tony Abbott. If they do not like what their leaders say, they can vote them out and run for the position themselves.</para>
<para>The democratic process occurs annually on university campuses right around this country. Universal student union membership fees ensure that all students are represented and that they are provided with relevant campus services. Like them or hate them, student organisations have been at the forefront of vital campaigns for decades. Students have been trailblazers in successfully campaigning for real change on issues. The Vietnam War is a perfect example of this, where students played a key role in facilitating action against that war. Students have also been at the forefront of the massive public movement against the war in Iraq.</para>
<para>More recently, students have campaigned against this government’s attacks on higher education that saw a 25 per cent increase in HECS and an increase in the number of domestic undergraduate full fee paying places to 35 per cent for government funded courses. Whether or not you agree with that, the point is that dissent is a vital part of our civil society. It is vital that students have a right to have an organisation which expresses their views. On a number of views, which everyone agrees with such as the opposition to apartheid in South Africa, students played a critical role. No-one defends it now, but there was opposition from the current Prime Minister to sanctions opposing apartheid in South Africa. Thank goodness for the student movement.</para>
<para>The introduction of VSU would mean that there is no official body for students to participate in higher education policy. NUS continues to be the most effective representative lobby group for students and young people. The government has already got rid of the Australian Youth Policy Action Coalition and replaced it with the Prime Minister’s handpicked National Youth Roundtable—and as time goes on we hear less and less from that. This government has also slashed funding for environment and heritage groups in my portfolio throughout Australia, threatening to also remove their tax deductible status if they make any political statements. This is a government obsessed with silencing activity by community organisations.</para>
<para>Student organisations are not replaceable. Just on the border of my electorate sits the University of Sydney. There are many student organisations within Sydney university: the SRC, of which I was a member; the union; Sydney Uni Sport; and the Sydney University Postgraduate Representative Association. All of these organisations contribute to a vibrant and robust campus culture. These organisations provide opportunities for students to get involved in activities outside of the classroom, whether that be sport, clubs and societies or student politics. Through involvement in these extracurricular activities, students make friends, have relationships and develop themselves as human beings as well as having fun from time to time on the sports field. They develop skills such as preparing a budget for the film society, running a membership drive for the Christian club or arguing with the world’s brightest students through being involved in a global intervarsity debating tournament. These are skills in running and promoting organisations, in motivating people and in solving problems. They are skills demanded by Australian employers. They are skills which provide social capital and a benefit to the Australian community as a whole.</para>
<para>It has been said that, to develop these skills and retain a vibrant campus culture, only sport and social societies need be retained on campuses. However, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sydney has acknowledged the importance of a full range of activities. Professor Gavin Brown has said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I seriously believe that experience in student politics or in the SRC ... is enormously valuable both to the individuals who participate in it and ultimately to the country ... you should provide students with the opportunity to be engaged in serious political involvement while they are students, because that is ultimately to the net benefit of society.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The University of Sydney’s SRC has many advocate services such as help with Youth Allowance and Centrelink, legal matters, tax advice, harassment issue, academic issues, problems with university administration and tenancy advice. No other body within the university could provide these services to people, many of whom come from a disadvantaged background. How can a student be represented by simply an advocate whose employment is dependent upon the institution to which they are appealing? It is important that these organisations exist.</para>
<para>In summary, voluntary student unionism will mean the death of student organisations. It will not increase choice; it will take choice away. Students will be denied the choice to purchase subsidised food for their lunch. They will be denied the choice to put their child in child care whilst they attend class. They will be denied the choice to develop the essential skills that employers demand. They will be denied the choice to stand up and collectively oppose attacks on their own education and attacks on the education of their children. That is what this debate is about. When prominent individuals like John Coates and Kevan Gosper, of the AOC; Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush; David Clarke, the Executive Chairman of Macquarie Bank; and David Gallop of the NRL argued the case for student organisations, the minister would not listen. Now we have members of the coalition arguing the case. What the minister should do is stand with the community at large, say no to VSU and withdraw this legislation.</para>

<para>—The speech of the member for Grayndler was very well reasoned. It outlined, in a reasonable way, why the <inline ref="R2430">Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005</inline> and, indeed, the VSU bill cannot be accepted. But, of course, reason is not the basis for the government’s decision to introduce the bill under debate and the VSU bill into the House. It strikes me that this bill shows a level of hypocrisy by the government in how it deals with overseas students on the one hand and Australian students on the other.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Through this bill the government is seeking to continue with compulsory student service fees for overseas students while in its VSU bill it wants to prohibit them for Australian students. Why is there one law for foreign students and another law for Australian students? The reason is that the government seeks to silence dissent and to attack those that it perceives to be its opposition. In attacking what it perceives as political organisations, the government is willingly allowing all Australian students to lose essential services. This is a spiteful indulgence by the government. This bill and the VSU bill are unnecessary and a waste of the parliament’s time.</para>
<para>If the Minister for Education, Science and Training wanted to focus on things that matter in his portfolio, he would be looking at the shortage of places in our TAFEs and universities. He would be seeking to ensure that our education system is the best in the world. He would be focusing on ways to improve our current education system. Instead we see this spiteful, wanton behaviour by a government that is out of touch and has no regard for anyone who chooses to disagree with it on any particular matter. The member for Grayndler was right: there are organisations that have been systematically confronted by this government and punished for contradicting the government’s view on certain matters.</para>
<para>I had the good fortune to go to Monash University. For some of the time I was involved in my student union. I was also involved in sporting associations, debating clubs and the ALP club, of which I was happy to be president for some time. I remember that most students did not involve themselves actively, or at least on a weekly basis, in student politics. I can certainly understand that; there are so many other things to be doing and constraints on people’s time. Many students have to make a living so they can afford their education and there are so many other pursuits that you can undertake at university. But I was involved and, indeed, the Treasurer, who went to Monash University, while not in the ALP club, was in the Labour Club, as I understand it. He was very active; in fact he became the chairperson—I think it was called—of MAS, the Monash Association of Students. The Treasurer sought to be an office bearer of the student union and associated with a political organisation called the Labour Club.</para>
<para>I want to tell the Treasurer this: introducing a bill that would remove the capacity for campuses to provide services to their students will not change the fact that he played a role in the Labour Club and was the chairperson—that is, the equivalent of president—of the student union at Monash. It seems like this is a 20-year payback by the Treasurer. The bizarre thing about it is that this student at Monash, who sought the highest office you could reach in the union, at the time did not advocate voluntary student unionism or that fees should be paid on a voluntary basis and was happy to have his university degree paid for and to be the chairperson of the student union. It is quite hypocritical of the Treasurer and other members of government who had active political roles on their campuses to later remove that capacity for students of today. As I said, a small minority decide to involve themselves in the specifically politically active areas of student unions. Indeed, the money afforded to that activity is negligible when you look at the budget of student unions and what they are expended upon.</para>
<para>The overwhelming proportion of the budget expended on campuses across the country is used for services such as housing and accommodation, child-care, transport and employment assistance—vital services that enable those students who need assistance to be given it. This is where you see the government, as I said, being indulgent in wanting to fight old fights and where it is being wasteful by not focusing on the things that matter in education.</para>
<para>I understand that the minister for education probably has some proving to do of himself—that he indeed has the politics of the government side. Here is a man who boasted that he never voted for the Liberal Party. Here is the minister for education who boasted that he always voted Labor and that he was a member of the ALP. He used to wear an earring as well. Last term he wore an earring, but he has since got rid of it. That is fair enough. He also got rid of his ALP membership, but that clearly is not enough. What the minister for education has to prove to the hard Right on the other side of the chamber is that he is willing to indulge in ideological battles at student campuses.</para>
<para>So here we are, in the most important chamber in the land, having to debate matters about student politics. This is the Commonwealth of Australia’s pre-eminent chamber, and we are having to consider legislation that is about fighting student politicians. As we know, this is motivated by revenge on the part of some on the other side. The <inline ref="R2428">Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005</inline>—which is contradictory to the VSU bill—is a case of the minister proving himself worthy of being a Liberal Party minister because of his history. We have seen it with all the legislation that he has introduced since he has been the education minister. We saw it first with the universities and the TAFEs being punished—that is, deprived of Commonwealth expenditure—if they did not introduce Australian workplace agreements at each TAFE and university.</para>

<para>—I agree with the member for Cowan’s point of order, but I am not surprised that the minister at the table felt the need to stand up and defend the minister for education—he needs a lot of defending. There is no doubt that the minister for education needs a lot of defending because of the way in which he has decided to introduce the <inline ref="R2428">Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005.</inline> It clearly shows a contradictory approach by the minister and the government by allowing, on the one hand, voluntary fees to be applied to Australian students should the VSU bill be passed and, on the other hand, incorporating compulsory fees for overseas students in the bill before us.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The minister at the table has been out to my electorate, and I am still waiting for the much promised Sunshine college. I attended the meeting that the minister convened and, in good faith, I listened to him about this proposed college. There are many young people in desperate need of training in my electorate. When the government said before the election that they would build the Sunshine college, these young people believed that that college would be built, starting next year. But there has been no news from the government and the minister at the table about it—and it is the minister’s responsibility.</para>
<para>Returning to the bill before us, I want to draw a comparison between it and the fact that the government has chosen to contradict the policy it outlined in the VSU bill. I understand that the minister for education has to prove his worth, given his history of association with Labor. I am even considering the notion that the Treasurer has to support the expunging of student unions because of his former association with the labour club at Monash University. I understand that this might be some sort of ritual passage, some sort of initiation process, that the minister for education has to go through in order to fulfil his obligations to the Liberal Party. Essentially, the government are not focusing on those things that matter to the bulk of the student population; instead, they are choosing to punish those people whom they see as being in disagreement with them.</para>
<para>I understand why the VSU bill has not been enacted and certainly not been passed in the chambers to date. One of the reasons why the minister has had to delay the voluntary student unionism bill and, instead, this week introduce the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005 and the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005 is that the National Party have grave concerns that the bill is very unpopular in their electorates. The Nationals understand that the student union fee is required for fundamental services that students need in their everyday lives. The Nationals are not caught up in some sort of AUS or NUS war—some sort of student political battleground that the member for Indi, the Treasurer, the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Minister for Education, Science and Training seem to be indulging in. The Nationals—including Senator Joyce—understand that, if you go to the campuses in regional Australia, those services that are provided to students are necessary and essential. That is what worried me yesterday when I heard the member for Bass say in this place that child care is not an essential service.</para>
<para>I read the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> because I think there was some attempt to suggest that he said otherwise. The member for Bass was actually arguing that nothing incorporated in the student amenities was essential. He was asked whether child care was essential and he said that it was not. Most of the Nationals in this chamber know that services like that are essential. I was very disturbed and surprised that the member for Bass—someone who represents Launceston, a great part of northern Tasmania and a fantastic part of this country—said in this place that child care is not essential. It may not be essential to him, but he has to think outside of his own circumstance and understand how important child care is for many parents who are trying to earn a living or indeed seeking to improve themselves through education. The fact that he does not have the wit to understand the importance of child care as a service at a campus level is an indication of the government’s ignorance or contempt of students in need of services.</para>
<para>Some people may have the private means to study without a great deal of support. Some students are parents—in some circumstances possibly single parents—looking after their kids, trying to better themselves, trying to acquire a more formal education so that they can find a suitable job, and it is very unfortunate indeed that the member for Bass thinks that that type of service which assists students is not essential. But it is indicative of the government’s lack of regard for students and their basic needs. It is indicative that the government is so obsessed about silencing dissent—that is, attacking so-called student politicians—that it is very happy to throw out all other services that are required for all students.</para>
<para>I should not be surprised, but I am very disappointed that the member for Bass has that view. I would be very disappointed if that view that child care is not essential is shared by other government members. I can assure you that that is not the view on this side of the chamber. Labor believe that students deserve decent services. We believe that there is nothing wrong in allowing for a fee that would ensure that that assistance is available for people who require it, whether it be housing assistance, employment assistance, transport assistance or, indeed, child-care assistance. The fact that the government is quite happy to throw all of that out in its spiteful indulgence in attacking what it sees as its enemy shows how little this government is concerned about education and how it is more interested in having old fights with student politicians.</para>

<para>—I am pleased to make a contribution to this debate on the <inline ref="R2430">Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005</inline> and the <inline ref="R2428">Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment Bill 2005</inline>. I make a couple of observations about the ESOS bill. Sections of the ESOS Bill will allow a university to charge fees to international students for services such as counselling and advocacy support services, which the VSU bill would deny local students. I am reminded of the second reading amendment that the shadow spokesperson on education, Ms Macklin, will be moving:</para>

<para class="block">We can see the hypocrisy. On the one hand, the minister is enshrining in legislation the right of universities to charge a fee for services for overseas students while, on the other hand, through the so-called voluntary student unionism legislation, the minister wants to outlaw universities charging Australian students a fee for exactly the same purpose. What do we call that? Trying to walk both sides of the street, or do we call it as it is—an absolute act of hypocrisy?</para>
<para>The government knows that if Australian universities are to be taken seriously as academic institutions overseas, they cannot be seen to be stripped of their vibrant campus life and support services for students. This is yet more proof that the proposed legislation has everything to do with ideology and bashing political opposition to the government and nothing to do with choice for students.</para>
<para>Although the education minister has backed down, I note that there is a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> this morning, headed ‘Howard to press on with university reform’, in which the Prime Minister is reported to have said:</para>

<para>—that is, they do not yet have the numbers. We have seen only this week Senator Barnaby Joyce demonstrating on at least one occasion that he is prepared to stand up to the bullying of the government, so they cannot be certain that they have the support of Senator Barnaby Joyce—and I do not think they can be certain that they have the support of the National Party generally. They certainly do not have the support of the vice-chancellors of Australia’s universities, the student bodies of Australia’s universities, the academic bodies of Australia’s universities and, dare I say it, the wider Australian community.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>It is important to understand that what we see here is the government taking a backwards step because someone in a position of influence and power—that is, someone with a vote in the Senate—has dared to front it. The government won the last election so handsomely that it got control of the Senate. One would have thought the government would have chosen to use that power responsibly, but it is very clear now that this government has chosen to abuse process and to abuse the power it has in this place by introducing legislation such as the VSU legislation. This legislation does not have community support, the support of the academic community generally or the support of the leadership of the universities, yet the government intends to impose upon the Australian community its ideological fixation with the abolition of student unions, ignoring the wonderful work carried out by these organisations in the universities.</para>
<para>Somehow, by parading around the country because you are part of a student body, you are ipso facto an activist—someone who might go out and put their hand up to oppose the government’s decisions. What a hide! The hide of university students actually expressing a view and walking in the streets and demonstrating their opinion! I am a child of the sixties and I am very pleased that I am, because I was able to participate in and observe the demonstrations, led from the university campuses, about Australia’s involvement in Vietnam. Imagine if this government had been in power then! What would they have been doing to those students? All sorts of things, one would imagine, but they would certainly not have been allowing them the freedom to demonstrate their views, to organise collectively and to use the resources they had available to them to express their views publicly and to try and influence public opinion.</para>
<para>That is very important. I think we need to appreciate the importance of the student bodies in universities, historically and worldwide, for their ability to hold governments to account and raise issues of importance to the Australian community and the world community. This government says, ‘Because they might do that, and because we might have a few activists on the campuses who might be taking leadership positions against us, we will ban them—get rid of them—and abolish university union fees, and students will no longer be required to affiliate with these organisations.’ Never mind the fact that the quantum of money spent by these organisations on political activities is infinitesimally small in comparison to what they spend on the sports facilities they administer and fund and the cultural activities and welfare services that they administer and fund.</para>
<para>We have heard from the member for Gorton that he reviewed yesterday’s <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and learned that the member for Bass said in this place yesterday that child care is not an essential service. Tell that to the single parents who are university students and require child care. Tell that to the young couples who have children and might be students. We were not all born with a silver spoon in our mouths. Some of us have been workers. Some of us understand the need to put ourselves through universities—as we have done—and to fund our own living expenses—</para>

<para>—Or TAFE, in your case, comrade. I am pleased to see that you have been to one. The arrogance of this government knows no bounds. That is demonstrated by the view now expressed by the government that they can do anything at any time in this place. We have seen again this morning how the government abuse their power in this place. The VSU legislation is but one example. We had another example this morning with the introduction of the nuclear waste management legislation in this place, which completely ignores the views and concerns of the community of the Northern Territory. But because they can do it they will. Because they believe they can get it through the House of Representatives and the Senate, they will. No matter how extreme it might be, they will do it. We see it again in the emerging and current debate on industrial relations.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>We know where this is coming from. We are in a time warp. We have been taken back to the sixties by the Prime Minister and this government, because these are the views he expressed when he first came into this parliament. We see that ideology riven throughout the minds of the government members, but I am sure it is not in their hearts. I cannot believe for one moment that all of the people on the government benches support the propositions about the abolition of student unions. I cannot believe it; I do not believe it—because we all know they do not. Ordinarily, they are gutless but, thankfully, there was a glimmer of hope this week when one National Party senator from Queensland voted with the opposition. So maybe, instead of lying supine at the feet of the Prime Minister, some of them will get a bit of steel in their backbone and stand up to him instead. If they are prepared to do that, we might see a viable debate in this place and see people really value the notion of democracy: that we can have alternative views properly debated both in the party room and the chamber, instead of having people trodden on and belted.</para>
<para>You can just imagine what has happened to Barnaby Joyce this week—and we hear that Minister Vaile is coming back from overseas on Friday. It is reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> this morning that he says he is going to talk to him—that is, Barnaby. Well, what sort of counselling session do you think that might be? Barnaby, my friend, you just keep going on as you are. Do not be counselled by these people. You stand up for what you think is right. I know for certain that, in the case of the concerns that I have about the way in which this government operates in the Northern Territory, those people from the Country Liberal Party who sit on the government benches here in the House of Representatives and in the Senate—the member for Solomon and Senator Scullion—will not stand up for the Northern Territory like Barnaby Joyce has stood up for his consistency. They will not stand up for the students at Charles Darwin University.</para>
<para>What do you think is going to happen to a place like Charles Darwin University? Of the 1,100 units offered previously by the university, 340 units have been cut this year. In Alice Springs, in the business school nine courses are advertised this year. In the past those nine courses have had lecturers in front of students in classrooms. Of those nine courses, only two courses will have lecturers in classrooms. The other people will be expected to do their courses online. Given that sort of environment and knowing it has lost millions of dollars as a result of decisions deliberately taken by this government, what capacity has Charles Darwin University got to augment or supplement or act in lieu of the work which is currently being done by the student union as a result of the fees which are paid to it by its students? We know the answer to that is very simple. If it has already cut courses because it cannot fund the university properly because of decisions taken by this government, what hope has it got of maintaining the services which are currently provided by the student union? We know the answer to that, don’t we?</para>
<para>This is a small university in the Northern Territory and this government—it is an absolute joke—on every occasion that it possibly could, has shown its absolute contempt for the people of the Northern Territory and the services that they have access to—utter contempt. As I said this morning, we saw it again with the introduction of nuclear waste dump legislation—absolute contempt for the people of the Northern Territory. Here we see it again with this VSU legislation. We see their short-sighted fixation on getting their ideological fix. We should not ignore the fact that there are some fundamental issues here. The universities do not support the government. The student bodies do not support the government. The academics do not support the government. The bulk of students would be most concerned about their inability to access services in the future. When I spoke in a previous debate on this subject, I quoted from a piece by Kent Rowe, who was president of the Charles Darwin University Students Union. I will do that again:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">But sausage rolls are not the issue. Since the 1996 election the Howard government has removed $6 million a year in recurrent funding from our CDU alone, or around $40 million to date. Last year his government introduced HECS changes which included a 25% rise in HECS fees, and also opened the door for “buy your future” $200,000 degrees. Students also enjoy GST on text books and increasing student to staff ratios.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">As I have said as an addendum, they now have the indignity of seeing units slashed because of the university’s inability to resource them. He goes on:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">None of these policies have been good for students and, in pursuing its role of standing up for the best interests of students, the Students’ Union has rightly criticised the Government for them.</para>
<para class="block">The Howard Government irritated by informed, organized criticism of his anti-student policies by Students’ Organisations, so now he wants to shut us up. The legislation his government introduced in Parliament today is designed to do just that. What kind of Government bans students from making organised political comment?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Let us think about this. What kind of government seeks to ban students from making organised political comment? Let us have three examples. He gives the Suharto government in Indonesia in 1978, Deng Xiaoping in China 1989—and we all recall the infamous Tiananmen Square massacres—with the other being John Howard in Australia in 2005. What shame! What shame this Prime Minister is bringing on us as a nation! These extreme steps are not based on any rationale which can be reasonably adduced as coming from discussion, conversation, consensus or even good debate but they come from his own ideological fixation on what he believes.</para>
<para>The Australian community should not have to stand for this. Certainly Australian students should not have to stand for it. We need to comprehend that, if these changes are to proceed, in the case of the Northern Territory, without a shadow of a doubt we will see the student services which are currently provided by the university through the student union all but disappear. Forget about the student political activity; just think about their access to the welfare services, the child-care services, the cultural activities that they participate in and the sports activities which they are responsible for running and administering. Is that not shameful? We now have a piece of legislation which shows the hypocrisy of the government. It is now proposing, through the ESOS bill, that we allow people to charge fees for students from overseas. What does that tell you?</para>
<para>I am embarrassed at times to stand in this place and observe and debate the government because of what it is doing. I have been in this place a long time and I have to say that, even in their most strident days, the Hawke and Keating governments never abused their position and power in the way in which this government is doing. We are seeing a succession of decisions taken by this government, a succession of legislation being passed through this parliament which is aimed at denying access to services, such as this, or imposing the government’s will on communities that do not want that will imposed upon them, such as the <inline ref="R2453">Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Bill 2005</inline>, which was introduced in this place this morning. We are seeing it time and time again, and it is shameful.</para>
<para>I am concerned about it. I am concerned about the state of our democracy when the government can choose to abuse its power the way it has. But, as I said earlier, there is a ray of hope, a light which sparkles at the moment. Let us see if it continues to do so. There is at least one coalition member in the Senate—and we know that there is a coalition member in this place who stood up to the government on Telstra—who has at least this week been prepared to stand up to the government. Let us hope it continues. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Before I begin summing up the debate on the <inline ref="R2430">Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005</inline> and cognate bill, I would like to set the record straight in relation to some funding that is provided by the Australian government for our universities and for higher education. If you listen to members of the opposition, you would think that there had been a significant amount of money taken away from our universities and higher education sector. In fact, it is quite the opposite. There will be, and there has been as a result of the work of the Minister for Education, Science and Training and his reforms to the higher education sector, an extra $11 billion of new money that will be injected into the higher education sector over the next 10 years.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In summing up, I would like to thank all of those who spoke on the bill for their interest in this significant development in higher education in Australia. The Australian government is committed to developing a strong, high-quality higher education sector which not only underpins our economic, cultural and social development but also competes with the best on the international level. Higher education is increasingly being delivered in a global context. Just as Australian universities are establishing branches, campuses and alliances in other countries, foreign universities are similarly looking to expand their operations into Australia. The changes proposed by these bills to the Higher Education Support Act 2003 provide a framework for the higher education sector in Australia that will ensure the sector’s international competitiveness. The amendments will enable higher quality foreign universities which want to offer courses to Australian and international students in Australia to be listed as higher education providers in the Higher Education Support Act 2003.</para>
<para>Together with the amendments to the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000, the changes will allow Carnegie Mellon University, a private United States based institution, to operate an overseas branch in Australia. Carnegie Mellon University will offer education and training services to international and domestic students in Australia for the commencement of the 2006 academic year. Carnegie Mellon University is a prestigious private, not-for-profit institution, currently ranked No. 38 out of 200 on the <inline font-style="italic">Times Higher Education Supplement</inline> ranking of world universities and ranked 54 out of 500 on the Jiao Tong University’s ranking of top world universities. These amendments reflect the Australian government’s commitment to giving students greater choice of excellence in higher education. The anticipated entry of Carnegie Mellon University into Australia will enhance that choice.</para>
<para>The bill inserts a new list of table C providers, being overseas higher education institutions with Australian branches that have been approved under the national protocols for the higher education approval process. Table C providers will have limited access to certain Commonwealth assistance, including FEE-HELP and OS-HELP. As a result, Australian students studying at Carnegie Mellon University will have access to the same entitlements that they would if they had enrolled at an Australian higher education provider, reflecting the Australian government’s commitment to ensuring that all eligible Australian students are granted equal access to entitlements. The introduction of Carnegie Mellon will invigorate the Australian higher education sector, generating worldwide interest and publicity. It will also attract more students to Adelaide from the Asia-Pacific region, bringing increased revenue and prestige to South Australia as an international centre for higher education.</para>
<para>The amendments will also strengthen tuition assurance requirements under the Higher Education Support Act 2003. The <inline ref="R2430">Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005</inline> contains a number of amendments to the act that better reflect the policy intent of tuition assurance requirements. These amendments include mechanisms that will provide improved, comprehensive consumer protection for students studying at non-table A providers in the event that a higher education provider ceases to offer a course in which the student was enrolled. The amendments clarify that, where a private provider ceases to offer a course, students will not be financially disadvantaged. Students can either switch to another higher education provider without incurring any additional cost or have the option of obtaining a refund for the uncompleted units. If a student chooses to transfer to another provider, the amendments ensure that the student will not pay twice for that unit. The second provider will bear the cost, as is the current practice. Where the refund option is taken, any HELP debt will be remitted, and the student learning entitlement and FEE-HELP balances are to be repaid to the student. Under the tuition assurance, a student who transfers to another provider and then withdraws due to illness or family circumstances will also be able to obtain a refund and a recrediting of the student learning entitlement. The second provider will not bear any cost in such cases.</para>
<para>The Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 established the national elements for the regulation of international education and sought to ensure international students receive the education and training for which they have paid. The act strengthened public confidence in the student visa program by ensuring that only genuine students come to Australia to study under these arrangements and that they are appropriately supported in doing so. To do this, the ESOS framework requires higher education providers to meet a range of obligations. In particular, it ensures that all registered providers, including universities, continue to make certain support services available to overseas students. These services are required under the Education Services for Overseas Students Act National Code of Practice for Registration Authorities and Providers of Education and Training to Overseas Students—the national code. This includes appropriate arrangements for independent grievance handling and dispute resolution, and access to information on counselling services, orientation, academic progress, further study and accommodation.</para>
<para>It is a longstanding policy of the Australian government that non-Australian government funding, tuition fees or student contributions paid by Australian students should be used to subsidise the tuition or services provided to overseas students. The government is determined to maintain this policy and, as such, it is necessary to ensure the privacy of charging overseas students for the services defined in the national code. The amendment allows a provider to include an amount in its tuition fee, but not a separate fee, to cover the national code requirements. This, however, is not a new policy but one that reinforces current requirements to ensure that overseas students receive quality protection—one of the major attractions for overseas students coming to Australia, in fact.</para>
<para>The amendment does not place an additional legislative financial requirement upon educational providers, including universities. I urge you to support this legislation, and I commend this bill to the House.</para>

<para>—Nobody is suggesting that Australian students should pay for the services received by overseas students, and Labor do support this amendment bill which will see overseas students paying a compulsory fee. The question we are asking is: why is it all right for overseas students to pay a compulsory fee for counselling services but not all right for Australian students to pay a compulsory fee for counselling services for Australian students?</para>

<para>—I make the point that these services are limited services. They include independent grievance handling, dispute resolution services, counselling services regarding orientation and academic progress, services for further study and accommodation, the approval of accommodation and welfare arrangements for overseas students under 18 years of age, and the appointment of a student contact officer who is responsible for the provision of support services to overseas students, including counselling. These services will promote the successful adjustment by overseas students to life and study at an Australian institution and assist those students to resolve problems which could impede successful completion of their study programs. If you look at those limited services, nobody could reason that they should not be paid for; they should be supported because of the nature of these overseas students.</para>

<para>—In answer to the member for Jagajaga—and in conclusion—this bill has been debated by both sides of parliament for quite a period of time. In relation to that, this government is a government of choice; it is all about being able to provide people with a choice and being able to provide students with a choice. We are simply saying that if students do not want to pay a compulsory fee at a university then they should not have to. It is as simple as that. This is very simplistic. The feeling from many students is that they agree with this.</para>

</item>
</list>
</motion>
<para class="block">The primary purpose of the bill is to create new video link evidence provisions under the Crimes Act 1914, which will apply to proceedings for terrorism and other related offences and also to proceeds of crime proceedings relating to those offences. The bill provides for video link evidence to be used in proceedings for certain terrorism and related offences. This is provided for mainly by item 5 in the schedule, which inserts a new part 1AE into the Crimes Act.</para>
<para>According to the explanatory memorandum, the coverage of these offences has been intentionally broad so that they cover not only direct terrorist offences but also peripheral and ancillary related offences, such as the giving of false and misleading statements to ASIO while being questioned under warrant for a terrorist offence. Important evidence from overseas witnesses that are unable to travel to Australia could be put before the court, using video link technology, unless there are compelling reasons why this would be inappropriate.</para>
<para>The bill also makes consequential amendments to the Foreign Evidence Act 1994 and to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. The bill will amend the following legislation for unrelated purposes: the Crimes Act 1914, to modify matching profiles rules for DNA databases; the Financial Transactions Reports Act 1988, to correct an unintentional omission from the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002; the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, to fix an error in regulations and enable payments out of confiscated assets accounts; and the Surveillance Devices Act 2004, to enable law enforcement officers to retrieve authorised surveillance devices under warrant.</para>
<para>This bill has been referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, and the committee will report back on 1 November. While most of the bill is uncontentious in its effect, there do appear to be several issues relating to video link evidence that the committee will need to examine closely, including the differential treatment of the prosecution and defendants in relation to the use of evidence in the proposed amendments to both the Crimes Act 1914 and the Foreign Evidence Act 1994. Another issue that will need to be examined closely is the retrospective effect on proceedings that have already commenced, and there are several other minor matters, including inconsistencies in the treatment of video link evidence between various sections of the Crimes Act. Labor’s primary concern with this bill lies in the provision of differential treatment of prosecutors and defendants in relation to the test for refusing admissibility.</para>
<para>I will move now to the issues surrounding the use of video link evidence in criminal matters generally. The use of video link, also known as television link or CCTV, evidence is well established overseas. It is also widely used in civil proceedings in Australia. When it comes to its use in the criminal law, New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, Queensland and Tasmania all provide for video link evidence in criminal matters. In the federal jurisdiction, video link evidence is currently available under the Crimes Act 1914, part 1AD, for child witnesses; the Crimes Act 1914, part 3A, for child sex tourism offences; the Evidence and Procedure (New Zealand) Act 1994; the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987; and the Foreign Evidence Act 1994, as so determined in the Australian courts.</para>
<para>So legislative provisions to protect child witnesses and/or sex offence witnesses from intimidation, distress or psychological harm associated with recounting their experiences in a daunting courtroom environment are already in place, and were supported by Labor. Part lAD of the Crimes Act 1914 already provides, in relation to sexual offences, for the giving of evidence by child witnesses under the age of 18 by closed-circuit television, video recording or other alternative means and that a child witness may be accompanied by an adult when giving evidence. In addition, part IIIA of the act in relation to child sex tourism offences makes similar provisions for the giving of evidence by witnesses of all ages, with the additional provision covering unreasonable expense or inconvenience. In addition, video link can be used in various other matters under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 and the Foreign Evidence Act 1994. And that is a brief synopsis of video link law as it stands at present.</para>
<para>The new regime proposed in this bill is an issue that we now need to discuss. The provisions before us are intended to apply to certain terrorist and terrorism related offences listed in proposed section 15YU and will cover all criminal proceedings, including committals, for those offences. The regime as proposed will specifically exclude defendants from giving evidence by video link. Proposed section 15YU(3) makes the effect retrospective for proceedings instituted before the commencement of the new part 1AE, as well as for proceedings instituted after that date. That is something that Labor believes the committee needs to consider in terms of its appropriateness.</para>
<para>Another issue relates to fair treatment and balance between the prosecution and the defence. Under the bill, the court must ‘direct’ or ‘by order, allow’ a witness to give evidence by video link if they are ‘available’ or ‘will reasonably be available’ to do so. Both prosecutors and defendants may apply for such orders and must give reasonable notice to the court of their intent to make such an application. However, the tests that are applied to such requests appear to differ depending on whether the request is made by a prosecutor or defence. There is a legitimate query of how this conforms with the general common-law requirement that a criminal trial be fair.</para>
<para>The provisions in the bill in relation to the admissibility of video link evidence appear clearly to favour the prosecution by providing a narrower test for the court when considering whether it can refuse an application from prosecutors. For the prosecution, a court can disallow the application if making the order would have a ‘substantial adverse effect on the right of a defendant’ to receive a fair hearing. For the defendant, a court can disallow the application if the making of the order would be ‘inconsistent with the interests of justice for the evidence to be given by video link’.</para>
<para>This dual test is at variance with those currently in the act. Labor’s concerns on this issue are equally applicable to items 22 to 25 that amend the provisions of the Foreign Evidence Act 1994, which deal with other types of foreign material such as videotapes and transcripts of examinations to treat as foreign evidence. In amending the Foreign Evidence Act the bill also proposes a dual test for non-video link evidence from foreign jurisdictions creating a separate regime for the prosecution of designated offences. The present test in section 25 applies to both prosecution and defendant. Under this test it must be:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... to the court’s satisfaction that, having regard to the interests of the parties to the proceeding, justice would be better served if the foreign material were not adduced as evidence.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The test proposed under the new section 25A is applicable to the prosecution only and it reads:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... the court may direct that the foreign material not be adduced as evidence in the proceeding if the court is satisfied that adducing the foreign material would have a substantial adverse effect on the right of a defendant in the proceeding to receive a fair hearing.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In the provisions for both video link evidence in the Crimes Act and the non-video evidence regime covered in the Foreign Evidence Act, the effect of the changes is to weaken the court’s discretion to disallow prosecution evidence. The differential test for prosecution and defence, the inconsistency with current legislation and the problem of retrospectivity in procedural terms are all a major concern for Labor.</para>
<para>Another issue that may arise under this new bill is the limited ability of the Australian courts to apply the law of contempt and perjury to witnesses giving evidence via video link from a foreign country. Contempt is primarily concerned with conduct that interferes with the administration of justice and may be subjected to legal sanctions, including custodial offences. Perjury is the offence of intentionally misleading a court. The powers of courts to deal with cases of contempt or perjury are a major component of judicial power, but it is unclear from the bill how these matters would be addressed in order to ensure fairness to the accused and to ensure that the court in question is able to have available adequate sanctions to supervise the administration of justice.</para>
<para>Labor do not oppose the use of video link evidence but, as I have outlined, we do have some serious concerns about the video link provisions in the present bill. Rather than achieving consistent treatment across the law, the bill creates another video link evidence regime that is often at considerable variance with those already present in Commonwealth law. In addition, the definition of ‘observer’ in this bill under proposed section 15YV is excessively loose and should specifically rule out criminals and terrorists.</para>
<para>The second question is why the bill inserts yet another separate video link regime into the Crimes Act. Given the prevalence of video link evidence in other parts of federal criminal law and its extensive use in state and overseas jurisdictions and in our civil law, it is appropriate that we consider whether this bill is in fact too limited in its scope. Accordingly I move the second reading amendment that is circulated in my name, which outlines Labor’s concerns and the need for the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee to closely scrutinise and flesh out options for improving these provisions in the bill.</para>
<para>I might now briefly summarise some of the other measures contained in the bill. The bill includes a change to forensic procedures to expand the number of DNA profiles a volunteer can be tested against and to remove the requirement that interjurisdictional matching be confined to a specific investigation. Items 6 and 7 amend the Crimes Act to repeal the existing definition of tape recording at section 23B(1) and replace it with a definition that includes digital recording. This is not related to the taking of video link evidence but instead to the taping of interviews.</para>
<para>The two other acts that will be altered by this bill are the Proceeds of Crime Act and the Surveillance Devices Act. Schedule 1, items 26 to 28 amend the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to clarify that the new video link evidence provisions of Part IAE apply to the Proceeds of Crime Act and to insert a new provision to allow payments out of the confiscated assets accounts in relation to the conduct of an examination with the approval of the DPP. The amendment will empower the DPP to approve payment to a third party which has carried out an examination under the act. This provision is not part of the video link provisions. And, finally, the bill will correct the status of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal members to retrospectively validate examinations conducted under the act by AAT members who were inadvertently divested of their power to conduct such examinations by an error in regulations.</para>
<para>Schedule 1, items 29 and 30 amend the Surveillance Devices Act to clarify that a law enforcement officer may apply for a retrieval warrant for a tracking device that was lawfully installed. The current act provides only for a surveillance device to be retrieved. These other measures are largely uncontentious; but, as mentioned previously, Labor has concerns with this bill and will closely examine the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report, when it is released, before making our final judgment on the bill.</para>
<para>The second reading amendment that I have moved outlines the significant concerns that I have already gone through. In summary, the issues that are of particular concern to Labor are the number of the video link measures that appear to be inconsistent with other current measures in the act; the measures that would take effect retrospectively for proceedings instituted before the commencement of these new measures; the effect of changes to weaken the court’s discretion to disallow prosecution evidence; the disparity between treatment of prosecution and defence requests—the same problem arises again under the Foreign Evidence Act 1994 where a new section introduces a narrower test for the court’s discretion in allowing video link evidence; the issue that there is no adequate definition of an observer in the bill; a limited ability for courts to enforce contempt and perjury laws in cases where video link evidence is received from a foreign country; and, finally, whether the coverage of the bill is adequate. These concerns are all factors which we would expect the Senate committee to address in its report on this bill.</para>
<para>Perhaps our greatest concern about this bill is that it appears to have been prepared by the Attorney-General in a rather slapdash manner without a full and proper consideration of the issues involved. Why, for example, is video link evidence in criminal matters to be limited to just child sex tourism, child witnesses and terrorist offences, especially given that New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, Queensland and Tasmania all have much broader capabilities for use of video link evidence in dealing with criminal law matters?</para>
<para>Indeed, we can use video link evidence at the Commonwealth level on a broad criminal law basis under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act and the Foreign Evidence Act. Why is it that the government is tinkering around the edges when it is clearly time to put in place a broader regime in the Crimes Act with necessary protections in place? As it is, the changes in this bill could leave Australia unprepared to take video link evidence in relation to other non-terrorist related federal crimes like sex trafficking, drug trafficking or people smuggling. In its haste to put these changes up, the government has dropped the ball when it comes to implementing a broad regime to assist the courts in fighting crime.</para>
<para>Given all of those remarks, I make clear that Labor will support the bill in the House, while reserving our right to amend or oppose the bill in the Senate after seeing the recommendations from the Senate committee report.</para>

<para>—I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the <inline ref="R2421">Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Video Link Evidence and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline>. The technical amendments in this bill demonstrate the Howard government’s continued commitment to combating terrorism. The purpose of this bill is to create new video link evidence provisions that apply to proceedings for terrorism and other related offences and proceeds of crime relating to those offences. These new provisions will facilitate the prosecution of terrorism offences by ensuring that, in the absence of compelling reasons to the contrary, important evidence from overseas witnesses who are unable to travel to Australia can be put before the court using video link technology. The bill also amends the Foreign Evidence Act 1994 to facilitate the use of foreign material as evidence in proceedings for terrorism and related offences and proceeds of crime relating to those offences. These changes complement the new video link evidence provisions and will assist in circumstances where it is not possible for evidence to be given by video link.</para>

Yesterday we remembered the 88 decent Australians and three permanent residents of this country who lost their lives in the terrorist bombings in Bali. They were young innocent Australians enjoying a holiday in a beautiful part of the world. They were senselessly struck down amidst the joy of being amongst their family and friends and the beautiful people of Bali. Yesterday, we stopped to mourn their loss with their families.</para>
<para>As the Prime Minister described at the time, what happened was barbaric, brutal mass murder without justification. It was a terrible reminder that terrorism can strike anyone, anywhere, at any time. Nobody anywhere in the world is immune from terrorism. We are reminded that, in this borderless world, with a particularly mobile young population, Australia has dearly learned that we too are not immune from such horrible attacks. This unfortunately was demonstrated again with another attack in Bali on 1 October this year. Again Australians going about something as inoffensive as a joyful holiday have had their lives interrupted and, in the case of four fellow Australians, taken away. I wish to briefly refer to an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> of Thursday, 13 October. This article expressively evokes the sentiments of many Australians. The article is entitled ‘Aussies unite in grief against “ideology of hate”’:</para>

<para class="block">Looking again at this legislation before us, most state and territory legislation allows for evidence to be taken by video link from witnesses overseas. But, generally, the decision to grant an application to take evidence by video link is discretionary, based on an assessment of whether it would be fair to the defendant and whether it would be convenient or in the interests of justice.</para>
<para>Being mindful of this week in Canberra and in the parliament, this legislation is very timely. The proposed video link evidence provisions will limit the discretion of the court to refuse applications for a witness to give evidence by video link in terrorism proceedings, whilst ensuring that the right of the defendant to receive a fair hearing and the interests of justice remain important safeguards. The application of the proposed video link evidence provisions in this bill will be limited to terrorist matters. Terrorism offences, by their very nature, are likely to involve witnesses that are overseas and may be unable to travel to Australia to give evidence.</para>
<para>Terrorism offences also involve matters of national security that warrant the application of special rules. Offence specific video link rules are not novel. Part IIIA of the Crimes Act 1914 already contains specific video link evidence rules for child sex tourism prosecutions. Some of the video link provisions in this bill are based on those existing provisions. The proposed video link evidence provisions will be applicable to witnesses within Australia as well as overseas. Applying the video link evidence rules to witnesses within Australia will cater for circumstances such as where bringing a witness into the courtroom to give evidence would pose an unacceptable security risk to the witness or another person. State and territory video link evidence rules will be preserved so that parties will have discretion as to whether to make an application under state or territory legislation or under this new federal legislation.</para>
<para>Amendments to the Crimes Act 1914 will include the proposed section 15YU, the purpose of which is to set out when the video link evidence provisions in new part IAE of the Crimes Act 1914 will apply. The listed offences are all either terrorism offences, offences that may be committed in the context of a terrorism offence or offences that may be sufficiently related to terrorism to warrant the application of the new provisions. For example, section 34G(5) of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 provides that, if a person is before a prescribed authority for questioning under a warrant in relation to a terrorism offence, it is an offence for the person to make a statement that is, to the person’s knowledge, false or misleading in a material particular. This offence carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment.</para>
<para>Whilst an offence against this section is not directly related to a terrorism offence as such, evidence from witnesses who are overseas may be required to prove that the person made such false or misleading statements in the context of investigating the terrorism offence. It is important that special questioning powers for investigating terrorist offences can be enforced. Section 11.6 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 ensures that part IAE applies to ancillary offences such as attempting to commit, inciting the commission of or conspiring to commit one of the offences listed in proposed section 15YU. The new video link evidence provisions will also apply to breaches of section 6 of the Crimes Act that relate to any of the listed offences. Proposed paragraph 15YU(2)(b) provides that new part IAE will also apply to proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 relating to the offences listed in subsection 15YU(1). The Proceeds of Crime Act provides a mechanism for the restraint and confiscation of proceeds and instruments of crime.</para>
<para>The act includes both a conviction based confiscation regime, where confiscation action follows conviction, and a civil confiscation regime, where property can be confiscated without first requiring a conviction or a criminal charge. The civil based scheme allows for the confiscation of unlawfully acquired property as long as the court is satisfied—on the civil standard of balance of probabilities—that a person has committed a ‘serious offence’, that property is the proceeds of an indictable offence or that the property is an instrument of a terrorism offence.</para>
<para>Paragraph 15YU(2)(b) will enable part IAE to apply to civil based Proceeds of Crime Act proceedings so long as the Proceeds of Crime Act proceedings relate to the offences listed in subsection 15YU(1). For example, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions may seek to take Proceeds of Crime Act proceedings to restrain or confiscate property which has been used or was intended to be used as an instrument of a terrorism offence. Paragraph 15YU(2)(b) also provides that the video link evidence rules in proposed part IAE of the Crimes Act would apply to the Proceeds of Crime Act proceedings to restrain and confiscate property, whether or not criminal proceedings have been taken in relation to the terrorism offence.</para>
<para>Proposed section 15YV of the Crimes Act sets out the circumstances in which the court must direct or allow a witness to give evidence by video link. Firstly, either the prosecution or the defendant must have made an application under section 15YV for a direction or order that a witness give evidence by video link. It is important to note that, where an applicable state or territory law also allows evidence to be given by video link, it would be open to the prosecution or defendant to instead make a video link application under that state or territory law, in which case the rules in proposed part IAE would not apply.</para>
<para>Secondly, the prosecutor and defendant must have given the court reasonable notice of their intention to make such an application. The court will have sufficient time to make the technical arrangements necessary for the video link and the other party will have an opportunity to consider the proposal before the application is made. The witness must also be available to give evidence by video link. This will prevent undue delays by overcoming the potential misuse of the provision by a party seeking a direction or order in relation to a witness who cannot realistically be made available to give such evidence. Likewise, the facilities required by proposed section 15YY must be available or reasonably capable of being made available. Finally, the witness cannot be a defendant in the proceeding. This ensures that a defendant facing terrorist charges must give any evidence to the court in person.</para>
<para>If all of these circumstances are met, proposed subsection 15YV(1) provides that, where the prosecutor has applied for the direction or order, the court must direct or allow the witness to give evidence by video link unless the court is satisfied that giving the direction or making the order would have a substantial adverse effect on the right of the defendant in the proceeding to receive a fair hearing. This ensures that, in a terrorism prosecution, where evidence from a witness may be critical to the prosecution’s capacity to prove the guilt of the defendant beyond reasonable doubt, the court will only be able to disallow video link evidence where there is a compelling reason to do so. Under state and territory video link provisions, the onus is generally on the party seeking to adduce evidence by video link to convince the court that it should allow the evidence. These new rules essentially put the onus on the other party to provide a compelling reason why the evidence should not be allowed.</para>
<para>Proposed subsection 15YV(2) provides that, where the defendant applies for the direction or order, the court must direct or allow the witness to give evidence by video link unless the court is satisfied that it would be inconsistent with the interests of justice for the evidence to be received by video link. This ‘interests of justice’ test is broad enough to allow the court to consider the interests of both parties.</para>
<para>This bill also amends the Foreign Evidence Act 1994. The proposed new part 1AE in the Crimes Act 1914 will deal with video link evidence from witnesses both from overseas and within Australia in proceedings for terrorism and other related offences and proceeds of crime proceedings relating to these offences.</para>
<para>The Foreign Evidence Act 1994 deals with other types of foreign material such as video tapes and transcripts of examinations. The proposed amendments to the Foreign Evidence Act 1994 will assist in treating the foreign evidence in a similar manner to the new video link evidence rules in part 1AE of the Crimes Act 1914 in proceedings for terrorism and other related offences and proceeds of crime proceedings relating to those offences. This will assist in circumstances where it is not possible for evidence to be given by video link, perhaps because of restrictions under the law of the foreign country.</para>
<para>Section 24 of the Foreign Evidence Act 1994 provides that foreign material may be adduced in a proceeding if the material would be admissible if the witness were giving evidence in person.</para>
<para>Subsection 25(1) provides that the court may direct that foreign material not be adduced as evidence if justice would be better served if the foreign material were not so adduced.</para>
<para>Also in relation to the Foreign Evidence Act, item 25 of this bill inserts a proposed new section 25A. This new section applies to a criminal proceeding for a designated offence or a proceeding under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 in relation to a designated offence.</para>
<para>Item 22 also inserts a definition of designated offence into subsection 3(1) of the Foreign Evidence Act. It is defined to include the same list of offences that are listed in proposed subsections 15YU(1) and 15YU(2) of the Crimes Act 1914. These include terrorism and other related offences.</para>
<para>Proposed section 25A provides that if a proceeding is a criminal proceeding for a designated offence or a proceeding under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 in relation to a designated offence and the prosecution seeks to adduce foreign material as evidence in the proceeding, then subsection 25(1) of the Foreign Evidence Act 1994 does not apply.</para>
<para>Instead, proposed subsection 25A(1)(d) will apply, and it provides that the court may direct that the foreign material not be adduced as evidence if the court is satisfied that adducing the foreign material would have a substantial adverse effect on the right of the defendant in the proceeding to receive a fair hearing. This will provide a narrower test than the one that still applies if the defendant is seeking to adduce the foreign material under subsection 25(1).</para>
<para>Proposed subsection 25A(3) stipulates that it is immaterial whether the proceedings for the designated offence or proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 in relation to the designated offence were instituted before or after the commencement of this section.</para>
<para>Section 24 of the Foreign Evidence Act 1994 will still apply, so that the foreign material will only be admissible if the nature of the material is such that the witness could have given the evidence in person. This will ensure that the normal rules of evidence, and the normal protections which apply under those rules, will continue to apply in proceedings covered by proposed section 25A.</para>
<para>In conclusion, I would like to return to the courageous words of young Joe Frost from Newcastle, a university student and a survivor of the 2005 Bali bombings which occurred only a few weeks ago. He reminded Australians to be strong. ‘We have to stand together,’ he said. A little later he said: ‘We can’t let it get us down. We just have to keep standing strong.’ Australians will stand strong. This important legislation is a vital tool in strengthening our laws and providing our law enforcement officers and courts of justice with the lawful means of protecting our freedoms and our great Australian way of life. I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para class="block">There are other features to the bill, which I will not go into. However, I want to read out the provisions in relation to where the court may take evidence by video link.

<quote>
<para>Courts already take video evidence under existing state and territory laws. In child sex tourism trials, courts apply the same admissibility test to both parties—that it be in the interests of justice that the video evidence be used.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I was on the House of Representatives committee that looked at child sex tourism legislation, and we had it substantially amended. I recall that the government at that time proposed the same tests for both the prosecution and the defence. I would say to the Attorney that I think it is a worrying sign that, in terms of the admissibility of evidence, there is a differential test between the prosecution and the defence. I am interested in the justification for this. Why do we have a different test for the prosecution and the defence? It needs to be borne in mind that we want to prosecute terrorists, or purported terrorists, but we should give them a fair trial. We should not have differential tests. Later down the track that will result in appeals, inquiries and a questioning of the whole process.</para>
<para>I remember vividly reading in recent times about the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and the McGuire Seven—three different sets of trials in the UK—where people were convicted and those convictions were subsequently brought into question. Indeed, in one instance, the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, recently issued an apology to those people who were wrongly convicted. They were tried in an atmosphere where there was a lynch-mob mentality and the conduct of the police was less than satisfactory. We do not need differential tests for the prosecution and the defence in relation to the conduct of video evidence. Video evidence, as it is, is fraught with danger. The protections are not there for an accused person that would otherwise be there if the evidence was given in person. I think there is a question there for the Attorney and he should tell us why there is a need for a differential test.</para>
<para>We have already had tensions in the first use of video evidence in a terrorism trial, and they arose in the case of Faheem Lodhi, which appears in the Parliamentary Library’s <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline>. Video evidence was tendered by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions in the committal hearings that were held between December 2004 and February 2005. Mr Lodhi had been arraigned in the New South Wales Supreme Court and his trial is to take place in February 2006. The <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> states:</para>
<quote>
<para>A summary of the video-link evidence tendered in the committal hearings is provided to give context to the Bill. As some of the key provisions of the Bill have retrospective operation, they may be in effect for this trial.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Mr Lodhi was a 34-year-old architect from Punchbowl and he faced nine charges after allegedly plotting to bomb the National Electricity Group and several Sydney defence sites. He was arrested in 2004 and charged. In the case, the Commonwealth tendered the evidence of four overseas witnesses who all gave evidence at the committal hearing over defence objection by way of video link in late 2004, early 2005. One witness was being held in Singapore, without charge, under that country’s national security legislation. The other three witnesses are serving sentences in the United States and have reportedly reached plea agreements with the US government to give evidence in various trials in the US, in Australia and in the UK.</para>
<para>One can see that there was a need for video evidence because of the inability in some instances to bring these people to Australia to give evidence in person. That being the case, there should be safeguards and consistent tests in relation to their ability to give evidence. The Singaporean witness, Arif Naharudin, purported to identify Faheem Lodhi as a participant in LET training camps in Pakistan. Due to the operation of the National Security Information (Criminal and Civil Proceedings) Act 2004, defence counsel were not allowed to see certain parts of his evidence, on national security grounds, and the cross-examination was held in secret. The defence argued in court that Naharudin’s testimony may be suspect. Phillip Boulten SC said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">He is being held without charge. We do not know what pressures have been put on him. We want to know. If we’re going to be restricted from asking questions about it, it is getting to the point in this whole process where there’s barely any justice at all, let alone Australian justice.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Although I have not spoken to Phillip Boulten SC about this case, I should put it on the record that he is a very close friend of mine. We were at the Legal Aid Commission together and we still maintain a strong friendship. When it comes to defence work, he is probably the most prominent member of the Sydney bar, and words uttered by him need to be taken into account. He is basically saying that the restrictions in relation to the questions that he is able to ask as defence counsel bring the process into question. I suggest to the Attorney that having a differential test for the prosecution and the defence brings the whole process of video evidence into question. In a recent article in <inline font-style="italic">Australian Prospect</inline>, Phillip Boulten SC also argued that the evidence of the fourth Commonwealth witness may have been tainted by torture. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">A second American emerged badly from his cross-examination at the committal hearing in February 2005, where it was revealed that he had been arrested by Saudi Arabian police in Riyad, held without warrant and without charge for approximately four weeks in solitary confinement in a cell with the lights on 24 hours a day, interrogated regularly throughout the night by Saudi police and then handed over to the FBI who, after stripping him naked and photographing his genitals, dressed him in prison greens, placed him in irons, placed dark goggles over his face and then transported him from Riyad to Washington. He told Central Local Court in Sydney that it was in this flight that he first confessed his involvement in LET activities.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">There were also some other technical issues. In December 2004, the Commonwealth DPP requested and was granted an adjournment of six months, saying that the Australian translator spoke a different dialect to Naharudin and difficulties with the video link were causing confusion.</para>
<para>I do not seek to go into the merits of cases that are currently before the courts; that is a matter for the judge and the jury. My point—and the reason I raised those examples—is that we already have an instance in which video evidence has been used. And I would imagine that video evidence is going to be used in more than the usual run-of-the-mill court cases, because of the nature of offences. I have no doubt that people will be in custody in America and there will be a whole range of other things. In some instances, it reminds me very much of when I was at the criminal bar and evidence was being given by prisoners against other prisoners because concessions or other things might have been offered to them by the prosecuting authorities. So, in framing laws that allow these people to be cross-examined, one needs to be very careful about the nature and quality of the evidence they may give.</para>
<para>What worries me is that, in the current climate, we are operating from a presumption of guilt. I come from the school of thought that talks about the presumption of innocence—the school of thought that says, ‘Before you convict someone, their guilt must be beyond reasonable doubt, you must have reputable evidence that is not tainted and it must be a process that we can all be proud of.’ If we lower the standards, mistakes are going to be made. This is not about getting a conviction at any cost; this is not about turning around and getting scalps. The laws that we passed a couple of years ago were laws that I supported. I was the justice spokesman at the time and Senator John Faulkner was the homeland security spokesperson. We negotiated with the government, amendments were made and we had laws that both sides of the parliament could be proud of. As a former public defender I had no problem with supporting new laws to plug the gaps in the Criminal Code—I saw that as our responsibility—but I wanted laws that were reputable and which you could run a ruler over in terms of basic principles. To me, the flaw in the bill before the House at the moment is that the test for the prosecution being able to have evidence by video link is different from the test for the defence being able to have evidence by video link. I think that is a real problem and it needs to be addressed by the Attorney and the government. We should go to an equal test for both the prosecution and the defence.</para>
<para>This is something that the government should be looking at long term as I cannot see an argument for a differential test. I cannot see how it is going to disadvantage the prosecution to have the same test because, while at the end of the day it is an adversarial system, the onus is on the Crown. The Crown should bear the onus and it should not be an onus that is a diminished onus in terms of the normal criminal standard, because we are dealing with the liberty of a subject here. To me the values that we are defending against terrorists are values that we should defend internally. I believe that if you lower your standards the terrorists win, because they can point to a grievance and they can talk in their own little circles about how badly they were treated, how unfairly they were treated. The truth of the matter is this: what you need to do is take your population, the people, with you, and we should be learning from mistakes of the past, not repeating the mistakes of the past. If there is to be a lowering of the standard then we need to know why and if there is to be a differential standard we need to know why. On my reading of all the material to date I have not seen a justification for it, justification to say we need a lower standard for the prosecution because the bar is too high. So I look forward to the Attorney, in the summary of the debate, being able to explain why we have this differential test.</para>
<para>I also say this to the Attorney: when you bring in laws such as this, they should be brought through the parliament and the processes of the parliament—and I understand this one is going to a Senate committee—to allow a level of scrutiny. If they are good laws they will withstand scrutiny. If there is a problem with the laws then politicians on both sides of the equation can look at it. Concern for our system of justice is not only on one side of the parliament; it is on both sides of parliament. This concern is the one thing that does bring members from both sides together, through committee work where there is scrutiny. So that is my big question mark over this particular piece of legislation. I understand there is the retrospectivity question too. I know that there have been some concerns raised about that. I am not raising those concerns and I understand where the Attorney is coming from.</para>

<para>—I thank the honourable members for Gellibrand, Hughes and Banks for their contribution to this debate on the <inline ref="R2421">Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Video Link Evidence and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline>. I thank the member for Hughes for her supportive comments about the measure. I note that the member for Gellibrand has moved an amendment. I will deal with all of the points that she has raised except No. 5. Obviously, the government does not accept the amendment. In dealing with the member for Banks’s observations, I will treat them in the context of the broader arguments that were made in the amendment put by and the speech made by the member for Gellibrand because they covered some of the same area.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Firstly, the amendment, in my view, is premature. It is based upon assumptions that are contained in its numbered paragraphs, which form a premature view as to the way in which the bill would operate. I think she herself pointed out that these were all matters that will be considered by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. I would prefer to await the outcome of that process before jumping to wild conclusions. The first matter that she raised was the claim that the member for Banks has not pressed: that the bill is retrospective. It is not the case that it is retrospective. The provisions in this bill are procedural and they apply to proceedings that are to take place after the provisions come into force, thus they do not affect the substantive rights of either party.</para>
<para>As for the points of principle made by the member for Banks, I do not demur in relation to criminal matters as to what the burden of proof should be, nor do I want to see proceedings that are unfair to the parties involved. But that does not mean that the ways in which those issues are dealt with have to be precisely the same. I will deal with the issues relating to different tests of admissibility that apply to the prosecution and defence, because it is correct that the tests are different. However, to imply that different tests necessarily mean that one party is disadvantaged over another is not, in my view, a safe assumption. I notice that, in commenting about the observations of Mr Ian Harrison, whom I know well and whom I respect, while he may have offered substantive arguments the quotes that were given were really an opinion without outlining the basis upon which that opinion was reached.</para>
<para>The question, in my view, should not be whether the tests are different but whether the tests that have been set for the prosecution and the defence are fair and appropriate. That is the issue that I want to deal with. Both the defence and prosecution may make an application for a witness to give evidence by video link. If the prosecution makes the application, the court must allow the witness to give evidence by video link unless to do so would have a substantial adverse affect on the right of the defendant in proceedings to receive a fair hearing. While the tests differ slightly for the prosecution and for defendant applications, both allow scope for the rights of the defendant to be taken into account. It would not be practicable to make the test for the defendant’s applications analogous to those that the prosecution has to meet. That test of course would be that if the defendant makes the application the court must allow the witness to give evidence by video link unless to do so would have a substantial adverse affect on the right of the prosecution in proceedings to have a fair hearing. In my view, those words would make no sense because the prosecution does not get a right as such to a fair hearing in the same way that you expect a defendant should.</para>
<para>The test needs to be different, and the interests of justice test for the defendant applications is an appropriate and flexible test that will give the court the capacity to protect the interests of the defendant. It will also allow the interests of the prosecution to be taken into account. The test for the prosecution applications is more narrowly focused on protecting the defendant’s interests, as in that situation there is no need for the court to second-guess what is in the interests of the prosecution.</para>
<para>That is essentially the gist of the argument that we make. If in some way we have failed to do that adequately and it comes through the committee process, I will look at it. I am not churlish about these things. If a bill can be improved, I am quite prepared to look at amendments, provided they do not derogate from my aspiration to ensure that evidence that is available—and ought to be available but cannot be obtained because somebody is not free to travel to Australia—would not be denied. I do not think the Australian community would want people who are charged with serious offences in relation to terrorism to be able to get off on the basis that you put in place procedural blocks for evidence that might significantly impact on the question of whether or not a person is guilty.</para>
<para>The member for Gellibrand also notes that the provisions are inconsistent with other measures in separate enactments. There are differences, but why does a difference somehow imply a weakness or error? The differences are deliberate, carefully crafted to accommodate the objectives of this bill. For example, the main difference is in the test that applies when the prosecution adduces video link evidence. The test is intentionally different because the bill is designed to facilitate the admission of video link evidence in terrorist cases. It is not designed to be a general law dealing with video link evidence.</para>
<para>The fourth point that was made by the member for Gellibrand is that the definition of ‘observer’ is too loose. The provisions are flexible, and that was deliberately so to ensure that the court would have the power to control its proceedings and to determine whether it was first necessary for an independent observer to be present—for example, if the representatives of both the defence and the prosecution were present in the place where the video link was given. These are matters that we think the judge, in ensuring that the trial is conducted fairly, should be able to address and make appropriate rulings on. So it was left not vague but flexible in order to give the judge control over those proceedings.</para>
<para>Point 5 was related to whether the courts would ‘face practical or legal obstacles to the enforcement of contempt and perjury laws in cases where evidence is received from a foreign country’. There may be issues in relation to those questions, but I think the broader purpose of being able to get access to the evidence is important, and the efficacy of that is a matter that will be determined in the trial. Whether or not you would be able to use proceedings in relation to contempt and perjury when somebody is not within your jurisdiction obviously demonstrates that you cannot necessarily address those issues, but it should not be a technical defence to enable a person to avoid responsibility for their actions, particularly where terrorist acts have occurred. The fact that those remedies are not available to you may be a matter that the judge, in considering the weight that is put on some of these matters, may want to take into account, but again I think that is really a matter for the judge.</para>
<para>Finally, there was a serious question raised as to whether coverage of the bill is adequate. The point I would make is that the government have brought forward amendments which are specifically targeted and designed to give the courts flexibility in managing trials for serious terrorism offences. If there are issues raised as to whether or not we have put in place sufficiently flexible measures, my argument would be that we have and that we have left the matter within the capacity of the courts to deal with.</para>
<para>I think it is important in the context of the amendment and the bill that we do not lose sight of what we are about here. This bill is to ensure that the laws that we have put in place to target terrorist activity are able to be enforced. Experience has shown that, to successfully prosecute a terrorist, it will often be necessary to rely on evidence from witnesses overseas who are unable to travel. I think the member for Banks brought out some of the reasons why they might be unable to travel. Sometimes people in these situations may be known to a person who has been charged here, and they are not going to be free to travel here. Yet the evidence might well be of a great deal of importance in securing a successful prosecution. This bill will ensure that, wherever possible in terrorism cases, important evidence from overseas witnesses can be put before the court using video link technology. If evidence cannot be given by video link because the laws of other countries do not allow it, the bill will ensure that the witness’s testimony can be put before the court using alternative means—for instance, by way of a written transcript or a videotape.</para>
<para>New video link and foreign evidence rules are balanced with appropriate safeguards. Video link evidence and foreign evidence cannot be adduced if it would compromise the defendant’s right to a fair trial. An independent observer can be required to be present at a place where the video link is being given to safeguard against any impropriety in the giving of that evidence. In all cases, the normal rules of evidence and the protection provided by those rules will continue to apply. The bill makes a number of other important changes to the criminal law enforcement legislation.</para>
<para>In conclusion, I am particularly keen to see this bill enacted. I have not commented on litigation that is afoot—I do not think it is appropriate for me as Attorney to do so—but it is quite clear that there are people who have been charged with serious terrorism offences where legislation of this sort could well be relevant to ensuring that the trials can be properly conducted. I hope the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee will keep in mind in its consideration the urgent need for this legislation and, hopefully, when we return in early November, the Senate will agree that the bill in its present form should be given passage.</para>

<para>—The <inline ref="R2427">National Health Amendment (Budget Measures—Pharmaceutical Benefits Safety Net) Bill 2005</inline> amends the National Health Act 1953 in relation to two changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme announced in the May budget. The amendments will implement new safety net and patient copayment arrangements for some pharmaceutical benefits where the pharmaceutical benefit is supplied within 20 days of a previous supply. The amendments will also increase the thresholds for eligibility for PBS eligibility entitlements.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The safety net 20-day rule will result in the following effects: the patient copayment amount will not accrue towards the safety net threshold, and the patient copayment will be the standard amount that applies to the person’s entitlement. Reduced safety net copayments will not apply. The pharmaceutical benefits which will be subject to the measures will be determined by the minister on the advice of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. The bill will also increase the thresholds for eligibility for PBS safety net entitlements for general and concessional patients. These amendments will increase the general threshold by an amount equal to two indexed general patient copayment amounts on 1 January each year from 2006 to 2009 inclusive and increase the concessional threshold by an amount equal to two indexed concessional patient copayment amounts on 1 January each year from 2006 to 2009 inclusive. The increases will result in a gradual adjustment of the eligibility thresholds for the PBS safety net entitlements via increments over four years. These increases will occur in addition to the annual indexation of the safety net thresholds on 1 January each year.</para>
<para>Labor will oppose this bill. Firstly, it shows the deep cynicism of the Howard government and its contempt for the electorate that, at the last election—even though it made a major statement on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme—the government did not see fit to advise Australians that it would be making these changes to the PBS safety net, which are clear cutbacks. Secondly, once again from the Howard government, this is a poorly thought-through piece of policy in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, which will have all sorts of unintended effects and consequences.</para>
<para>I will just paint the background to this bill before coming to its specific points. We know that the Howard government has been in a mode to cut back the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme since the Treasurer first produced the <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational report</inline> in the context of the 2002-03 budget. This was, of course, supposed to be a major opportunity for the man who would be Prime Minister to parade his credentials and his ability to think about the big picture, the big national issues and the forces which will shape our nation over the next 40, 50 or 60 years. He correctly identified one of those forces as being the ageing of the population and, consequently, the need to think about how providing benefits to an ageing population can have intergenerational consequences and intergenerational equity dimensions. We know that the <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational report</inline> which was delivered by the Treasurer was hardly earth-shattering stuff. Basically it fast-forwarded present spending settings by the Commonwealth government and suggested that, if they remain unchanged in 40 years time, the Commonwealth budget would be unsustainable due to the ageing of the population.</para>
<para>About the only action item that came out of the <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational report</inline> was the Treasurer’s and the Howard government’s announcement that it was worried about PBS sustainability, and it was consequently going to increase copayments for pharmaceuticals by 30 per cent. Of course we are all deeply concerned about the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme’s sustainability, but there was always the smell of panic and ill thought-through policy about the Treasurer’s reaction to the <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational report</inline> and his plans to cut back the PBS.</para>
<para>Certainly in the 2001-02 year, the cost of the PBS had increased by 22 per cent. One can understand that anybody who is worried about fiscal sustainability would have looked at that figure and asked, ‘What’s going on here?’ Clearly that growth rate, if it were to be replicated each and every year, would make the PBS unsustainable over time. But there is an intellectual task here that was apparently left undone by the Howard government, which was to diagnose why the cost of the PBS increased by such an extraordinary amount in the course of one financial year. We know of course that most of this increase—some 10 percentage points higher than the average—was due to the Howard government’s own actions in two specific areas.</para>
<para>Firstly, there was the raising in the 2001-02 year of the income limit for access to the Commonwealth seniors health card by self-funded retirees. The Howard government, by taking that decision, made more people eligible for the concessional PBS arrangement. More patients were paying a lower percentage of the cost of the drugs because they were entitled to the lower copayment and therefore—do the maths—taxpayers were paying more. Secondly, this was the year that the government contributed to PBS costs by acting to list Celebrex at a price 20 per cent higher than that recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee and without negotiating the quality discount also recommended. It then took the government far too long to realise that what it had anticipated would be an expenditure of $54 million a year on Celebrex was actually going to be in the order of $232 million a year. So there was a big jump in PBS expenditure. With a jump of 22 per cent you would be right to be concerned. You would need to get to the bottom of the causes. And then you find that significant causes have been the Howard government’s own actions.</para>
<para>If you then look more broadly at growth rates in the PBS, what we know is that the average annual PBS growth rate has been about 12 per cent, but it is important to recognise that the average figure disguises substantial fluctuations that have always occurred over the life of the PBS. Since June 2002 the cost of the PBS has declined significantly from the 22 per cent high I spoke of. It was 10 per cent in 2002-03, eight per cent in 2003-04 and 10 per cent in 2004-05. Commonwealth expenditure on the PBS for the next few years, from 2004-05 to 2006-07, will be under 10 per cent. It is then estimated to hit the 10 per cent mark again in 2007-08.</para>
<para>We have some scepticism about the budget projections for the growth of the PBS because these estimates do not take into account the impact of major therapeutic groups coming off patent. The current budget estimates suggest that, without the savings measures included in this year’s budget, the cost of the PBS would increase to 15 per cent by the end of these forward estimates. So the government projected a 15 per cent growth rate, used that as an argument to say it needed cutbacks and then said it thought the growth rate was going to be about 10 per cent. But we are concerned about the robustness of these estimates because there are always considerable cost savings on the PBS when major therapeutic groups come off patent and move to being cheaper generics. Those highly anticipatable savings have not been factored into the budget estimates.</para>
<para>None of this is to say that we do not need to be concerned about PBS sustainability. Of course we do. But a competent government would be getting to the bottom of the growth rate, particularly the 22 per cent hike that started this flurry of PBS activity and particularly the push on copayments. And in terms of future estimates, a competent government would be modelling to get the most exact prediction of future costs that it could. The Howard government does not bother to do that. Instead it prefers to put into the budget things that will justify its policies rather than put into the budget things that might be truly accurate because they have been modelled.</para>
<para>Where does this leave us? Of course we had the copayment increase, and the major part of that copayment increase came into effect on 1 January this year. There has been some evidence—it is only early evidence, I concede that—that the increase in the copayment is affecting the access to medicines that people need. We know that in the first six months of 2005 the number of concessional scripts—that is, the number of scripts that are taken out by poorer and older Australians who qualify for the concession—grew by only one per cent and the number of general scripts dropped by five per cent. It may be that that is a result of changed prescribing practices. It may be that that is explained by a sudden outbreak of wellness in our community. But I suspect an element of that is that the increased copayments are having an effect. And if the increased copayments are having an effect then that may mean we are saving a bit of money now, with lower growth rates in scripts for concessional patients than would have been anticipated and a drop in the number of general scripts.</para>
<para>We are saving money now but with a view to having far higher health expenditure in the future, because the sorts of medicines that people are likely to go without if they are under financial pressure and cannot meet the new increased copayments will tend to be those that are about stabilising health conditions. These would be health conditions where you are not necessarily experiencing an immediate feeling of unwellness but where, if you go off the medicine for a long period of time, you will hit a health problem. A clear example of that would be taking a statin—a cholesterol-lowering medication. If you go off your statins because you cannot afford them then you are not going to feel sick on day one. But the cholesterol build-up over time may result in you having a heart attack or some other major health problem that could have been avoided by consistent medication. So we are concerned about that.</para>
<para>The 30 per cent copayment increase is not the only change that the Howard government have made to the PBS about which we are concerned, and it is not the only change that we think was ill thought through. During the federal election campaign, on the Friday of the second to last week of the campaign, the Howard government ran out and announced that they were going to engage in a major cutback to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme—not in the interests of making the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme sustainable or in the interests of financing expenditure on the other health areas but because they needed to snaffle a saving somewhere and to send it out of the health portfolio and into another portfolio to pay for some election sweeteners that they wanted to give older Australians.</para>
<para>The government needed to cobble together a savings measure. No doubt, Howard government ministers, staff and others working on the election campaign were instructed by the Prime Minister—and others—along the following lines: ‘I need to find the best part of $1 billion. Someone find me $1 billion.’ A weak and incompetent minister like the Minister for Health and Ageing was unable to resist when the pressure came on, so he was told to cobble together any old policy—it did not matter how incompetent it was—to find some savings for the Prime Minister to send out of health and into other portfolios during the course of the election campaign.</para>
<para>That policy was to cut the cost of generic medicines by 12½ per cent. You could not find a person in the pharmaceutical industry in Australia or a health professional who would agree with this policy. Each and every one of them, if they were asked to come into this place to make a statement about it, would say that it was an ill-advised, ill thought through fiasco. It has been revised several times because it is a fiasco. It has had unintended consequences because the minister for health, who does not understand the PBS, did not understand that if you cut the price of generic medicine then that flows through the therapeutic groups that the PBS has defined and starts to affect the prices that you pay for innovative medicine.</para>
<para>So what is the result of this ongoing fiasco? On the one hand it has meant that we are now in a situation where four medicines attract a special patient contribution because the drug companies have not been willing to supply them for the cut price. These are innovative pharmaceuticals, not generic pharmaceuticals; they have no clinically effective generic substitute. So now if you have advanced lung cancer and you need to get a second-line treatment like Alimpta you are at risk of having to pay a special patient contribution of around $500. That has been one way in which this fiasco has cut in.</para>
<para>The other way in which this fiasco has cut in is that the Minister for Health and Ageing has exempted some medicines—and I am thinking particularly of Lipitor—from the 12½ per cent cutback policy because he did not want to face the political heat of a special patient contribution on such a commonly taken medication. He has managed to punch a hole in the budget bottom line of around $237 million. It takes a rare genius to design a policy which, on the one hand, results in patients paying more and, on the other hand, punches a hole in the budget bottom line. It takes a rare genius to do that but somehow our minister for health has managed that double act. It is a policy of gross incompetence which I suspect will be a revised again and again.</para>
<para>We know that the assault on the PBS did not end with that policy in the recent budget. Calcium has been taken off the PBS. That was a decision made without any expert advice. The minister for health has now sent that decision to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee and they have provided advice. He must not have liked that advice because he has done what he always does when he gets advice that he does not like—he has sent it back for ‘clarification’. We are still waiting to see what comes out of that process. In the meantime, people who take a lot of calcium—whether they take it because they are also taking PBS osteoporosis medication or because they have kidney complaints—are facing an increase in the cost of their calcium if this matter is not resolved. The problems that this government has created in terms of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme just go on and on. This bill represents another two problems.</para>
<para>I will turn to the question of the safety net changes. We have a PBS safety net arrangement for people who are high medication users. You need to be chronically unwell to be using enough scripts to be in the range of hitting the PBS safety net. If you are a person who uses a lot of medication—currently, if you need 52 scripts in a year—you will hit a safety net arrangement where thereafter you can access medicines at grossly reduced costs. So you have paid your PBS copayment for the 52 scripts—you might have paid that at a concession level because you are a concession card holder or paid it at the full rate—but then the safety net comes in and takes care of you. Now, under these changes, that is going to go up progressively so that it is 54 scripts, 56 scripts and so on.</para>
<para>If the Howard government had wanted to change the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme safety net arrangements then they should have done the following. On the day in the election campaign that they effectively made a Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme policy change of some significance—when they announced the 12½ per cent price cutback policy to fund another election policy—to be honest with the electorate the Prime Minister should have held a press conference and said: ‘Understand this, Australians. If you vote for me, I will be cutting back the PBS safety net. If you do not want that done, do not vote for me, because I am going to do it.’</para>
<para>But honesty is not something that we expect from the Howard government—and we never get it. Once again, we did not get it on this occasion. They did not tell the electorate. Seat holders in the Howard government—coalition members—did not walk around their electorates, knock on doors and say: ‘Are you a chronically ill person? Well, understand this: if you vote for me, I am going to come into the House of Representatives and vote to make the PBS safety net threshold harder for you to reach. If you are someone who needs a lot of medications you had better know that, before you walk or drive down to the polling station to exercise your vote.’ They did not say that. It was a gross act of dishonesty and a gross act of hypocrisy, and on that basis we are opposed to it.</para>
<para>Then there is the second bit of this bill—a Howard government special, particularly from the minister, who seems completely unable to think about health issues in detail and in depth; he has an intellectual bypass which means he is unable to do that—where there has been cobbled together this new thing called the ‘20-day rule’. This is supposed to be about a measure that prevents the hoarding of medicine. I understand that it is not desirable, in terms of people who go to the doctor and get multiple scripts, to have all of those scripts filled at the one time and for them to be looking for new scripts and be hoarding medication, particularly if any of that is motivated by trying to hit the PBS safety net threshold at an earlier point in time than they otherwise would. So there is an issue—but this is such a poorly designed proposition to deal with that issue. This is saying that, if you are prescribed a medication and within a 20-day period you go and fill a second prescription for that medication, the amount of the patient copayment that you pay to get the second script filled will not count towards the PBS safety net. If you have already hit the PBS safety net, then by filling that second script the reduced patient copayment that should apply under the PBS safety net will not apply. That is irrespective of why you are filling a second script within 20 days.</para>
<para>We pressed the Department of Health and Ageing on these matters when we took the briefing, and we just got gobbledegook back. I would like the minister for health, when he comes in and sums up in this debate, to tell me why this House or any member in it, including any coalition member sitting in the government ranks—and I hope they understand that this is what they will be voting for, because we will make sure that everybody understands that this is what they did vote for—should be put in this position; why anyone should be put in the following positions, and I have a few examples.</para>
<para>Let us imagine a low-income family that has reached their PBS safety net limit. There might be a member of the family who is chronically unwell—indeed, there might be a number of children who all share the same chronic illness. Let us imagine that one of the children in that family has asthma. Let us say that that child goes to school and does the kind of thing that kids often do: they lose their school bag and somehow they manage to lose their medication. They leave it behind and it is not there when they come back, or it is sports day and they leave their school bag and wander back onto the school bus. I am sure we can all remember times in our childhood when we lost jumpers, shoes, school sports uniforms, pens or books. You can also lose your asthma medication. Let us say that child has lost Ventolin, Seretide or Atrovent—all medications they could be taking. The family will have to replace that. They cannot have an asthmatic child wandering around without medication. Under this legislation, when they go to get the second script filled within a 20-day period, that family will be paying $85.80 to get that medication for their child, instead of $13.80. So we have a low-income family that has hit the PBS safety net threshold. They have an incident where a young kid has left their school bag somewhere and they cannot find their medication. They will be paying $85.80 instead of $13.80—an additional cost of $72. I hope the members on the coalition benches are proud to vote for that when we come to voting for this bill.</para>
<para>Let us take another example: a diabetic patient who might be taking Metformin, Ramapril or Atorvastatin, one of the statin groups. Let us say that they have misplaced their medication. They could have been on holidays and left it where they have holidayed. They could have lost their luggage. Madam Deputy Speaker, I am sure you are someone who has had to confront a loss of luggage, travelling on planes from time to time. These things do happen; it is no-one’s fault. It may be the airline’s fault—sometimes it just happens—and your bag does not come out on the carousel and you do not have your medication. Someone in that position may have filled their script and taken their medicine away with them. It has been lost and they need to replace it within 20 days. They will be hit with an additional $72 payment. That is someone with diabetes who, despite the PBS and all sorts of other government measures, would already experience high out-of-pocket costs day in, day out to manage their diabetes. Once again, I hope the coalition members who will file into this place to vote for this bill are proud of that as a result. I hope they are wandering around their electorates explaining to every diabetic that they have potentially cost them $72 extra if they happen to lose their medication.</para>
<para>I have another example. This week is Mental Health Week. This government has lots of spin on mental health but precious little substance. We know that, even in Mental Health Week, the government has managed to deny appropriate funding to an organisation called depressioNet, which has helped 200,000 Australians and which will close at the end of this week. We all know exactly how low the real commitment of this government is to mental health issues. Indeed, the minister for health does not deign to look after this himself. He believes that dealing with mental health issues is somehow beneath him and has given the matter to his parliamentary secretary. There are obviously many people in our community who have a mental illness, who need medicine for that mental illness and who may be liable to lose or misplace their medicine. Indeed, forgetfulness could well be a side-effect of the mental health condition they are facing.</para>
<para>So let us give an example of someone who has schizophrenia—tragically, too many people in our society do—with all the lifetime effects that having such a major mental health condition implies. That person could be taking Zyprexa. If they lost that medicine they would be required to pay an additional $4.60 to get the medicine. That may sound like a small amount of money to many people. But if someone is schizophrenic it may well be—tragically, is likely to be—that they will not be in the work force. They will be on some form of welfare payment, and they may be in the situation where they lose their medicine frequently. Each time they do, it is an additional $4.60.</para>
<para>So this is the problem of the 20-day rule, and that is even before you get to things like people who live in rural and remote locations who come to town and fill all their scripts at once, not because they are going to take all their medication at once but because it will be a long time before they get back to town again. So they go into the chemist, fill all their scripts, take the medicine back home and take it as they are supposed to take it, but of course they will be caught within this 20-day rule because they have filled the scripts. This really is I think an incredibly cruel policy, a policy that is likely to have its highest impact on elderly patients who have certain shopping cycles and may be confused or insecure about running out of medicines. It is likely to have strong effects on people with chronic conditions who might need extra supplies of medicines in order to have the medicine in more than one location or who may lose their medication. It is going to have strong effects on people who are taking mind-modifying medicines and may be more likely to be confused than the average person.</para>
<para>It is an ill-thought through proposal from a minister whose understanding of health is so shallow that sometimes it takes my breath away. There is an issue here about medication hoarding, I understand that, but this is not the way to fix it, and that is why Labor will be opposing this bill. I will be recommending to members of the coalition backbench that, instead of just wandering in and voting for this in the way they will be instructed to, they actually have a think about it because it is going to have substantial demerits for people in their constituencies. I conclude by moving the second reading amendment which has been circulated in my name and which makes these points. I once again urge coalition members to consider voting for the second reading amendment if they are genuinely motivated by the concerns of their constituents. I move:</para>

<para>—Of course we will be opposing the second reading amendment to the <inline ref="R2427">National Health Amendment (Budget Measures—Pharmaceutical Benefits Safety Net) Bill 2005</inline>. Obviously the shadow minister has jumped ahead of the game because I am sure, with the consideration given by the people involved in the dispensing of medications under the rule that she has just mentioned, the proposal she has put forward as well as the examples she has outlined will be covered by reasonable people working through the process. There will be a number of drugs, of course, in this whole process that will not be subject to the 20-day rule and there will be further information going to doctors and pharmacists of people who have chronic diseases.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The government today is putting forward this legislation to further strengthen the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and cement its commitment to essential, accessible and quality medicines for all Australians. In fact, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is one of the most important supports for older Australians that this government has supported. Not only has it been supported by this government but also, as was mentioned by the shadow minister, the government has corralled even further numbers of Australians into the PBS and increased its eligibility for older Australians. This is a very important scheme for older Australians. The government acknowledges that it allows people to live a longer, healthier and happier life.</para>
<para>The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme sets out to restrict and subsidise the amount that people pay over the counter for their medicines while facilitating a continuation of the sale of high-quality pharmaceutical items. It is in effect a legislated safeguard to protect the vulnerable in our community, particularly those individuals and families who rely on continuous and large quantities of medicines for a variety of illnesses, whilst ensuring that they are as cost affordable as possible. I know of many people in my electorate of McMillan who have children or loved ones requiring large doses of particular medicines on a long-term basis to treat a variety of debilitating illnesses. I reiterate that the Australian government will not forget the plight of people in McMillan who find themselves, even in prosperous economic times, financially marginalised by such unavoidable circumstances. The government will always keep in mind the needs and concerns of those that are least able in our community to look after themselves. This legislation will build and strengthen the PBS and, with it, the support and protection it offers people in the Australian community who need it most.</para>
<para>The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has rightly earned us the envy of many other countries with first-class health care systems. In the United States, for example, this is evidently so for a variety of drugs. In facilitating the measures made in the 2005-06 budget, this legislation will amend part VII of the National Health Act 1953, the act relating to certain aspects of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. In building and strengthening the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the government has put forward several amendments to the current legislation that will implement new safety net patient copayment arrangements for some pharmaceutical benefits where the benefit is supplied within 20 days of a previous supply. The amendments will also increase the thresholds for eligibility for PBS safety net entitlements.</para>
<para>Part VII of the National Health Act provides for subsidised access to high-quality medicines and includes mechanisms which support quality use of medicines and appropriate use of government resources. In other words, the taxpayer is important. Supporting our war veterans for the tremendous service they have selflessly given our nation is a responsibility the Australian government takes very seriously. In maintaining our commitment to this, expenditure on the PBS and the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for veterans has grown at an average rate, as the shadow minister said, of 12 per cent per annum for the last 10 years. In 2004-05, this equated to a cost of around $6,500 million. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is an invaluable asset to Australia’s health care system and the measures the government is putting forward will ensure its success and survival for generations to come.</para>
<para>Part of this strengthening also includes a widening of the PBS safety net threshold over the next four years and introduces safety net arrangements for the early supply of some PBS medicines. This will be of great comfort to thousands of people in my electorate who rely on the PBS to meet their short- and long-term health care needs. The government is in a position to put these measures forward only after considered and prudential planning that allows the strengthening of the PBS today yet sets in place careful fiscal management that will see the PBS available for generations of families and individuals as the years go forward. While supporting Australia’s needs today under the PBS, we as a government must also be mindful that the system is carefully planned for the long-term future. The government recognises that, in putting forward these amendments, we are investing further trust in the judgment of people who rely on PBS medicines to use them wisely.</para>
<para>I referred earlier to the strengthening and widening of the PBS safety net threshold. The threshold for general patients will increase by an amount equal to two general patient copayments and the threshold for concessional card holders will increase by two concessional copayments each year from 2006 to 2009. Where currently the general safety net threshold is $874.90, it will proportionately develop by amounts equal to two indexed copayments each year for four years, resulting in a safety net threshold in 2009 which includes eight additional copayments. For those Australians reliant on the concessional safety net threshold, currently $239.20 and equal to 52 prescription copayments, it will increase by two copayments each year to 54 prescriptions in 2006, 56 in 2007, 58 in 2008 and 60 in 2009. These increases will be a welcome relief to many and will come into effect on 1 January each year, in addition to the usual annual indexation based on CPI.</para>
<para>Contained in the amendments put forward in the legislation is also the inclusion of the safety net 20-day rule, which in effect ratifies responsible accessible use of PBS medicines. Through this measure, instead of attempting to bulk-buy excess quantities of a drug based on financial restrictions, patients will achieve the best value for PBS copayments by complying with the set entitlements. This amendment is responsible and fair. The introduction of the safety net 20-day rule is sensitive and practical in that it will only apply to PBS medicines where, on expert advice, it is appropriate. This will aid in the alleviation of inappropriate and potentially dangerous amounts of oversupply.</para>
<para>Still mindful of this, the government also recognises that, where appropriate, if an additional or early supply of one of these medicines is required, it will be eligible for PBS subsidy but not eligible for safety net benefits. The amendments put forward in this legislation support a PBS that is accessible and sustainable. The Howard government is committed to easing the strain on people weighed down by the physical and financial duress of short- and long-term illness and, as such, the safety net will continue to play an important role in protecting people from financially out-of-reach costs that they may incur for PBS medicines.</para>
<para>It is also important that we have regard for the people in each of our electorates. In my electorate, for instance, I have people located around the smaller pharmacies who may only occasionally come to town—some only once a week and others a few times a month. My local pharmacists have raised the issues of access for those people with me and there were some considerations and discussions with my local pharmacists about this issue prior to this bill coming into the House.</para>
<para>I said before that there will be a list of drugs that are not covered by the 20-day rule. They are yet to be brought forward—the pharmaceutical board will list them for us. The measure will actually help to ensure that pharmacists supply medicines to consumers only when they are needed. Commonsense will prevail for those situations whereby a medicine is lost. When a patient has a prescription for multiple supplies of medicine, he or she is normally not able to obtain a repeat supply until 21 days—which is the proposal—after the previous supply was issued. To avoid hardship, the script can be presented earlier using the PBS immediate supply provisions if the drugs have been lost, damaged or are needed for immediate treatment.</para>
<para>However, from 1 January 2006, supply of some of the medicines under the immediate supply provisions will be excluded from the PBS safety net entitlements, and this will have two effects. Consumer copayments for these medicines will not accrue towards the safety net tally and the copayment amount that will apply after the safety net threshold is reached will be the person’s standard copayment amount, not the reduced safety net amount, which I mentioned before. It is a measure for good practice and safe use of medicines and it will help to make the use of funding for the PBS more effective. Doctors will still be able to write a prescription for which all repeats of the medicine are dispensed at the one time if that is necessary for the patient. The PBS rules allow for medicines to be supplied at intervals which reflect treatment needs and are flexible enough to allow convenient access for repeat supplies. This measure does take away the incentive for people to stockpile medicines when they do not really need them.</para>
<para>There is a saving to the PBS of some $70 million over the four years. These measures should not be presented by the shadow minister as a further scare campaign for older Australians. Older Australians are very important to the Howard government. I think older Australians are very important to the opposition, too, and I do not think they would want to send a scare campaign message out into electorates right across Australia telling older people that they are going to have a problem, because they are not going to have a problem. People will be protected and looked after under this very expensive scheme covered by taxpayers. It should be remembered that this scheme has been supported by every government since its introduction. It is a scheme that needs ongoing management so that we can provide the latest and best drugs and so that our community is enhanced by this world renowned scheme.</para>
<para>Australians are living longer, better, healthier and, in some ways, happier lives because of it. There is nothing more debilitating within a family than ongoing disease if you do not have the support that this nation gives to its citizens through the PBS. It could be said that the Howard government is the best friend the PBS has ever had, but managing this process is a part of government and I would have thought that the opposition, particularly the Labor Party, would be supportive of fiscal management that is appropriate for the day. In fact, rather than calling on government backbenchers and worrying about what they might be saying to their constituents, I hope the opposition will support this bill, because whoever is in government has to manage this very good but very expensive scheme in a fiscally appropriate manner.</para>
<para>All schemes such as this need ongoing attention. I thought that the attacks on the Minister for Health and Ageing were really unfair because, throughout the whole of this process, parties have put forward different health policies at different times, as was seen by the shadow minister during the last election campaign. Medicare Gold became a dog of a policy for the opposition. However, when the opposition drops a dead cat on the table, as Medicare Gold was, we still have to remember that now and again the opposition may have some good ideas. We should always be open and listen to how we can improve the PBS and Medicare, and it has been said many times in this House that the Howard government is the best friend Medicare ever had.</para>
<para>Rather than putting forward a scare campaign on the PBS—which is what the previous address amounted to; nothing more, nothing less—would it not be better if Labor came forward with some constructive ideas to manage the PBS through the years ahead to make it affordable for Australian taxpayers while providing the appropriate benefits to those in need of these medicines? All of us are touched by older people; all of us have older people around us. We can see the benefits. We can see that the changes to the PBS over the years have all enhanced the system. As I said before, more people have been brought into the pharmaceutical benefits net. This has benefited another whole generation of Australians.</para>
<para>If you have children with an ongoing need for these medicines, you will be provided for. A lost school bag will not be a reason for not being able to access medicines. It is just not on that a proposal like that would be put forward in this House. How many times have I heard, in my various visits to this House, the opposition put forward scare campaign after scare campaign, whether on aged care, pharmaceutical benefits or any of those health issues. Privately I hear some very good proposals from some Labor members.</para>

<para>—I will not be publishing my diaries, ever! Labor members do not come into this House and put forward appropriate proposals that may benefit the scheme. I hope the next speaker surprises me. I hope the next speaker makes a positive contribution to this debate, having regard to the benefits of this scheme that are crucial to the nation as a whole and to how we can benefit older Australians and those with an ongoing need for these medicines. This has been the program of all programs. Every government is going to have to deal with the cost of this system. In a strong economy like ours, we must be free to alter these policies so that they fit with today’s community. I believe that these changes will benefit the taxpayer and those in need of these medicines. I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para>—The purpose of the <inline ref="R2427">National Health Amendment (Budget Measures—Pharmaceutical Benefits Safety Net) Bill 2005</inline> is to amend part VII of the National Health Act 1953 to put in place certain measures announced with respect to the PBS, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, in the 2005-06 budget. The amendments will implement new safety net and patient copayment arrangements to do with the supply of some medicines within 20 days of a previous supply and increase the thresholds for eligibility for PBS safety net entitlements.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Before the member for McMillan leaves the chamber, I would like to congratulate him on his courageous effort to defend the decision on the PBS in this year’s budget. I am not sure that I will be able to rise to his high mark and make suggestions about how we can improve the PBS, but I intend to pose a number of questions in relation to the benefit of the PBS as against other forms of treatment that I believe the government, if it has a rational approach to the sustainability of the PBS, should be addressing.</para>
<para>The surprising thing about the PBS is the way in which it affects all Australians, because of course it enables the supply of essential pharmaceuticals not only to older Australians but to all Australians. It makes them accessible and affordable. The honourable member for McMillan is correct: the Australian PBS is a system that is the envy of the world. On both sides of this chamber—therefore, on both sides of the political spectrum in Australia—we have consistently sought to defend the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</para>
<para>I put to the House that we have to remember to look at this measure in the context that it follows on from measures in the 2004-05 budget, which had the effect of savings on the PBS of $1.3 billion over the next four years. So 12 months before this year’s budget the government said, ‘We have a problem. We have to address the sustainability of the PBS.’ What did they do? They put in place a range of extreme measures to make savings of $1.3 billion. Twelve months later, with a general election in between, we then have the government coming forward with another couple of proposals, which are the subject of this legislation, to make further savings on the PBS to the value of some $210 million over the next four years.</para>
<para>The point that has to be stressed in this debate is this. Before the 2004 budget the cry was, ‘We have a problem with the PBS, so we will put in place measures’—savage measures.  Twelve months later, in the 2005 budget, what is the cry from the government? ‘We’ve got a problem with the PBS. We’ve got to put in place more measures.’ So there is a further $0.2 billion of alleged savings. What sort of way is this to put in place policy proposals? Surely when the government went to the people in October last year they could not have had this proposal, because they did not put it to the Australia public! As the shadow minister, the member for Lalor, has said, they were not out trotting around saying, ‘We’ve hit you for $1.4 billion worth of savings on the PBS in this year’s budget. Next year we will be hitting you again for another $200 million worth of savings.’ No siree. There was either a high level of deception in the way that they approached last year’s election or in fact, after October, yet again, somebody was sitting around the cabinet table or in a subcommittee of cabinet and said: ‘We’ve got a problem with the PBS. It’s out of control. We need another measure in this budget.’ My problem is that I believe we will get to next year’s budget, the 2006 budget, and, given the state of the poor old PBS—the $5.5 billion, the increases averaging seven per cent a year—the cabinet again will say: ‘It’s out of control. We need another measure.’</para>
<para>That is the problem that the honourable member for McMillan has. Whilst he was courageous, and he is the only person that is going to step up to the plate to support the parliamentary secretary who introduced this piece of legislation on behalf of the minister—and I compliment him for his courage—that is his difficulty. While he says he is proud of the government protecting the PBS, in the time that he has been outside this place before he came back for his third visit, he knows that there have been changes to the PBS over the course of the Howard government. Obviously they have been incompetent in putting these changes in place, because they have come up with another piece of legislation.</para>
<para>My positive suggestion to the member for McMillan is that he get down to the party room and say to Minister Abbott that it is a nonsense that year in, year out he has changes. As I have said in debates on previous health legislation, this is typical of this minister. Every month there is a different idea. It is out of control. Sometimes his proposals countervail others. As the custodian of the Australian health system, he ought to step back and do a proper study. Money is being thrown into other areas—the private health rebate and the safety net uncapped out-of-pocket expenses. There is money being thrown at problems, but in the wrong direction. At least there is some consistency in the way they approach the PBS. The consistency is that they clamp down on the consumer—they clamp down and shift costs to the individual.</para>
<para>I say this to the member for McMillan—and this is a fairly rough piece of economics and financial analysis: the explanatory memorandum on the increase of the safety net thresholds says that, in the fourth year, 2008-09, when we have gone from the equivalent of needing 52 scripts to be eligible for the safety net to the equivalent of 60 scripts, this will be a saving to the Commonwealth of $71 million. There are 150 seats in this House. If I divide $71 million by 150—I know this is a bit of voodoo economics—that is $500,000 to the seat of McMillan.</para>
<para>The other aspect of the voodoo economics analysis is that, if in fact we keep seeing the same number of scripts and the savings that are achieved by the increase in the threshold number of scripts from 52 to 60, that $500,000 is coming out of the pockets of people that live in the electorate of McMillan. The only other way that there can be savings is there will not be the same number of scripts. That might be because people actually cannot afford them, and that brings a bigger problem for the member for McMillan. This is not a scare campaign; this is stating the facts that the minister for health has to be up front about.</para>
<para>Back in 1993—I think that is about the time period; it might be before that—I was a backbench member of a government that did a bit about copayments and the PBS. The reason for doing that, unashamedly, was not necessarily to cost shift to the private person, to have them paying, but to set a marker. The belief was that by setting a copayment there would be a marker in the thought processes gone through with the patient in discussion with the doctor for writing the script. The marker would say: ‘Is this really needed? Because we are putting an imposition on the patient themselves.’ So, unashamedly, an aspect of that piece of policy was to set in place a reason for a reduction in the scripts. This led to a great deal of debate within the Labor Party caucus, but the point is that that was the basis.</para>
<para>Going forward to the 2004 budget, the copayment itself was radically increased, and then in this year’s budget the threshold was increased. That is not about setting markers. That is about shifting the responsibility for a large portion of the cost of essential medicines onto the person themselves; let us make no mistake. So that is the point at which we really have to think about what we intend by these sorts of measures. I believe there needs to be a bit of a deep breath, a step back by government and an analysis of the way that the PBS contributes to the level of wellness as much as to attacking illness in Australia. If it is about that, and if in fact, on the basis of cost, people are avoiding having scripts dispensed and therefore heading down the track of unnecessary hospitalisations or the like, we have a problem. They are the things that I think we need to study. They are the things we really need to look at. If the anecdotal evidence is correct that disadvantaged and low-income Australians, as part of their discretionary decisions about what they purchase, have to decide that they will not get scripts dispensed because they cannot afford them, we have a big problem as a nation. The bean counters who look at these things ought to realise that the consequence of that is the person getting sicker and that therefore it is leading to other forms of more expensive treatment.</para>
<para>I chaired the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs back in 1993. We held a large inquiry right through the whole kit and caboodle from the pharmaceutical industry to pharmacies. One of the things that we always talked about during that inquiry was that we had to acknowledge that, in a cost-benefit analysis, the PBS is really very good value. I do not see a discussion and debate about the cost-benefit of the PBS when we are looking at decisions like this. It is merely, ‘$1.37 billion saved last year; $210 million’—or whatever the figure is—‘saved this year,’ without really looking at the potential for the loss of benefit.</para>
<para>So, to the honourable member for McMillan, that is where I say we are coming from. We are asking: are these measures actually appropriate? If he is going to get up—on this, his third visit back to this place—as the lone government voice in support of these measures and talk about how good the PBS system is, let us step back. Why doesn’t he come on board and say, ‘We’ll have a proper inquiry; we’ll have another look’? He was part of the community affairs committee back in 1993 on his first visit to this place. He was part of the inquiry and he was a great contributor. But I want him to go back to McMillan—it is not a scare campaign—and explain to them what value or peace of mind the punters of McMillan are getting for their half a million dollars worth of savings in 2008-09, the out year of the four years of these measures, when the overall saving to the budget is $70 million, or explain how the $22 million nationally that is being saved by the 20-day rule gives them peace of mind. It is the reverse of the scare campaign: get out and give the assurances.</para>
<para>Of the 37 million PBS subsidised prescriptions filled in Victoria, the share of the seat of Scullin in 2004-05 was nearly 966,000. Of these PBS subsidised prescriptions, the number for concession card holders was 930,409 in 2004-05. The total number of PBS subsidised prescriptions for non-concession card holders in Victoria was 1.5 million and in Scullin was 33,000. The interesting figure is that the minority of scripts under the PBS are for non-concession card holders—something like four per cent in Victoria and 3½ per cent in Scullin. So, whilst of course the purpose of the PBS is to make essential medicines affordable and accessible to all Australians, it has its greatest impact on concession card holders. We should never get away from that. We should never forget that. It is a very important aspect of the way Australia has put in place its health system.</para>
<para>I support the honourable member for Lalor’s second reading amendment, because I think it goes to issues that the government is not considering in the mishmash of proposals it has had over time for improving the PBS. I think that the government has to say to people that the benefit of the PBS far outweighs the cost; but do the savings, in the same manner, not lead to a greater loss of the benefit? Last year’s budget proposals, on the evidence of figures early this year, have reduced the increase in the number of scripts down to something like one per cent. So there is a dynamic going on. If, as I contend, there has been a clamp on the demand over the journey since the copayment has been put in place, and if we have a further reduction, will that go below the line we want to go to? In a national sense, will that go below the line at which we get the full benefit from the PBS? This government has not been characterised by doing full investigation of public policy areas.</para>
<para>There is not one area of public policy where we can say that this government has had an approach where it has put out in the marketplace for discussion and debate a full proposal about anything. The thing that characterised the Hawke and Keating years, especially in social policy, was that we were always out there putting forward proposals on housing and health et cetera—fully documented research that we put out to people who were interested so that they could have full discussion. We never see that from this government. What we see is policy on the run. It is either in the context of putting in all the dastardly things that create savings in the budget or, at election time, throwing a few sweeteners around and not really worrying about where the money is thrown or thinking about the outcome; it is just to grab the headline. It is about time this government stepped back and got fair dinkum, or in next May’s budget we will find a further proposal: because the PBS is in disarray, it needs further savings. It is a nonsense; the government needs to be consistent and look at the overall problem.</para>

<para>—The lengths to which this government will go now that it controls both houses of this parliament almost know no bounds. This government continues to amaze me when it comes to the extent to which it is prepared to wield its new-found powers as it continues to hack away at some of the fundamentals of our society. I oppose the <inline ref="R2427">National Health Amendment (Budget Measures—Pharmaceutical Benefits Safety Net) Bill 2005</inline>. I do not want to see it simply amended or watered down; I simply do not want to see it passed. This bill represents the extent of meanness of this government. It is yet another example of the obsession with implementing two-tiered systems when it comes to government services.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Howard government’s great social engineering experiment that we have seen thus far includes the introduction of a two-tiered system in health; a two-tiered system in education and training; this morning, a two-tiered system in student services; and a two-tiered system in industrial relations, which is currently emerging. Now the government wants to apply it to pharmaceuticals. But, of course, that is really not going far enough. Given half a chance, this government acts to exacerbate disadvantage by introducing charges like those we have before us today. This is probably the perfect time for the government to slip through these changes, which it was too scared to take to the electorate at the time of the last election a little over 12 months ago. It is the perfect time to slip through changes to the PBS under the guise of sustainability and under cover of a $100 million advertising campaign on its extreme industrial relations agenda.</para>
<para>Members opposite may be wondering why I and my colleagues on the Labor side are upset about this bill. They might be wondering why we regard this as being of such importance. The reason is quite simple. These changes go to the core of people’s wellbeing. By and large, they have the most impact on those who can least afford it, and they impact on families. No-one wants to get sick, but when they do they want to know that they can have access to affordable and high-quality health and that they can obtain, at a reasonable price, the medicines they need to get back to good health.</para>
<para>Under the changes in the bill being debated today, the simple desire to get better and to be well again now comes at a higher price. Of course, this will not come about just through one price but through a complex set of rules put in place to shift the cost of health care from government to consumers. I am sure the government is pleased that it did not have to pass a no-disadvantage test on this to contend with the development of this piece of policy, because the solution would certainly not have stacked up. I have to wonder whether the minister has produced a family impact statement, one that is satisfactory to Senator Fielding, because this legislation certainly does impact on families.</para>
<para>This bill will introduce a complex set of rules, possibly the bluntest instrument available to the government, which it claims will support the affordability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme well into the future. But this bill and the policy it introduces do nothing to support the affordability or the sustainability of the PBS. This bill simply shifts the costs off the government books and into the pockets of sick people and families. The bill claims to support sustainability of the PBS by doing two things: firstly, it sets in place a new safety net and new patient copayment arrangements; and, secondly, it introduces a threshold for eligibility for the safety net entitlements. This is where a new 20-day rule comes in. The bill before us introduces a 20-day rule aimed at stopping the accumulation of medicines and the filling of scripts in order to reach the safety net expenditure threshold early.</para>
<para>While not wanting to make light of issues of health or the PBS, I do find the government’s underlying agenda in this scheme somewhat amusing. As we have heard from previous speakers, a 20-day rule implements a time limit for filling a script. Under the 20-day rule, a resupply within 20 days of a previous supply of the same pharmaceuticals for the same person will not count towards the calculation of the safety net entitlement. The copayment will not accrue towards the safety net threshold.</para>
<para>The stated aim of this part of the bill is to discourage people from obtaining additional or early supplies to reduce the risk of wastage—or at least that is what it seems to be. It points to a clear concern of the government that people are either seeking to fill additional scripts and hiding medicines away in the cupboard or simply seeking to gain their medicines early. I must admit that I do not know the extent of this problem—or even if it is a real problem—but it seems to me that people who are engaging in that sort of behaviour are doing so because of flaws in the existing system. These people are almost being accused of being rational agents because they know that once they reach a certain level of copayments the cost of their pharmaceuticals will be reduced—or at least that seems to be the government’s argument.</para>
<para>It would seem to me that the motivating factor in this is not the desire to have more pharmaceuticals; it is the desire to reach the threshold. The threshold has created a perverse incentive for consumers, and I have to wonder whether setting some form of arbitrary time frame in which the same pharmaceuticals cannot be purchased would be the best way of addressing this problem—if indeed it is a problem. I find it particularly interesting that the immediate supply provisions that allow for subsidised resupply in the case of loss or destruction will also be subject to the 20-day rule, and those intending to travel will not receive any exemption. One can only wonder what sorts of abuses of the PBS travellers have been perpetrating to have this rule applied to them.</para>
<para>The most significant of the two changes, when it comes to the concerns of the young families in my electorate, are the changes to the threshold for the safety net entitlements. This will result in a double whammy for patients. The changes contained in this bill do not introduce just one increase but set in train a series of increases in the threshold for each and every year, right through to 2009. Members opposite may scoff and say that this is not a big deal, that there are only four increases in the threshold. I wish it were that simple.</para>
<para>This bill implements increases in the threshold by an amount equal to two indexed general patient copayments in each of these years. This means that the current general safety net level of $874.90 will gradually increase to a level in 2009 that is the equivalent of eight additional copayments over its current level. As the previous speaker, the member for Scullin, said, the position with concession card holders is also not spared in this instance. The concessional safety net has also been caught up in this legislation. Over the next four years the concessional rate will rise from its current level of $239.20—or the equivalent of 52 copayments—to a level equivalent to 60 copayments in 2009.</para>
<para>While most would think that the introduction of a new system of increasing the safety net would supersede the existing one, the government has decided to stick with its own two-tiered philosophy here as well. Currently the safety net increases are on 1 January each year and increase at the rate of inflation, as measured by the CPI, and the government has made it clear that this situation will continue. So what Australians will face when they wake up on New Year’s Day of each year from next year through to 2009—in addition to any possible after-effects of the celebrations of the night before—will be an increase in the PBS safety net threshold. Let us be perfectly clear on what will happen. There will be an increase in the safety net well above the rate of inflation. The threshold will not simply be adjusted to indexation; there will be an out-and-out increase. We will have a two-tiered increment in the safety net to match the two-tiered PBS.</para>
<para>The government claim that these changes are necessary to ensure the ongoing sustainability of the PBS. They argue that incremental changes are necessary because they will limit the alleged rorting of the existing scheme through the advance purchase of medications and the hoarding of medications, all done so that people can reach the safety net level of expenditure. If that really is the case, I find this is a pretty strange policy solution. It is a strange policy solution that did not make its way into the coalition’s policy material released during the last election campaign. It is a policy solution that only came to light as a measure in this year’s budget.</para>
<para>The way that this bill and its measures are introduced will produce the desired effect, because they will stop people from using medicine. Health care costs are already one of the single biggest threshold budget items for Australian families, and this policy is going to make those costs bigger. This cost-shifting exercise will mean that, more than ever, people will be thinking twice about going to the doctor or taking their kids to the doctor. Initially it was about whether or not they could find a bulk-billing doctor; now it will be about whether they can afford to have the script filled. The people who will find themselves at the greatest disadvantage when it comes to accessing medicines under this scheme are those already doing it tough under this government. The people who are facing considerable cuts to their welfare payments under the government’s draconian welfare-to-work reforms are facing yet another setback.</para>
<para>Families in my electorate are already doing it tough and this change means that things are going to get worse for them. The people of Werriwa are already facing significant increases in the price of petrol, which this government has refused to do anything about. Many families in my electorate are also suffering at the hands of the family tax benefit system and have to repay almost $1.5 million because of that flawed system. This is on top of already high mortgage repayments which, if the indications of the Reserve Bank as reported two nights ago are anything to go by, may go even higher. Now, when the family budget is already stretched to breaking point, they have to deal with this—policies that do nothing to lift the pressure that families and family budgets are currently under.</para>
<para>The instruments employed here are probably the bluntest that could have been employed by the government. Generally speaking, those who can least afford the copayments will be most affected by this change, and they are often those in society who, on average, have the highest propensity to suffer an illness. Higher copayments will cut down the use of pharmaceuticals, but it is also likely to mean that those groups who need access to pharmaceuticals will no longer be able to afford them. This is another mean act from a mean government. This bill introduces another system where those who can afford access will get access and those who cannot afford it will be deprived.</para>
<para>This bill has nothing to do with the sustainability of the PBS; it is about the sustainability of the government’s budget position. After the government splashed around cash during the last campaign in an effort to secure victory, it has realised that, in order to maintain its budget position, it is necessary to cut costs elsewhere. It is necessary to shift costs from the government books and foist them on the broader populace. Put simply, Labor does not believe in a two-tiered health system. It does not believe that, in order to fix a system, it needs to remove access to the system from those least able to afford it.</para>
<para>The price mechanism is a powerful tool which—I have to concede—can produce positive results. By the same token, price is also a powerful tool for producing vastly inferior outcomes if it is used wrongly. The changes implemented by this bill are a fine example of that. Labor believes that the PBS is an investment in the health of all Australians. It should not be abused; it should be used wisely and it should be financially sustainable. With this bill the government has signalled that it is determined to continue to remove access to affordable health care. It has done this by introducing a scheme that will produce not one, not two, not even three, but in effect 12 increases in the safety net threshold for the PBS over the next four years.</para>
<para>The passage of this bill will not make the PBS any more sustainable, it will not fix the growing hole in the budget and it will not introduce any further incentives for new medicines to be listed on the PBS. Access to the high-quality medical care that we have available in Australia should not be rationed simply on the basis of the ability to pay. We have all heard stories from people who continue to feel as though they have been ripped off by private health insurers as the minister continues to rubber stamp increases in their premiums, and now they are going to face this.</para>
<para>This bill is a manifestation in legislation of an out-of-touch government that—because their fourth term agenda only extends as far as destroying the rights of working Australians—is bereft of ideas and is trying to paper over cracks that it has already created for itself through the high-tax, high-spending regime that it has presided over for the last decade. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing, when he introduced this bill, crowed:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The safety net will continue to play an important role in protecting people from high out-of-pocket costs for PBS medicines.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Surely this cannot be believed with regard to the structure of this piece of legislation. I oppose this bill and I oppose everything that this government has done to destroy a health system that once provided safety and security for all Australians, comfortable in the knowledge that if they happened to get sick they could seek and find help through an affordable and equitable system.</para>

<para>—The <inline ref="R2427">National Health Amendment (Budget Measures—Pharmaceutical Benefits Safety Net) Bill 2005</inline> seeks to ensure that the cost of health will continue to be prohibitive for those people who can least afford it. This government is rapidly turning the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme into a two-tiered system whereby the wealthy can obtain prescriptions but the not-so-wealthy need to juggle which prescriptions they can afford. The PBS was introduced by the Chifley government to guarantee access by all Australian citizens to 130 lifesaving medicines. There were two High Court challenges and a constitutional referendum before the PBS was finally introduced. It was social reform designed to provide ‘universal and affordable access to medicines’. Significantly it has been the only public health initiative to receive a democratic mandate through a referendum.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This government has introduced a raft of changes since coming to office, none of which has assisted in the objective of ‘universal and affordable access’. In January 1999, the eligibility criteria for the seniors health card was extended. Apart from other benefits, the card allows its recipients to receive prescription medicines through the PBS at concession rates. Prior to the 2001 election, the government altered the eligibility criteria for self-funded retirees to access the Commonwealth seniors card. Far be it from me to suggest that this decision may have had a political motive.</para>
<para>The change meant that people over pension age who were not in receipt of the age pension and whose annual income was less than $50,000 for singles or less than $80,000 combined for couples were able to qualify for the card. I note that the changes in the 2001 budget also meant access to bulk-billing. I do not begrudge self-funded retirees having access to the concessional rates of the PBS, but I do find it interesting that this direct impact on the cost of the PBS has not been referred to when the government speaks of cost blow-outs. This change must have had a substantial impact on the cost of the PBS to the Commonwealth.</para>
<para>When the copayment concept was introduced in November 1990, pensioners faced a cost of $2.50 per prescription for the first time. However, to minimise the impact on low-income earners, the Hawke Labor government increased the pension and introduced a ‘safety net’. At the time, the use of discretionary drugs was lowered. In the 2001-02 budget there was a 27 per cent increase in the copayment amount, and safety net thresholds were increased. No compensation measure was introduced by this government to assist those adversely affected, and the number of prescriptions filled subsequently dropped.</para>
<para>The impact on the PBS budget projections was further exacerbated by the government’s failure to correctly assess the actual costs of the drugs Celebrex and Zyban. The 2005-06 budget proposed changes which were introduced on 1 January this year. These changes included another increase in the copayment and raised the level of the safety net. Concession card holders will now pay $4.60 for most prescriptions, up from $3.60. General users are now paying up to $28.60—up from $22.40. The increase in the safety net means that, for general card holders, the threshold has increased by $188.50 to $874.90. For concession card holders, the threshold has moved to $239.20, or 52 scripts, in a calendar year. These measures are estimated to save the government around $1.1 million over the next four years.</para>
<para>It seems to me that the government might pursue a fairer policy position by using some of the money spent on government advertising to fund the PBS. The same budget committed $45 million to four advertising campaigns that I am aware of. This is on top of $27.6 million on campaigns current at the time of the budget and a further estimated $35.1 million on pending campaigns.</para>
<para>Prior to the last election, the government promised it would pay 12.5 per cent less for PBS drugs when the first generic version of each new drug group was made available to the market. Earlier this year, the minister announced that the much-trumpeted generics policy had resulted in a special patient contribution for four drugs. I am advised that these are special drugs for lung cancer, depression and epilepsy, which do not have generic equivalents but are listed in the same therapeutic categories as those that do. These drugs on the PBS will only be able to be obtained by people who need them if they pay the PBS copayment in addition to the government’s special patient contribution—for example, Alimta, which is a drug for lung cancer, will cost a patient around $460 in the special patient contribution if they need it. For sufferers of lung cancer, I doubt that there is any choice. But what if you cannot find the $460?</para>
<para>The government has introduced many of these changes based on the increase in the overall cost of the PBS. I agree that the PBS must be sustainable into the future so that all generations can have access to the best pharmaceutical benefits scheme in the world. But at what social cost? These short-term solutions do not provide for the long-term sustainability of the PBS. Growth rates of PBS are not uniform. Since 1993-94, the average annual PBS growth rate, in real terms, has been around 11 per cent. In 2001-02 the rate of increase on spending on the PBS was 22 per cent over the previous year. The government failed to recognise that this increase was primarily due to the policy of raising the income limit for access to the Commonwealth seniors card; together with the cost blow-outs in Celebrex and Zyban.</para>
<para>The government panicked, and we saw the introduction of the measures I have previously mentioned. Since June 2002 the growth in the cost of the PBS declined from the high of 22 per cent to 10 per cent in 2002-03; eight per cent in 2003-04 and 10 per cent in 2004-05. Expenditure for the next few years is anticipated to be under 10 per cent, while reaching 10 per cent again in 2007-08. Yet, in the first six months of this year, since the increase in the copayment, growth in the cost of the PBS has slowed to 2.8 per cent.</para>
<para>Over the past nine years there has been a steady erosion of the PBS coupled with a steady cost increase to the consumer. Anecdotal and statistical evidence shows that these changes have impacted most directly on lower income earners and concession card holders. For example, in the first six months of this year, the number of concessional prescriptions grew by only one per cent and general scripts dropped by 5.1 per cent.</para>
<para>Research by the RAND Health Insurance Experiment in 1993 showed that, while copayments may reduce excess consumption by people on moderate or high incomes, they may deter people on low incomes. Anecdotally, it has been suggested that, when medicines have a direct impact on the household budget, people will choose to decrease their use of preventive drugs and increase the use of drugs which relieve symptoms. For example, a person may not take medication to reduce hypertension but rather take analgesics to remove a headache. Analgesics are cheaper than a prescription.</para>
<para>This government continues to chronically mismanage the PBS based on short-term solutions rather than long-term sustainability. Let me quote a specific example. Two of my constituents have asked me to make representations on their behalf to the minister. One is currently taking the long-lasting insulin Lantus. This costs $160 per month and the constituent finds it effective. The other constituent is pleading that Lantus be considered by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee for her husband’s condition. Both constituents have advised my office that the manufacturer has approached the PBAC to have Lantus listed on the PBS but has been unsuccessful. Yet two other long-acting insulin products are being withdrawn from the PBS, and I am advised that Lantus could be one of the substitutes. I am told that the PBAC may have felt constrained in its approval decisions by pressures from the government to rein in the costs of the PBS. This is simply unacceptable.</para>
<para>We hear nothing from the government on the fundamental concept of prevention rather than cure. My colleague the member for Lalor in a speech on 25 August quoted Canadian researchers. This research shows that there is a substitution between pharmaceuticals and medical services—that is, when the price of pharmaceuticals rises people are more likely to go to the doctor more often. Commonsense says that it must be cheaper to treat the symptoms not cure the illness. Consider someone with hypertension paying $28.60 per month for medication to reduce their blood pressure, which is offset by the PBS. Surely this is cheaper for the Commonwealth than paying for that person to remain in hospital while being treated for heart attack or stroke.</para>
<para>In their submission to the Productivity Commission inquiry on the impact of advances in medical technology on health care expenditure in Australia, the Australian National University stated:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Co-payments inhibit the use of essential medicines (including those for hypertension, high cholesterol, asthma, depression, heart conditions, diabetes, and thyroid conditions). Reducing the use of such essential medicines may cost the health system much more money than it saves.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The federal government has three key responsibilities in the health area: the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, Medicare and hospitals. It does not take a rocket scientist to realise that it is more cost effective for the overall health budget to fund the PBS realistically than to spend on the higher end of the health system.</para>
<para>Subsidising the PBS should be able to be offset by lower growth in hospital and medical costs. Medicines are subsidised, priced and prescribed with the goal of avoiding the higher end of treatment costs, which may otherwise be incurred through patients’ use of hospital and medical services. The true purpose of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme remains social rather than financial. It fulfils a vital role of social justice and equity for the whole community by facilitating universal access to essential medicines. In achieving this objective, the government continues to fail dismally.</para>
<para>I think the great tragedy is that we have a government approaching its 10th anniversary. What does it have to show for it? This is one area it is going backwards on. We know that $100 million has been allocated for advertising the government’s spin when it comes to the changes in workplace relations. How that $100 million could be used on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is easy to imagine. It would make a contribution to our society instead of the negative advertising that we are subjected to. We are told that the figures, when that $100 million is spent, will be in the order of $1 billion worth of advertising over that 10-year period. That is a disgrace when the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme at the moment is being mismanaged by this government. I say to the government: you have been elected to govern for all Australians. Stop governing for some Australians. Cut out the rhetoric. It is about time the PBS and other worthy schemes are properly funded instead of your advertising for spin purposes.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I am happy to speak in conjunction with the rest of my colleagues on the <inline ref="R2427">National Health Amendment (Budget Measures—Pharmaceutical Benefits Safety Net) Bill 2005</inline>. I point out, as the member for Scullin did, that there was one solitary member of the government willing to step up to the plate and argue the government’s case. The member for McMillan was the only backbencher willing to support the case put forward by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing. You might wonder why government members are so unwilling to argue the case for the government. If you have a look at what is in this bill, you will see that there is very good reason for the government members to be scurrying away from these provisions. This bill fundamentally injures the safety net that has been put in place to help people who are chronically ill avoid the need to expend moneys that they do not have on medicines that they need.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Under Labor, the provisions that were put in in relation to this safety net ensured that the people who most needed the medicines, those who were most chronically ill, would be able to afford them, because the level of copayment was affordable. We ensured that once people got to the relevant level of prescription then, from that point, if they were a concession card holder, they would be able to get the rest of their prescriptions for that particular year free. For people who were general payees, we ensured that there were arrangements once they got to the level of the safety net. This has a dramatic impact on every Australian family, whether it is a single person in a household or whether it is a mother, father and a number of children. When people were most pressed in looking to the care of their family and the health of their family, then, if they had expended up to the level of the safety net—once they got to that point—they could be assured that the extra expenditure that they might have to undertake would not be imposed on them.</para>
<para>What do we find under this government? We find that under this government there was a 30 per cent increase in the amount that concession card holders and general people had to pay for the cost of all their medicines. It is now $4.60 per prescription up to a level of 52 prescriptions per year that concession card holders have to pay. What is the provision in this bill for people on concession cards? For the next three years, it will go up by another two scripts per year. We will find that after 1 January 2006 it will be 54 prescriptions in that year of 2006. In 2007 it will be 56. In 2008 it will go to 58 prescriptions. What will happen when we come to deal with people who are in the general category? They can face up to $28.60 for each of two extra prescriptions, because that is the increase for this year. I am not sure, but there may be a rise in those categories as well.</para>
<para>The government argues that, first, it is a question of cost-benefit analysis and, second, it has to protect the community as a whole from people who might overuse or abuse the system. What is this system about if it is not about a safety net? The Minister for Health and Ageing may as well abolish the whole safety net entirely, and do it openly, rather than doing it by stealth, as he is here in this bill.</para>
<para>The impact with the general provisions is on the number of prescriptions but there is also the specific provision that you cannot get a repeat medicine in less than 20 days. What if you are coming to the end of a period and you have already reached the safety net? For a person in the general category, you are looking at something like $879 a year before you even get to a concession. For any other medications you would pay $4.60 each instead of $28.60. Someone in that condition may be in a position where, for their own health benefit, they have to go and get a prescription. What is the impact of this if you have already reached the safety net? What is here in this bill is pretty simple: you can front up with $28.60, thank you very much. You will pay full freight.</para>
<para>The expectation of the government is that it will make a great many savings—in the order of $140 million. Those savings will come from the pockets of pensioners and concessionaries and from the general population. There is a simple situation that many people will face. They will be asked to pay the full cost of those medicines when they need them. If a person has a repeat prescription, fundamentally there is a medical reason for that.</para>
<para>I will give a simple and direct example of what that might be. I have twice suffered from a condition where I have had a cold sore directly in my eye. I take a prescription medication, Acyclovir. I have twice had that condition directly in the eye. I have it many times a year proximate to the eye—close to it. There is a potential that I could have it in the eye again. When I get that cold sore, I have to take the medication as a prophylactic and to fix the situation. I have to take the medication four to five times a day. It is only a very small tube, so I need the repeat tube. What does this provision say would happen if I reached that safety net point? Even if I am at the safety net point, if I need to get that provided on a repeat basis within 20 days it may be on the list of medicines that should be knocked out. In this simple example it is a situation where, if you do not use the medicine, you can lose your sight. That has happened to me twice when I got the cold sore directly in the eye. The ulceration had the effect that I lost part of the sight in my right eye.</para>
<para>For any person who is a general member of the community or someone on a concession, the provisions of this bill lay out that the safety net will be stripped away. What should have been there to protect them will be ripped away from underneath them. It vitiates the whole purpose of the safety net being in existence. It will mean that people in similar positions, needing lifesaving drugs or drugs that could prevent the loss of sight or hearing, will be in a position where they will have to pay more for those if they need them.</para>
<para>The provisions the minister for health has introduced here are savage and vicious. The changes to this safety net proposal are not based on the fact that the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has been rising by 11, 10 or nine per cent a year. It is not because of those provisions. It is because of another set of safety net provisions—out-of-pocket provisions—that this minister for health introduced without a proper cost-benefit analysis being done. He wilfully maintained the provisions prior to the last election and did not rein them in until after the election.</para>
<para>The set of provisions in this bill mean not only that ordinary Australians will pay more for their prescriptions but also that their health will be challenged. The government seeks to take from them what previously was there. This provision was set up in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme under the Chifley government and there was also the introduction of the safety net and its proper operation. The fact is that Australians who most need the help of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and this safety net—the weakest, the sickest and those who have the least money—will be put under incredibly greater pressure as a result of the viciousness of these proposals.</para>
<para>It is possible to make savings under the PBS and to do it in an open and honest way. It is possible to say outright, prior to the election, that this is what the government intends to do—as it did last year when it saved $1.3 billion. This year it is $200 million to $400 million that the minister for health seeks to save. But it is also possible to do it in the way the minister for health has, in an underhanded way.</para>

<para>—My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to his statement that a benchmark for Australia’s job being done in Iraq is when the Iraqi security forces are able to deal adequately with the insurgency. I also refer to the US Senate testimony of General Casey, US Commander in Iraq. When asked how many battalions of the new Iraqi army were now capable of independent operations, General Casey replied: ‘One’. Given that it is now 2½ years since the invasion and the new Iraqi army effectively has only one battalion of 700 troops facing an estimated insurgency of 30,000, when exactly does the Prime Minister expect Iraq’s security forces will be capable of dealing with the insurgency and when, therefore, will he detail to the Australian people his own exit strategy from Iraq?</para>

<para>—I am aware of the testimony given by General Casey. I am also aware of separate assessments made by the Australian military that indicate that the security forces in Iraq which operate in the areas where Australians are deployed are improving in capability. That gives us grounds for some optimism. It is also the case that, when I visited Al Muthanna province in July, both the Australian military people to whom I spoke and the British military commander who came from Basra spoke positively of the improvements which had taken place in relation to the capacity of the Iraqi security forces.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is a slow process. I think that is self-evident. But it is a very difficult task that the Iraqi security forces face. There are really two choices in Iraq. We can either persevere in the belief which the government holds that, through perseverance, a stable country will emerge, capable of looking after itself, or we can do as the opposition wants to do and cut and run and condemn the people of Iraq to the chaos, disorder and—</para>

<para>—The question asked by the member for Griffith shows very clearly the different approach that the two sides of this parliament have as to whether or not Iraq should be given the hope of a democratic future. The Labor Party do not believe in a democratic future for Iraq, whereas we on this side of the House do. Giving Iraq a democratic future will require the continued presence of coalition forces for some time into the future. I have no intention of foolishly, or without any proper grounds for doing so, making myself or this government hostage to a particular date. The Leader of the Opposition and the member for Griffith can ask as many questions as they like. Nothing will alter the fact that they do not really want a democratic Iraq. Their policy will condemn Iraq to years of chaos, terrorism and internal disorder. Our policy, on the other hand, will give to the people of Iraq the hope of a democratic future.</para>

<para>Let me say, through the House to the people of Iraq, that I hope I speak on behalf of all Australians in saying that we would like to see a massive turnout at the referendum over the weekend. If there is a high turnout at the weekend, it will demonstrate the determination of the people of Iraq. It is very well for us to make fine speeches against the background of uninterrupted democracy but, when you are fighting to establish a democratic country in the face of the most fearful terrorism, your behaviour is to be admired. It should not be sneered at, as has been the case with the member for Griffith.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Greenway for raising this issue. Today, along with other members of the house—including the Minister for Family and Community Services and the Minister for Health and Ageing—I launched Carers Week. In the course of doing so, I was able to speak of a number of things that have been done by this government to expand the support for the magnificent carers of Australia. They comprise some 2.5 million Australians who are engaged in different ways in the informal voluntary care sector. They are amongst the most impressive, inspiring and praiseworthy of our fellow citizens. On this occasion, at the commencement of Carers Week, I want to say to all of our fellow Australians who are engaged in care: we are profoundly in your debt. You enrich the character of our national life, and we owe you something that can never be properly expressed or properly repaid.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The government has enhanced in many ways support for carers, particularly over the last few years. We have announced significant enhancements in the formal care sector. For the past two budgets we have had additional one-off supplements both in relation to the carers allowance and the carer payment: $1,000 for carer payment recipients and $600 for carer allowance recipients. In the 2004 budget we announced a $2.2 billion investment in the formal and informal aged care sectors. In this year’s budget we announced $207.6 million over four years to expand access to respite care. In September, the Minister for Family and Community Services announced $57 million to extend carer payment to carers of children with severe intellectual, psychiatric or behavioural disabilities.</para>
<para>I am pleased to say that I announced today at the opening of Carers Week a new initiative of the government: a package worth some $200 million that will allow ageing parents of children with disabilities, amongst other things, to establish private trusts of up to $500,000 for the future care of their children without being affected by social security, gifting and means testing.</para>
<para>This is a very significant structural change. It will affect many families with ageing parents who wish to sell a large home and downsize on the basis that their disabled child might go into some other kind of residence. Under existing arrangements, the money provided for that other residence would be deemed a continuing asset and be caught by the means or assets test. That will no longer be the case when these new arrangements come into operation and, whilst I am not suggesting for a moment that this is going to meet all of the needs of carers in our community, it is a very significant step forward.</para>
<para>I take the opportunity of paying tribute to Senator Kay Patterson, the Minister for Family and Community Services, who has campaigned long and hard for this change. She, more than anybody else in the government, has been responsible for this change with her persistence, her compassion and her commitment. It will bring relief and it will solve the thing that I have found in interviews with elderly parents of disabled adult children that bothers them most: ‘What will happen to our child when we die? Will they be properly cared for?’ As I said, it does not solve every problem—I am not pretending that—but it is a significant improvement. It will meet a need. I think it can be seen as part of an ongoing program by this government to expand the support we provide for a section of the community to whom we owe so much—that is, the 2½ million carers of Australia.</para>

Can the Attorney confirm that seven of the eight government backbenchers on this committee will have a family relationship centre in their electorate? How can the Attorney assure the House that the members for Bass, Deakin, Greenway, Lindsay, Moncrieff, Riverina and Wakefield did not participate or in any way interfere in the location allocation for the family relationship centres? Further, will the Attorney now commit to the House that these backbenchers will have no role to play in assisting tenderers to make applications to run these services and no role in assessing tender applications to be made for the services to be run in their electorates?</para>

I took advice from my department in relation to demographic matters. It certainly was aware of the choices that I was considering. I cannot comment on whether or not there are specifically centres in the electorates that have been mentioned, but I will check the matter, but it was irrelevant to the choices that were made.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>What I can say about the members of parliament who have served and will continue to serve on the task force that is advising on the broad implementation of these matters, but not on the choice of centres, is that they come from those parts of Australia where they have, with their contacts within their electorates, very considerable experience and capacity to advise and assist on these matters. I make no apologies whatsoever for involving those members in giving advice on the way in which those matters in their electorates that they are familiar with ought to be addressed.</para>
<para>I have been asked a specific question about whether or not the members will be involved in the choice of those who tender. As to who will be successful, I can assure you they will not be involved in that process. I do not regard it as being appropriate.

<para>—I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. As his colleagues on this side of the House have quickly found out, he has considerable capacity and ability and a great deal of interest in the issue of families and keeping families together. He has produced some very erudite papers on these matters, which I would encourage all members of the parliament to read and consider.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Today I had the pleasure of being joined by a number of my parliamentary colleagues, including the member for Wakefield, when I spoke with families at a public meeting here in Parliament House about the government’s family law reforms. As members would know, we are embarking upon the most significant reforms in 30 years. Around Australia, we will be changing the landscape of the way in which family relationships are managed. Separation will no longer be seen as just a legal matter that you battle over in the courts. What we want is a situation where parents will be encouraged to sit down together and sort out what is best for their children. At the heart of this cultural change will be our new family relationship centres. I have previously announced that 15 of those centres will be opened by the middle of next year. Today I announced that the remaining 50 centres, to complete the network of 65 centres, will be rolled out progressively in the following two years. These new centres, along with the strong emphasis we are placing on outreach, will cover the nation. From Cairns to Campbelltown, and from the Pilbara to Launceston, families will have a place where they can go to get help. Having travelled around the country consulting with families on the role of these centres, I know they will make a real difference.</para>
<para>Unfortunately, not everybody in the parliament shares that view. In fact, what we have found—and the Leader of the Opposition might like to know this in relation to his colleagues—is that some of them seek to trivialise the matter. The salad bar analogy used recently by the member for Gellibrand poses some very significant questions because, whilst this government is providing ‘healthy’ alternatives to help parents resolve their family relationship issues in a way that does not end up in court, the Labor Party offers little more than salad dressing. One piece of advice I can give to the member for Gellibrand—and her colleagues probably share this view—is that she should get on board and support the government’s generational changes to the family law system.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Dobell for his question and for his championing of small businesses in his electorate on the New South Wales coast. Small businesses in Australia will be able to increase employment through, amongst other things, the removal of the unfair dismissal laws—through increased flexibility—which will enable them to take on extra staff. Yesterday we saw the animosity towards small businesses in Australia from the ACTU in an exchange between ACTU President Greg Combet and Richard Glover on ABC radio. An employer rang in pointing out that, because of the inflexibility in the current workplace relations system, he was unable to offer an extra shift to a 21-year-old employee. Instead, he and his wife had to do the work, resulting in less money for the employee and, of course, the employer and his wife missing time with their family. He asked Mr Combet, ‘What about when the shoe is on the other foot, Greg?’ There was an awkward pause on the radio and then Mr Combet said, ‘I’m afraid I’m not a small business advocate.’ That is only too true.</para>

<para>This hostile attitude towards small business was also revealed in <inline font-style="italic">The Latham Diaries</inline>.

<para>—Thank you, Mr Speaker. My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, is it not the case that Colmar Brunton is working in close collaboration with Jackson Wells Morris and advertising agency Dewey Horton—all of whom are under consultation and contracts from the Commonwealth government—Dewey Horton having been associated with Liberal Party election advertising for many years? Has $2 million of taxpayers’ money already been forked out to these Liberal Party favourites for the government’s industrial relations spin and propaganda campaign? Prime Minister, does this not prove that the government’s misleading advertising propaganda is really a Liberal Party campaign for political purposes?</para>

<para>—I am indebted to the member for Perth for asking that question. He mentioned a number of firms. Let me start with Jackson Wells Morris. It is probably well known in this House that, although Grahame Morris is no longer associated with that firm, he is my close friend—we have a very close friendship. He was a political adviser of mine over a number of years and is a person for whom I have enormous regard. The Wells is a former journalist who was my press secretary during one of my unsuccessful stints as the Leader of the Opposition—it seems to be a habit in this place to have unsuccessful stints as opposition leader. He was also press secretary to Andrew Peacock. But the Keith Jackson was, I think in either the 1970s or 1980s, the Labor candidate for Mackellar.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>A member of the advisory board to that company was none other than Kerry Sibraa. There is also a gentleman—I know this gentleman and I have a very high regard for him—whose surname is Cook, who is a senior adviser to that firm and was in fact either the principal private secretary or the senior adviser to John Dawkins when he was minister for education in the former Labor government. I suppose you could say that firm qualifies unconditionally as a group of Howard government mates! You might say that, but I think you would be stretching it a bit far. The processes of this have been correct, and the fact that you happen to have an association with the Labor Party or the Liberal Party, if you have the ability, should not disqualify you. If you want a bit of field evidence for that going back to the time the Labor Party was in office, have a look at what Rod Cameron did for former Labor governments.</para>

<para>—Certainly people who live in rural and regional Australia—40 per cent of Australian families—want an industrial relations system that is flexible and able to provide particular benefits and tailored agreements to meet their needs. The employment agreements that can meet the individual circumstances of families that perhaps have to travel long distances will obviously have significant benefits in rural and regional areas. Families want flexibility, small business wants flexibility and we have just heard that unions want flexibility. The only people that do not want flexibility, it seems, are the members opposite. They want a staid, rules driven industrial relations system that cannot allow businesses to take advantage of their opportunities or families to negotiate an arrangement which enables them to have the very best possible lifestyle.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>WorkChoices will provide the real opportunity for families to negotiate a family friendly working arrangement. It will give them opportunities in relation to appropriate leave and family friendly arrangements, including personal and carers leave whenever that is necessary for their families. That is the kind of flexibility that it seems members opposite think is inappropriate. And, what is more, they do not want the public to hear about it. They do not want the truth, they do not want anything said about what is being proposed in this legislation and they do not want the public to be given information. All they want is to have distorted trade union campaigns endeavouring to tear apart these changed arrangements. Families that live in rural and regional Australia that might have to travel long distances may well choose a working arrangement that gives them the opportunity to work for longer hours and then have longer periods off. That is the kind of thing that unions are happy to negotiate on behalf of their members, but Labor opposite wants to put an end to that kind of thing.</para>
<para>The strong economic performance that we have seen in Australia, the growth in our economy since the first tranche of industrial relations reform in 1996, ought to really be an inspiration for us to go further at this stage. The honourable member for Hinkler has noted in his own area the extraordinary drop in unemployment and the growth in business. We are in adjoining electorates and for many years we have had amongst the highest unemployment rates in the country. It is magnificent to see the drop in unemployment over recent times. That is very much about having a growing economy that is built on a flexible workplace. It is important that Labor should set aside its opposition to this proposed flexible new system. They boasted when they were in government how they kept wages down. We want a system that provides an opportunity for people to earn more in circumstances that fit their own family needs and also, as a result, to build strong and progressive businesses, because the progress and development of our country is very much dependent upon having a very successful business environment.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Wentworth for his question, and I acknowledge the very broad range of the member for Wentworth’s interests. In answer to the member for Wentworth, I can certainly assure him that older Australians can trust the Howard government to deliver high-quality, affordable health services. Thanks to the government’s bulk-billing incentives, I can inform the member for Wentworth that some 85.5 per cent of older people now have their GP consultations bulk-billed. Thanks to another government initiative, more than 200,000 Australians aged over 75 now get comprehensive health checks every year under Medicare—thanks to the Howard government. Perhaps most importantly—thanks to the additional private health insurance rebates that this government is offering to older people—1.1 million Australians aged over 65 can keep the security and the choice that private health insurance brings.</para>

<para>But I am aware of a policy called Medicare Gold—an unfunded, unfair policy which purports to help older people by ripping off younger people.

<para>—I thank the honourable member for Hume for his question. The member for Hume is eminently qualified to speak, drawing on his life experiences as well as his experiences of the excesses of union power and intervention in the workplace. He spent 32 years in the meat processing industry and several years of that time on the floor of a meatworks. He can tell stories about being forced out of work, as a young man with a young family, and being involuntarily on strike for six months or more, consequently making it very hard to provide for his family. The complexity and overprescription that have grown up over the years with regard to the union dominated award system defy belief. They certainly defy logic. There is no justification: it is utterly indefensible to have the system we have at present over six jurisdictions.</para>

<para>—This represents big unions and big government, which are embodied by the Labor Party. I have spoken about the cost of some awards in providing for the care of horses supplied by employees and how it varies between states. In some states it is $4, in others it is $3.50 and in some others it is $5.50. It varies, it is inconsistent and it lacks logic. It surprised me to find the same distorted hotchpotch of a system also exists in providing for allowances for bicycles—so much so that, under a number of awards, there is a higher allowance for bicycles than for horses. For instance, under the National Fast Food Retail Award, a bicycle allowance is $9 per week. That is twice the cost of the allowance provided for a horse across the country. With a horse—an essential aid for many in country areas—there are grooming, feed and watering costs. But why would you give twice the amount per week for maintaining a bicycle than you would for maintaining a horse?</para>

<para>The Queensland Clerical Employees Award has $3.36 for a bicycle. So caring for a bicycle in Queensland costs about one-third of what it costs in New South Wales. And there is poor old Tassie—the Tasmanian Horticulturalist Award provides only 80c a day for a bicycle. The bicycles must feel neglected! The best of all is the New South Wales shop employees award, because there you get $9.80 for a bicycle—the highest of anywhere in Australia. But better than that: you get $9.80 per week for a tricycle. I do not know how many tricycle enthusiasts there are among the shoppies of New South Wales, but they are well catered for. The simple fact is that these awards—and there are thousands of them—get in the way of commonsense. And it means that not only employers but also employees are spending most of their time trying to adhere to the conditions laid down by the unions and by the Labor Party, so they do not get on with the job.

<para>—I thank the member for Kingston not only for the question but also for his very strong support for the auto industry—not only in South Australia but right around Australia. When it comes to the future of the Australian automotive industry, the government is well and truly taking the driver’s seat. This industry has received two long-term plans worth about $7 billion, or even more, from this government. This is a serious investment in the global competitiveness of the Australian automotive industry and it is delivering results. Last year 130,000 Australian made vehicles were exported, and that is a record number. In 2002-03 $630 million was invested in R&amp;D, an increase of $140 million on the R&amp;D in the automotive sector of the previous year. Today, in a positive development for the local automotive industry, Mitsubishi Australia has launched its new 380 model, which has received very strong reviews. I understand that the member for Kingston has already shown his confidence in that product by ordering one. I urge other people to consider that also.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>There is an oversupply of capacity on a global scale and these are impressive achievements by the Australian industry. We in the government are not resting on our achievements. We are working to ensure that the future of the car industry is as strong as possible. Just recently I led a delegation of industry representatives to Japan and we promoted Australia’s automotive capabilities to the head offices of Mitsubishi, Toyota, Nissan and Mazda. We had a reasonably positive reaction, I have to say. There was one response that we received from them, though, that we all need to bear in mind, and that is that we as an industry in Australia have to deliver on price, quality and, of course, security of supply.</para>
<para>It is to the third element that the threats that the member for Kingston has asked about are emerging. Union strikes crippled the car sector in 2001-02, bringing production to a standstill and, at one stage, costing the industry $30 million a day. That is a disgraceful example of reckless union power, and it is no surprise that the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries pointed out on Tuesday in its statement that parts of the Australian automotive supply chain are still particularly vulnerable to disruption. It is no surprise also, on that basis, that the FCAI has fully backed the government’s IR reform package. Who opposed it? Doug Cameron opposed it, and so did the federal Labor Party. The federal Labor Party remain the biggest threat to Australia’s car industry.</para>

Who is delivering—the coalition or the Labor Party? Let us look at interest rates. With the interest rates, people are $500 or $600 a month better off under the coalition than under Labor.

<para>—He says, ‘Weak.’ That is the thing that you think about, politically speaking, when you hear the Leader of the Opposition. He has had 9½ years to define a persona. He has had 9½ years to tell the Australian people what he stands for. The only thing that can be said of the Leader of the Opposition is that, if the coalition is in favour of it, the Leader of the Opposition is against it.</para>

<para>He once believed that you should roll back the GST. He is now so far in retreat from that that when the word ‘roll-back’ came out of his lips in relation to industrial relations he said: ‘No, rub that out; airbrush that out. I didn’t really say it.’ I thought at one stage the Leader of the Opposition did represent an alternative leader of the Labor movement in this country, but I have watched him over 9½ years. He does not have the ticker to articulate an alternative policy to the Australian people. All he ever does is oppose for opposition’s sake.</para>

<para class="block">Twice in this week the opposition has moved a censure motion against the government related to aspects of their industrial relations bills not yet before the House. The propaganda is out but not the bills. The propaganda is out—the soft soap is out—but not the knife. The knife remains sheathed for the course of the next couple of weeks. Twice in this House these so-called brave men—these folk full of ticker!—have squibbed a censure debate. The Prime Minister, who regards the industrial relations legislation as his leitmotiv and finest hour, has squibbed participation in the debate. I think that speaks volumes to the Australian people.</para>
<para>Fairness, which has been added as an afterthought in these documents, is not the hallmark of this government. We say the system needs to be fair. The churches say the system needs to be fair. Australians want the system to be fair. Even the government’s own advertising gurus say the system should be fair. So what does the government do? Instead of putting fairness into the system, it puts ‘fairness’ into its slogan. That is where fairness ends. Instead of just pulping the first of its booklets, at vast public expense, it should pulp the bill.</para>
<para>This deceit typifies the government’s whole approach to industrial relations: soft soap sell on the outside; a twist of the knife on the inside. A sum of $100 million of taxpayers’ money to sell the Australian public a wages cut. I will tell you one of the things that the Australian people know that I stand for and that my party stands for: the ordinary Australian who, for the last 9½ years, has been traduced by a political party that has said one thing in an election campaign and done another thing after it. It said it would never, ever do the GST—</para>

<para>—The whole point is that, if the government had the courage to confront a censure motion, it would be possible for them to lay out a defence of what it is they are up to. The Prime Minister loves the opportunity for reply in question time and to sit in coward’s castle and abuse us and all that we do on this side of House. But when the moment comes for them to face the music, and there is a fair and even-handed debate in the place, they cut and run. That is the form of the government, and we are seeing that form here again. The unfortunate thing is that we are not the people who are being cut and run on in this case. The people who are being run over are the ordinary Australians, who will be shattered by the passage, ultimately, of this legislation.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The reason why we have to discuss this matter in this place and why this motion to suspend standing orders ought to be carried is that these documents bear some very close examination indeed. Clearly these documents were put out and printed with one set of intentions in mind, and then they were got together to do two things: firstly, to soft-soap the cover of it and, secondly, to start to manoeuvre for the government a position where their words had enough wriggle in them to cover what their real intentions were. So all of a sudden we had dumped into the middle of the title the word ‘fairer’. That is the soft line. The more interesting thing is what then happened to other sets of words. In the old document, the document that the public will never see, one particular chapter—in fact the most important of the chapters in it—begins: ‘Your existing award conditions protected by law.’ Out of that document are those words and inside instead is ‘WorkChoices and awards.’ Out goes ‘Your existing award conditions protected by law’ and in comes ‘WorkChoices and awards.’ In the old document one of the subheadings in this chapter is ‘Preserving key award conditions.’ In the document to be released it becomes ‘Protecting award conditions.’ The word is softened immediately.</para>
<para>In the old document, with its lovely little ‘protected by law’ stamp over it, is ‘Terms and conditions and existing agreements will be protected’—so a nice little ‘protected by law’ stamp over it. In the to be released document—nothing. There is nothing at all; it is gone. The ‘protected by law’ is gone. Then in the old document you have the heading ‘Protected award conditions.’ In the document to be released it becomes ‘Protecting award conditions in bargaining.’ Two totally different concepts. What this government has determined to do is to rip those awards from underneath Australian workers. Nothing grates on our nerves more on this side of the House—and it is one of the reasons why we want an open debate and a censure motion on this—than to see some of the wealthiest people in this country standing before the dispatch box, mocking the conditions of some of the poorest, ordinary Australians—people who are shop assistants, not terribly powerful, and rural workers, desperately trying to get the resources together to support their families. These are people whose livelihood is less than the expense claims of the average Australian cabinet minister—and because, for their pitiful bike, horse or whatever, they are entitled to a $5 payment, they get mocked in this place.</para>
<para>The ordinary Australian does not reside anywhere in the heart of the average Liberal or National Party member. They despise ordinary Australians, and they now want to brutalise them. The simple fact of the matter is that this entire panoply, facade, volume of words out there in the public conceals one essential and absolutely concrete purpose—that is, the intention of the government is to introduce a set of laws that will cut people’s wages. That is the point. They want to exercise downward pressure on wages at a time when the cost of living on so many fronts is rising quite dramatically. Their intention here particularly applies to those who find themselves less able to protect themselves in the work force, which happens to include a majority of the work force: young people entering it, women who are casuals, members of the work force who are skilled and semiskilled—few of whom are unionised. It is an odd thing about this debate: the unions are in fact standing, in the main, for non-unionised Australians—few of whom are protected by unions but all of whom are protected by the existence of an Industrial Relations Commission and a set of awards and a set of award conditions.</para>
<para>Finally, we have got to debate these censure motions and have them seriously considered in this place because the intention on the part of the government has to be exposed in detail so that the public of this country understand what it is they are up to, because in the last election campaign they saw none of it. The government did not have the courage or the fortitude to go into the last election campaign telling the Australian people what they would do. But they have fraudulently spent $100 million worth of public funds to try to conceal from the public what it is they intend to do. This censure motion must now be debated. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Mr Speaker, the motion before the chair should be defeated because the record of this government has been about improving the working conditions of Australians. In contrast, the record of the Leader of the Opposition, when he was Minister for Employment, Education and Training, is an abysmal record. Teenage unemployment in Australia, when this man was in charge of unemployment in this country, was 34.5 per cent. That is the record of the opposition that comes in and says, ‘Look at the record of the government.’ Our record is a 14.9 per cent increase in real wages, 1.7 million extra jobs and over 10 million Australians in work. That is why this motion should be defeated.</para>

</talk.start>

<para>I gave some examples of agreements today where the very thing that the unions are railing against are the things which they are entering into agreements on and having them signed up in the Industrial Relations Commission. On one hand, we hear them in here railing against the fact that hundreds of thousands of people work on public holidays and, on the other hand, we have instruments of employment negotiated and entered into by unions in Australia put forward for certification at the Industrial Relations Commission which provide that degree of flexibility. This is a confected outrage by the Leader of the Opposition. As I said, this was a man who, when told by Paul Keating that he had better go along and vote in 1993 for workplace change, did it. When he has been told not to do it, he will not do it today.</para>

<para>—Standing orders need to be suspended to enable the House to censure the Howard government for its deliberate deception of the Australian people about the damage its extreme industrial relations changes will do to Australians and their families and its outrageous waste of taxpayers’ dollars for a fraudulent advertising campaign which is really Liberal Party propaganda and spin. Standing orders need to be suspended so that the House can debate that censure and censure the Howard government because of the matters that were exposed during question time.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In question time we discovered that the government had prepared, at taxpayers’ expense, documents as part of its multimillion dollar advertising campaign and had pulped 60,000 copies of a 16-page brochure at an estimated cost of $40,000. Why did it do that? Because it received advertising and market research advice that the spin was not quite right, that it needed to insert in the headline the word ‘fairer’—<inline font-style="italic">A simpler, fairer, national Workplace Relations System for Australia</inline>—that would go over better with the public. The problem is that this has exposed the complete lack of defence that the government has in this monstrous and massive abuse of taxpayers’ funds for party political purposes.</para>
<para>The Prime Minister stands at the dispatch box in question time and says, ‘This is all defensible and defended because it is providing information to the public.’ The government inserts the word ‘fairer’—and it does not even believe that fairness ought to be a public policy priority or attribute in this area. In a speech given by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations on 25 February 2005 he says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">In the context of this debate and where we want the workplace relations system to be in five years time much is often said of the need to focus the workplace relations system on fairness. This is, and must be a focus of Government but, and as the Business Council of Australia recently argued, an emphasis on fairness only leads to regulatory excess and inefficiency that reduces productivity and discourages job creation.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 16 February, the Business Council, which the minister was endorsing, said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... there has been heavy reliance on workplace relations policies to redistribute wealth and the achieve ‘fair’ outcomes. But using workplace relations to achieve fairness has often resulted in restrictive and uncompetitive workplace practices.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The government as a matter of public policy does not believe that fairness ought to apply in this area, yet it inserts—at a monstrous expense to the taxpayer—the word ‘fairness’ because it is advised by its market researchers, its advertisers and its Liberal Party election campaign mates that that will put the spin over better for the Australian public and they will be able to slide it through. How do we know this? Colmar Brunton, an advertising and market research company, has been given over half a million dollars to do market research, firstly, to help prepare the government’s advertising and, secondly—and it was in the field last night in the Illawarra and Brisbane—to test the effectiveness of that advertising so far as the public is concerned. What advice have Colmar Brunton given to the Liberal Party mates Jackson Wells Morris and Dewey and Horton, the advertising agency? The advice they have given them is, ‘You’ve got to get the spin better. So: let’s add the word “fairness” in because that will trick the public better. That will deceive the public better. That will make the monstrous abuse of taxpayers’ funds’, which the government is using for Liberal Party campaign purposes, ‘more effective. It will slide it through the punters better.’</para>
<para>As the Leader of the Opposition showed during question time, once you get past the cover, the devil—and the knife to the conditions, salaries and entitlements of working Australians—is in the detail. It is on page 13 of the document. You change the cover to say ‘fairness’ and then you change the inside to make sure that current conditions can be even further pulled away. It pulls the rug of the safety net, minimum standards and the independent umpire away from the living standards of working Australians. There is a need to suspend standing orders to censure this government for a massive, fraudulent deception. It is a corruption of the public policy and parliamentary and government process by using millions and millions of dollars of taxpayers’ funds for a Liberal Party campaign purpose to perpetrate a fraud on the public. In its defence, it says that it is providing information to the public. It makes newspaper advertisements, TV advertisements and brochures, and it is happy to pulp them if the spin is not quite right despite the even greater loss and expense to the taxpayers. This government needs to be censured for acting like a gang of burglars, deceiving the Australian public. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—At the end of question time—or as it now turns out to have been the end of question time—members in this place and anyone in the gallery would have noted the Prime Minister directed an uncharacteristic spasm of pure hatred across the dispatch box towards me. A normally quite courteous man in an old-fashioned sort of way—even if he is thoroughly devious in the way in which he deals with the electorate—he reserved for the end of this week a package of bile such that I have not seen from him in a very long time. It was an indication to me and all my colleagues that, 12 months into this parliamentary term, we in the opposition are being very effective. We are holding this government to account for its deceit, its dishonesty, its exploitation of the public purse and, above all, for its willingness to impose on ordinary Australians and the happiness in their lives its rampant ideology.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Another thing that we have done during this week is to demonstrate comprehensively that the propaganda campaign that the government have put forward is not about information; it is about spin. Closely monitoring public opinion and their failure to change it, they are trying desperately to work out a way in which their totally unacceptable positions can be made to seem more acceptable to the Australian people. I do not discuss polls—never have, either in government or in opposition—but I will today on this one thing. I guess we have an explanation as to why the government are so closely monitoring public opinion on this issue. In the polls that we saw earlier this week, a quite narrow difference between the government and the opposition on industrial relations matters has exploded into a 2-1 differential.</para>
<para>Quite clearly, the pulping of the government’s document, at vast public expense, followed by its reprinting with a different title to include the word ‘fairer’, was a direct response from some form of their polling which was replicating to them the sudden collapse of public confidence in the willingness of the government to give a fair deal to ordinary working Australians. We see the dramatic expose of that in what we have had presented to us today.</para>
<para>The second thing that we have tumbled over during this week has been the extent to which, as the government go through their phraseology, they seek the wriggle room to justify at the conclusion a massive diminution in the working conditions of ordinary Australians. That is what they are seeking to do. We have firm statements like ‘existing award conditions protected by law’, ‘preserving key award conditions’, ‘terms and conditions in existing agreements will be protected’ and ‘protected award conditions’. That panoply of guarantees subtly but decisively undermines. Some of them have been removed, as I have already indicated, and boiled down to work choices and awards. From ‘preserving’ we get ‘protecting’ and from ‘protected award conditions’ we get ‘protected award conditions in bargaining’. So the Australian people get a clear picture from the contrast between these two documents. The government will walk into this chamber—when it finally gets to presenting this blinking legislation; we have been waiting for it since May—with a metaphorical legislative knife between its teeth, as far as ordinary Australians are concerned.</para>
<para>The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations in question time today started talking about the fact that there are bargaining arrangements which from time to time allow workers, if they wish to, to bargain certain rights for much higher levels of pay. Many backbenchers shouted out to him at that time, ‘If there is that level of flexibility, why are you bothering with the new legislation?’ A logical question, I would have thought, but the answer is simple. In the legislation that is going to be put forward in a fortnight’s time, or thereabouts, one absolutely essential condition, which to this point has accompanied the greater level of flexibility in the wages system put in place by the Keating and Hawke governments, is what is known euphemistically as the no disadvantage test.</para>
<para>In effect, that means that you may not be deprived of any award conditions—be they the prominent sorts of award conditions that we have been discussing in this place or those that apply to more specialised types of employment, like the special shift allowances that nurses get, for example, and I suppose the award conditions that agricultural workers get or that shop assistants in some areas get under current law—without a complete and exact replication of those benefits in your other conditions. That provision has been watered down in previous legislation by this government but it still persists, at least to some degree, in the current legislation. When the Keating government introduced enterprise bargaining—with my solid support, I might say—they did so with that particular clause featuring very prominently throughout the legislative system. A great deal of flexibility and productivity was secured in the work force as a result of that measure.</para>
<para>Now the government intends to move from a situation whereby flexibility was accompanied by fairness to a situation where fairness is removed from the system. It is Orwellian, it is Stalinist and it is equivalent to the sorts of dictatorships’ propaganda of the 20th century—you tell people the exact opposite of what it is that you intend to do. You talk about fairness when you intend to remove it. I guess the folk who got the first cut of that pulped brochure—at least as they sat down and wrote it—understood exactly what the government had in mind, and fairness had absolutely nothing to do with it.</para>
<para>We in the Australian Labor Party understand these things and what the government intends. It has nothing to do with the economy; it has nothing to do with productivity. The massive productivity growth which is incorporated and the substantial rises in real wages are entirely and exclusively a product of the enterprise bargaining arrangements put in place by the Keating government, of which there have now been four or five iterations and which of course are collective agreements. This was put in place by the Keating government. That and that alone is what has produced the substantial real increases in the wages of Australians over the last decade and a half. Nothing else has—nothing the government has done.</para>
<para>The government’s own industrial relations changes have been put in place to at least try and pare back from the less well-organised sections of the work force the benefits that were going to the better organised sections of the work force or the more skilled sections of the work force. The Keating government put in train the productivity that this country has enjoyed. This government has done nothing but detract from it. What was for the Keating government a process that permitted the Australian economy to modernise and grow has become for this government an opportunity to reintroduce into the Australian wages system the 19th century. The things that the government intends to deprive workers of and which it is going to remove from its legislation when it finally comes into this place include the removal of the independent umpire, the removal of the capacity, by and large, of most people in this country to get access to assistance from a trade union, and the removal of the no disadvantage test so people will be obliged to give up conditions without a compensating arrangement attached to it.</para>
<para>What have they created? They have created a master-servant relationship, which was a feature of industrial systems in the colonies in the 19th century but has not existed in this country since Federation. I will not take a lecture from the Prime Minister on the subject of modernising the wages system of this country when he has the most old-fashioned concept of it. His analysis of it, I and my colleagues believe, is firmly rooted in the view that the industrial relations system he inherited reflects the lock-up mentality of the 1960s and 1970s. He has erected a straw man to cover his attempt to reintroduce the 19th century. The consequences of this, particularly if the good economy created largely by the reforms of the Hawke and Keating governments starts to slow down—as all economies do, often for reasons external to the country—will be the massive impoverishment of a large number of Australian families.</para>
<para>The individual contract regime that the government wishes to put in place has been tried elsewhere. It was tried in New Zealand. In the 1990s, New Zealanders experienced the ‘working poor beneficiary’. Food banks were created to support people in full-time work, because they did not necessarily have the sorts of jobs that would sustain a bargaining position by which, in the conditions in which everything was weighted in the hands of the employer, they could not get for themselves what might be described by all of us here as a living wage. Should there be an economic downturn—and if this legislation is put in place and this government is not removed—we will experience the same phenomenon here, once this legislation is passed. The union movement will survive the attack on it, but many Australian families will not. Many of the people I am referring to are skilled or semiskilled and, in the outer suburbs of this country, they are supporting a mortgage of considerable dimensions. The main breadwinner has an income of about $50,000 a year—that is the average—and the spouse has an income of about $25,000. That is a total of $75,000—and that split sustains it. When the main breadwinner’s capacity to get overtime is gone, and when the capacity of the other contributor to get family-friendly hours is gone, family life will be simply unsustainable.</para>
<para>What is being mounted here—and it was not foreshadowed during the last election campaign—is the most massive attack ever on the Australian way of life by an Australian government. It will mean the destruction of the lives of ordinary Australians, about which the incredibly wealthy people on the Liberal-National front bench chortle and cheer in question time after question time. They will haunt the houses of average Australians with the propositions they are going to put through: no umpire, no protection, no underpinning, no-disadvantage test—nothing. There will be absolutely nothing but a master-servant relationship in which the power persists with the person who owns the business. That person will have no incentive to conduct any sort of discussion other than on the basis of what optimises his profit—not necessarily what produces the best in productivity but what optimises his profit. We are going to resist this in this parliament and put up a comprehensive alternative at the next election—and we will win.</para>

<para>—The deliberate campaign of dishonesty, misinformation, scaremongering and misrepresentation by the Labor Party and the ACTU—we have seen it since May, we have heard it in spade loads here today and we have seen it all week—must be seen for what it is: a political campaign. Those opposite are embarking on a political campaign. Their motive is to change the government, not to protect the wellbeing of Australian families. They could not care less about that objective. Their objective is self-serving; their objective is to change the government. It is a political campaign. ACTU Secretary Greg Combet let the cat of the bag in May when he said, ‘It is about changing the government.’ These reforms are seen by the Labor Party and the ACTU as a political opportunity to turn their fortunes around. Both the Labor Party and the ACTU are desperate in this regard because the only thing that has fallen faster over the last 20 years than the Labor primary vote is union membership. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline>
</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Those opposite only have their hearts in this because they see, wrongly, a cheap political opportunity to get back in the race off the back of their opposition to these fair and sensible policy reforms. They have not got their hearts in it because of any genuine disagreement with the policies being proposed, because those opposite know in their hearts that these changes are necessary if we are to protect and grow the quality of life of Australian families. They know that if we are to spread the benefits, such as the benefits of flexibility that exist in some parts of the economy because of past changes, across the economy, we need to build on past changes and remove more of the roadblocks and third party interference that are holding back much of the energy and productivity of a lot of workplaces across the country.</para>
<para>So it is a political campaign not motivated by any genuine concern. The only attacks have been dishonest misrepresentation of the material that we have put in front of the opposition. For weeks, if not months, they asked for details. They have now had them for a week—and what have we seen? We have seen only dishonest misrepresentation. We have seen them fly things up the flagpole here all week, only for those things to be exposed. We have seen them dishonestly misrepresent the AWA of a small operation in Queensland. We  have seen them dishonestly misrepresent public holidays. All they have done all week is make a series of dishonest misrepresentations of what is proposed. They do not have their hearts in it other than for political motivations. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline> As I was saying before I was rudely interrupted, it is a political campaign by our opponents opposite. Sharan Burrow, the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, gleefully started a doorstep interview this week with the statement: ‘Well, good morning, Comrades. This is a fight that the labour movement has been waiting for.’ For Sharan Burrow it is simply the basis of a membership drive for an organisation that now represents less than 17 per cent of employees in private enterprise. The Leader of the Opposition was saying on national radio yesterday, and again in the House today, they can run this thing all the way through to the next election. All these comments betray the real motives of the Labor Party and the ACTU, and so does their body language.</para>
<para>Look at what they have been doing all week. Look at the disinformation, the level of the rhetoric and the fulminating. The Leader of the Opposition was almost going to explode this week with the fulminating that he has gone on with. Then there is the feigned anger of the Leader of the Opposition. Here is a man trying to cover up a few deficiencies. There are also the overstatements. Think about what has happened all week. Think about their comments. They have overreached on every issue. They have exaggerated. They have gone too far. The credibility of their case has been undermined day by day as they have overreached.</para>
<para>It is betraying their desperation. They have an eye on the polls—don’t you worry about that. Do not listen to what the Leader of the Opposition just said about never commenting on polls. He might not comment on them too much, but by golly he is always looking at them. Their body language this week has been betraying their desperation. These actions, these approaches to the debate, are all unwitting symptoms of a mob that has no genuine interest in the likely effect of these reforms on the wellbeing of Australian families. It is all about reversing their own political fortunes. It is all about saving their own skin. It is all about looking after their own wellbeing, not the wellbeing of Australian families. It is a political campaign, pure and simple, by the Labor Party—an opportunistic grab for political advantage off the back of misinformation and scaremongering.</para>
<para>We have seen another extraordinary example of this blatant misinformation and hypocrisy in relation to the claims about the treatment of the 38-hour week in our workplace. This week we had the member for Throsby, Jenny George, and the President of the ACTU, both saying things to that effect. ‘What a joke.’ Sharan Burrow said. The Prime Minister has spent years saying he cares about work and family. ‘The 38 hour week,’ he says, ‘on the one hand, is protected. On the other hand, you can average it over a year.’ ‘What a joke,’ says Sharan Burrow. We heard similar sentiments from the member for Throsby, who is a former President of the ACTU.</para>
<para>A simple scanning of some publicly available agreements negotiated by various unions indicates that unions have regularly and for years agreed to the averaging of a 38-hour week over a year in exchange for other benefits. There are seven, eight or nine unions here—all members of the ACTU. Either Sharan Burrow and Ms George are grossly ignorant of a standard practice that they have been fully across or they have sought to deliberately mislead the Australian public as part of Labor’s disinformation campaign over the government’s workplace relations reforms. If Ms George and Ms Burrow truly believe that averaging over a year is an attack on work and family, why have they not publicly and strenuously sought to stop the unions, who they are ultimately responsible for, from negotiating this common practice? It is blatant hypocrisy and it is misinformation. The truth of the matter is that, in many cases, the averaging provision has helped save jobs, and job security is at the heart of creating strong and happy families.</para>
<para>The Leader of the Opposition waxed lyrical in an attempt to denigrate the motives and the determination of this government to protect the wellbeing of Australian families. The soft option is to rant and rave and to give up on real reform, but the Leader of the Opposition has a history of shirking the hard decisions. If you go back to when he was Minister for Employment, Education and Training, there are some classic quotes. ‘I lost a lot of ambition and I stopped straining. I thought there was less capacity to achieve in that portfolio than just about any I have had,’ said Mr Beazley. Mr Beazley as minister for employment gave up on the unemployed, and now he stands here and lectures us about taking hard decisions, about maintaining and protecting the living standards of Australian families.</para>
<para>This government has no intention of shirking major policy decisions. This is a big reform but a fair reform. It has been well thought through. It is overdue. If we do not make these reforms, we will be left behind. Other countries will run past us and outcompete us. Australian families will be left behind. These changes are necessary if we are going to continue to grow this economy. It is a strong economy that provides job security, higher wages and better conditions and it is a strong economy that provides for the wellbeing of Australian families. The only reason we are proposing these changes is to deliver on the workplace relations system that will give more flexibility, grow the economy and help Australian families. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—‘This reform has been well thought through,’ said the member for Goldstein, but they cannot even produce the legislation. What has been well thought through is the need for them to have a propaganda campaign, paid for by the taxpayer, to drive down the wages and conditions of Australian workers, to transfer wages straight into profits. This has nothing to do with economic growth. It has nothing to do with productivity. Indeed, it could in fact be negative because when you drive down the wages of average workers who spend all of their wage every week—on their mortgage, on food, on child care, on clothing and on education for their kids—you dampen down economic growth. Those people do not have the savings and the opportunities that some of the spivs opposite have had and have taken for granted throughout their whole lives.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We heard that this was well thought through. The opposition leader exposed that farce today in the parliament with two documents. The reform has been so well thought through that they printed tens of thousands of copies of a document but then had to pulp them because their pollsters and spin doctors, who they are paying millions of dollars—Liberal Party friends—advised them: ‘It’s probably not a good idea just to say “A simpler national workplace relations system for Australia”. We need to add the word “fairer”.’ Why did they need to get advice to add the word ‘fairer’? Because the concept of fairness is anathema to those opposite. The concept of equality, the concept of a fair go, is something that they oppose and just do not get. They hate workers, when it comes down to it. They hate average Australians. They think that the people they are elected here to represent—those people of privilege—are the only people who deserve representation in this parliament.</para>
<para>We saw it perhaps best here from the member for Gippsland. The member for Gippsland has for three days in a row got dorothy dixers in which he has spoken about agricultural awards, shop assistants and the average decent, hardworking Australians who keep this country going, in pejorative terms. He has actually had the hide to criticise payments in awards for personal contributions at the workplace level for rural workers who provide a horse for the benefit of themselves and their employer. That is seen by the minister as something that is hilarious. That has got a run for three days in a row, as it is so strange and odd that this would be included in awards!</para>

<para>—should be very conscious of the complex arrangements that come in our awards that we have to sign off on every month. Just as workers have in their awards transport entitlements, so do we, and ours are pretty generous. If the member for Gippsland drives his car from Sale in Victoria to Parliament House, he gets 522 times 63c—$328.86—each way. That is a total of  $328.86 for five or six hours work, not bad money in the kick—something that the minister knows a lot about when it comes to public money. But, when he gets here, the minister has to sign off the registry to prove that he was here. He then has to reconcile it. There are documents the thickness of a telephone book that we have to comply with in what is essentially the equivalent of our award. But there is one difference between our conditions and the conditions of the average worker: this man, who has more wealth than probably every shop assistant in Australia combined, begrudges elements in awards such as $5. He begrudges $5 going to an average worker, which exposes, really, what the government are about.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The member for Goldstein talks about how well the economy is going under this government. They speak about the flexibility that is there. Of course it is there, because the Hawke and Keating Labor governments made sure through their industrial relations reform—which was all about enterprise bargaining and making sure that productivity was a key to wage increases—that the economy they inherited would go well. But this government have it confused. They have confused non-unionism with anti-unionism. It is true that unionism in this country has fallen to about one in four in the work force. They have thought this through and thought, ‘That means everyone hates unions.’ Not true. Decent, hardworking Australians know that they want a safety net. They want an Industrial Relations Commission. They might not even know who are members of their union. We have all had workers turn up to our electorate offices and say, ‘I need assistance. I’ve copped a raw deal off the boss.’ The first thing you say to them is, ‘Have you gone to your union?’ They say, ‘I’m not really a member—but I would like to join.’ And you know what they do? They do just that—join. Part of the culture in this country is knowing that trade unions exist and will be there for those who need them. Part of the culture of the great Australian Labor Party that we will not walk away from is our connection with the trade union movement, something that we are proud of.</para>
<para>The government in its documents has really exposed what it is about. This is a government that would construct an industrial relations system in which ‘fairer’ just does not figure, in which ‘fairer’ is an afterthought. This is also a government which has been exposed by these documents. What has it taken out of the documents? It has taken out ‘your existing award conditions protected by law’.</para>
<para>Can you imagine the setting? In the minister’s office, the document comes through—glossy, paid for as part of the $100 million spend. The minister or one of his advisers gets it and reads: your existing award conditions protected by law. ‘We can’t really say that because we’re not doing it. We’d better take that out.’ Then they have a look and read: preserving key award conditions. ‘Well, we’re not really going to do that either. We’d better take that out.’ Then they have a look and see: terms and conditions in existing agreements will be protected. ‘We’re not going to do that either, so we’d better take that out.’</para>
<para>What this document exposes—not a piece of propaganda from the ACTU or the ALP, but a document from the government, paid for by the Australian taxpayer—is what this government is really about: ripping the guts out of fairness in the Australian system. Fairness characterises us as a nation. We use it throughout our language: ‘fair dinkum’, ‘fair go’. We can lose the Ashes and think, ‘That’s all right, because it was about time the Poms won.’ We have as part of our culture fairness before the law. The rights of trade unions are a core part of that. The fact is the government has just got this wrong. It knows it has got it wrong because its $100 million propaganda campaign has been exposed as being illegal. The AEC wrote to the minister today saying just that. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Out of the mouth of the member for Grayndler is the MPI condemned. Where was the member for Grayndler’s reference, throughout his entire diatribe, to investing in skilling the Australian work force? The Labor Party are simply using what has happened this week for political opportunism, and they have been told to do so by the union movement. They are running scared of the union movement and they must oppose. This is in total contrast to our position back in 1993. In their contributions, the member for Grayndler and the Leader of the Opposition referred to the former Prime Minister Paul Keating and what he did. I am glad they did that, because it stands in stark contrast. The actions of our party when we were in opposition stand in stark contrast to the actions of the ALP at the moment, now they are in opposition.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The reform process that is taking place at the moment in Australia is very much an evolutionary one. It started in 1993. We saw the second wave of reforms in 1996 and we are now seeing a third wave of reforms taking place in 2005. When Paul Keating introduced that first wave he was opposed by the union movement. But do you know who supported him? The opposition supported the moves, at that time, to make changes. Obviously we felt that he had not gone far enough—we would have liked him to have gone a bit further—but we still supported him. So the claims of the high and mighty on the other side that what we have today is because of their changes in 1993—that the fruits of those changes are what we are benefiting from—are pure hypocrisy.</para>
<para>Back in 1993 the former Prime Minister was very prophetic. He said of the industrial relations system in this country:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... let me describe the model of industrial relations we are working towards. It is a model which places ... emphasis on bargaining at the workplace level within a framework of minimum standards provided by arbitral tribunals. Over time the safety net would inevitably become simpler. We would have fewer awards, with fewer clauses ... We need to find a way of extending the coverage of agreements from being add-ons to awards ... to being full substitutes for awards.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The statement made by Paul Keating that ‘we need to find a way of extending the coverage of agreements from being add-ons to awards to being full substitutes for awards’ is precisely where we are today. What Paul Keating advocated back in 1993, at the beginning of the reform process, is exactly what is happening today. In this third stage of reforms we are seeking to make agreements full substitutes for the choking award based system. Do we receive any support from the ALP? No. Do we receive any support from the union movement? No, of course not. We are not surprised by the union movement’s opposition to this. They opposed the reforms then and they oppose them now. The difference is that they now have their comrades, those on the other side, who will do their bidding to avoid risking preselections and hard-earned financial support come the next election.</para>
<para>The MPI this afternoon has been confused with a censure motion. The member for Grayndler’s speech epitomised that fact. The argument today has been based on an attack on the government’s advertising campaign. I can only wonder what it is that the opposition is asking us to do. Is it asking us not to inform the Australian public of one of the major reform programs undertaken by this government? It is an advertising campaign—an information campaign—to inform the Australian public. By its very nature, when you have reform there is a lot of complexity to it. There is a lot to understand and comprehend. We did that with other reform programs over the last 9½ years. We did it with the GST. At the time, the Australian public got to understand exactly what we were doing. We are doing it again now.</para>

Those opposite do not like the Leader of the Opposition’s record being exposed in this chamber. We know that this MPI is a fraud. It is a fraud because it certainly exposes what the ALP in government failed to achieve. During the time that Mr Beazley was the minister for employment and education—basically he was the minister for jobs and skills, which is part of what this MPI is all about—we had one million unemployed, 329,000 long-term unemployed and teenage unemployment of 34.5 per cent.

This is a government that is more contemptuous of this parliament and what it represents than any government we have had in the time since Australia has been a nation. It is a disgrace. We understand that in times of national emergency there might be a need to recall the parliament early, but there is no excuse for cancelling scheduled sitting dates.

<para>—There is no greater symbol of the Howard government’s contempt for our heritage than its request for roadworks at Anzac Cove. In 2003, the Prime Minister promised to protect Anzac Cove. He promised to make Anzac Cove the first listing on the new National Heritage List. On 18 December 2003, the Prime Minister said:</para>

<quote>
<para class="block">It seems to me ... entirely appropriate that the Anzac site at Gallipoli should represent the first nomination for inclusion on the National Heritage List. And, although it’s not on Australian territory, anyone who has visited the place will know that once you go there you feel it as Australian as the piece of land on which your home is built.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Instead of protecting Anzac Cove, this government and this Prime Minister requested roadworks which have damaged the site forever. The Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee inquiry into matters relating to the Gallipoli Peninsula, which reported today, have confirmed this. The inquiry found:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... that significant sites of the ANZAC campaign ... have been lost forever. The coastal road has been widened beyond the extent necessary to ensure visitors’ safety; spoil has been deliberately dumped onto the beach below; there were no environmental measures put in place to minimise erosion from the construction ...</para>

<para class="block">How exactly is the trashing of this sacred site to all Australians acting appropriately and correctly? It is an extraordinary statement given the government, firstly, requested the road works and, then, failed to properly monitor the project. This complacency now threatens other elements of our Anzac heritage. Further roadwork upgrades are planned for Anzac Cove, but the government has already dismissed calls by the Senate inquiry for:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... remedial action before the onset of winter to stabilise and restore the vegetation at ANZAC Cove.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">To some extent the damage is done. What Australians saw for 90 years when they went to that site was that the integrity of the site remained largely the same as it was in 1915. When you went there you could get that sense of experience. Diggers who went back there certainly have said that that is the case, as have historians such as Les Carlyon, as have archaeologists and as have the RSL.</para>
<para>The government must ensure that it does not get worse. It must ensure that this remedial action is undertaken before the onset of winter to ameliorate the scarring caused by the roadworks and to minimise future erosion. Proper heritage management plans must be put in place in partnership with the government of Turkey. Clear guidelines must be put in place for the future management, recovery, reburial or storage of human remains at Gallipoli which were uncovered by these roadworks. The Howard government must end its complacency on this issue and it must learn from its mistakes. It must ensure that no further damage is done to one of our most sacred sites.</para>
<para>Mr Speaker, you may well recall that when I first raised this issue of the degradation of this site in the parliament the Prime Minister’s response was to say arrogantly that it is regrettable that the question was even asked. Thank goodness the opposition did raise it or it could have been even worse. But now is the time for complacency to end. It should take on board the Senate inquiry recommendations and ensure that no further damage is done. It should get serious about protecting Australia’s heritage.</para>

<para>—I rise to pay tribute to Francis Eugene Joseph Galbally. Frank died yesterday after a long illness. He would have been 83 today. Over the course of one’s life, you come across many people whom you respect and admire. There are few who achieved distinction in so many diverse fields as Frank Galbally. Francis was a brilliant advocate, an author, a great contributor to Australia’s public policy, a defender of democracy against dictatorship in Greece, a proud husband and father, a man of intellect, of compassion and a man of passion. And he made the world’s finest vodka martini.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Francis Galbally came from a family of Irish Catholic provenance. He considered becoming a priest; indeed, he attended the seminary at Werribee for three years before joining the Navy after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. On his return from the war, he studied law at the University of Melbourne and began his career as a solicitor. He never went to the bar, and always told me that he had made a very wise decision.</para>
<para>I will not say too much about his legal accomplishments because his legal colleagues are better able to do that. I will just say that the tributes to him are replete with references to his being the world’s most successful defence advocate—a man who took on causes that were unpopular and even dangerous. He was, as former Victorian Chief Justice John Phillips described him, ‘a very brave, lion-hearted man’. The fact is that the demands of the defence took their toll. He once told me that, despite his incredible run of successes, he did not want to do any more murder trials because taking the responsibility for somebody else’s life was overwhelming.</para>
<para>I first met Frank in 1975 and our relationship developed over the course of his work on the report on post-arrival programs and services. We then worked together on the Ethnic Television Review Panel and the Implementation Team for Multicultural Television and he was my chairman at the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs. Frank was a wise, generous and dear friend. He became involved with ethnic issues because, when Malcolm Fraser asked him what he wanted to do when we won government in 1975, Frank said he was concerned about the situation of Australia’s ethnic communities.</para>
<para>Malcolm Fraser, sharing these concerns, made him Chairman of the Committee on Post-Arrival Programs and Services. The resulting report, which had all its recommendations accepted and funded, was a watershed in multicultural philosophy and practice. Its fundamental principles were: equal opportunity and equality of access to general services, the provision of special services where these are needed, respect for cultural diversity, consultation, self-help and self-reliance.</para>
<para>The Galbally report, as it became known, institutionalised the commitment to multiculturalism: the right of all Australians to express and share their cultural heritages, the right to equality of treatment and the removal of discriminatory barriers—rights which were always accompanied, in Frank’s mind, by the obligation to make a fundamental commitment to Australia. The Fraser government’s implementation of these principles would, in itself, have earned Frank a place in Australia’s history, but he went on to establish multicultural television, which had stalled, and to oversee the translation of the vision of a multicultural television service into reality. That reality is with us today, and for the service to have survived despite repeated onslaughts from both left and right is a tribute to how well Frank built it.</para>
<para>I believe that the work of Frank Galbally contributed significantly to the fact that what emerged from the mass immigration of the last half century was an admirable, decent, harmonious multicultural Australia—a society based on the appreciation of cultural diversity and on tolerance and mutual respect. Frank Galbally was a distinguished Australian who made a very distinguished contribution. He was a man of vision who conceived things that people had not thought of before and he had the capacity and toughness to translate them into reality. He will be sorely missed, and the thoughts of many people will be with his wife, Bernadette, and his many children, Michael, David, Francis, Simon, Paul, Bernard, Elsa and Joe.</para>

<para>—When the Australian people pay their taxes they expect the money to be spent on services for the Australian people. Nobody likes paying tax, but when they do they at least know it is going to a good cause. But we now have a government which is wasteful and slothful with taxpayers’ money. This is the highest taxing Australian government in history—a government which is spending $100 million, not of its money but of taxpayers’ money, on advocating a policy which has not yet even been introduced into this parliament. It is a government that is buying advertisements on prime time television which appear every five minutes at $90,000 a pop. It is a complete waste of taxpayers’ money that this government should be ashamed of.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Today we heard in the House the revelation that the government had produced 60,000 pamphlets on the industrial relations changes only to have them pulped because they were not good enough. This is a government which claims to be a good economic manager but is prepared to see taxpayers’ money wasted and thrown around like confetti at a wedding. And that is not all. There has been other wasteful spending from the government in the last 12 months. We have seen $100 million spent so far on private recruitment agencies. I do not deny that some use of private recruitment agencies is appropriate, but spending $100 million on private agencies for government recruitment shows that this government has an extreme ideological approach to these matters. I would contend that this sort of recruitment could be done much more efficiently by members of the Australian Public Service. This government has an ideological obsession with outsourcing.</para>
<para>Last year an estimated $10 million was spent on media monitoring by this government—$10 million to watch themselves on television and read about themselves in newspapers. What an outrageous waste of money which would not pass the reasonableness test of the average Australian taxpayer. Another $80,000 was spent on massages for selected public servants. I do not deny that those public servants work very hard, but I think the average taxpayer would say that $80,000 on massages for selected public servants is not a good use of taxpayers’ money—and if it is good enough for some public servants then it is good enough for all.</para>
<para>The arrogance goes further. A few months ago I put a question on notice to the Minister for Human Services asking him if he had sought legal advice about his powers in relation to the Minister for Family and Community Services. I asked him if he had paid, at taxpayer expense, for legal advice on whether he was more powerful than the Minister for Family and Community Services. For good measure I asked the Minister for Family and Community Services whether she had sought legal advice about the Minister for Human Services. To her credit, the Minister for Family and Community Services answered promptly and said no. The Minister for Human Services took months to respond. Last week I received an answer or, rather, a non-answer: ‘My department seeks legal advice on a range of matters from time to time.’ That was his answer. He refused to indicate how much he spent on legal advice about how much power he has in relation to a so-called colleague.</para>
<para>It is an arrogant contempt of the processes of this parliament when a minister says, ‘I refuse to answer a question from an elected member of parliament.’ I have written again to the Minister for Human Services and asked the same question under the Freedom of Information Act, and I expect to receive an answer. Then we will know how much money he spent finding out how powerful he is in relation to the Minister for Family and Community Services.</para>
<para>We see an arrogant contempt for the forms of this House and an arrogant contempt in the use of taxpayers’ hard-earned money—taxpayers who work long hours going about their business and paying their tax. Nobody likes paying tax, but they do it because they know that community services will benefit. But taxpayers can receive no comfort from the way this government spends its money because it spends it on such things as advertisements and pulped pamphlets.</para>

<para>—We have been talking a lot recently about moving people from welfare to work. I want to draw your attention to a couple of constituents of mine who, in their time of greatest need, have been let down by the government. Dr Peter Todd from Newtown is a psychologist in private practice. In August he suffered a heart attack and needed a triple bypass. There were many complications from the surgery. He is now in a wheelchair, and his doctors have told him it will take three to six months to recover. He was in his own practice and had no income protection or paid sick leave, so on 6 September he lodged a claim for sickness benefit. He had $6,000 in a bank account to pay the costs of re-establishing himself in private practice when he recovered. Centrelink, of course, refused to pay him sickness benefit until he ran down his money. The rules were applied rigidly to his case and no discretion was exercised.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Dr Todd has been a valuable member of his community for over 40 years, working with disadvantaged and marginalised people, particularly with HIV-AIDS patients at the Albion Street clinic, and yet, at the only time in decades that he has needed any help or support, he has been turned away. He felt as if Centrelink had pulled the rug out from under him. He told my office:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">It is making it very hard for me to return to private practice. I will have a tax debt unpaid with no option to pay it and no money to re-establish my practice.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The stress of the ordeal has greatly affected his health, and he has felt in his time of need that he was treated harshly and unsympathetically by the system.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Another constituent of mine—let us call him Frank—from Waterloo was addicted to heroin and methadone for decades and received DSP for 13 years. He has turned his life around, and in 2003 he stopped using drugs and became a bike courier. In May he became ill due to a nasty ear infection and needed income support for six weeks. He made his claim, and it was eventually accepted by Centrelink, but he did not receive a cent until the day before he returned to work. He was treated with such suspicion that he was forced, over and over again, to lodge numerous documents. Of course, it was extremely stressful for him not to be in receipt of any income during his time of illness. He ended up behind in his rent and had to borrow money for food. Someone who is marginally employed in this way and has a history of illness is very close at any time to becoming homeless or suffering ongoing health effects, and the treatment that Centrelink gave to this man was, I believe, unnecessarily sceptical and unnecessarily harsh.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Both of these hardworking Australians, when they needed short-term support through their illnesses, were offered no empathy, no understanding and no support, only a very suspicious attitude and an obsession with form filling, paperwork and reviews. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I am concerned that Australia might be about to miss an important opportunity to move its television services to an all-digital environment. Currently, digital programs and analog programs are simulcast across Australia. The government had indicated that by 2008 the analog network would be switched off. There now seems to be a move to defer that to 2012. I am opposed to that. If we are going to be a modern, progressive country, we need to move to the all-digital environment now. I understand that there has not been a great take-up of digital technology in the community, but the way out of that is that set-top boxes now only cost about $60. It may well be in the government’s interest and in the networks’ interest to provide all remaining receivers who do not have a digital service with a set-top box so that the analog system can be switched off on time in 2008. The benefit of doing that, of course, is that it removes this wasteful dual transmission service and frees up the spectrum that is currently being used by the analog service. It also then allows the networks to put the money saved from running two services in parallel right across Australia, using hundreds of transmitters, into further Australian production.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">While I am talking about Australian production, I am angry with the ABC. I now find out that they produce only 20 hours of first-run drama a year. That is disgraceful, and that has to be fixed. I also now find out that they are not subject to the same Australian content rules as the commercial networks. How could that be? When we set up the ABC charter, did we just expect the ABC to do the right thing by Australians? That was probably the case, but I think the government should now move to insert in the ABC’s charter a requirement that they match the same Australian content rules as those that apply to the commercial stations. I think that is fair. In fact, many of us would expect that they do better than the commercial stations. It is incumbent on the ABC board to listen to what I am saying and to listen to the expectation of all Australians so that our ABC can in fact be our ABC.</para>

<para>—There are many aspects of the government’s radical industrial relations plan which I find repugnant and un-Australian. I want to refer to just one of those now. It is the example given in the government’s own publication and propaganda paid for by taxpayers about Billy, the unemployed person whose is offered a job ‘contingent on him accepting an AWA’. Note that: contingent on him accepting an AWA—that is, he takes the job only if he accepts the boss’s terms of an AWA individual contract that, presumably, as an unemployed person he is supposed to be able to bargain on some equal footing. No Australian believes that. It is interesting that for years the government have said that people would not be offered a job on a take it or leave it basis with AWAs. Now, not only do they admit it; they have put it in their taxpayer funded propaganda. The propaganda goes on to say this:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The AWA Billy is offered explicitly removes award conditions for public holidays, rest breaks, bonuses, annual leave loadings, allowances, penalty rates and shift/overtime loadings.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">That means that Billy is not entitled to any of those public holidays—none of them. He can work on Anzac Day and on Christmas Day and get the same hourly rate as if he was working on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday from nine to five. He has no right to annual leave loadings and he has no right to shift loadings. So he can work the midnight shift and not get one cent more. This is what the government proposes to do to Billy—to take advantage of the most vulnerable, to kick the most vulnerable people when they are down.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">One of the things that struck me when I first heard this was my response not as a politician or as someone who was committed to the labour movement and the rights of working Australians but as a parent. What this government is proposing to do is to say to Billy’s mum and dad: ‘You will be the first generation since white settlement in Australia to bequeath to your children worse conditions than you had when you were their age. You will bequeath to your children fewer rights in the workplace than you enjoyed when you commenced work 20 or 30 years ago.’ That is in fact what Billy’s parents are being asked to sign up to by this government.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">That was the response I had, not as a politician, not as a committed Labor person, not as someone concerned for working Australians, but as a father of four children. I am not prepared in any of those capacities to stand by and see this happen. It is clear from the reaction already from the public, some of which we know from our electorates and some of which we know from the published opinion polls, that Australians understand that too. It is fundamentally wrong; it is un-Australian. At a time when we talk about mateship and camaraderie, and at Anzac Day services where we talk about looking after the less well off in our society, to say to the most vulnerable people in our community, ‘You should be placed on conditions that are not only worse than every other worker has at that time but worse than the conditions that your parents had when they were at work,’ is something parents will not tolerate. I look forward to the debate on this when the parliament resumes in a couple of weeks time. But more than that: I look forward to the debate on it in the community in the next two years.</para>

<para>—I want to take this opportunity to praise the work of two school communities within Bass Coast Shire within the electorate of Flinders. In particular, on 21 November the rebuilt and brand new buildings at Cowes Primary School will be opened. This follows a tragic fire some time ago, and the school community has responded magnificently. Led by the principal, Ms Sue Becker, the school community, the staff, the council, the parents, the friends, the families and, in particular, the students have worked not only to recover that which was lost but to create a better, stronger school than that which was there before. It is tremendous example of taking adversity and turning it into the opportunity to create something new.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">At the Commonwealth level we will have made a contribution of $600,000 to the reconstruction and re-establishment of buildings. I am delighted that we were able to do that. I thank the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, who within 24 hours of the fire had made a public commitment to help in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the school. It was a tremendous outcome and a great cooperative project between the school community and the Commonwealth. I also acknowledge the important work of the state. I congratulate all those involved in the reconstruction, redevelopment and rehabilitation of Cowes Primary. I think that 21 November should be a day of celebration.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The second thing I want to do is pay tribute to the school community of Bass Valley Primary. This is a school which serves small towns such as Coronet Bay, Corinella, Pioneer Bay, Grantville, Kernot, Glen Alvie and Glen Forbes—all of these small towns. Bass Valley Primary is a tremendous little school. I am delighted to be able to inform the House and the broader community in that area that we will have $50,000 for upgrading playgrounds, play equipment and the general facilities for schoolchildren under the Investing in Our Schools program. I know that the principal, Dale Hendrick, does a tremendous job, as do his staff and the school community who put together the application. They have worked incredibly hard. The work that they do is outstanding and I congratulate them on their achievements. I wish to pass on my thanks to all of them and say that it is a tremendous outcome which is fully deserved for a great school which does a great job.</para>

<para>—I rise today to speak on behalf of all family carers who are caring for their loved ones in my electorate of Richmond and throughout Australia. There are 2.5 million carers in Australia who look after family members or friends—people with disabilities, mental illness or chronic conditions, or the frail and aged. They look after them day in and day out, 365 days a year.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The contribution that carers make is not only to the people that they care for but also to the community and the economy more broadly. It is estimated that carers save the Australian economy approximately $20 billion annually through unpaid work, yet their work unfortunately goes largely unrecognised. Family carers are always telling me that they are angry, tired and frustrated by the appalling lack of support that they receive from the federal government.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Last month I joined hundreds of carers and their families who had travelled to Canberra from every corner of Australia to beg the Howard government to ‘Walk a mile in my shoes’. To symbolise the lonely and exhausting journey of family carers, we placed hundreds of pairs of old, worn-out shoes on the lawns of Parliament House. Many of these I brought on behalf of carers living in my electorate of Richmond. Each pair of shoes was tagged with an individual, personal message written from a family carer to the Howard government, asking to give them more support.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Take a carer like Cindy Petersons from Bangalow, who cares for her daughter Alexandra. Alexandra is 13 years old and has cerebral palsy. Alexandra’s mum, Cindy, wants the Howard government to understand what it is like to care for someone every hour of the day, year after year, without support or respite. Another carer is Marie Dudgeon, also from Bangalow, who cares for her son Glen. Eight years ago Glen was in a car accident that left him brain damaged, blind and physically disabled. Glen’s care is indeed 24/7, 365 days a year, and takes a huge physical and emotional toll on Marie and her family. Marie wants the federal government to recognise her never-ending care for Glen and hear her cry for more help and support.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There are also carers like Geoff Jones and Steve Pollitt from Tweed Heads, who are members of the Tweed Heads Mental Health Carers Network. The network is a voluntary group coordinated by the tireless June Saville. It provides much needed support for families who care for loved ones with mental health issues and it advocates improving the lives of carers. The Tweed Heads Mental Health Carers Network has asked me to take their message to the Howard government, so I am calling on this government to stop making the lives of carers harder and to start listening to them. We need to give them greater recognition for the vital work that they do. We need to provide greater financial support that recognises the cost of caring and we need to provide greater support in the workplace so that carers can pursue their own careers and livelihoods. After nine long years, this government has done little to ease the burden on carers. Today I am calling on members of the Howard government to walk a mile in the shoes of the millions of carers around Australia who sacrifice everything to look after their family day in and day out. It is time that the government started taking their needs seriously and provided enough support for the carers.</para>

<para>—This morning I would like to congratulate all those people involved in the Advancing Burleigh project, which was launched last year by me and the councillor for the area, Councillor Greg Betts. The Advancing Burleigh project resulted from a combination of the Gold Coast City Council’s identification of Burleigh as one of the 10 centres of the Pacific Innovation Corridor and, more recently, the council’s Centre Improvement Program.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Through the Regional Partnerships program, we were able to provide some Commonwealth funding for the Advancing Burleigh project. The Gold Coast City also contributed to the project. The Burleigh Chamber of Commerce also contributed because the Burleigh business community understood and identified how important it was to get this project off the ground. We needed to be able to market Burleigh, put Burleigh on the map and give those small businesses the opportunity of growing their businesses, growing the economic demands of the area and providing jobs for the area. Through the Regional Partnerships program, that is what we are trying to achieve.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Burleigh project aimed to progress the Burleigh region, as I said, by marketing and building on the economic growth of the area, by creating new jobs and by revitalising the town centre. I have often said that Burleigh is the secret treasure of the Gold Coast. It is a bit of a sleepy village, but it is a very popular holiday destination. There are a lot of small businesses and, by giving them a kick-start with this marketing project, we were able to put them on the map, so to speak.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The project has been extremely successful. It has been run over the last 12 months. We were able to engage consultant Jo Eady to push the project along. It is through her determination to see this succeed that we have got to where we are today. Jon Ingall, who is the president of the Burleigh Chamber of Commerce, certainly got on board, and Michael Hart, who is the vice-president, drove the Burleigh Business Week by bringing all those businesses together. We had a mini expo during the week, and it culminated in a night of awards. We had eight awards during that night. We had around 80 businesses represented at that dinner and were able to recognise the expertise of a lot of the businesses in Burleigh.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We also launched advanceburleigh.com. This is a web site we have developed to put Burleigh on the map both nationally and internationally. Anyone visiting the area will be able to access advanceburleigh.com, see what is available there and hook into what I believe is a beautiful part of Gold Coast City. On behalf of all the people involved, I think we have come a long way in 12 months. We have advanceburleigh.com, we have brought in the Burleigh Business Awards, we have had the Burleigh Business Week and we have re-energised the Burleigh Chamber of Commerce. Congratulations to all of those involved.</para>

<para>—A couple of wire service things jumped up at me today. Seeing as today is World Sight Day, it was great to see that the number of blind people worldwide has started to dwindle for the first time ever. The numbers have dropped from 45 million in the year 2000 to 38 million, despite the huge growth in the world population. But we are still talking about huge numbers.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The other wire service announcement that related to this is that at the end of last month in my state of Tasmania 7,040 Tasmanians were waiting for elective surgery at public hospitals. It really worries me that we have six state and two territory Labor governments that seem to have a fixation with infrastructure—toll roads, buildings, bridges and the like. There seems to be, despite the huge amount of money they are getting from the GST revenue, little being spent on social infrastructure.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">At the Royal Hobart Hospital, the state’s main teaching hospital, the waiting list grew from 3,334 at the end of June to 3,532 at the end of September. At the end of September 10,856 people were waiting for dental treatment in Tasmania. I think this is absolutely appalling.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Professor Taylor, who spoke about the World Health Organisation report into blindness, estimated that there were 50,000 Australians suffering from blindness and half a million Australians with visual impairment. Up to three-quarters of their eye problems were caused by conditions which were either preventable or treatable. That is worth repeating: three-quarters of the eye impairments suffered by these Australians are caused by conditions that are either preventable or treatable. He said that 40,000 Australians were on public hospital waiting lists for cataract surgery, some having to suffer for years before being operated on. I find it absolutely appalling that most of the 40,000 Australians on the waiting lists are being denied basic human rights. As Professor Taylor said, the community cannot afford to have people waiting too long for cataract surgery:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">The cost ... of the increased falls and fractures and demand on community service is enormous and cataract surgery is so cost effective.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I would challenge all the state and territory Labor governments to really have a look at this issue today, World Sight Day. I think they are denying their citizens right across Australia basic human rights, and that needs to be rectified straightaway.</para>

<para>—I rise in the chamber this morning to praise the contribution by this nation to the South Asia earthquake relief funds. We all know that there was recently a very large earthquake affecting areas of Pakistan, India and Afghanistan. It is to our credit as a nation that we were one of the first countries to make a very substantial contribution.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Honourable members would be aware of the important role that Pakistan plays in the war against terror and also of its incredibly important geographical position, bordered as it is by Afghanistan, Iran, India and China, and I think there is only a 15-kilometre corridor between Pakistan and Tajikistan. So it is vital that we recognise the importance of Pakistan as an ally. President Musharraf was here earlier this year and that was a very important visit. It is vital that we continue to recognise the very difficult and important role that Pakistan is playing.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">More important than recognising the vital role of Pakistan in the war against terror is the need for us as a wealthy nation to continue to provide humanitarian assistance to the tens of thousands of people who have been left homeless and the tens of thousands of people who have been injured. I am disturbed to hear that at least some 30,000 people have been killed. Many families have lost children; many children have lost parents. The increase in our contribution so far to $10 million is a very important step forward.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I want to commend the Minister for Foreign Affairs for looking very closely at this important challenge confronting South Asia. It is vital that countries from around the world continue to provide assistance and that we continue to provide additional assistance if required. Australian assistance is often well targeted and given very early. At times, countries give assistance of a nature that might not necessarily be needed, but Australian assistance is always well targeted. We are on the spot early. The increase in our assistance by a further $4.5 million, bringing it to $10 million, is really important. I hope that we continue to be generous and that we give more assistance if we find, on assessment, that more is required.</para>

<para>—The Prime Minister gave a very unsatisfactory response to a question I asked him during question time on Tuesday about his extreme industrial relations agenda. Inter alia, the Prime Minister refuses to guarantee that no employee will be worse off under his proposed extreme industrial relations agenda. I want to pay tribute to my senior researcher and media adviser, Adrian Leopardi, who is a very alert electorate officer for picking up what the Prime Minister said to Kerry O’Brien on Monday evening on <inline font-style="italic">The 7.30 Report</inline>. In part of the interview, Mr Howard said:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">We’ve had an ongoing debate in this country about a skills shortage. Why don’t a lot of young people go into apprenticeships? The reason is that they can get highly paid unskilled jobs as soon as they leave school.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Prime Minister’s own words are clear. In his view there are a lot of young people who are unskilled and who are being highly paid. What better proof than the Prime Minister’s own words that the most vulnerable members of the work force will be worse off under the Prime Minister’s extreme industrial relations agenda? What are these highly paid, unskilled jobs that the Prime Minister is referring to? It is obvious from his own words that people are going to be worse off when this legislation is passed by the Senate, as it surely will be. The Prime Minister has consistently dodged this issue and not told the truth to the people of Australia. Workers will be worse off.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In summary, these changes will hurt employees because they will allow employers to put workers onto individual contracts that cut take-home pay and reduce employment conditions to only five minimum standards. Workers who refuse to sign may be sacked without remedy. The changes will put downward pressure on the minimum wage. They will abolish protection from unfair dismissal for almost four million workers employed in companies with fewer than 100 staff.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Many people are contacting my office daily about the government’s proposed agenda. It was disgraceful to see yesterday in all the national papers the four-page advertisements about the industrial relations changes, advertisements costing millions of dollars of taxpayers’ money. The government is stripping employees of their rights, which will only hurt local families. That is why, while I am in this parliament, I will continue to fight against these extreme measures about to be visited on the decent, hardworking families of Australia.</para>

<para>—Today I raise two issues of particular concern to the Dunkley community. The first relates to the Banksia Centre, an outstanding and nationally recognised provider of respite care services operated under the auspices of the Brotherhood of St Lawrence. For some time now there has been particular community anxiety and concern about the future of that service, as its current location appears to be earmarked for sale by the Brotherhood of St Lawrence.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">In recognition of the outstanding work of the Banksia Centre and its staff, and in support of its carers and of the people who greatly believe in the work of the team at Banksia, the Howard government committed a timely and generous amount of $400,000 to support the relocation and redevelopment of the Banksia service. Some 18 months after I was assured that it would be just weeks before a firm and clear proposal was approved by the Brotherhood of St Lawrence for the relocation and redevelopment of the Banksia Centre, there is still no plan. There is no plan to accommodate this outstanding service, despite the grant being awarded, despite the public assurances, despite the great support of carers and staff.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There is now great alarm in the community. There is still no firm plan to implement the Brotherhood’s undertakings. I call on the Brotherhood of St Lawrence to implement those undertakings and give effect to those assurances, because the carers of people with dementia rely on the Banksia Centre and its respite care programs, both in-facility and host-home, and its other support services. The many families who would love to be able to make use of those services are looking for concrete, firm and urgent action by the Brotherhood to put in place real plans to make sure that the service’s future is secure and that its facilities are expanded and redeveloped, as has been the goal supported by the Howard government’s funding grant.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">A second issue I raise in the time available to me relates to the very sad, dark and probably the most evil case of electoral misrepresentation I can recall—and that is the Bracks government’s ‘no tolls’ commitment to the people of my community in the east and south-east of Melbourne. Now that we have learnt that the project is not going ahead without tolls, the Howard government’s $540 million commitment will not be taken up, because the agreement signed by the Victorian government is not being implemented by the Victorian government.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The project is going ahead as a tollway. It will add considerable traffic volumes to an already congested intersection in the city that I represent. The Frankston freeway ends and crosses Cranbourne Road. It is one of the state’s busiest intersections right now and it will be made more so with the completion of EastLink. Traffic volumes are expected to rise by 23 per cent, or three times the normal projected growth. We need some support to alleviate the consequences of that impact on our local community, and an opportunity to get behind the regional effort to see the Frankston bypass and the Rutherford Road on-ramp put on the radar screen. I urge government at the state, local and federal levels to get behind those projects. (<inline font-style="italic">Time expired</inline>)  </para>

<para>—The government has conceded that the <inline ref="R2440">Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2005</inline> is aimed at correcting an anomaly resulting from the Australia-America free trade agreement. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing described the bill as correcting ‘an unintended drafting error’. However, this is an error that has added considerable compliance costs and undue delay in applications to have products approved. In the same contribution, the parliamentary secretary commented:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">The amendments seek to rectify an unintended consequence of previous amendments which came into force from 1 January 2005 to introduce into the marketing approval process certification requirements in relation to patents.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The purpose of the bill is to restrict current patent certification requirements under section 26B(1) of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 for registering or listing therapeutic goods in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, ARTG.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The amendments are a response to major concerns raised by representatives from the complementary medicine and over-the-counter medicine sectors and the Australian biotechnology field that current requirements are too cumbersome, leading to unnecessary compliance costs. Thus the bill amends the act so that patent certification will be required only of those applicants who are required to submit safety or efficacy data when making their applications or, alternatively, who when making their application rely on data previously submitted to the TGA by another person or organisation in relation to an approved product. All other applicants may provide a notice to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing that a section 26B(1) certificate is not required.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The amendments will remove the unnecessary requirement and burden imposed on applicants with products for which the patent certification requirement under the act is not relevant. The practical implication is that it will exempt the complementary and over-the-counter medicines industry from Australia-US Free Trade Agreement requirements which impose an obligation that products proposed to be listed on the register do not infringe existing patents, an obligation which generally involves conducting expensive, time-consuming global patent searches and research.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The background to this is that all therapeutic goods sold in Australia must be included on the ARTG. Therapeutic goods on the ARTG are regulated on a risk management approach. Higher risk therapeutic goods—that is, registered medicines—are subject to a high level of scrutiny, and the TGA must determine their quality, safety and efficacy. Lower risk therapeutic goods are ‘listed’. In that case, the TGA must determine their quality and safety but not their efficacy—that is, the TGA does not evaluate listed medicines prior to supply to determine whether they are effective.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In Australia, over 80 per cent of over-the-counter medicines do not require manufacturers to submit safety or efficacy data to the FTA. Therefore, they should not be required to obey strict patent certification requirements, as this act would have required. The bill will effectively alter the way these products are brought into the marketplace in this country by restricting patent certification requirements for products that do not require manufacturers to submit safety or efficacy data in their application.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The FTA draft encompassed a broader group of products in Australia than in the United States; thus, the current patent certification requirements are more onerous and cumbersome than they should be and more onerous and cumbersome than those of their competitors in the United States. In the US, complementary and over-the-counter medicines are treated as dietary supplements. Here they are treated as pharmaceuticals. Therefore, when the FTA was drafted and agreed to, it captured a far broader group of products in Australia than was captured in the United States. This puts Australia at a significant disadvantage in the light of the FTA provisions.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In the FTA, article 17.10(4) is directed at marketing approval processes for pharmaceutical products that ‘rely on evidence or information concerning the safety or efficacy of a product that was previously approved’. Most complementary and over-the-counter medicines are known as ‘listed goods’ as opposed to ‘registered goods’. However, reliance upon safety and efficacy data lodged by another party with the TGA is not required for listed goods. The bill aims to rectify this anomaly, because in the United States complementary and OTC medicines manufacturers do not have to comply with patent certification requirements in the marketing approval process. The amendments in this bill will also exempt the same industry players in this country from compliance.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The patent certification requirements in the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 went beyond the original intent of the FTA. This has been proven by the complementary and over-the-counter medicines industry inadvertently being caught in the stringent requirements thus imposed. The fact is that this oversight should not have occurred in the first place. The government was in such a rush to get the FTA and its ancillary documents through that it did not give much thought to the different regulatory regimes in the two countries or the unnecessary burden on the complementary health care industry here. Whilst we welcome the bill, we also say that the government should have acted immediately. Why did it take constant lobbying by the complementary and over-the-counter medicines sectors and the Australian biotech industry to pressure the government for change?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Complementary Healthcare Council of Australia and the vitamins makers Blackmores have strongly lobbied the government since the FTA came into force on 1 January. They repeatedly stressed to the government the unnecessary and unreasonable costs of patent certification requirements. Figures of up to $80 million in compliance costs have been quoted. Each application, as I understand it, in research, in exploration and in investigation, costs a minimum of $5,000, which they were not obliged to meet previously and which was originally intended for mainstream drug companies.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Also highlighted to the government in this lobbying exercise was the additional burden on consumers, possibly a five to eight per cent increase in costs to consumers. Add to this the undue delay for these industry groups—and thereby the consumers, the users, the people needing it—in seeking to have their products listed on the register. The government should consider carefully the legislative purpose and intention of its instruments before rushing them through and then trying retrospectively to correct a situation which has hurt companies, hurt employees and hurt Australian consumers.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Complementary Healthcare Council of Australia said that the patent law changes to the Therapeutic Goods Act had gone far beyond the original intent of the FTA and that complementary medicines have been caught up in onerous new requirements. The FTA and subsequent amendments to the Therapeutic Goods Act put the Australian industry in a singularly unfair position compared to United States manufacturers and industry. Marcus Blackmore from Blackmores has stated: ‘We believe there is adequate evidence that the American dietary supplement industry does not have to comply, and that puts us at a significant disadvantage.’</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The change that we are putting through the parliament today does represent a victory for the complementary health care industry, a victory for commonsense, a victory for analysis of legislation and a victory in a situation where this legislation should not have been rushed through in the first place. There can be an issue of concern, still, that potential exists for the United States to challenge legislation if they believe the amendments breach the FTA. They can do this under chapter 21 provisions.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The purpose of the act is to ensure quality, safety and efficacy of therapeutic goods. That is the fundamental requirement of this act. The parliamentary secretary has said in his second reading speech:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">While the amendment simplifies the administrative burden on industry, it in no way changes or diminishes industry’s responsibility in relation to supplying medicines that fully meet all the existing safety, quality and efficacy requirements as set out in the Therapeutic Goods Act.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">That is quite clear. Of course it in no way reduces the requirements, the oversight, the mandatory stipulations on industry. The question is whether for the past year, or most of it, this industry should have been essentially put at a disadvantage to US competitors and whether consumers should have had to bear this cost. It should never have occurred.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">After consultation with key industry bodies—such as Medicines Australia and the Complementary Healthcare Council—affected by the FTA and the subsequent amendments to the act, these bodies are of the view that the bill corrects an oversight by the government. It removes burdens on their industry unnecessarily imposed in the first place. The current provisions are having a major impact on their industry, with many losing money, with higher costs for single applications and with undue delay in having products on the register. Throughout the field, they also totally agree that the original bill in response to the FTA, earlier this year, should not have been enacted in that fashion. It was an error made by the government which must be fixed. I join the government in recommending this bill for approval.</para>

<para>—The purpose of the <inline ref="R2440">Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2005</inline> is to restrict the patent certification requirements under subsection 26B(1) of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. The amendments contained in this bill do not change any aspect of existing health, safety or quality controls for therapeutic goods under the act; they simply address the unintended breadth of an amendment relating to patents that came into force on 1 January this year. The Howard government acknowledges and supports the rights of consumers to make informed choices on matters of health. It also believes that people are entitled to expect that medicines available in Australia are both of high quality and safe when used appropriately.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Whatever form medication takes, whether it be prescription drugs, over-the-counter remedies such as analgesics or cough mixture, or complementary medicines such as vitamins or homeopathy products, we want to be confident of the safety and quality of that medication. However, in our enthusiasm for ensuring safety and quality, we must be careful not to impose unnecessary bureaucracy or restrictions on manufacturers and suppliers of such goods. We need care and we need balance, because sometimes perfectly good legislation can, in practice, have unintended consequences, as is the case here.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In Australia, all therapeutic goods must be entered in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, the ARTG, before they can be supplied in or exported from Australia. The ARTG is the responsibility of the Therapeutic Goods Administration in the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing. To understand the meaning of this bill, we need to have a basic understanding of how therapeutic goods are assessed and either registered or listed in the ARTG. Within the registration process, there is a risk based system where the level of evaluation and regulatory control of a particular medicine is based on the relative risk of that product and on the seriousness of the condition for which it is intended to be used.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Medicines assessed as having a higher level of risk must be registered, as opposed to listed, in the ARTG. The degree of assessment and regulation these registered medicines undergo is rigorous and detailed, with sponsors required to provide comprehensive safety, quality and efficacy data. For example, prescription drugs are classed as high-risk registered medicines. They must be assessed and registered as such. However, while over-the-counter medicines such as analgesics and cough remedies must still be registered, they are evaluated under a low-risk classification.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Down the scale from the registered medicines under the act are listed medicines, which are usually considered to be relatively benign. The majority of the listed medicines are self-selected by consumers and used for self-treatment. Examples include vitamin and mineral supplements and products such as sunscreens. Listed medicines are assessed by the TGA for quality and safety but not efficacy. This does not mean that the products do not work; it simply means that the TGA has not evaluated them individually to see if they work. However, under the act, sponsors must hold information to substantiate all of their products’ claims and must make such evidence available to the TGA upon request. Sunscreens, for example, can be a listed product, but they must also have complied with testing under the Australian standard for sunscreens, and the company must be able to produce evidence of doing so.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This bill does not change any of the safeguards or quality controls currently contained in the act. It simply reduces the unintended scope of the patent amendments which came into force at the beginning of the year. The purpose of the earlier amendment was to prevent manufacturers of a generic version of a patented product from entering the market before the expiry of the patent covering that product. To this end, all applicants seeking to register or to list any product on the register are now required to provide section 26B(1) certificates declaring that they will not infringe a patent or, if they intend to enter the market before the expiry of any applicable patent, that they have notified the patent owner of their intention.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Unfortunately, the result of that earlier legislation is that all applicants for the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, not just those who want to market a generic product, are now required to have the section 26B(1) certificate. This can entail expensive global patent searches and legal advice. This bill responds to concerns raised by representatives from the complementary medicines industry, the over-the-counter medicines sector and the Australian biotechnology industry that the current patent certification requirements are onerous and broader than they need to be. This bill quite sensibly narrows the circumstances in which a patent certificate is required and restricts the requirement to those who under the act are required to submit safety and efficacy data and to those whose application relies on data previously submitted by another person in relation to an approved product.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The practical effect of this amendment is that the majority of complementary medicine and over-the-counter products, such as sunscreens and throat lozenges, will no longer be subject to the current certification requirements because they are low-risk therapeutic goods and safety and efficacy data is not required under the act. This bill simply means that patent certification under the act will apply only to relevant applications. There will not be a blanket requirement under the act for all applications to register or to list therapeutic goods. I therefore commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para>—I rise to support the <inline ref="R2440">Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2005</inline>. The Labor Party supports the bill because it enables the removal of obligations from parts of the industry which should not have had these obligations placed on them in the first place. The purpose of the bill is to amend the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 by creating an exemption to the current certification requirements for registering or listing therapeutic goods on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The amendments are in response to concerns raised by representatives of the complementary medicines industry, the over-the-counter medicines sector and the Australian biotechnology industry that the current patent certification requirements are more onerous and broad than they need to be. I know that all members of this House do not want that to be the case. We want to ensure that Australian people are able to obtain over-the-counter medicines and alternative medicines without the current onerous requirement. The bill proposes to exempt the complementary medicines industry and the over-the-counter medicines industry from the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement, which imposes an obligation on producers to prove that the products that they propose to list on the register do not infringe on existing patents. This generally involves expensive global patent searches.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The government has admitted that this bill is to correct an anomaly resulting from the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement. It has captured a sector that should not have been caught. I see that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing is at the table. I know that he has described this bill as being needed to address an unintended drafting error. We on this side of the House believe that that should be accommodated. We do not need to put in place requirements that are not needed.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The bill will effectively alter the way these products are brought into the market in Australia by restricting the patent certification requirements for particular products such as those that do not require manufacturers to submit safety or efficacy data in their application. The practical implication of this is that the majority of complementary and OTC products will no longer be subject to certification requirements. That is very laudable.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This error has added considerably to compliance costs and undue delay in applications to have products approved. That is the unintended nature of this drafting error. I know that the government would not want that to occur, and nor would we on this side of the House. We believe that you should streamline legislation so that you can get around these unintended errors that occur from time to time. Perhaps there should be more care taken in the drafting initially. This is an opportunity for us to see how there can be unintended consequences from the US free trade agreement. My contribution to this debate is only a small one. I join with the shadow minister in recommending that we support the legislation.</para>

I would also like to thank the member for Fairfax, from the government side, and the member for Reid, the shadow minister, for their contributions to this debate.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">To sum up very briefly, the government became aware that there were some unintended consequences arising out of the signing of the free trade agreement with the United States that affected complementary medicine and over-the-counter medicine producers in Australia, applying a heavier burden on Australian manufacturers of these worthwhile products than on American producers of them. The government acted quickly to ensure that the same burden that falls on American producers falls on Australian producers.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This bill is very welcome in the complementary medicines sector and the over-the-counter sector. It will impact on about 80 per cent of over-the-counter medicines and 90 per cent of complementary medicines and will ensure that consumers have access to the full range of therapeutic products that they seek, without the unnecessary burden falling on business of having to find out about patents which would have little impact on their ability to market these products in Australia.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2442">Energy Efficiency Opportunities Bill 2005</inline>. The purpose of the bill, as we have heard previously, is to establish the mandatory energy efficiency opportunity assessments announced in the government’s energy white paper <inline font-style="italic">Securing Australia’s energy future</inline> in June 2004. It is the opposition’s intention to support the passage of this bill. However, I intend to move a second reading amendment to reflect that the bill does not address the urgent need for greater energy efficiency across all sectors of the economy, not just business.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">There is an urgent need for us, as a community, to address greater efficiency in energy use in our transport fuel, and this means a national focus on the long neglected policy area of urban public transport. We have unfortunately become a nation that drives, for example, 500 metres to the local shop instead of walking. We have cities that are uncomfortably congested, with huge costs to the economy now related to the issue of congestion. These situations obviously waste fuel and time, and they are a source of stress to people trying to carry out their daily lives with reasonable ease.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We have also unfortunately become a nation that all too often switches on the airconditioner the minute the lounge room seems to be a little hot in summer. We make the assumption that our energy supplies are infinite, but we can no longer take that for granted. We are also a nation that does not pay adequate attention to our own energy use in our workplaces and in our homes. Take Parliament House, for example: how many people walk out of their offices each Friday afternoon and leave the lights glaring all weekend? We, as a community, ought to be taking the lead in displaying to the Australian community that we are actually concerned about energy conservation in Australia.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I raise these issues because this is what the Energy Efficiency Opportunities Bill 2005 is about. It has the support of both sides of the House because it is about trying to focus in a practical way on how to improve our energy use in this community, with the initial focus on the business community. It is important that we consider these issues, because we cannot ignore the greenhouse implications of our energy use. We, as a community, have to get smarter about energy consumption in our homes and in our workplaces. These are vitally important policy issues relating to energy efficiency that are not addressed in this bill, and I intend to raise some of these issues this morning.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In addition, the bill does not take up the challenge of diversifying our energy supplies. Unfortunately, the government has been very muted in its support for alternative fuels and renewable energy technologies, yet these are an important part of our energy solutions. I contend that the government has also missed a wonderful opportunity to take up the bipartisan recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Sustainable cities</inline>, many of which deal with energy efficiency initiatives that would make our cities move livable. It is interesting to note that the report says that, at a national level, at an Australian government level, we are going to try to work with our state and territory counterparts to get serious about improving public transport, especially in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. The opposition welcomes the government’s initiatives to address energy efficiency opportunities in the business sector, but I remind the House this morning that the opposition does not believe the bill goes far enough.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The bill requires large energy-using businesses to register with the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources. The end result being that they are required to submit a plan to undertake assessments of energy efficiency opportunities and report publicly on the outcomes of those assessments. This is about putting the finger on the business community in Australia to front up to their responsibilities on energy use. It is about public accountability and trying to build a new culture in our business community. Energy inefficiency is not a challenge to the Australian community alone but also a cost to those running businesses, which goes to their competitiveness both domestically and internationally, which therefore influences our capacity to create additional jobs in Australia.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I acknowledge that firms will be free to make decisions on investments identified via their normal business processes. It is not about Big Brother trying to direct on a daily basis how business operates in Australia but about trying to create a new culture of energy efficiency.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In Australia today, both the level of energy efficiency and the rate of improvement since 1973 are unfortunately lower than most other major industrialised countries. While the relatively lower price of energy in Australia may explain some of the difference, Australia has lower rates of energy efficiency improvements than countries with similar energy prices, such as Canada and the United States of America. More generally, experience in Australia and overseas has shown that there is often a gap between best practice energy efficiency and actual practice. While some technically feasible energy efficiency improvements will not be economically viable, there is also evidence that firms do not take up energy efficiency opportunities that are privately cost effective. This is clearly known as the energy efficiency gap, which is central to the bill.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The decision by government to introduce a mandatory assessment measure is aimed at addressing the gap. It comes in light of the fact that previous government programs have shown that a significant number of privately cost-effective energy efficiency improvements have been overlooked by the participating businesses.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Based on data from the ABS, around 250 companies are like to be covered by this measure. Those companies operate in a variety of business sectors in Australia. They importantly include: in mining about 65 companies; in commercial and service activities, 45; in petroleum, coal and chemicals, 30; in food, beverage and tobacco, about 25; in metal products, 25; in transport and storage, 15; in machinery and equipment, 10; in non-metallic mineral products, 10; in wood, paper and printing, 10; in construction, five; in water, sewerage and drainage, about five; and in textile, clothing, footwear and leather, five.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There was some consideration by the opposition that the potential school of companies to be picked up by this legislation is somewhat lower than that provided for by legislation in New South Wales and Victoria, but we decided to give the bill the opportunity of being put in place and tested for the purpose of trying to get some national leadership and pressure on business in Australia in the initial instance.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Business energy use accounts for over 80 per cent of Australia’s primary energy consumption. However, a relatively small number of businesses are responsible for the majority of energy use. ABS data suggests that the 250 large business energy users account for around 80 per cent of all energy used by businesses in Australia, which clearly points to where we have to make the initial progress with the application of this bill in trying to get an energy dividend as a result of government action.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Given the coverage of well over 50 per cent of emissions, the up-front compliance cost to business of an average of $49,700 per firm and current annual costs of $87,600 per firm, this seems reasonable coverage initially. It is for that reason we support the bill rather than seek to amend it with potential alternative legislation in New South Wales and Victoria. But we raise this issue in the debate for further consideration in the future based on how much progress we make as a result of this bill.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In the longer term, however, the opposition would like to see the program extended to cover a greater proportion of emitters. Estimated net benefits compared to business as usual are $557.3 million over 10 years, based on 2005 estimates. Realistically, businesses are unlikely to invest at such a low discount rate; however, with even more conservative assumptions including a 12 per cent discount rate, net benefits are estimated to be $132 million.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This bill is exceptionally important. I couch our remarks also about the issue of rising energy costs in Australia. I say that because, with very rapidly rising energy costs and increasing concern about the implications of climate change coupled with one of the most rapid economic expansions in history—namely, in our own backyard in China and India—it has become more important than ever for us to conserve our energy resources and to move on cleaner energy sources and technology.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In that context, in terms of energy, I pay brief attention to the issue of oil. At the moment, there are roughly five cars per thousand people in China—a growing economy, which will lead to increased demands for automobiles in that country. Alternatively, at the moment in North America, there are roughly 750 cars per thousand people and in Europe there are 500 cars per thousand people. In terms of the current debate on the price of oil in Australia, that confronts us as to what might occur in the foreseeable future. It is an issue of supply and demand. There is no simple answer to the issue of oil prices confronting not only Australia domestically at the moment but also, importantly, the international community.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Hence, in that context, we very seriously point the House’s attention to the need for the Commonwealth to get serious also about the issue of public transport in Australia. We have to front up to it in terms of our own responsibilities and our own capacity as a nation to move people and, for the movement of freight, to improve the use of rail transport in the decades ahead. This is a real economic issue and not just an environmental issue, if we are to be able to sustain good levels of employment and economic growth in Australia at a time when we are reaping the benefits of the rapid expansions of the Chinese and Indian economies, the benefits from which we want to continue to receive.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">That goes to some of the primary issues and it also points to the fact that total energy consumption in Australia is 3,000 petajoules per annum and is estimated to cost $A40 billion annually. Industrial energy consumption is 40 per cent, giving an energy bill of $16 million per year. Although many firms now achieve impressive economic returns by using energy more efficiently, numerous studies continue to uncover significant potential. Experience in Australia and overseas has demonstrated that it is possible to save 10 per cent to 15 per cent of this energy use over a five-year program. This would result in reduced costs of up to $2 billion annually, strengthening Australian industry and making it more competitive in world markets. The opposition contends that there are very clear reasons, both for the purposes of our economy as well as for environmental, greenhouse and resource conservation imperatives, to get more out of energy use in industry and business.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">That raises the importance of the second reading amendment, which the opposition proposes to move this morning in trying to focus the government’s attention on a broader agenda. Obviously, this second reading amendment is a practical endeavour to say to the Australian government that a little more has to be done, which means there should be a proper consideration of the House <inline font-style="italic">Sustainable cities</inline> report, on the question of our urban cities.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">At point 3 of this second reading amendment, we seek to condemn the government for not adopting the bipartisan recommendations put forward by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage in its report <inline font-style="italic">Sustainable cities</inline>. That issue is raised because the truth is that, in terms of transport in Australia, it took a long campaign to get the Australian government to front up to the fact that we needed a national land transport plan. As a result of work done by the Department of Transport and Regional Development after the election of 2001, that finally emerged in the form of AusLink.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The problem is that, in the consideration of AusLink, the current government ruled out any consideration of urban public transport. It is not fair to say that, historically, the national government has not been involved in the provision of public transport in Australia. I can refer, for example, to programs such as the Better Cities Program which existed under Brian Howe, the then Deputy Prime Minister, as minister prior to the defeat of the Labor government in 1996. You can go around Australia and see the success of Commonwealth government action in improvements to public transport. For example, in Western Sydney around the Parramatta-Granville area, the extension of the tramway to Bundoora on Lower Plenty Road in Melbourne and the extension of the tramway down the Burwood Highway in eastern Melbourne. Clearly that was about the Commonwealth government accepting the issue of movement of people.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The huge cost of congestion now confronts state governments. In cities such as Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne there is a requirement for the Commonwealth to join in a proper partnership with local, state and territory governments and actually do something about improving access in our major cities. That is important because it is fair to say that the Commonwealth government has contributed to some of those problems with a migration program which effectively means that most migrants settle in our cities. Australia, more than ever, is depending on a migration program to attract skilled tradespeople to Australia because of our failure to invest in the training of Australians both in the trade skills area and at the tertiary level.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We use part (3) of our second reading amendment to say to the government that they need to step back from their original intentions with respect to AusLink and give some serious consideration to including public transport in future land transport planning in Australia. If they do not, they are going to damage Australia’s domestic and international competitive position. Congestion is now a huge cost to the operation of business in Australia. By way of example, there is the Western Sydney Orbital, which is finally being constructed as part of the national highway as a partnership between the New South Wales and Australian governments. The construction of that section of the national highway is going to represent a huge saving to the cost of running business in Australia. Currently, there is all the associated waste of time and oil with the approximately 55 sets of traffic lights. In the future, energy savings will be associated with the opening of that road. These are very serious issues. Part (1) of the second reading amendment reads:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>calls on the Government to introduce energy efficiency to all sectors of the community, including transport, and housing, as well as business ...</para>
</item>
</list>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I do not think that it is fair in terms of energy efficiency and conservation to just point the finger at business. As a community, in our use of transport and in our personal activities, we have to start fronting up to fact that we have to conserve energy—in the same way that we have become serious in recent years about the issue of water conservation because of the drought in Australia. If we can do it successfully on the water front—and water is now accepted as a very important and scarce resource in Australia—we can adopt the same community attitude in our use of energy.

We have not sought to amend the detail of it. We will be moving a second reading amendment to try and extend the government’s focus in a genuine way.

</talker>
<para>—The purpose of the <inline ref="R2442">Energy Efficiency Opportunities Bill 2005</inline> is to provide a legislative basis for the Energy Efficiency Opportunities program, which was announced in 2004 in the government’s white paper <inline font-style="italic">Securing Australia’s energy future.</inline> We are a lucky country. Our lucky country has energy resources which are a source of considerable prosperity. Those resources bring Australia more than $24 billion a year in export income, and they provide access to low-cost energy for businesses and households. Those energy resources underpin our prosperity and our security. They mean industry and employment for Australians, but they are finite. We have to continue to learn to conserve and sustain them. That is why the white paper and this legislation, which results from the white paper, are so important.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The white paper represents a comprehensive review of energy policies and approaches taken by the government as a basis for developing long-term strategies to protect our energy resources, our economy and our environment into the future. About 90 per cent of Australia’s energy is sourced from non-renewable fossil fuels. Demand is projected to increase by about 50 per cent by 2020, so it is obvious that we must learn to conserve energy and to use it more efficiently. We can try to educate people to look for energy efficiency as a criterion when purchasing new appliances. We can promote the construction of energy efficient buildings. We can use more efficient light globes. We can even try to get the kids to turn off the lights when the leave a room. It all helps, but it is not enough.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Over time, such measures will reduce domestic energy use, and of course it is important to continue to look for ways to do that. But for nationally significant reductions in energy use, we need to look at efficiency in the way energy is used by those who use it the most. We want them to use what they need to process their product, but we want them to use it carefully. Business use accounts for over 80 per cent of Australia’s primary energy consumption, and Australian Bureau of Statistics data suggests that the 250 largest business users account for about 60 per cent of all energy used by business. That means that 250 businesses use about 50 per cent of all energy used in Australia each year. I think that is a quite remarkable figure. Let me repeat that: about 250 companies account for about half of all the energy consumed in Australia each year. If these companies can find and initiate more energy-efficient processes which significantly reduce their usage, then that reduction must also have a significant effect on the national figures. It is a real win-win situation. The company gets to save money, and our energy resources and environment also benefit—Australia benefits.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">So how do we get those 250 companies to reduce their consumption, to seek methods and processes to use energy more efficiently? One way of reducing demand for something is to tax it or make it more expensive. Another is to introduce penalties for exceeding particular limits, but there are very good reasons for rejecting both methods. Firstly, the increased price would be passed on to consumers and the cost of living would rise. Secondly, the government has no desire to penalise these businesses just because they are large or because their particular industry has high energy requirements; nor do we want them to produce less to avoid exceeding an energy limit. We are talking about businesses that are major employers, important to the economic welfare of Australia. They create employment, which has an enormous flow-on in creating other employment and business opportunities. Damaging those businesses would have a negative effect on our economic welfare.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">What the government wants to do is encourage these businesses to actively seek ways and means to be more energy efficient, and to undertake them. The benefits are at least threefold: overall energy consumption is reduced, which affects energy sustainability; less energy use means lower emission levels, which is good for the environment; and lower energy use of course means reduced business costs.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The purpose of this bill is to establish a framework for mandatory energy efficiency opportunities assessments, and public reporting of the outcomes, by the highest energy using businesses—that is, those businesses using more than 0.5 petajoules a year. Most people would not have any idea what a petajoule is or what 0.5 petajoules actually means, and I must confess I would be among them; 0.5 petajoules is roughly equivalent to the electricity requirements of 10,000 households a year. At least once in every five years these particular businesses will have to, firstly, assess their energy use; secondly, identify any cost-effective opportunities for using that energy more efficiently; and, thirdly, report on the assessments and their response to any identified opportunities. It is not mandatory to act on the assessment, only to report on it. This legislation leaves them totally free to make commercial decisions regarding the implementation of assessment findings.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">While we are making it mandatory for these high-energy users to be aware of possible energy efficiencies in their operations, any subsequent action is their own commercial decision. For instance, a business might find that it can save hundreds of thousands of dollars a year on electricity by replacing certain machinery. But whether or not it makes the necessary capital investment remains a normal commercial decision for that business.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">You might well ask why the government needs to push business to examine ways of saving money. It is an interesting question. Over the past decade the Australian government has used a variety of voluntary programs to assist companies to identify energy-efficient opportunities. The most recent one was the Energy Efficiency Best Practice Program, whereby the government provided $10 million worth of assistance to companies wishing to work towards energy efficiency. At first the focus was on providing benchmarking and information, which really did not prove very effective. The program gradually evolved into much more practical assistance, with management coaching and workshops, with some quite remarkable results.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is interesting to read the later case studies. They include a malting company which identified energy savings of 43 per cent, predominantly by changes to kilning. Another great example is the brewery which cut its refrigeration energy consumption by 35 per cent and has saved $500,000 per year—that is, half a million dollars—by changing how it chills its brew. The explanatory memorandum says that evidence from this and other programs suggests that many businesses can save 10 per cent to 30 per cent on their energy costs without reducing productivity. It says that experience of the EEBP shows that the provision of information is not enough because there are organisational barriers to be overcome. These barriers include risk aversion, short-term horizons, lack of cooperation between various managers and decentralisation.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">A Productivity Commission inquiry survey over five years of 47 sites, each spending more than $5 million per annum on energy, found that 44 of the 47 sites—that is, 94 per cent—had no established energy management systems. The Energy Efficient Opportunities Program is aiming at changing that. Remember, these companies are spending more than $5 million each on energy. Just as one manager in a large organisation cannot ensure energy efficient operations without the cooperation of other managers, nor can the government effectively work towards reducing energy demand and lowering harmful emission levels without the cooperation of people and businesses, particularly those businesses with the greatest demand for energy. The federal government is already working closely with industry and with state and territory governments to maximise energy savings with minimal additional regulatory burden.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">More efficient use of energy in Australia will not only help protect our environment—it could yield a $975 million improvement in our GDP each year. The Howard government is committed to protecting the welfare of our people, our economy and our environment, but we must all play our part: business, government, and individuals. We must continue to be careful of energy use and the environment in our everyday life—in the lights we use, in the appliances we buy, in the cars we drive and in how we design and construct our homes. I therefore commend this bill to the House.</para>

<para>—Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, being from Tasmania, you are well aware of the effects of renewable sources of energy. Tasmania’s development and direction has been dominated by the hydro-electric companies which, in part, in past years has perhaps led to an undervaluing of energy saving. It is a bit of an irony. Tasmania, being so dependent upon hydro-electricity—a renewable source of electricity—as its major energy source, can be a great exemplar for the rest of Australia of how to tackle a number of the global problems that confront us. Whilst you and I may have differing views on matters to do with the greenery that grows—which is code for trees, which is code for forests—Tasmania is an interesting experiment in managing a sustainable environment and all the principles of sustainability.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I would hope, given the advantages that Tasmania has, that things like this legislation—the proposals that the opposition would like to see the government going forward with to even a greater extent to move towards greater energy efficiency—may lead to a renaissance for Tasmania in the way in which industry can be encouraged to adopt these great opportunities.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">My interest in this legislation is not only because of the elements in it. There has been adequate description of the way in which the energy <inline ref="R2442">Energy Efficiency Opportunities Bill 2005</inline> will operate. It had its genesis in the government’s white paper <inline font-style="italic">Securing Australia’s energy future</inline> in June 2004. It will establish the Energy Efficiency Opportunities Program, as has been outlined. It will require corporations that use more than half a petajoule of energy per year to register. As indicated in the minister’s second reading speech, half a petajoule is equal to the electricity needs of 10,000 Australians households, at a cost of over $5 million. The paper has estimated that some 250 companies are likely to be involved. It will require those companies to assess the way in which they can tackle their energy needs over the five-year cycle of the program.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">On behalf of the opposition, the member for Batman has moved a second reading amendment which indicates that the opposition does not decline to give the bill a second reading. It certainly urges the government to look at energy efficiency in all sectors of the community including transport and housing, as well as the corporations covered by this legislation. Our second reading amendment condemns the government for its failures in the way in which it has supported alternative fuel and renewable energy industries. The third point in the amendment is the one that really attracts me to the debate:</para>

</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">At the time, as I have reflected in other debates to do with energy efficiency matters, there was a very strong debate in the coalition parties about this matter. It is right to say—this is not something that has been corrected on the public record—that at the time the then Minister for the Environment and Heritage, David Kemp, was rolled in cabinet. I know that many of the people I had the pleasure of working with on the environment committee were disappointed by the decision of the government to not push the envelope much further in regard to mandatory renewable energy targets, which was really disappointing.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As I say, when the House of Representatives committee looked at this matter in detail and discussed it with people in the community and in industry, we came to this recommendation in a unanimous fashion. I always say that one of the great things about the work of committees is that if we can come to an agreement—even if it reflects a consensus view that may reflect that there has been a bit of give and take and people have had to do away with some higher aims—and get unanimous decisions at parliamentary committees, it would therefore behove executive government to implement them. The parliament, as reflected in its opinions through parliamentary committees, could be confident that, even in a change of government, these things would go forward. That is the disappointment we see in ignoring the overwhelming view that we developed as a committee.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I am pleased to see that the honourable member for Moore is here, because he successfully picked up the chairmanship of the committee in this parliament. We had the re-referral of the sustainable cities inquiry, and Dr Washer was very accommodating in allowing us to further pursue the inquiry, not ignoring the work of the committee in the previous parliament but value adding to it. We made a trip to Western Australia, where we not only had a series of inspections but also took further evidence which added to the outcomes of the committee.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In our <inline font-style="italic">Sustainable cities</inline> report is a chapter that goes to issues of energy. Whilst not necessarily decrying the intent of the bill before us, the opposition is indicating, as a view of the Australian Labor Party, that on these matters we should just keep pushing and pushing and have higher aims. In fact, we were really critical of the white paper last year on whether it really had adopted a strategy that was going to see the outcomes that were necessary over a timetable that was necessary. The reason for doing these things is that, whilst it might be said that there is scientific evidence, for instance about greenhouse matters, that leads us to look at ways in which we can produce renewable energy without the release of greenhouse gases, if we do not act now and the majority view in the science world is correct, we will have lost the opportunity and we in this generation will have very much let down future generations in our stewardship of the globe.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In looking at some of the matters to do with a national approach to energy efficiency, the committee, in the sustainable cities inquiry, has set down a very comprehensive list of things we think the government should look at. In fact, recommendation 27 says:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The committee recommends that the Australian Government further develop its commitment to energy sustainability, particularly in the area of increasing the use of renewable energy.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Recommendation 28 says:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The committee recommends that the Australian government, through the National Framework for Energy Efficiency, examine the economic and environment benefits of decentralised energy delivery and encourage investment in this area.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">This is an interesting proposition—that the way in which we have this large decentralised system of energy supply runs in a countervailing way to our intent of achieving energy efficiency. Another view was put to the committee that the costs of shifting away from a large-scale centralised system to a decentralised system might outweigh the benefit, and that is why the committee recommends that we look at the economic and environmental benefits.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I want to highlight this one because I hope that, through the kind of legislation we are discussing today, we might see large corporations embracing the opportunities that might exist in their own processes to be creators of energy that might then be put out into the grid. Often, because this is incidental to the core business of companies, it is overlooked. We have to change the culture. We have to change the way people approach and think about these issues. That is why, again, we are pushing the government to show even greater national leadership on these issues, because a change is required in the approach of companies. The member for Fairfax was correct in proposing the question: why don’t companies do this? This is not a criticism, because they make decisions on the basis of their business.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We have to move forward—and the sustainable cities inquiry had this as an underpinning base—so that, in all facets of the community, we think more widely than just, say, economic sustainability, which a business might look at. Or the far Left greenies might just say, ‘It’s only ecological sustainability that’s important.’ At the end of the day, the sort of triple-line accounting that businesses are moving to is also something that is important about the national approach to sustainability. It has to be a national approach that not only is on the basis of environmental sustainability but includes economic sustainability and, as the committee emphasised, it has to include social sustainability, because the way in which all these things come together will be very important. We could have a dramatic effect if we do not change the way in which we envisage energy sources and energy use. That will have catastrophic social consequences as a result of the catastrophic environmental consequences, and we really have to look at these things.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This will require a change in our thinking. To the extent that this piece of legislation tells some 250—or so the white paper suggested—companies to change their attitudes and outlook because of legislation, this has to be transferred on throughout the community. Let us look at the types of companies that will be covered by this piece of legislation. If you extract data from the ABS, it indicates that there are something like 65 mining companies; 45 commercial and services companies; 30 petroleum, coal or chemical companies; 25 food, beverage and tobacco companies; 25 metal products companies; 15 transport companies; 10 machinery and equipment companies; about 10 non-metallic industry companies; about 10 wood, paper and printing companies; five construction companies; five water, sewerage and drainage companies; and five companies in the TCF industries. So you see that, across a whole range of industrial sectors, large companies will have to really come to grips with the questions and the challenges that are raised by the imposition of looking at the way in which they can be more energy efficient. I would hope that they are bold. I would hope that they see that this is not just a problem but an opportunity that they can embrace to be very innovative about the way in which they tackle some of these problems.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Again, Deputy Speaker Adams, if I refer to the forests and wood related industries, you know that I do acknowledge that those industries have been bold and innovative in changing their processes and in acknowledging that one of the thrusts that Australia requires is to go down the value added track, to be looking for those niche markets. When we can see a shift, a great change, in the way that industry approaches matters such as that, to add an approach that requires them to look at energy efficiency should not be a hard ask. But the simple facts are that, at the moment, Australia lags behind by international comparisons. The problem there is really this culture. It is not seen that this requires a partnership—that, at the individual level, this is truly about individuals and the state and that, at a company level, it is about corporations governance.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We have great challenges, but I think they add to the way in which the community can rally behind causes. To that extent, we need to have a wide debate on things like energy efficiency and the exploration of other forms of renewable energies, because it would seem that every form of renewable energy can raise the emotions. In a bold fashion earlier this week the honourable member for Batman, as our spokesperson on resources matters, entered the debate about uranium as a source of energy. I do not mind this being raised to the extent of increasing the debate. Without going into any confidences, in private conversations with the member for Moore we have discussed that we should not be afraid of the debate. It is not necessarily that if you put up your hand and say, ‘Have the debate,’ you have changed your mind—which I think is my position—but I cannot do my job as a legislator or as a person involved in public decision making if from time to time we do not revive the debate. At the moment I am sure that, even given the sorts of changes that people might propose in the debate, my position will not change. But I am obliged to keep an open mind and allow the debate.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We have extraordinarily emotional debates about wind turbines. The honourable member for McMillan—and I think he is on the speakers list—takes opportunities in these debates to express his concern about them. These concerns range from amenity and that they are a blot on the landscape, through to the way in which they are a great threat to migratory birds and the like. But we really have to look at the opportunities that evolve. The member for O’Connor may be on the speakers list. When he gets in here I am sure that tidal power will be discussed. We have interesting discussions about tidal power. A pilot program in Wollongong, in the Illawarra region, is being explored which perhaps has greater possibilities than the ones that we have seen on the western coast.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We need to look at all these possibilities. To that extent, we want to see the government push the envelope in that direction, and that is the reason for our proposed second reading amendment. I hope that when this legislation is in place it will lead to these big companies, these major decision makers in Australia who do things that affect the wider community, understanding the need for a cultural change. It is important for decisions to be made now that will affect future generations.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Scullin for the excellent work he did in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage, and I thank him for his kind words.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The <inline ref="R2442">Energy Efficiency Opportunities Bill 2005</inline> establishes a program under which corporations that are large energy users are required to assess the potential to improve their energy efficiency and report publicly on the assessment. This measure was announced in the energy white paper entitled <inline font-style="italic">Securing Australia’s energy future</inline> in June 2004. The government has appropriated $16.88 million over five years to introduce the program. Ongoing but reduced funding will be required to continue administration of the program in subsequent years. In talking about energy efficiency, I am referring to gaining the same or a higher level of useful output using less energy input.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">A major challenge to Australia’s economic growth and living standards will be to meet a projected 50 per cent increase in energy demand, while moving to a low emissions future by 2020. Improvements in energy efficiency will be a key step towards meeting this goal. It is expected that firms would take up cost-saving energy efficiency opportunities without any need for government intervention. Obviously, firms that use large amounts of energy would have a particular incentive to increase energy efficiency and reduce their input costs.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">So why is the government getting involved? In reality, it has shown that, in Australia as well as overseas, there is often a gap between best practice energy efficiency and actual practice. In Australia, both the level of energy efficiency and the rate of improvement since 1973 are lower than those of other major industrialised countries. This may be due to the lower energy prices in Australia, which reduce the commercial attractiveness of some energy efficiency opportunities. However, the US and Canada have similar energy prices to ours and have had greater improvement in energy efficiency.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">A Productivity Commission inquiry conducted this year found that 94 per cent of Australian companies had spent over $5 million on energy and did not have established energy management systems. The potential to improve energy efficiency in this country is enormous. The Australian government’s Energy Efficiency Best Practice Program has indicated that businesses could save up to 10 per cent to 30 per cent of their energy costs without reducing their productivity. The former Energy Efficiency Best Practice Program assisted industry sectors to achieve energy efficiency through innovation and capacity building. The program was funded from 1998 to mid-2003 and it worked with companies in the sectors of baking, beverage, packaging of dairy, pulp and paper, resource processing, supermarket and wine industry. To ensure that the materials, methods and results of the program continue to be available and utilised by industry, an internet based resource kit is being prepared.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">So why are more Australian businesses not taking up energy efficiency opportunities, if they will save on costs? It would appear that large energy users lack information about energy efficiency opportunities within their own organisations and, therefore, are failing to take advantage of potentially cost-effective instruments. Previous government programs have focused on provision of information; fact sheets and other material were made available to industries regarding energy efficiency best practice. However, reviews show that the passive provision of information by itself did not assist companies seeking to improve their energy efficiency.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This bill requires a more active engagement by asking large energy-using firms to look at their unique energy circumstances, assess where improvements could be made and report on them. The bill seeks to enhance the information flow to decision makers in these organisations. It does not mandate an adoption of an energy efficiency investment if the firm privately does not consider it cost effective. This approach strikes a sound regulatory balance by helping to address organisational informational barriers, which may then lead to lower energy use and reduce environmental externalities when—and only when—it is of benefit to the individual firm.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Companies to be covered by the bill are those that use over 0.05 petajoules—that is 10 to the power of 15—in a year, which equates to the electricity needs of 10,000 Australian households with a cost of over $5 million. Around 250 companies in Australia meet this criteria. These 250 companies account for around 60 per cent of all energy used by business in Australia. Small improvements in energy efficiency in this sector will have a great impact on total energy use in Australia—much greater than changes of a similar magnitude in the residential sector would have.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">These companies will be required to register for the program by mid-2007. By mid-2008, 50 businesses will have made an assessment and reported publicly on their energy efficiency opportunities. Verification and reporting arrangements will be determined consultatively. However, reporting is intended to utilise the Greenhouse Challenge Plus online reporting system, which already has about 120 of the target companies reporting on greenhouse gas emissions and energy. It is expected that companies will conduct assessments on a five-year basis from 2007. Public reporting is designed to provide the business community with useful lessons learned, while protecting companies’ reasonable commercial interests. Key performance indicators have been designed so that the program can be reviewed for effectiveness and efficiency.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It must be remembered that the Energy Efficiency Opportunities program has a dual purpose. The increased take-up of private cost-effective energy efficiency improvements will benefit not only the individual company but both the Australian economy, through increased productivity, and the environment, through reduced greenhouse emissions associated with less energy use.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The world abounds with proven ways to use energy more efficiently. Over the past decade, chemical manufacturer DuPont has boosted production by nearly 30 per cent but has cut energy use by seven per cent and greenhouse gas emissions by 72 per cent, thus saving more than $US2 billion so far. In 2001, oil giant BP met its 2010 goal by reducing carbon dioxide emissions to 10 per cent below the company’s 1990 level, cutting its energy bill by $US650 million over 10 years. Earlier this year, General Electric vowed to raise its energy efficiency by 30 per cent by 2012 to enhance shareholder value.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">With US companies implementing energy efficiency opportunities, the US now uses 47 per cent less energy per dollar of economic output than it did 30 years ago, effectively lowering costs by $US1 billion a day. There are obviously countless ways that a company can become more energy efficient, ranging from simple, cost-free measures to those more complex, such as infrastructure changes. Many energy-efficient products, once costly and exotic, are now inexpensive and commonplace. Simple items—such as fluorescent lamps, which use 75 per cent to 80 per cent less electricity than incandescent bulbs—are now cost-effective options.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Products with poorly designed standby circuitry lose electricity by energising computers and other appliances when they are turned off. In the US it is estimated that five per cent of household electricity is lost in this way and that it is equivalent to the output of more than a dozen 1,000-megawatt power stations running at full tilt. The Australian government is increasing the availability of information on the energy performance of appliances, buildings and vehicles, which will make it easier to select energy-efficient models. It will also expand on the successful minimum energy performance standards program by applying it to a greater range of appliances and applying more stringent standards to equipment currently included.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Structural engineering can have enormous impacts on energy efficiency. For example, in 1997 a carpet factory was constructed in Shanghai with the concept of optimising the whole building for multiple benefits rather than using isolated components for single benefits. The designers cut the pumping power required for a heat-circulating loop by 92 per cent through two simple changes. The first was to install fatter or wider pipes rather than thinner ones, which greatly reduced friction and hence allowed the system to use smaller pumps and motors. The second innovation was to lay out the pipes before positioning the equipment they connected. As a result, the fluid moved through short, straight pipes instead of tracing circuitous paths, further reducing friction and capital costs.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Whilst on the topic of energy efficiency, it is worth while touching on sources of energy in Australia and increases in efficiency in this area. When it comes to energy sources in Australia, the key component is coal. It provides us with 85 per cent of our electricity. The amount of electricity—that is, energy—that can be generated from a tonne of coal today would have required over four tonnes 100 years ago, and this is constantly being improved upon. Australian scientists have recently developed a drying process that removes more than 70 per cent of the water from brown coal, boosting energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by a third or more. The captured water can also be used to replace some of the water requirements in power stations, such as cooling water make-up and ash pond water.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Australian government is very keen to increase the uptake and efficiency of renewable, low-emission energy production. Currently, renewable sources supply around five per cent of our primary energy needs. In talking about renewable, low-emission technologies in the past, most people do not think of energy efficiency. However, if the renewable energy technologies are supported and are being researched and utilised, they will be further developed to become more energy efficient. More than $300 million was made available to support the renewable energy industry over the period from 1998 to 2004. This included a package of programs announced in the Prime Minister’s 1997 ‘Safeguarding the future’ statement, and additional support measures announced in May 1999 as part of the Measures for a Better Environment statement.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">These measures included the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target, which mandates an increase in the contribution of renewable energy to Australia’s electricity supply mix to achieve a target of 9,500 gigawatt hours per annum by 2010. This measure is expected to generate at least $2 billion in renewable energy investment in Australia and will be a significant driver of the industry’s growth. The measures also include the Renewable Energy Commercialisation Program, which provides funding for renewable energy commercialisation and includes a component for industry development; the Renewable Energy Equity Fund, which provides venture capital for small, innovative renewable energy companies; the Renewable Remote Power Generation Program, which will fund special purpose grants to state and territory governments to provide rebates for the installation of renewable energy equipment where it will reduce the use of diesel fuel for electricity generation; and the Photovoltaic Rebate Program, which will increase the utilisation of photovoltaic systems on residential buildings and community use buildings.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Some important low emission technologies such as solar and wind are intermittent in their power supply. Better electrical storage is required for them to be more efficient. The government is establishing an $18 million fund which will provide funding on a competitive basis to leverage investments into development of advanced electricity storage technologies, such as advanced batteries, electromechanical storage such as flywheels and chemical energy storage.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">An excellent example of an energy efficient renewable energy source is the solar Stirling generator. This unit was developed in response to the need for an uninterrupted power supply at a remote Queensland mine site. The unit combines the simple efficiencies of early 1800s Stirling engine technology with an inventive spin on conventional solar and heat cell technologies.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Stirling engine was developed in 1816. It converts heat into usable mechanical energy via a drive shaft by the heating and expanding and cooling and contracting of captive gas such as helium or hydrogen. This engine is far more efficient than an internal combustion engine.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The solar dish used on the unit is constructed of polished stainless steel rings that can be produced for about $1,700, compared to the $10,000 to $12,000 for a conventional dish. Conventional dishes are also susceptible to UV degradation and damage from hail. This design also has a larger solar capacity than a dish of equivalent square area. Attached to the solar dish is a phase-change heat cell containing salt and graphite. This cell can store 9½ times more energy than the same size lead-acid battery used in photovoltaic systems. It can also store 100 per cent of the solar energy directed into it, compared to only 15 per cent for photovoltaics. The salt cell lasts in excess of 25 years.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">When the engine is connected to a five-metre solar dish and salt cell, it can produce five kilowatts per hour and 20 kilowatts per hour of hot water at a combined heat and power efficiency of 80 per cent. This would be enough to cover domestic electrical and hot water needs and an absorption chiller for airconditioning, with energy storage for approximately four days without sunshine. The only by-products are hot water and electricity. A single unit will repay its CO footprint—that is, the amount of CO generated in its production—within 18 months. A desalination unit can also be attached which will supply 300 litres of distilled water per hour, 24 hours a day, and latent heat which is siphoned off and reused. The whole system is expected to retail for about $15,000 with government grants.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Australian government is dedicated to improving Australia’s energy efficiency performance. This bill is part of a group of measures being undertaken in order to achieve this. They include demonstrating the potential benefits of energy efficiency and market reform through major Solar Cities trials; expanding the range of appliances and buildings subject to minimum energy performance standards; continuing to improve the energy efficiency of Australian government agencies; increasing the availability of information on energy performances of appliances, buildings and vehicles; establishing the Productivity Commission inquiry to provide further information on the potential benefits of and policies to achieve improved efficiency; continuing to work cooperatively with the states and territories through the National Framework for Energy Efficiency process; and improving price signals for demand side management as part of reforming Australia’s energy markets. Some price signals and market arrangements do not fully value the benefits from energy efficiency, either as a mechanism for addressing greenhouse emissions or by reducing energy demand in response to higher prices. A prosperous and sustainable economy needs all participants to play a part. This bill will enable big energy users to play an active role in making Australians’ futures better.</para>

<para>—It is an honour and a privilege to follow my good friend the member for Moore, Mal Washer, in this debate. In the last parliament we were on the Standing Committee on Science and Innovation and also on the Standing Committee on Industry and Resources. It has been a loss to our committee that he is not on the industry and resources committee now, because one of the areas that we are looking at is the whole question of how to increase energy efficiency and also the safety of the community, and reduce greenhouse gases, by looking at alternatives to the use of fossil fuels. We are also looking at the general question of the state of Australia’s uranium industry and associated questions of nuclear power use in the rest of the world. I will come to part of that a little later.</para>

<para pgwide="yes">The member for Moore, as he is wont to do, had some really interesting things to say about how energy efficiencies could be achieved and what cutting-edge technologies had been developed in Australia and advanced to do things not just at the business level but at the home level. The <inline ref="R2442">Energy Efficiency Opportunities Bill 2005</inline> is specifically directed towards energy efficiency opportunities for Australian businesses. There is absolutely nothing whatsoever here about domestic use, domestic savings and domestic efficiencies. I wish in this instance that the government had paid greater attention to the member for Moore and to the government members of the Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage, which in August 2005 produced <inline font-style="italic">Sustainable cities—</inline>I will come to that later as well—because what is not in this bill are important things that are dealt with in the amendment moved by Martin Ferguson, the member for Batman, our shadow minister in this area. I want to come later to some of the key elements of that.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In terms of what is instructive about how we have got to this point and why this bill is necessary, I am indebted of course to the Parliamentary Library and their <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> and to the background briefing from the shadow minister’s office. Essentially we are here because in 1992 the then Labor government, in conjunction with state governments across Australia, initiated the process through COAG of putting before the Australian people and Australian governments an implementation process to try to get greater energy efficiency across Australia. In the 13 years since 1992 there have been some signal victories in regard to programs introduced by the states. Victoria, in particular, is an extremely interesting example of how you can go down a regulatory path and achieve significant effects—I think it is in the order of 1.15 million tonnes of CO a year because of what they have done. They are also very interesting because they have done what is not done in this bill—they have actually benchmarked what businesses have to do.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Maybe the government might move towards that kind of approach, because they have moved a long way so far. Upon coming to government in 1996, in the period 1996 to 1997 and a bit after that they started to look at how to deal with the problem of the greenhouse challenge. One of the problems, as the member for Scullin indicated, is that, even such a short period of time ago—nine years—it was still not absolutely conclusive that the arguments in regard to greenhouse were as strong as they now seem to appear. At that point in time it was apparent, particularly just a little bit later with George W Bush coming to the American presidency, that the approach taken by the Americans was to say that they did not want to trammel their industry in any way because of just the possibility of these greenhouse effects, and that really they would just barge on in the way that they had previously. They have learned some lessons in the interim.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The member for Moore cited some very interesting statistics on savings from energy efficiency in American businesses and the fact that this is cost effective. Those statistics underline one of the problems that the government have had, having spent a long time looking at what greenhouse strategies there might be and then encouraging businesses that it is in their own interest and in the country’s interest to do assessments of energy efficiencies that could be achieved. Specifically, in June 2004, the Prime Minister was still at it in securing Australia’s energy future. He said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">... the government will require large energy users to undertake a rigorous assessment of energy efficiency opportunities every five years ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">But you have to go a lot further than that. This bill finally goes a lot further, because the government have discovered that in this area, as we discovered in the superannuation area when we were in government, you can talk until you are black in the face but sometimes important regulatory changes that have to be made have to be mandated.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">If those who are covered by government regulation choose not to take the simple solution to follow the government’s strong suggestions that it is in the national and international interests, as well as in the interest of businesses, to look dramatically at how they could achieve greater cost effectiveness for their businesses and greater energy effectiveness for the benefit of the community at large, sometimes you just have to move. We are seeing here where the government have moved to.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There is also the example of where the government have not moved to. They have not moved to a point where they will say, ‘We will not only determine that major companies have to make energy savings; they have to be benchmarked.’ The government are good at benchmarking. The National Commission of Audit said on the government’s instruction, when it came out in 1996, that the only thing a federal government should do is benchmark and audit. The government have made a great deal of progress over a nine-year period towards getting themselves out of the game of actually governing this country, but at least through this issue they have been forced back into doing something active in this area.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">But there is a let-out clause. If the business think that it is not cost effective for them, they do not have to travel down that road. I predict that the government will have to get harder in this area. If you do not press it to the floor, ensure that people have a regulatory regime—if you do not have well-founded policy, as is the case in Victoria and New South Wales—and make them do it, it is easier to just not do it.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Let us have a look at who is involved. When we look at the series of campaigns we have had—we have had them particularly in New South Wales on domestic use—we see that the big users of energy in Australia are in manufacturing. The ABS had a look at 250 companies that will be covered by this measure. Mining has about 65 companies; commercial and services, 45; petroleum, coal and chemicals, 30; food, beverages and tobacco, 25; metal products, 25; transport and storage, 15; machinery and equipment, 10; non-metallic mineral products, 10; wood, paper and printing, 10; construction, five; water, sewerage and drainage, five; and textile, clothing, footwear and leather, about five. Those companies account for about 80 per cent of Australia’s energy use in those areas, but the ABS then went on to find that a small number of businesses are responsible for the majority of that use and that those 250 business users accounted for 60 per cent of all energy used by business. The ABS also pointed out that there would be a significant cost of compliance for these measures, so companies would have to front up with roughly $49,700 per firm and pay recurrent annual costs of about $86,700.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">You can see why the government was so tardy in coming to regulate—because of those costs. But on the other end there is a net benefit to those businesses, and that has been calculated to be in the order of $557.3 million over a 10-year period. But it may be a lot less than that. Due to a variety of factors, it may be only as much as about $132 million.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We welcome the fact that the government have finally moved from ineffectively cajoling to regulating and mandating, but we think they could actually do a great deal more. Not only are there energy efficiency opportunities; there are positive ways in which companies could do a great deal more than they have done so far. We also understand that there is a hell of a lot more that you can do if you take up the recommendations of parliamentarians. The Victorian example is very strong if you actually go a lot further. I will give the House a bit more information in that regard.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Victorian Environment Protection Agency, the EPA, have conducted a program for greenhouse gas emissions and energy efficiency in industry. In part, that requires certain entities that operate under EPA statutory approvals to examine and implement measures to improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The legislative requirement to implement measures that meet certain benchmarks, money relating to the pay-back period, distinguishes the Victorian program from the proposed Commonwealth Energy Efficiency Opportunities Assessment program. That is the fundamental difference. They are willing to press it further and to go harder than this government is. There is a three-year implementation period from 2004-2006. Their expectation is that they will achieve 1.15 million tonnes of reduction of CO annually. Under that program, they have actually brought the stakeholders directly to account.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is often good to take note of the work that government committees do and that individual members do. I am pleased to see that the digital clocks that were so inappropriately stolen from this chamber by one committee that decided it would do things without asking the users what was appropriate have been returned. I note that the rather ugly analog ones that they put in their place and that are a bit difficult to read have been left there. In energy efficiency terms the old clocks should go. The old analog stuff should be ripped out of this place. We should only have the more energy efficient digital clocks in this Main Committee on their own. That would be a saving in itself. That is a minor example, but a simple example of a small thing that we could do. I hope that might be taken note of.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Members from both sides of the House did excellent work on the report <inline font-style="italic">Sustainable Cities</inline>. What have the government done so far? Zip. Hopefully, they will move quickly to have a look at the recommendations in that report. I want to go to a couple of those, because they are pretty significant. The member for Moore spoke to recommendation 26, that the Australian government should double the photovoltaic rebate to further encourage the uptake of photovoltaic systems, based on the excellent work being done by the University of New South Wales. Recommendation 27 is very interesting. It is pertinent in regard to how we got to this bill and the tardiness of the government in pressing things through. It urges that the House:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The committee recommends that the Australian Government further develop its commitment to energy sustainability, particularly in the area of increasing the use of renewable energy.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">It is telling that a cross-party committee have sent the message that they do not think the government has had much commitment to energy sustainability. I do not think they have. Part (3) of the amendment moved by the shadow minister, the member for Batman, urges that the House:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">condemns the Government for not adopting the bipartisan recommendations put forward by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage in its report on Sustainable Cities.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes"> Key to the amendment is the second part, which:</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">condemns the Government for failing to support the alternative fuel and renewable energy industries;</para>

<para>—Given that in this regard it is actually in the amendment, I can refer to it. I am not a member of the committee; I cannot speak to the report. But I can refer to it, as everyone else dealing with this has done—the member for Scullin did, of course—and I can refer to the recommendations it involves. It is entirely directed towards the issues covered in our amendment, and our amendment cannot be understood without the report being involved. So it is material in this instance.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para pgwide="yes">The first part of our amendment ‘calls on the government to introduce energy efficiency to all sectors of the community, including transport and housing, as well as business’. Recommendations 28 and 29 in the report go a great deal further. Recommendation 28 says:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">The committee recommends that the Australian Government, through the National Framework for Energy Efficiency, examine the economic and environmental benefits of decentralised energy delivery and encourage investment in this area.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">What has been apparent in the work that I have been involved in, both in the industry and resources committee and the science and innovation committee, is that we have not done enough in regional areas, in particular, to foster different energy uses and alternatives. One of the excellent examples given by the member for Moore is the work that has been done on the salt cell.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Through advice that has been given to our committee, I know that some really interesting work has been done by Australians in the CSIRO and in private companies. Some of the research has been done in disparate areas, but some very interesting work has been done gathering research done elsewhere and presenting it in a new way. In the case of one company that spoke to us, there is the possibility of providing energy not only in regional Australia but in urban Australia as well. They would provide not only peak-load energy but also base load energy, by combining three different technologies that people did not think would actually work together. Part of the solution is similar to what is involved in the salt cell—that is, you need a way to store what you generate.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Recommendation 29 of the committee goes to another area that we have been investigating in the industry and resources committee, and it is material in terms of ways of producing energy that have less greenhouse effect. Recommendation 29 says:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">The committee recommends the Australian Government investigate US and German initiatives in the area of solar energy generation and purchase, and, where appropriate, implement or emulate them.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">In the industry and resources committee, we heard that the original German work done on the solar tower worked reasonably well. A one-kilometre high solar tower was built in about 1982 in Spain and it went through 10 years worth of proving. A solar tower is essentially a big chimney, at the bottom of which is a very large base of solar cells gathering energy and being used to throw heat up that chimney. What has been done in Australia is quite extraordinary. They have taken that original German technique and reduced the tower in the first instance to a 350-metre tower that can produce about 250 megawatts. Instead of starting from that angle, they are looking now at going to much lower generation—12 through to 25 megawatts of power—using, again, a much smaller tower but with a much improved system of energy delivery and much greater productivity in terms of energy efficiency. Most excitingly, by using another technology that has been proven by the CSIRO in another area, there is the possibility that they might be able to marry this in such a way that they could store that energy, not only to feed in to produce further energy overnight but to produce base load energy that could be used throughout regional and urban Australia.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We need to be really inventive in this area and to be open to the massive opportunities that are available to us. We need to press not only the regulatory foot to the floor, as the Victorians have done, but also the inventiveness of CSIRO and our industries because, if we do not achieve these energy efficiencies and take up those opportunities, the country will be much the poorer for it.</para>

<para>—It is an interesting thought that we are here today talking about efficiency. That of course is commendable on any occasion but, what is more, it makes a point that I have made, particularly during my time as minister for conservation, that the economy and the ecology have got to advance together. It is our responsibility as a government to ensure that the responses that we have to known environmental problems, for instance, can be resolved in a way that does not destroy our economy. If you want to know why that is the case, it is because poverty is the greatest threat to the environment. One does not have to travel far from our homeland to see the attitudes of low per capita income countries to the environment—it is virtually non-existent, because they cannot afford it. Unfortunately, the environmental debate is very much the property of wealthy nations; but that is not a reason why we should not have it.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I am here today to argue a case—and, consequently, I have to say to the previous speaker, the member for Blaxland: I am not interested in mickey mouse solutions. I talk of ‘greenhouse with grunt’. Australia, in that primary energy resource area, has a great asset that is not available in many other parts of the world. It starts with the moon, which fortunately has a habit of circling the earth at a known and highly predictable rate. As a consequence its basic pull on the seas of the earth creates tides. When you get a certain topographical situation as exists in the Kimberleys of Western Australia, you get massive tidal movements of a mean average of 11 metres a day—up to 40 feet. They happen to move twice a day so, if you want to harness the massive energy associated with those tides, you can harvest it on the way in, on the way out, on the way in and on the way out.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We heard quite tragically some time ago of a number of cockleshell harvesters getting drowned by a quickly increasing tide in England. Of course, that is no help from an energy perspective because the fact that they were out there with their tractors on this gradually sloping beach means that you cannot effectively harvest the energy. But when you go up into the Kimberleys and look at Walcott Inlet, which is 50 old-fashioned miles long, fills up and empties twice a day and has a neck where water flows in and out, where the average 400-metre runner could traverse—or swimmer, when the tide is up—then you realise how easy it is to harvest that energy. It is probable that you could harvest it more than once up and down that same inlet.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As a consequence I asked CSIRO what they thought of the energy harvest potential of that resource. They answered: equal to all the energy of every variety consumed in Australia today. And we have never ever contemplated using it. There is one good reason for that: it is far away from where we need electricity in the Australian context, notwithstanding that there is a very large adjacent bauxite deposit there, which is the base material for aluminium, known otherwise as congealed electricity. One would wonder why, as I have put to the state government over there, there is not a condition on leasing that deposit that it has to be vertically integrated to aluminium, and the electricity to do so should be generated by the tides of the Kimberleys.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">A more important development has occurred. Electric wires cannot efficiently deliver the energy generated to, say, Perth, South Australia or Sydney, but another energy transport medium could do the job. It is called hydrogen, one of the most commonly occurring elements in our universe. It is found, at a ratio of two parts hydrogen to one part oxygen, in water. It can be extracted from salty water as well as fresh water. A number of people, including our Prime Minister, may remember some of the experiments they conducted in their high school laboratories. They would have put two electrodes under low voltage into a beaker of water and got hydrogen off one and oxygen off the other.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The opportunity now exists to use the massive resource in the Kimberleys not only to generate electricity, which might develop the northern area—a good idea—but also to extract hydrogen and liquefy it, which would make it transportable, in the same nature as liquefied natural gas. We use natural gas to liquefy natural gas, so we burn some of the energy. Natural gas by nature usually has a component of carbon dioxide. In the gas one gets out of the Gorgon deposit the carbon dioxide component can be as high as 14 per cent. Some of the west Queensland facilities also have that level of contamination. The carbon dioxide has to be removed in the liquification process, simply because it solidifies before natural gas liquefies and, if you let that happen, your whole system blocks up. So what do they do with it? They pump it into the atmosphere and then send the clean product off to China or Japan or somewhere like that. In the case of Gorgon, they try to geosequester it—in other words, extract it and pump it back down into the ground.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I have some concerns about this policy. For instance, Mr Deputy Speaker Baldwin, in your own region were they to extract the carbon from coal after it is burnt to make electricity and pump it into the ground, and then were we to have another disastrous earthquake, it might be followed by a very large burp. The policy has a few problems, in my mind. Nevertheless, if we want a purely vertically integrated energy transfer agent—that is how hydrogen is referred to in the scientific community—how does that happen? If you generate electricity and you want to make it renewable you could use all the base surplus that occurs at night-time and other non-demand periods at a coal fired power station but you would have a carbon issue. If you want a purely renewable process you could commence using the tides of the Kimberleys to produce, as the French have been doing for 40 years, electric energy. Having done so, you electrolyse water and then you have a huge resource of energy which you can use to liquefy the hydrogen. You can then put it in a tank or tanker and take it to Sydney and use it there. I would not propose to use it to remanufacture electricity—although that is exactly what you can do.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In 1839 a gentleman invented the fuel cell, but it languished because petrol and diesel and similar fuels were that much easier. We have rejuvenated it. There are three buses in the Perth metropolitan area, three in London and 30 in various other parts of the world, in groups of three, running on pure hydrogen. They have no engine. You can put hydrogen into a reciprocating engine. BMW, in particular, followed that technological route. But in the case of the fuel cell you recombine this hydrogen with atmospheric oxygen and you get back the electricity you put into the water up in the Kimberleys.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">So in fact the buses that are running around Perth, London and other parts of the Northern Hemisphere are running as electric buses. We immediately recombine hydrogen back to electricity and water. If you get behind one of these buses in Perth as they accelerate away and use more hydrogen, you see that a puff of steam comes out of the exhaust pipe. There is no pollution whatsoever.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The transport sector in Australia uses 50 per cent of all the energy consumed in Australia. We already have proven technology. Yes, it requires upgrading or further development. We could have a 50 per cent reduction in carbon based energy by the simple act of replacing that energy with hydrogen.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">A lot is said about wind generation. Of course there are more poems and songs written about the vagaries of the wind than I could list in this place today in the time available to me. It is farcical to say that wind generation is saving emissions. It simply is not. Our base load coal fired power stations have got to maintain steam pressure while waiting for the variations in the wind.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I had discussions with the Minister for the Environment and Heritage this morning. Within my electorate a wind tower was erected for an isolated community. It is about 600 kilowatts. Then the power authority went out and bought two diesel generators of 700 kilowatts. Okay, they tell me that their fuel consumption is down by 45 per cent, but, on the other hand, if that wind generator were using its surplus power—remembering that typically the wind blows most strongly when all the lights are out—they could be making hydrogen and running the diesel motors on hydrogen. This morning an expert quoted all the great problems to me. You would think that we could not fly a man to the moon.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">What I am saying is that we are wasting money trying to clean up coal. It may or may not work, but as we stand here the cost of extracting the carbons from the chimneystack of a coal fired power station will increase the price of electricity somewhere between two and five times. That is still a matter of dispute. We should be spending our research money on getting hydrogen into our transport sector, and if necessary we should be making it in the Kimberley.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">My farmers should be making it on property. We should be assisting them with the research. I would like to know how big a photovoltaic cell panel and possibly wind generator my farmers need to electrolyse the salty underground water that is giving them all sorts of pain in terms of dryland salinity—to manufacture on 365 days a year enough compressed hydrogen to run their tractor and their header at peak periods and probably to top up the LandCruiser in the intervening period.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">That is all quite practical. No-one is doing any research on that. We are just passing laws in the parliament. We should be efficient. That is where the money needs to be spent. That would fix the price. The only fuel of tidal power is money. Money is a lot damn cheaper than fuel at this point in time.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I recently visited Detroit General Motors. It is their view that within five years they will be manufacturing, mass producing, a hydrogen fuel cell car—a car running according to the same principle as those buses around all parts of the world. Where will Australia be at that time if we want to bring a heap of them out here to have a distribution system available and a source of hydrogen? We are doing nothing. My side is doing nothing. Let us admit it. I think the members opposite would say that they have never seriously asked that question.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The other thing that I was told in Detroit was that only 12 per cent of the population of the world own a motor car today. It is predicted that that will go to 16 per cent by 2020. By then the world population will have moved from six billion to eight billion. So it is not 16 per cent of the present world population; it is all those extras. We keep mucking around trying to improve the efficiency of petrol based cars, but they say that in fact you would need to improve the efficiency of petrol or diesel motors by 62 per cent to keep a flat curve on petrol consumption in the United States alone.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">So let us look to the other alternatives. The present-day government, with the full support and enthusiasm of the opposition, should be saying: ‘We’ve got $500 million for research into renewable power. Why aren’t we asking one of our car manufacturers to produce a hydrogen taxi for the world?’ When you look at the technology of these cars, as General Motors will show you, it is all in the chassis. So you can have a floor plan much more like a London taxi, with plenty of room. In fact you would probably drive the car, because its steering would be electronic, with a joystick. So you could put that in the middle and it could be a right-hand drive or a left-hand drive with virtually no problems. You could have the taxi with plenty of room for your luggage, and step in. It may be a car of a similar nature that becomes the second family car, that is easy to put the kids in, that is easy to put shopping in and all those sorts of things.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">More particularly, why can’t we as a government say to Holden, Toyota or someone, ‘You build this vehicle and we in conjunction with state governments and local government will mandate their use in Sydney, Melbourne and these other places’? While we are about it, why aren’t we designing a fuel cell component so that you can rip the back axle out of a two-tonne truck, which is also a major polluter around the metropolitan areas, and fit in one of these things? If I can come back to taxis for a minute, let us say that even with government subsidies these taxis cost $100,000 each. You would say, ‘You can’t impose that on a poor old taxi driver.’ What do they pay for the licence plates? They pay $500,000 if they are lucky. Wouldn’t it be better for Sydney to have a taxi fleet whose only emission was steam, which was a much more convenient vehicle and which of course had the convenience of having only a few centralised refuelling places.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The General Motors company say that for $12 billion to $15 billion they can put a distribution system for hydrogen throughout the United States. Yet someone will tell you, ‘It’s all too hard.’ Yes, development is needed if we want a totally clean fuel system or if we want to take 50 per cent of our energy consumption out of the hydrocarbon places completely. You can get hydrogen by splitting natural gas—but the first lesson you learn in secondary school physics is that you cannot destroy an element. You can pluck the hydrogen out of the hydrocarbon, but you have still got the carbon, and that is the polluting factor. Someone said: ‘That’s quite easy. When you do this and you strip the hydrogen out you end up with carbon monoxide.’ We all know that is how people poison themselves. Apparently you can burn that and you get carbon dioxide again. I thought that was the problem.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Why are we mucking around with that sort of technology when we know how to produce hydrogen? We have technology, including the reciprocating motor—and BMW have got them—that runs on hydrogen. Down in my electorate, at Hopetoun, they have got $1 million from us to build another wind tower. I said to the minister this morning, ‘Why don’t you insist that all the surplus energy of those two wind towers is directed to electrolysing water?’ You can buy a package. That is what fuels some buses in certain parts of the world. It all just sits in a container. Why aren’t we insisting that that go in concert? Why, after we have paid for another wind tower, which is highly inefficient in terms of its comparison with coal generation, aren’t we using it to make the hydrogen to run the diesel motors that are sitting there to back it up every time the wind slows down or the grid demand exceeds its capacity if it is up to capacity?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">These are all fundamental issues that both sides of parliament should be looking at. A fuel cell is 61 per cent efficient; a reciprocating motor, in the mid-20s. So in other words we get a prize for being environmentally friendly, yet we are running around trying to tax people to force them to use less energy, when they could be using virtually three times as much with no pollution. This is the challenge that I ask the opposition to consider. In fact, if they get after us on it, I will welcome it, because I do not think we have gone anywhere near far enough in the proper solutions. We are waiting for the world to fix the problem and it might be too late.</para>

<para>—The night of 2 October 2005 will be a night that lives long in the memory of many people in south-west Sydney. It was a night that saw people from all walks of life gathered around television screens in pubs, clubs and family homes, all in one united hope—the hope that the mighty Wests Tigers would take out the NRL grand final. I am happy to report that they did, and in spectacular style. The streets of Campbelltown in particular, where I live, were abuzz for a week, with perfect strangers coming together in shops and on streets, contemplating the prospects of the Wests Tigers at the grand final. Cars were decorated with balloons and streamers; shop windows were adorned with posters; and the air was filled with a nervous expectation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">It has been a long time since the western suburbs has won a premiership—1952, in fact—and it was back in 1969 when Balmain won a premiership. But this was the first occasion that the new five-year-old merged joint venture, the Wests Tigers, had made it to a grand final. Needless to say, in the days leading up to the grand final, supporters in the south-west of Sydney were already walking tall, looking forward to a great game and hopefully a great victory. That is exactly what we got: a great game, a tremendous victory and fabulous celebrations of the win. I do not know if the players have come back to earth as yet, but I do know that there is still a spring in the step of Tigers fans in the streets of Ingleburn, Campbelltown and Liverpool. It is amazing what a win like this can do for a local community like the one I represent.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There are a number of people who must be congratulated for taking the team from rank outsiders earlier in the season to a premiership win. Naturally, Scotty Prince and the players had a great deal to do with it, both the high-profile players and the not-so-high-profile players who toiled away tirelessly throughout the year and have become heroes in the community and examples to many aspiring young players who strap on their football boots every weekend.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Of course, a team is only as good as its support staff and Wests has been blessed with a fine coaching staff, led by Tim Sheens, himself no stranger to grand final success. To be honest, when I stood on the hill at Campbelltown Stadium with the Leader of the Opposition during my election campaign, watching Wests Tigers lose to the Canberra Raiders in a trial match, I did not think that I would see Wests Tigers making it to a semi-final let alone taking out the grand final. Tim Sheens and his coaching staff, strongly supported and encouraged by club officials, particularly the CEO, Steve Noyce, can be rightly proud of the results that they have now attained.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">While the Lord Mayor of Sydney, Clover Moore, has decided not to put on a street parade to recognise the victory of this fine Sydney based side, I am proud to report that the West Tigers will lead a street parade through Campbelltown early in November. In fact, on 5 November the Tigers will lead more than 80 floats down Queen Street in the Festival of the Fisher’s Ghost street parade. The Tigers may not be considered good enough by the Lord Mayor of Sydney to have their own street parade, but they will certainly be greeted by thousands of cheering fans who will line Queen Street and congratulate their team. I will be one of those fans, and I am proud to say that this year, my team, the Wests Tigers, took out the premiership.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Congratulations to the players, the support staff, the administration and of course the fans on a superb effort this season. Let us hope that this time next year I will be proudly hanging the 2006 grand final-winning Wests Tigers T-shirt in the window of my parliamentary office.</para>

<para>—Last month, the New South Wales government announced that it will not be extending any travel concessions to pensioners living outside the Hunter, the Illawarra, the Blue Mountains and the Central Coast. Pensioners living outside those areas will not be able to take advantage of the $2.50 concession being offered to their peers. Instead they will continue to suffer a penalty for daring to live outside Labor electorates in New South Wales.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">This is a huge rebuff to pensioners living in the Southern Highlands and the Shoalhaven. The message the New South Wales government are sending to them is: ‘You don’t count, and we don’t care.’ The Labor Party have always been class conscious and what better way is there of reinforcing that ideology than by creating two classes of citizens in New South Wales—one that lives in the metropolitan Labor held electorates and one that includes all the others.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This just adds insult to injury when you consider that the electrification of the South Coast rail stops at Kiama. Of the $380 million the Labor government dedicated to the maintenance of the Princes Highway from Wollongong to the Victorian border over 10 years, well over half is being spent on constructing the Kiama bypass. The New South Wales government are also pumping water out of the Shoalhaven River to supplement Sydney’s supplies and are now suggesting that they may raise the wall of the Tallowa Dam in Kangaroo Valley. This will cause untold damage to what they have themselves promoted as heritage valued environment.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">All in all, the approach of the New South Wales government to regional issues seems rather partisan. The state coalition, as part of their election platform a couple of elections back, suggested a universal pensioner travel concession of $1. This was costed and found to be fiscally viable. It would have applied to private bus operators, and many of my constituents who are pensioners would have benefited as it is a long way between towns and villages with little or no public transport. A shopping expedition to Nowra can be quite costly in fares, but that does not seem to concern the New South Wales government.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There is no reason why the $2.50 concession being offered to metropolitan pensioners cannot be extended to regional and rural areas. In fact, I challenge the New South Wales government to show why this cannot be the case. Why are pensioners in the Gilmore electorate being discriminated against? The purpose of an elected government is to govern for all, yet here we find a government who are blatantly saying that it is okay for pensioners outside the metropolitan areas to be treated differently. In the rural and regional areas, there is suffering because our pensioners are paying more to get around. It is tantamount to categorising them as second-class citizens.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I would have thought that, given the boundary redistributions for the next election, there would have been some token gesture to demonstrate the principle of universal suffrage. Instead, the member for Kiama, whose boundary redistribution will take in a nominally Liberal seat, is running around trying to convince people that he can look after them. But the evidence suggests something opposite. I am intrigued by how the member for Kiama can reconcile the obvious discrepancies between what he is saying and what is actually happening in the real world. Ironically, he has recently been appointed as the parliamentary secretary to the New South Wales Minister for Roads. That puts him in the box seat to demonstrate his influence and the regard in which he is held. The first thing he could do is to wield his new influence and get money for the Princes Highway. But I bet all we will get is more doubletalk and blame shifting and little action.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">New South Wales has a population of just over 6.7 million persons. Most residents live in Newcastle, Sydney and Wollongong, whilst proportionally only about one-fifth live in the rest of the state. So how much more expensive would it be for the New South Wales government to extend the concession throughout New South Wales so that they do not discriminate against country people, as they always seem to do? The people of Bomaderry and North Nowra are entitled to an answer before the member for Kiama asks for their vote in 2007.</para>

<para>—Over the past weeks it has been my great privilege to present over 150 medallions to veterans. This has been to mark the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II in the Pacific. I am advised that in the seat of Banks there are over 2,500 veterans entitled to receive the medallion. Many have chosen to have it presented by their local member. I have been joined on each occasion by my colleagues Kevin Greene MP, the member for Georges River, and Alan Ashton MP, the member for East Hills. Their presence, together with the pleasure of the recipients and their friends and families, has made these occasions truly memorable.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">In some cases our veterans have been unable to attend the formal presentations that I have been conducting in the various service clubs in the electorate. I have been invited to visit some 30 homes to date, where I have been able to conduct personal presentations. Each time I hand a medallion to one of these people I know that there is an individual story behind that person and the memories they carry, both good and bad, of the years they served their country.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I recall one in particular. The medallion was accepted by a veteran’s son on behalf of his deceased father and at the request of his mother. The mother was especially pleased to ask her son to accept the medallion as relations between father and son, I am told, had never been easy. His mother explained why. The father had served several years on the Burma Railway and later in the Japanese coal mines. According to the veteran’s widow, her husband was never really the same when he returned to Australia. Who can blame him? It was moving to see how important the medallion was to mother and son. My generation know very little of what our veterans experienced and suffered. This is my opportunity to find out. I have enjoyed every minute of the seven formal presentations I have conducted so far, together with the many personal presentations.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">However, it has come to my attention that there is a crucial anomaly in the process of determining the criteria for receipt of the medal. In speaking with the many veterans, widows and widowers, my staff have found that the Department of Veterans’ Affairs has made what I believe to be a strange determination. In a number of cases both husband and wife served during the war—indeed, that is how many of them met. Where both are still alive, each is entitled to receive the medallion. Where one is deceased, the family is only entitled to receive one medallion. In several examples, a woman has been allocated a medallion to receive on behalf of her deceased husband but is not entitled to receive one in her own right.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This seems to be inconsistent, at the very least, and discriminatory at its worst—although I have had the reverse apply as well, where a husband received a medallion on behalf of his deceased wife and was therefore not able to receive one in his own right. When queried the department explained that the policy is ‘one medallion per person’. If one partner is deceased then the other is entitled to only one medallion. I find this extraordinary. Both partners have served their country in their own right. Initially I was informed that the criteria for receiving a medallion were:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">... a person must have been alive on 8 May 2005, Victory in Europe (VE) Day, and served during WWII, or be the widow/er of a person who served as:</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">A member of Australia’s defence forces; or</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">An Australian merchant mariner; or</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">A Member of the Commonwealth or allied forces who has qualifying service; or</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">An allied mariner who has qualifying service.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">To be eligible for the medallion a Commonwealth or allied veteran, mariner, widow or widower must live in Australia.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The fact sheet provided by the department states:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Maximum of one medallion per person.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The medallion is intended to commemorate surviving WWII veterans and their widow/ers. One medallion will be issued to each eligible veteran or widow/er. Where a widow/er is eligible for a medallion in their own right as a veteran, and is also eligible for one as a widow/er, the widow/er will receive one medallion.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">It seems extraordinary that this should occur and that people are determined to be eligible based on their marital circumstances. These veterans contributed to the war in their own right, as individuals. The medallion represents the respect that this generation holds for those who have served in the defence of Australia.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">A further query to the department elicited the response that the policy is under review by the national office. I do not know what stage that review is at. However, on behalf of a number of very disgruntled ex-servicemen and women, may I make it clear that they are not pleased. The Department of Veterans’ Affairs has a motto, which is on their website, which states: ‘Their Service—Our Heritage’. I do not believe that ‘our heritage’ is well served by such bureaucratic rulings. I strongly urge the department to reconsider this distressing state of affairs. If that does not occur, the minister must intervene in this matter and clear it up as soon as possible.</para>

<para>—As we approach the Phillip Island Moto Grand Prix this weekend I want to raise two issues that affect that area. One is in relation to the public safety on the roads at Kilcunda and the second is in relation to public health issues on Phillip Island. The town of Kilcunda is on the Bass Highway. It has a beautiful vista; it overlooks the Bass Strait. But it has an extremely dangerous crossing. It is a primary route with trucks, busses and cars all travelling along it. Children are set down there, parents cross there and families who are staying at the caravan park cross that road on a frequent basis as a means of getting to and from the shops, the caravan park and the beach.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">This is a disaster waiting to happen. It is a blind corner with heavy traffic travelling at fast speeds through a small township that has a significant population of elderly and young people, both of whom are at risk from the traffic. We have made representations to VicRoads in relation to the desperate need for a pedestrian crossing. Those representations have not been responded to by the state, and I want to raise before this House on this day, with the Grand Prix coming up this weekend, that it is a death trap. Unless something is done to produce a pedestrian crossing at the earliest possible time, we face the risk of either elderly or young people, or others, being killed on a road which should be perfectly safe. A pedestrian crossing is needed now. We have a petition in place and, in working with the local community, my message is very simple: we will continue to work until we are successful, and nothing less than complete success in securing a pedestrian crossing will satisfy us.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The second point I want to make is in relation to the need for a Phillip Island aquatic centre. As we approach the Grand Prix weekend, with tens of thousands of visitors going to Phillip Island, one thing which is absolutely clear is that there is a need for a major aquatic centre for residents and visitors. The reasons are twofold. The first is that residents in an area that is demographically old have a need not just for aquatic facilities but, in particular, for hydrotherapy. To that end, the Phillip Island Aquatic Centre Steering Committee, led by Pam Cameron, has developed a proposal which is a ripper. This proposal sets out a plan for an aquatic centre, a funding mechanism for it and a hydrotherapy proposal. It is one with which I have been involved since shortly after its beginning, and it is one to which I am committed. I commend the committee in relation to their activities.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The second reason why it is necessary is that Phillip Island has uneven tourism throughout the year. It has high points for the major road races and it has high points over summer, but there are long periods where the level of tourism to this magnificent island—with its penguins, its koalas and the attraction of the Nobbies—is down. One of the elements which tourism advisers have said would help smooth that is a major aquatic centre, because there is great interest from sporting teams, schools and others in coming to the island, training there and visiting the natural environment, if there are facilities of sufficiently high standard to help with sports, the entertainment of school groups and the entertainment of visiting tourists, whether from Victoria, Australia more broadly or overseas. What we have at present is a large number of day tourists who come in, visit the tremendous Phillip Island Nature Park and leave. We want to capture that market. We want to make sure that those people stay more than one day, that they stay overnight or for a weekend.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">An aquatic centre would be a tremendous addition for the residents and it would be a great step forward for tourism. The steps in achieving this are simple. We have a plan. We need the support of the council, and we recently met with the mayor. I have pledged to push it at the federal level as a significant program, and we need the state to come on board. Those are the steps forward. I commend the aquatic centre proposal, and I pledge to do all I can to help. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talker>
<para>—I note a report in today’s <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> by Cameron Stewart wherein the President of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils, Ameer Ali, retracted comments that he made in the last fortnight. Having been briefed as part of the government’s Muslim Reference Group, he then greeted reporters with the comment:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">It was all unanimous; not one single disappointed person.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">In today’s <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> he roundly turns and, after exposure, concedes that the matter was not discussed amongst the parties there. It is quite clear from the comments of a number of participants that there is anxiety amongst members of the government’s Muslim Reference Group on the grounds of human rights issues. Ameer Ali conceded, ‘That was a misunderstanding. What I meant was—’ et cetera.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This unfortunately is not the first occasion on which the government has suffered some embarrassment from the performance of the Muslim Reference Group. In the first place, the group causes some concern. The criteria should not be how close people are to a political party or how much they might be perceived as giving the statements that the government might be comforted by, because this is the second time we have had a significant retraction.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The infamous Mr Deen, who of course is a well-known supporter of the federal coalition—and that is a credential, apparently, to be on the Muslim Reference Group—is the person who in the early meetings made the blatantly racist comment that all of the Jews in New York were away from work on the day of the September 11 attacks. That of course was a slander which originally apparently came from the chief imam in Paris some years ago. Mr Deen of course also had to clarify things. This is a person put on the Muslim Reference Group for the whole community in this country, handpicked by the Prime Minister. He said, ‘Oh, I didn’t really want to articulate those views. I was just repeating what other people think.’</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Quite frankly, I have doubts about his later defence. It is very unconvincing. But again, as I say, it indicates problems with the people in this reference group. From day one this group has not represented Islamic Australia. It is ethnically not of that tune. I of course represent a significant number of Turks in Western Sydney. I am very close to the community; I often attend the mosque there. If you want a community in this country with a secularist, progressive line in regard to the future of Islam, it is the Turkish community. They have not one representative on this body.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Similarly, the Lebanese Muslim association, which centres around the mosque at Lakemba, is not represented. These people might be now led by a more religious group of people than they have been historically. In the Lebanese Muslim association, there have been faction fights in the mosque, and the current leadership would be perceived as being more orthodox, more religiously committed, than their predecessors perhaps. But that is not criteria for exclusion.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We have to make sure in this country that we take the vast majority of Muslims with us, that we have them committed to Australia and its interests et cetera. If we have a committee which does not represent them and if we have a tune coming from some government members and ministers that those that are excluded are the ones that are dubious and doubtful, the ones that perhaps have some difficulties, then we have a situation where unfortunately misunderstanding and concern are spread in the community.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">On 29 August I had the Prime Minister in my electorate. The only place he seems to ever attend in my electorate, besides sporting events, is the Al-Faisal College, where he shares a close friendship with the principal, Shafiq Khan. I concede the point that he and others make in some venues—not all the time, mind you—that this government has indeed greatly enhanced the proliferation of Islamic schools in this country by liberalising the rules with regard to the establishment of schools. Previously, under Labor, there had to be a test as to how it would affect the local government schools. That was abandoned and other rules were liberalised. The Prime Minister and others, the member for Mitchell and the Attorney-General, in Muslim venues make the point that the government’s funding for private schools is very supportive of the Islamic community.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The day he visited, I took the opportunity to make the point in front of the Prime Minister that Islamic Australia is essentially like the rest of Australia, to a large extent. I gave an example of seven people in my electorate and people connected with me who are out there in sport, in culture, in professions, in education et cetera making a commitment to the country.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">So I have some concerns about the nature of the Muslim Reference Group. Let us make sure that these groups represent the whole community. Let us make sure that, by exclusion, people who do carry clout, people who do matter in this country, are not perceived as being outside the circle, perhaps not as loyal as others, not as true to the government and therefore liable to cause difficulties.</para>

<para>—The Hinkler electorate’s educational institutions and schools have long been known for their innovation and dedication to providing the best possible learning environment for their students. That commitment has been matched by strong support from the Australian government, with more than $1 million recently allocated to state school projects throughout Hinkler under the Investing in Our Schools Program. The IOSP has been warmly welcomed by local schools and P&amp;Cs, many of which struggle to find funds for wish-list projects such as airconditioners, playground equipment and new computers.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I remember back to last year’s election, when my local newspaper was inundated with outraged letters from various education unions, claiming that the coalition government had been diddling state schools on funding. However, the federal funding to Queensland state schools increased by 5.4 and 4.8 per cent in the previous two years, while over the same period the state government funding increased by only 2.4 and 3.9 per cent respectively. If the state government had merely matched the Commonwealth’s percentage increases, state schools would have received another $116 million, an extraordinary figure.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The coalition has come through with the goods well and truly. These goods are worth $700 million in direct funding for capital works in state schools between 2006 and 2008. That amount comes on top of the $1.5 million already allocated by the Australian government for schools’ capital works over the next four years. Some of the specific projects in my electorate that will be able to proceed, thanks to this Commonwealth’s funding, include the refurbishing and repainting of the Avoca State School in Bundaberg with $50,000 of funding; the creation of a new playground at the Sharon State School, which is able to proceed after receiving $33,000 from the Commonwealth; a new undercover area and playground as well as refrigerative airconditioning at the Wongarra State School, courtesy of a grant of $50,000; almost $30,000 worth of new floor covering for the Gladstone State High School; $50,000 worth of IT equipment for students to use at the Tannum Sands State High School; and a complete upgrade of playground equipment and a new school bus for the disabled kids of the Rosella Park School in Gladstone—a very special school, I might add—thanks to $73,000 from the Commonwealth.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">These are the sorts of projects that, though often desperately needed by schools, never make it into the priority lists of state government authorities. Normally they remain on schools’ wish lists, unless P&amp;Cs themselves are able to raise the money to do the work. The situation has not been helped by the fact that, under the Beattie government, each Queensland student receives nearly $600 a year less than the national average for students at state schools. On the other hand, the Australian government has increased funding to Queensland state schools and students to $603 million in 2005-06. This is an increase of around $43 million, or 7.6 per cent, over the past year and of $313 million, or 108 per cent, since we took office in 1996.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">On another positive note, I would like to pass on my congratulations to two outstanding young science students at St Luke’s Anglican School in Bundaberg: Luke Aaron and Julia Sullivan. Both Luke and Julia are in year 10 and have achieved a place in the highest ranks of the 2005 National Chemistry Quiz, coming in the top half per cent of entrants. More than 11,000 Queensland students took part in the quiz, with only 56 achieving the same or a better score than Luke and Julia. This is a fortnight when Australians from Perth have taken out the Nobel Prize for work on ulcers and another team from Brisbane has found a vaccine for cervical cancer, and these young people have a proud tradition to follow as their careers develop.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In the minute or two remaining, I commiserate with the member for Werriwa in his complaint about the Sydney City Council not honouring the Wests Tigers. Teams that make it to the Australian Rugby League grand final deserve recognition. The Wests Tigers and the Cowboys defied the odds and the critics and presented Australia with a very entertaining match. I congratulate both teams. I love watching the open play of the Cowboys; I think they are a marvellous team. Let me say to the Lord Mayor of Sydney that this would never have happened if the Broncos had won in Brisbane or the Cowboys had won in Townsville.</para>

<para>The Australian Government strongly condemns all destruction of religious sites and property that has occurred in Kosovo in recent years, and urges all concerned parties to ensure the appropriate restoration and rebuilding of damaged and destroyed sites.</para>
</item>
<item label="(7)">
<para>In the late 1990s it is estimated that over 200 mosques were destroyed or damaged in Kosovo.  As stated, the Australian Government strongly condemns all destruction of religious sites and property that has occurred.  The figure quoted of 200 new mosques being built is likely to include the restoration and repair of the existing mosques.  There are fewer entirely new mosques being constructed.  I understand that UNMIK has funds for assisting with religious sites, but progress has stalled due to the unstable political situation.  Some funding for the building and repair of some mosques has been from Wahhabist NGOs, and this has been the subject of some controversy within the Kosovo Muslim community. </para>
</item>
<item label="(8)">
<para>Regularisation of property ownership is a major problem in Kosovo, particularly due to the destruction of documents and dispossession of property by both Serbs and Albanians during in the 1998-2000 conflict.  There are undoubtedly large numbers of claims of various kinds made by numerous institutions and individuals.  I am not in a position to verify exact numbers of these complaints lodged with Kosovo authorities.</para>
