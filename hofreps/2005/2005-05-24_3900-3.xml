<para>—My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Does the minister recollect his March 2001 statement headed ‘Truss offers way forward on exceptional circumstances policy’ or his May 2002 statement headed ‘Federal government seeks to make EC support fairer’ or his April 2004 statement ‘National drought policy the way ahead’ or his May 2004 statement ‘Progress on drought reform’ or his July 2004 statement ‘Truss welcomes EC drought reform support’ or his December 2004 statement ‘Headway made on streamlining EC’ or perhaps even his April 2005 statement headed ‘Drought reform policy breakthrough’? When will the minister stop just issuing press releases and get farmers the help they desperately need?</para>

<para>—I welcome the fact that, for the first time in a very long time, we at last have a question from the opposition that has something to do with rural Australia. The drought that has been going for three to four years has finally dawned on the Leader of the Opposition, so welcome to the world. The reality is that the government have done more than any other to reform exceptional circumstances assistance, and we would have done a lot more if we could have had a bit of cooperation from the Labor states, most of which are now walking away entirely from drought assistance. The Victorian government are a classic example. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to show some compassion to farmers, I suggest that he first calls some of his state colleagues and asks the Victorian government why they terminated all of their drought assistance the moment their state election was over. Why did they cancel their assistance as soon as their state election was over? Why have Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia reduced their efforts?</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The reality is that we have sought to make significant reforms to the system, but we have had little or no cooperation from the states. In spite of that lack of cooperation, we have acted unilaterally to significantly improve the support available to farmers. We have done that by allowing such things as predictive modelling, so that declarations can be made earlier. We have changed the arrangements of boundaries for areas so that people are not locked out just because they are on the wrong side of the line. We have provided more generous and timely assistance. When the states would not cooperate, we acted unilaterally to provide assistance in December 2002 so that farmers could get immediate assistance. Even though we have tried—and we are still trying—to develop a drought reform system in cooperation with the states that will deliver meaningful assistance in a timely way, when the states have not cooperated we have still gone ahead, done our share and worked very hard with Australian farmers.</para>
<para>As I have said on a number of occasions, and as the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister indicated in western New South Wales just a few days ago, we will stand by farmers during these tough times. We know it is difficult. We know that they are enduring perhaps the worst drought in our nation’s history. We have demonstrated through the commitments we have already made that we will help farmers. We are prepared to do more, and we are working with industry organisations to achieve the very best possible results even when we cannot get cooperation from Labor states.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Mackellar for her question and for the interest she shows in what is happening in Bougainville and in Papua New Guinea more generally. Over this period—that is, since last Friday until 2 June—elections are taking place in Bougainville to elect an autonomous Bougainville government. The House should be aware that these elections are a momentous occasion in the history of Bougainville and more generally Papua New Guinea. The elections are particularly significant when one bears in mind the bloodshed caused in Papua New Guinea by a civil war over a significant period of time.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Around 130,000 people have registered to vote in Bougainville. This is a clear demonstration of the success of the peace process that has taken place there. I want to congratulate the government of Papua New Guinea, the leaders of Bougainville and the people of Bougainville on what they have done to take the peace process forward.</para>
<para>In answer to the honourable member’s question, I can say that we have had direct involvement in the elections in this one respect: we are participating in the United Nations-coordinated election observer mission on Bougainville, and we have provided $1 million to help with the election preparations. More importantly, it should not be forgotten that the government played a key role in bringing to an end the civil war in Bougainville and in facilitating the peace process. The Australian and the New Zealand governments were particularly important in assisting Papua New Guinea to bring peace to Bougainville following the Sandline crisis. This is one of the great achievements of Australia in recent years.</para>
<para>Let me conclude by saying that, since 1997, the Australian government has provided more than $180 million in assistance to support the peace process and post-conflict reconstruction on Bougainville, and many Australians have worked in the Bougainville Peace Monitoring Group and other, related organisations. We strongly support the election process and are committed to ensuring there is lasting peace and development in Bougainville.</para>

<para>—My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer him to the release last night of a three-year-old child from Villawood detention centre, where she has lived all her life. Prime Minister, does the government only release children from detention when it is shamed and embarrassed by headlines in overseas media? Prime Minister, will your government now act with compassion and adopt Labor’s policy so that children can live outside high-security razor wire detention centres?</para>

<para>—The answer to the first part of the question is no. The answer to the second part of the question is also no. I would point out to the Leader of the Opposition that there is already in the government’s policy, and has been for some time, provision for children to live outside of detention with their mothers. That has been the case now—and I will stand corrected on this—for some two to three years. Not every family faced with the option of the mother and the child or children living in the community chooses to separate themselves from the male parent in that family, and that, of course, is their decision.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Let me take the opportunity of saying to the Leader of the Opposition that the government continues to adhere to a policy of mandatory detention. It has been a central element of policy in this country from both sides of politics. We have already taken steps in relation to children. The decision taken last night, so I am advised, was a decision that was taken by the immigration department in its inherent administration of the immigration policy.</para>
<para>I want to take this opportunity of expressing my very strong support for Senator Vanstone’s administration of that portfolio. I express my very strong support for Amanda Vanstone’s administration of what is a very difficult portfolio. The Australian people have not forgotten the flip-flopping and the weakness of the Leader of the Opposition on border protection and immigration policy. I believe that the minister is administering this policy in a sensible and flexible fashion. She is trying to achieve the balance between compassion in appropriate cases and the maintenance of a very strong border protection and immigration policy underpinned by mandatory detention, which, I understand, remains the formal policy of the opposition—although it suits the opposition when the occasion strikes it to pretend in a narrowcast way to a section of the Australian community that it no longer supports mandatory detention. The minister will continue to administer a highly successful policy in a sensitive and compassionate manner.</para>

<para>—I thank the honourable member for Page for his question. I can tell him that this side of the House support tax cuts for all Australians commencing on 1 July this year. In particular, we will do that by cutting the 17 per cent marginal rate to 15 per cent. I made the point yesterday that the Labor Party opposes that and that it opposes any tax cut on 1 July. The member for Lilley took great objection to that and he scurried around and produced one of his press releases, which I, at least, read—I do not want those press releases to feel entirely lonely and orphaned! He took great objection to this. He said, ‘Oh, that’s not right. Labor’s proposal would see tax cuts on 1 July 2005.’ Do you know what they were? They were the government’s tax cuts from the last budget. I might have missed the last election, but I thought the Labor Party went to the last election saying that they were no good because they did not apply to people on under $52,000. Now they are an integral part of the Labor Party’s tax policy.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The second thing he said was that Labor’s plan gives you a $12 tax cut on 1 January 2006. As I said yesterday, if you are on $20,000, you do not get a $12-a-week tax cut. Of course you do not get a $12-a-week tax cut on $20,000. Again, it was completely false. The third thing he said—and get a load of this—was that senior Australians would benefit from Labor’s tax plan. I said yesterday that, because Labor are against cutting the lowest marginal rate, senior Australians would not get the benefit. The member for Lilley went out and said, ‘No, no, they will. Senior Australians will get the benefit because’—and get a load of this—‘senior Australians will be eligible for Labor’s welfare to work bonus.’ Can’t you see the Leader of the Opposition going through old age homes and, when people ask him, ‘Where’s my tax cut?’ him saying, ‘Well, if you only move off welfare into work, madam, you will be eligible for Labor’s welfare to work bonus’? This was a tax policy cobbled together out of nothing to try to relieve the Leader of the Opposition’s self-inflicted wounds. It changes on a daily basis.</para>
<para>That bill implementing the tax cuts will go through this parliament. If it does not go through this Senate, it will go through the Senate that takes its place on 1 July. The bill will be dated to take effect from 1 July. It will become law, even if it has to be passed by the new Senate; but, in order for people to get their tax cuts on 1 July, the withholding schedules, which have been prepared by the Commissioner of Taxation, must clear both houses of this parliament. Either house can disallow those withholding schedules. If the Senate should disallow the withholding schedules, that means that employers cannot operate the new withholding schedules from 1 July and people will not get their tax cut on 1 July.</para>
<para>The critical question for the Leader of the Opposition now becomes: will he be disallowing those withholding schedules, which will be tabled in the Senate when the Senate sits in about 2½ weeks time? Will he be disallowing them and throwing 850,000 businesses into confusion, denying people their tax cut, or will he allow those withholding schedules to go through? According to AAP the Labor caucus discussed this issue in their meeting. Bear in mind that the Labor Party is taking this great stand against tax cuts so that the Leader of the Opposition can show how strong he is on the issue. Here is the AAP report on what the caucus intends to do about the withholding schedules:</para>

<para class="block">This is the resolute Australian Labor Party: ‘We have resolutely determined today not to determine a position on this particular issue’! There are 850,000 businesses in Australia that need to know what to do on 1 July. I call on the Labor Party to determine to determine to have a determined position, determinately in favour of tax cuts! Get out of the way and let the tax cuts through.</para>

<para>—I was just answering a question. I am sorry you don’t feel that it ought to be, but there we are. My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to Cornelia Rau’s statement yesterday that she was treated like a caged animal in detention, to the callous treatment of Vivian Alvarez Solon and to the 32 other cases referred to the Palmer inquiry. Does the Prime Minister accept that the time has now come for a royal commission with full powers to investigate these matters? When will the minister responsible be held to account and sacked?</para>

<para>—I am aware of the contents of Cornelia Rau’s news conference yesterday. I have read reports of it. I did not see it, although I saw some excerpts from it on television last night. Clearly, the lady has been through a very difficult experience. I have acknowledged that repeatedly; spokesmen on behalf of the government and others have acknowledged that repeatedly. We do have an inquiry process underway. I can repeat what I have said before that, until the Palmer inquiry has reported, it is not the government’s intention to contemplate other things. When we have the report of the Palmer inquiry in, we can then assess all of the circumstances and give further attention to what might be done. At this stage, beyond repeating my previous expressions regarding this lady’s treatment, I do not intend to add anything. I think the sensible, measured, right thing to do—a thing that I suggest any government looking at this matter seriously would do—is to act as we have said.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In relation to Vivian Alvarez, I would like to take the opportunity, as the Leader of the Opposition has asked me a question about her, to repeat that the circumstances of that have been referred to Mr Palmer for inquiry and report. He has publicly indicated how he is going to handle that. In the meantime, as I think the Leader of the Opposition knows, a very experienced Centrelink officer from Darwin has been sent to the Philippines to talk to Vivian Alvarez and offer her assistance on behalf of the government. That person will have communicated the following offers of assistance immediately available to Vivian Alvarez: payment of her airfare and return airfares for an accompanying relative and/or nurse or carer, as assessed as appropriate in Manila; assistance from a reputable and experienced community agency to provide reception arrangements; accommodation and out-of-pocket expenses and assistance with finding and settling into longer term accommodation; the provision of a case manager to ensure that she has regular and ongoing access to advice and counselling as required; ensuring she is appropriately linked to other services, including income support, assistance, rent assistance, Medicare and counselling; and assessment for and arrangements to access medical and rehabilitation services, including the meeting of appropriate costs. That is what has been offered at present. Of course the lady is free to return to Australia. The question of when she returns and if any conditions are attached—</para>

<para>—Let me say this again: if any preconditions are attached to her return to Australia, they will be preconditions of her choosing, not of the government’s. The government have made it perfectly clear that we will do everything proper to facilitate, assist and support Ms Alvarez’s return to Australia. We are offering these things and, when we have further advice from Mr Palmer about the circumstances of her detention, depending on that advice we will have something further to say. I understand the keenness of the opposition to attack the government over this—oppositions do that. I simply want to say that it is a very unfortunate situation. Something plainly has gone wrong, but until we have available the report of Mr Palmer I am not going to start prejudging the situation. I simply say again that the minister, Senator Amanda Vanstone, continues to enjoy my very strong support.</para>

I can inform him that if the withholding schedules are not disallowed by the Australian Labor Party then every Australian can have a tax cut on 1 July 2005—which is great news.

<para>—It is because it is the perfect answer to the meretricious nonsense that the Treasurer has gone on with in the course of this question time. The simple fact of the matter is that if you accept our amendments seven million Australians will get $12 a week, not the derisory, contemptible $6 you have offered them while personally pocketing $65 a week. That is why: because we on this side of the House stand for a bit of tax justice for seven million Australians who, in the course of the last five years, with this alleged tax cut of yours you propose to give $10 while you award your backbench $120. We regard this as unacceptable for the Australian people. Those seven million Australians—those nurses, those truckies, those people on the waterfront and on the building sites—worked for the wealth of this country, and they deserve a decent tax cut. You have denied them that tax cut, and the moment that you give them that tax cut you will get your legislation.</para>

<para>—If Labor’s tax cuts go through in the next couple of weeks, average Australian families will find themselves in a situation where they are $1,800 better off if they happen to be dual income families, or nearly $1,000 better off if they happen to be single income families. They will be able to use those resources to pay for petrol, to pay for the rise in interest rates under this government, to pay for the various things they need—not your indulgences, their needs. That is what will happen if Labor’s tax cuts go through. The Treasurer invites us to bow down and worship at his altar of a $6 tax cut when he has already presided over, as a result of the policy he pursued last year, an $8 a week rise for the average mortgagee. Minus $2 is what the Treasurer offers the average mortgagee in Western Sydney.</para>

<para>So, Treasurer, you have some very simple options here. You want the Labor Party’s support for your legislation. You can get it very easily. You can sacrifice that $24 billion you have decided to whack off the bottom line of your budget in order to pay for giant tax cuts for your backbench—both in their superannuation and in their income tax—to further your leadership ambitions. You can sacrifice that for the seven million people who put you there and whom you have treated with such arrogance, not only in this budget but also in previous budgets. But if you do not accept what we have to say, Mr Treasurer, perhaps we may shame you into a position where you never do this to ordinary middle-income taxpayers again. And we will fight to change your behaviour.</para>

<para>—I thank the honourable member for his question. I inform the House that Japan submitted plans to the scientific committee of the International Whaling Commission to expand its so-called scientific whaling program in the Southern Ocean. That plan would double its take of minke whales to 935 and for the first time include fin and humpback whales. The government strongly opposes all forms of commercial and scientific whaling. Let me make that absolutely clear. And we always have done. In all the time we have been in office we have opposed—and I think the previous government probably did too—this type of whaling; in fact, we have opposed all types of whaling. While stock numbers remain under threat it is clear that Japan’s whaling program simply cannot be described as science. The Prime Minister made known Australia’s opposition to Japan’s plans during his recent visit to Japan and, more importantly, has written to Prime Minister Koizumi urging Japan to reconsider its proposal.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>On my instructions, our ambassador in Tokyo has also raised Australia’s concern and our embassy in Tokyo is coordinating joint representations to the Japanese with other anti-whaling governments. Quite a few governments, I believe, will participate in this demarche. We will be working with anti-whaling nations at next month’s International Whaling Commission meeting in Korea to urge Japan to cease altogether the scientific whaling program. Diplomacy and the force of argument are the best hope we have of being successful. The member for Griffith has suggested we use the leverage of our aid to a country like the Solomon Islands in order to get the Solomon Islands to change their position.</para>

<para>—There is distinction between the application of that legislation and the circumstances of the case. The reason why we have not intervened in the manner I think implied by the member for Grayndler is that the strong legal advice we have is that our claim over the waters off the Antarctic, which are the subject of our claim, is not recognised by Japan. It is not a claim that is recognised by a lot of other countries, and in those circumstances, on our advice, the sort of action sought would not be supported by international law.</para>

<para>—My attention has been drawn to some very interesting statements made by the member for Grayndler in the House last night, to some made by the Leader of the Opposition, and then to some again made by the member for Grayndler. They call into question the seriousness of the commitment I thought the Leader of the Opposition had made last week when he went to Tasmania to support in full the agreement I signed with the Tasmanian Premier. The truth is that last night here in the parliament it was very clear from the speech made by the member for Grayndler—for whom the member for Lyons has a very endearing and memorable expression—that he did not regard the agreement that I signed with the Tasmanian Premier as going far enough. He in fact wanted us to go a great deal further. The member for Lyons no doubt would have listened to that speech with a great deal of interest, because, unlike the member for Grayndler, the member for Lyons does have an interest in the jobs of hardworking Tasmanians.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It was quite clear from the speech made by the member for Grayndler last night that he was in conflict with what I thought had been the views expressed by the Leader of the Opposition when he was in Tasmania last week. But this morning at a doorstop the Leader of the Opposition seemed to me to be endeavouring to back away a bit from what he had said last week. Instead of expressing fulsome support, he was talking about a glass being only half full. In other words, he was walking both sides of the street. On the one hand, last week in Tasmania, surrounded by all those timber workers, he supported the agreement. But that all changes when a bit of heat is put on him by the member for Grayndler—fancy allowing the member for Grayndler to corner you on a policy issue. The Leader of the Opposition has answered a lot of questions today, and I have one more question for him so he can clear this matter up. At the end of question time today he can get up and very simply tell the House whether or not, if Labor were to win the next election, it would be the intention of a Beazley Labor government to renegotiate in any way the agreement that I signed with the Tasmanian Premier.</para>

<para>—As I think the member for Griffith would understand on an issue like this, when we are dealing with a nation that is a close friend of Australia and that is very important to Australia for a whole variety of reasons, one does not jump to the next move that one might consider making without having exhausted other moves. The sensible thing for this government to do, and what the government intends to do, is to continue to pursue a diplomatic path. You never completely rule things out but, I have to say, taking legal action against Japan in the International Court of Justice would be a very significant thing to do.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We will continue to pursue the diplomatic path. That diplomatic path also involves, of course, taking the matter to the International Whaling Commission and arguing our case there. It is not, I believe, productive for this country to adopt an arm’s length belligerence towards Japan. It makes no sense. It is not more likely to get a result. It is far more likely to get a result if we pursue the matter in a diplomatic fashion. And if, on the basis of those results, we believe that some further action is necessary then we will give consideration to it. I think the action that is currently being taken is the right action.</para>

<para class="block">They were the predictions made nine years ago about our then industrial relations reform. Fast-forward to today, Mr Speaker, and have a look at what has happened. Real wages have risen by 14 per cent versus 1.2 per cent. Unemployment is at a 30-year low. The profit share is at a historical high. The strength of the Australian economy is the envy of the industrialised world. The living standards of Australian workers have never been higher than they are under the policies that those opposite predicted nine years ago were going to destroy the fabric of our society.</para>
<para>I remind the Australian public of those predictions, because undoubtedly, when we release our reforms in the next few days, the same predictions will be made. They will be just as false; they will be just as exaggerated; they will be based on scaremongering and not on fact; and they will be proved by the passage of time to be the complete falsehood and deception of the Australian people that the arguments of nine years ago were. Those opposite have been found to be political fraudsters at the bar of public opinion over the last nine years, as they will be over the years ahead.</para>

Could I remind the House that the Leader of the Opposition said in 1996 that the Workplace Relations Act was ‘attacking the very basis of people’s living standards’. And what did he say just last week? He said that the government’s objective with industrial relations is not reform but suppression of wages. What we are getting is the same old, sad litany of tales from the opposition. They are saying the things that they said in 1995 and 1996.

<para>—My question is to the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. Can the minister confirm that she has sent to the electorate offices a letter regarding $1.5 million for community funding in relation to the Victory in the Pacific Day commemorations? Given the importance of this day, 15 August, when will the minister also forward the details of the proposed program, including the appropriate guidelines and funding processes? Can the minister also guarantee that all members and senators will receive this information at the same time and that no members or senators from the government have already received this information?</para>

<para>—The member is quite right. I heard his speech the other day and I will refer to that shortly. It is correct to say that we are going to commemorate victory in the Pacific. We on this side of the House respect our veterans and 60 years after the Second World War we want to pay tribute to their tremendous contribution to this nation’s freedom and democracy.</para>

<para>I sent out a letter to all members of parliament that encourages local members to work with their community and ex-service groups to prepare a proposal to commemorate victory in the Pacific in August. As the letter says, the detailed guidelines will follow. They are presently with the minister for finance and he is going to check off on them. As my letter says, I will be making them available to all members of parliament. However, I am interested in the comments of the member for Oxley yesterday. He claims that he had insufficient information and could not proceed. But he has an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Queensland Times</inline> titled ‘VP Day party fund’. It says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Community groups are being encouraged to apply for funding to hold activities to celebrate the 60th anniversary of victory in the Pacific. The federal electorate of Oxley has been allocated $10,000 of $1.5 million to be eligible if projects need to promote community participation, give recognition to World War II veterans and heighten public awareness.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I notice this has not held the member for Oxley back at all. I am pleased to see that he, like every other member of parliament, is seeking advice from his ex-service organisations to make sure this commemoration is memorable. This is another attempt by the Labor Party to denigrate our commemorations program for our veterans.</para>

The ruling is to the effect that there are limits as to what can be said about a group of members. The precedents that are there are clearly in line with what the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs just said. There can be no more offensive assertion in this place than that individual members of this parliament do not support veterans. I ask that that be withdrawn.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Moore for his question. I appreciate his efforts,  both as a general practitioner in Perth and as a public health advocate, to reduce the rate of smoking in Australia. Smoking is one of the greatest avoidable causes of early death and chronic disease. This government has already spent some $24 million on antismoking campaigns. We will shortly be introducing graphic health warnings on cigarette packets. Thanks to the good work of health educators, supported by government policy, Australia’s smoking rate has fallen from 22 per cent in 1998 to just 17 per cent today. It is the lowest on record and it is one of the lowest in the world. But it is still too high, especially amongst young people. About one-third of 16- to 17-year-olds smoke. I am afraid to say that about half of those people who begin to smoke during adolescence will ultimately die of a smoking related disease.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I am pleased to say that in the recent budget the government committed an additional $25 million over four years for further antismoking campaigns targeting young people and some $4 million to try to reduce the incidence of smoking during pregnancy. These are further judicious investments by the Howard government in health care and disease prevention. When this government sees a problem, it acts to address the problem. We never go around determined not to determine a position. We never go around decided to be undecided. We never go around, like the Leader of the Opposition, resolved to be irresolute.

<para>—I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. Everyone on this side, including the member for La Trobe, believes in three things in schooling: national consistency, national high quality and choice in education—choosing to send your child to a Catholic, independent or government school. The government in the budget this year has increased funding to Australian schools by $8½ billion. That is an eight per cent increase for government schools and a seven per cent increase for Catholic and independent schools. In fact this year this government has increased funding for capital works in Australian schools by a staggering 29 per cent in one year. It is worth reflecting on the fact that, had the Labor Party won the election last year, the funding increase for Catholic and independent schools after the Labor Party had taken government would not have been seven per cent—it would have been 3½ per cent.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I am asked about other policies. It is well known that the Australian Labor Party went to last year’s election led by Mr Latham arguing that it would take money from Australian parents and their children who make sacrifices to send their kids to Catholic and independent schools. One hundred and seventy-eight Australian schools, Catholic and independent, were to have their funding cut or frozen, taking $520 million out of those schools over a four-year period. That was the policy the Labor Party took to the election, and no doubt we will be reminded of that in the inaugural Latham lecture.</para>
<para>I notice the Labor Party has been getting some advice on the policy. On 27 April this year the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper reported a speech by Mr Bill Shorten, President of the Australian Workers Union. It says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">On education, Mr Shorten slammed the ALP’s policy under failed leader Mark Latham for taking money away from ... private schools, saying Bob Hawke “would have thrown out this silly idea in a few seconds”.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I then noticed that in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on 19 May the Victorian Premier, Mr Steve Bracks, has also given some advice to the Labor Party federally. It says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Premier Steve Bracks has urged the federal ALP to scrap its contentious “hit list” of private schools that would suffer funding cuts under a federal Labor government.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I notice in the story that it then says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">In response to Mr Bracks’ comments yesterday, federal Labor’s education spokeswoman, Jenny Macklin, said the party was sticking with the policy approach.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In other words, the Labor Party is committed to a policy that says to the parents of the 1.1 million children in Catholic and independent schools that a Labor government will remove funding that supports the education of their children. It needs to be remembered in this place that the Labor Party’s determination to stop Australian working families from getting a tax cut is matched only by its determination to cut the funding for the education of their children. So long as the member for La Trobe remains in the seat that he is in, and every member on this side, this government will protect and defend choice in Australian education and the rights of parents to make sacrifices for their children.</para>

<para>—Can I simply say that I have spent the last nine or more years look-ing a lot of Australian workers very directly in the eye. I have had my share of encourag-ing responses and my share of rebukes. I will go on, as has been my wont over the last 9¼ years, meeting as many Australians as I can, looking them in the face and explaining policies. When I talk to Australian workers and to the seven million Australians to whom the member has referred, I tell them of the 14 per cent increase in their real wages, I tell them of the fact that unemployment is at a 30-year low, I tell them that they are saving $500 a month on average on their mortgage and I tell them that the opportunities for their young sons and daughters to get jobs is much greater than it was 10 years ago. I remind them of the benefits they have had out of the tax changes that we have undertaken. I remind them, as I take the liberty of reminding the member who asked me the question, that if you aggregate all of the personal income tax cuts that have occurred under this government, you would find that the greatest percentage reductions have been given to the lowest income earners, which makes an absolute nonsense of this.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The final piece of advice I would give to the member who asked me that question is that she ought to go out in her own electorate and honestly look that same representative sample of seven million Australians in the eye and ask them the question: do they feel better or worse off under this government? If she is honest with herself and honest with this House, she will acknowledge that they will say that they are better off under this government and that this government has been a better friend of the workers of the Hunter Valley than any previous Labor government.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Barker for his question. Last week in Sydney I co-chaired the ninth Joint Ministerial Committee meeting with my ministerial counterpart from India, Minister Kamal Nath, where we focused on the bilateral relationship between Australia and India. India, a country with a population of 1.1 billion people, 1.1 billion consumers, has an economy that is growing rapidly, almost as quickly as China’s, as is our trading relationship with India. At the moment that trading relationship consumes about $6 billion worth of Australia’s exports.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We agreed last week that we would develop and negotiate a trade and economic framework between Australia and India to take advantage of the many bilateral agreements that are in place between Australia and India now such as the Investment Protection and Promotion Agreement, the Double Taxation Agreement and many others. That trade and economic framework will take our commercial relationship with India to a new level and take advantage of the already strong trading relationship with India and also the growing disposable income that 1.1 billion Indians have in that growth economy.</para>
<para>I also note the rare occasions when we get support from the opposition on some of our policies, and we have support from the opposition on our free trade agreement negotiations with China. I thank the opposition spokesman on trade for that and urge him and the Labor Party to also support the position we are taking with enhancing and deepening the relationship with India.</para>
<para>The member for Hotham has been quite courageous in taking on the left-wing elements of the industrial wing of the Australian Labor Party so that he can argue good policy in negotiating an FTA with China. He should have been there when we were negotiating with the United States. I am sure he will support us as we negotiate with India. But the challenge is going to be for the Leader of the Opposition to get in and protect him against some of the thugs in the Victorian industrial wing of the Australian Labor Party. If we look at the meetings that took place over the weekend and some of the reporting of what the member for Hotham was subjected to because he took a principled stance on good policy, the Leader of the Opposition should get in and protect him in his seat. Some of the lesser elements of the Labor Party were said to say:</para>

When the honourable member for Richmond asked her question of the Leader of the Opposition it appeared that the microphones either were not turned on or were very low.

<para>—Mr Speaker, I have a question to you. During question time the Leader of the Opposition sought leave to answer a question that was posed to him by the Prime Minister. On my recollection of events, it was you, Mr Speaker, who refused leave to the Leader of the Opposition, not the Leader of the House. Mr Speaker, I draw your attention to standing order 63 in relation to leave. It says:</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Banks. He will be aware that the Leader of the Opposition sought leave during question time. Since question time is just that, a question to a member other than a minister can only be accepted by the chair if it falls within a fairly narrow confine. Clearly that question did not fall within the confines of the standing orders, so it was out of order as far as seeking leave was concerned, because the question itself was out of order. I would also remind the member for Banks that, if he objects to a ruling, it should be raised at the point at which it occurs, not subsequently.</para>

<para>—Mr Speaker, further to the matter raised by the member for Banks, I ask you to reflect upon the answer you have given. As long as you are going to allow ministers to pose questions to the Leader of the Opposition in answers—which seems to me to be a serious challenge in the nature of it—if you say the question is out of order, then you should not be allowing ministers to propose them. But, if you are allowing them to propose them, you should be allowing people to seek leave to answer them. You cannot do both of those things. I understand that you can either refuse the question and the answer or allow the question and the answer, but you cannot allow the question and refuse the answer. I understand that that is a complex point and I do not ask for an answer today, but I would ask you to reflect upon the matter raised by the member for Banks and perhaps give some further consideration to that matter.</para>

<para>—The member for Cowan asked me a question about openings and officiation at government funded events. It would probably be helpful if I explained to the House how this actually works. Where the federal government has provided more than 50 per cent of the value of the project, it is a requirement of the funding that the federal government will have a representative that officiates at the opening. If less than 50 per cent of the funding is provided by the federal government, the school or the institution will then invite the person it chooses to officiate at the opening. A non-government representative is perfectly entitled to be invited to, attend and address any opening or function.</para>

<para>—It is appropriate for this issue to be addressed at this time of the parliamentary sitting, particularly given the circumstances of the government, with the cabinet considering drought aid to the farming community. This matter of public importance will give everybody in this parliament the opportunity to articulate the problems, as they see them, in rural Australia. Without a doubt, this is the most tragic drought that this nation has seen in living memory and it should be treated as such. This is a natural disaster of a magnitude that this country has not seen. It is impacting on an industry that traditionally has been, and hopefully will be into the future, a very important part of the Australian economy. It is also an issue, as I think was recognised by the Prime Minister late last week when he visited country Australia, that has much to do with the integrity of inland Australia.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>A number of questions I think need to be raised in this matter of public importance debate. I am pleased that I was able to attend the drought rally in Parkes last week. The minister for agriculture was also there, as was the shadow minister and a number of other parliamentarians, including the member for Calare. At that meeting there was an outpouring of emotion and fact in relation to the particular circumstances and feelings of individuals in some parts of Australia—not in all parts of Australia, which I think is one of the things that the media particularly has difficulty with in coming to grips with this particular issue. Drought is not some sort of amorphous mass that occurs simultaneously in all areas. It occurs in smaller areas and then becomes greater. It occurs in some areas and does not occur in others. So there are different circumstances within the nation. However, I believe that there are certain areas, particularly in New South Wales but also in other states, where this is the worst drought in living memory.</para>
<para>I thought the meeting at Parkes was well organised and I congratulate the President of the New South Wales Farmers Association, Mal Peters, for the way that meeting was conducted. I would also thank Alan Jones, the noted broadcaster, and Jeff Kennett, the former Victorian Premier, for their contributions. However, it is a great shame that the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and some members of the cabinet were not there to listen to what Mr Jones and Mr Kennett had to say—Mr Jones in terms of the drought and the impact on individuals, and Jeff Kennett particularly in relation to the mental trauma and impact that it is having on many individuals in the farm sector—and to individuals within the farm community who also made a contribution that day: real people sending real messages to government. I think it was a mistake for the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister not to attend. But, having said that, I should add that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry was there, as was the shadow minister, and they both listened intently—although I think the minister for agriculture had to leave at lunchtime.</para>
<para>A number of issues were raised and I will run through them; I think they have been articulated in the press over the last week. One thing encapsulated by the meeting was that we have to determine what the objective of drought policy is, and I do not think that has been done well in recent years. Looking at what people say they want rather than getting into the specifics of it, the overall objective, as I measure it, is in a sense to freeze-frame the financial position in which primary producers are placed in areas where exceptional climatic events are responsible for circumstances where they cannot create any income. Their financial position should be freeze-framed so that, when the drought breaks, they—and I am not talking about all farmers—will emerge from it in circumstances that will enable them once again to enhance the Australian economy productively.</para>
<para>A number of things were intimated at the meeting regarding how to enable that to happen. One was that the Commonwealth should take over exceptional circumstances arrangements, or whatever it is called, into the future. I think we saw here again today the old state-Commonwealth debate. If you are in a state parliament, it is the Commonwealth that is on the wrong side of the fence; and if you are in this parliament it is ‘blame the states’ day. I do not think it does much good for the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry to come out with that debate again and again. To overcome that, the Commonwealth should take full control of exceptional circumstances arrangements. The Commonwealth can do that; it has the funding arrangements necessary for doing it. In a range of policy decisions in recent weeks, it has intimated that it can put certain conditions on the granting of moneys to the states. If the Commonwealth feels strongly enough about drought in this country—the worst drought in living memory—perhaps it is about time it started to put conditions on the release of other moneys, to make up for what it believes should be made available by the states for drought and to call a halt to the tennis match. I think the Commonwealth is more than happy for the tennis match to continue so that it can play its anti-Labor games, but I do not think the farm sector is particularly interested in the games that are played by people in this place.</para>
<para>Other initiatives people were looking at were cash grants, changes to the exceptional circumstances criteria and a re-evaluation of off-farm income in relation to exceptional circumstances arrangements. An anomaly at the moment with exceptional circumstances funding is the way weather factors are judged, and a change to weather station criteria is needed. There are a number of other issues that also need to be addressed. Depreciation for silos and storage for fodder and drought-proofing of properties is still running at five per cent. It is important that that be addressed, particularly in light of things that can be read in Productivity Commission reports about assistance to other industries.</para>
<para>Issues also need to be addressed other than those raised specifically at the Parkes meeting. One, which I think is the most important, is whether we want agriculture in Australia. Does this parliament want agriculture? Does this parliament want an inland Australia? If so, it is going to have to change the policy mix that has emanated from this place for probably 15 years. The policy mix coming out of this place is reflected in competition policy and various other policies coming through, not the least of which is the reluctance of the government to embrace ethanol and create productive jobs in country Australia. Those sorts of policies can have a real effect on employment and the wellbeing of country communities.</para>
<para>There has to be a decision made in this place: do we want agriculture? If you relate the principles of competition policy to food, as we have to natural resource management and natural resource issues, the answer is no. That is an appalling answer. Relating that theory to food production means that you can bring food into this country, even though it is coming from other markets and corrupt world markets, and that the food can come in more cheaply than we can produce it. I think that is an appalling situation not only for the farm community but for all other communities as well. We saw what happened with the sugar industry—investment and a change of policy could have preserved the sugar industry, not as a major competitor with Brazil on the corrupt world sugar market but as a real contributor to clean fuel by way of ethanol. A number of other policy initiatives need to be addressed in those circumstances.</para>
<para>The other issue I would like to touch on is that of industry support. The <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> has an editorial today entitled ‘A drought of ideas on helping farmers’, and it has another article quoting Senator elect Barnaby Joyce about tax reform. I note that the member for Parkes is the only National Party member in the chamber. The Deputy Prime Minister is not here. Drought, a key issue, was not mentioned in the budget; John Anderson issued two lines the next day in relation to drought. One National Party person is attending to this matter of public importance.</para>
<para>The argument from many, including some in the press, in relation to industry support is that the agriculture industry should be left to the market, that there has been too much support: ‘If you cannot compete, go away. We live in a global world and that is the way it is.’ As to Peter Cullen’s ultimate insult this morning on <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> I thought, ‘Well, some people in the western division are getting old, so they might just die and go away!’</para>
<para>This has been the worst drought in living memory. When you look at support and break down the figures, you see that—other than unemployment relief, which all Australians are entitled to if they are not earning an income—for this worst drought in history, for which people are assuming millions of dollars have gone to the farm sector, there has been $237 million in the last three years in interest rate support. They are the figures I can obtain, and I stand to be corrected.</para>
<para>When the GST came out in 2001, the building industry said that the price of houses was going to go up by 10 per cent. There was an industry problem, and that was recognised by the government. Since then, the building industry has received $5.2 billion in support—that is over $1 billion annually—by way of the first home owners grant. I am not whingeing about the first home owners grant. But people should not come in here and say, and they should not say in the press, that the farmers of Australia are ripping the taxpayer off. Over $2 billion in 2003-04 went to the car industry, and I am not whingeing about that at all. But with $237 million over three years for the worst drought in history, with the farming community being put in a position where it is seen to be going to the begging bowl again, I think saying such things is a gross misrepresentation of the real facts. Look at unemployment benefits for one year—$5.1 billion in helping people. I am not whingeing about that either. The Productivity Commission’s report in December 2004, after talking about there being $11 billion worth of support for other industries, says that ‘measured assistance to agricultural industries remains low’. However, we have editorials such as that in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> this morning making some important points but leaving the message with the urban community that we are sick of putting millions and billions of dollars out to the farm sector. The hypocrisy of that is something that I do not adhere to.</para>
<para>We have seen a number of issues over recent years in relation to industry support. We have seen the debacle with improving Australia’s water problems. Since 1995, when competition policy allowed for property rights to be recognised, we have had the handing-out of money to the states by this government, and every time it was saying that property rights, for instance, would be recognised and that there would be a properly constituted market for water. None of those things has happened. Now we have—what do they call it now?—the Living Murray initiative, the watering Australia initiative or whatever it is making all these grandiose promises once again that we have seen over the last decade.</para>
<para>There is a solution to this problem in the long term, in my view, and that is by way of a national natural disaster fund where a source of money is accumulated over a period of time and used under certain criteria, whether it be for city disasters such as the Wollongong mudslide, the earthquake in Newcastle or Cyclone Tracy or for a drought of this magnitude. You avoid the state-federal issue and you avoid the closeness of an election or the marginality of a seat. The mechanism is triggered and the money is released for those in need. When people say, ‘You cannot afford to do that,’ remind them of the $237 million over three years we have spent. Just remember that.</para>
<para>A dollar a week from all Australians raises $1 billion in a year. When you analyse all the disasters that have happened in Australia since 1974, only one cost $1 billion in one year—the Newcastle earthquake. Normally disasters in Australia, whether city based or rural based, cost about $100 million to $200 million a year—10c to 20c a week. I think that is pretty good insurance for people when an unsuspected climatic event invades their privacy and upsets their potential not only to live but to be productive citizens for the future. They are the sorts of initiatives that I believe cabinet should be considering. There is enormous opportunity to look at those issues as well as the broader climate change issues of pollution in the air, and I referred to ethanol earlier. What we have to do—and I urge the parliament to bear this in mind—is to freeze-frame the economic position of agriculture to allow the farm sector to have the capacity to be productive when the drought breaks. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—There are a lot of things you would like to talk about in parliament, but I wish the reason did not exist to talk about this one. As somebody who not only has probably the most drought-affected electorate in Australia but who actually is a farmer and lives that same drought, probably as much as or more than most farmers in New South Wales, it is a horrendous issue to deal with—it a horrendous social issue and it is a horrendous economic issue at all levels. I will come back to that a little later.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In October 2002, well over 2½ years ago, the Deputy Prime Minister and I asked the Prime Minister to come out to see the drought first-hand. Really, we thought the drought had been going on a long time then. The Deputy Prime Minister and the Prime Minister came out to Cobar and saw—and I am talking 2½ years ago—just how devastating the drought was and, because of that, exceptional circumstances was brought on earlier than it otherwise might have been.</para>
<para>It was no great joy to have to request those two people to come out once again. They went to quite an area of western New South Wales last Friday. It does do a lot not just because people realise government is determined, despite the states not cooperating, to do more for them in drought circumstances; it does a lot for the morale of people out there to see the two leaders of this nation go out to places they have never been to together before. In the case of Lake Cargelligo, no Prime Minister had been there before and the last time a Deputy Prime Minister was there was when I was 20 years old—so that is a couple of years ago!</para>
<para>What it does is make people realise that, as the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister have said in the last week, we intend to make sure that as many farmers and as many towns as possible get through this situation as fairly and with as much support as we can possibly provide for them. Obviously, in the next few days, the results of the government’s and cabinet’s deliberations will be made known, because quite obviously the Commonwealth does have to provide this extra assistance on its own—not that we have not provided assistance and not that we have not provided a lot of assistance. Thus far, we have committed well over $1 billion and we have spent well over $640 million. In New South Wales, which is obviously the worst-affected state, around $317 million has already been spent in various ways. We spend a lot on household support and we spend extraordinary amounts on interest rate subsidies, but there are other things too. Health care cards become available to those so affected and so eligible and Abstudy and Austudy is easier to get. The Commonwealth makes it possible for people to get a range of things.</para>
<para>There is more than one element to drought and its effects. Certainly it has an economic effect. It affects the GDP enormously, as the Treasurer has pointed out over the last few years, and we are in uncharted territory—that is totally true. However, the personal impact on families is enormous. In my experience—and I have seen a few droughts, but without doubt this is the most onerous and the most ongoing—the effect on individual families is just horrendous. You surely have to take your hat off to and recognise the role that the women on the farms—the wives and mothers, especially—play in keeping families going through this. They seem to focus more on the family situation, whereas the men, by and large, drop their heads and probably work harder. The women face up to the everyday reality and the stresses that come on every family, which are absolutely horrendous.</para>
<para>Financial counsellors, which are 50 per cent funded by this government, have to be extraordinary people, because they have to be personal and family counsellors as well as financial counsellors. It is no fun dealing with a family that has reached the end of its tether and does not know where it can go. That is why we have thus far spent the money we have. Warren Truss has tried now basically for five years to get the states to review the way we do exceptional circumstances. If we had been able to do that, then probably we would not have to take the measures solely as the Commonwealth that we are obviously going to take probably over the next few days.</para>
<para>Australia is no stranger to drought. Unfortunately we have a dry continent and we have to deal with that. There have been major droughts before. There was a seven-year drought in the 1890s. There was a serious drought in 1914-15, when there was virtually no wheat produced in Australia. There was the 1937-45 drought, when the rivers stopped running certainly around the Murray-Darling region. There was the 1965-68 drought, the first one I remember with startling clarity. Then we had the short but absolutely drastic drought of 1982-83.</para>
<para>The difference this time is that it is just going on and on. From mid-2002 to now is a long time. The Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister met the Hoskins family at Kikoira. They have not been able to grow a crop with any profit for at least three years. They bought some extra land, which was a good commercial decision at the time. They are a young family, in their 30s, with five children. They are wonderful farmers—you could not see a better run farm. But they obviously are at the end of their tether, having to provide well over $1,000 a week to feed sheep and having to feed the family and do all those things. Meeting financial commitments is the thing that hits a family first. Then, obviously, there is the family situation itself, which, as I said, by and large people deal with, but it is damn hard and the women play a heck of the role in keeping the family going.</para>
<para>It is not just farms, obviously—it is the towns running out of water. Lake Cargelligo, which has never in my lifetime been dry, is just about dry now. That is happening around New South Wales. Goulburn has only got about five weeks water left, and we have places like Ivanhoe, which has to cart water from outside because they have run out of water. I cannot remember that happening before, even though Ivanhoe is basically out in the far west.</para>
<para>We are in the process of addressing the most long-running drought of all time, certainly in my time. It is a big statement to say that this is the greatest drought of all time. I do not remember the one that finished in 1902, but it must have been pretty horrific. We have to make the incredible effort that we are making as a nation. I did hear the member for New England make a couple of incredible statements a while ago. One was that we should take absolutely no notice of what the states do. The only reason this government is in a position to do more than the over $1 billion that has already been committed is that we are good managers. If we simply let the states opt out of every single responsibility that they want to opt out of, we are not going to have the money to do the sorts of things we are doing—and the things we will announce shortly—to help people in country areas through drought. It is ridiculous to say that we should take no notice of what the states do. Of course we have to make them play their role.</para>
<para>I would like to read from a press release that the state minister for agriculture in New South Wales put out prior to going to Parkes last Tuesday:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">My message to the farmers will be clear: the NSW Government has spent $150 million so far and we will keep spending ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">They certainly will. In fact, in the budget brought down at 12 o’clock this afternoon by Andrew Refshauge, the state Treasurer, they have budgeted about $16½ million, not for the next year but for the next two years. It is a huge effort; you have to congratulate them. In actual fact, in the next fortnight the Commonwealth government will spend as much as the New South Wales government will spend in the next 12 months.</para>
<para>That is an incredible situation. Yet we have the member for New England saying, ‘Take no notice of the states.’ By default, I guess we can’t. But if we had not done the economic job we have done, we would not have the money to do these things. We put in things like Regional Partnerships, Regional Solutions and Networking the Nation, which are great programs that are helping rural Australia at this time—the ones that are being denigrated by the member for Brand and his cohorts as being a rip-off. In the middle of the worst drought ever, they want to get rid of  the most popular program in country Australia. Aren’t they a wonderful example?</para>
<para>I have to admit, though, that it was great to see, as was brought to our attention by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry earlier today, that the member for Brand does realise that there is a drought on—he actually mentioned it today. As a matter of fact, if he were not spending so much time running around looking at real estate in Sydney, perhaps he would have time to get out into the country where it is happening and have a look at it.</para>
<para>I will talk about what we are committing to and what the state government of New South Wales is committing to. I will get to Queensland, Victoria and others in a minute. People talk about $150 million that they believe New South Wales has put towards the drought so far. Mr Deputy Speaker, let me tell you something: we have put $600-odd million in, of which I think $317 million is for New South Wales. Their $150 million includes $41 million of normal ongoing funding, which is simply for the special conservation scheme that is always there. If that is the case, do we want to walk around skiting about what we have forgone in the same period from farm managed deposits? What Treasury forgoes there is nearly $900 million. But that is not what we are talking about when we talk about what we have spent.</para>
<para>I doubt very much that the state government has actually spent the amount that is being claimed. When they count these things, they count the wages of their public servants. They count every damn thing you could think of except the cash they give to people. The figures we mentioned are all cash that goes to farmers to help keep them on the land and to help keep the families sane. What we recognised, when John Anderson and John Howard came out on Friday, was that yes, despite the fact that we cannot drag the rest of the governments around Australia along with us, we are going to do more.</para>
<para>In reply to a question the other day as to what Queensland are spending, they could not actually answer. The minute the proud Victorians won an election, they stopped spending a cent—not one zack. The minute we put exceptional circumstances in there we start taking the brunt of it. I wonder whether everybody realises that, of the money that goes in, all of the household support is from the Commonwealth and 90 per cent of the interest subsidy is from the Commonwealth. When you actually go out to speak to the people—</para>

Perhaps they were aided and abetted by the Independents—I don’t know—but the members opposite have single-handedly brought the ethanol industry to a standstill and put false ideas into ordinary motorists’ heads about what it does and does not do to their motors. In actual fact it is perfectly capable of being used in almost every motor. There are few people in this House that I believe can speak about drought and dealing with it in the same way that I am.</para>

I think it is instructive that we observe that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has failed to come into this House to debate this matter of public importance today. Furthermore, when we looked around this House we saw one member of the National Party in the chamber while the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services delivered his speech.

He is a decent man, but where were the others and where was the minister for agriculture? We had the member for Farrer here, so the Liberal Party was represented, but the National Party minister and his colleagues could not make it into this place to debate this matter. I say to the honourable member for Parkes: I got a phone call from a farmer who said, ‘Yes, we saw you were there; you came into the tent,’ and he was talking about me. But he said, ‘The member for Parkes never came inside the tent.’ That is very instructive. You front up, get around with the Prime Minister and get the photo opportunities—</para>

<para>—but when it comes to fronting farmers on this very important issue you go missing. Last week I attended the drought summit in Parkes, which was organised by the New South Wales Farmers Association and was attended by over 1,500 farmers, from drought-stricken New South Wales in the main. With around 45 per cent of Australia’s landmass now drought declared—and around 85 per cent of New South Wales in that state, with many areas experiencing their fourth year of drought conditions—the meeting at Parkes was a poignant reminder to politicians of all political persuasions of the impending crisis in many rural communities.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I am no stranger to drought. Like many speakers in this debate, I come from the land and in our family we have experienced first-hand the financial and other pressures that come on during a drought. During the drought in 1967 I can recall attempting, with my father, to put down a small bore with a hand augur device in search of water to keep our cattle alive. The party I represent was well represented in Parkes. In addition to me, Senator Ursula Stephens attended, as did my colleagues and ministers in the New South Wales government Ian McDonald and Tony Kelly and member Stephen Whan. There were more Labor members at the Parkes rally than there are National Party members in this chamber now to debate this very important matter of public importance. I also noted the presence at that rally of the Independent members for New England and Calare, as well as some members of the Liberal and National parties who were there to listen, as I was, to the sentiments expressed by those farmers.</para>
<para>If I were to try to encapsulate the sentiments expressed, as opposed to the concrete suggestions for action that underpinned those public discussions by the farmers, it would be these. Farmers and their families are very fearful for their financial futures. They are on the edge of a financial precipice and they are about to tip. Farmers are sick to death of the bickering on drought that regrettably has bedevilled the relationship between the Commonwealth and the states on drought policy—and the current minister is responsible for that, as is the parliamentary secretary through the statements that he made in this House today. In the immortal words of the great Hawthorn coach John Kennedy in his now legendary address to his players, farmers want their political decision makers to ‘do something’. They want you to ‘do something’.</para>
<para>In question time today the honourable member for Brand outlined the government’s lexicon of press releases about action on drought reform. What does the President of the New South Wales Farmers Association say about how the government has handled this particular area of policy? The parliamentary secretary ought to know because he is a good mate of the New South Wales president and he himself comes from the stable of the New South Wales Farmers Association. What he said was that the current policy is a shambles. After 11 years of your administration, your own has said that it is a shambles. He went on to say in a press release on Thursday, 14 April in response to the drought roundtable:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Here we are a year later and no closer to a long term solution. On top of that, if you consider that it has been 10 years since drought reform was originally initiated, it is unbelievable to think that there has been such little progress.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I do not have to say anything; your own have said it. Your own condemn you. A matter for the historical record is that at the last election the minister for agriculture stole a whole range of policies from the Labor Party. He stole our policy on the mandatory retail grocery code of conduct. He stole our policies on quarantine. He stole Labors’ policy on the national livestock identification system and he stole our policy on live exports. I only have one regret: that he did not steal our policy on drought. If he had stolen that policy, then the President of the New South Wales Farmers Association would not have made that statement condemning your administration on 14 April.</para>

<para>—How do you have the gall to stand up here and levy a charge at the New South Wales government about their budget when the government, in the face of the climatic evidence and the advice it received prior to the budget, slashed exceptional circumstance funding? I rest my case. The farming communities will wake up to a Prime Minister, the city slicker from Sydney who dons the Akubra, gets out there and makes some very fine statements about caring for rural Australia. You bandy about the $1 billion that you have put on the table for drought. We know, you know and the whole sector knows that you have not spent that amount of money on drought. Yet you go out there and deceive—$646 million is about all you can rake up.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>You criticise the New South Wales government, but at least Minister Macdonald went out to that particular summit. He waived all six charges for general security irrigators on the Lachlan River, reinstated transport subsidies for stock for sale and slaughter and broadened the criteria for emergency drought payments for producers who were abandoned when the Howard government failed to roll over exceptional circumstances. It is now a matter for the public record that, if you drop your package right now, there are some 10,000 farmers in New South Wales and Queensland, at a minimum—and that is a conservative estimate—who will not be eligible to access that assistance unless you change the criteria that currently apply to this assistance.</para>
<para>I have heard a lot of hypocrisy from the member for Parkes on this matter. Let me say one thing to the farmers of Australia: let it be a matter for the public record that, when the member for New England called this debate on today, not one of the government members stood up to support him or to support the Labor Party in a bipartisan position on this matter of public importance. Let it be a matter for the public record that only one of them chose to come into the chamber to support you in the statements that you made. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Like the member for Parkes, it gives me no pleasure to stand in this place and talk about drought in this matter of public importance introduced by the member for New England. Members on this side of the House have direct and first-hand experience of farming, of drought and of the pain felt by rural communities. It is not something we see reflected opposite. The Prime Minister travelled to my electorate and throughout other areas of New South Wales last Friday. He took the time to see for himself the effects this devastating drought is having on our state and on our country. He landed at the electorate of my colleague the member for Mallee. I do not think a Prime Minister had landed there for 20 years. He travelled to Wentworth, stayed overnight and then took a tour into the back country the next morning. He looked, he listened and he learned.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Farmers told him of their experiences of the drought, of what the present drought means to them and of the 10 to 12 dry years, particularly in the western division, which is looked after by the member for Parkes and me. Not all of them have been drought years but 10 to 12 have been dry years. It is awful out there and over the border in Mallee as well. These farmers explained to the Prime Minister that it was not subsidies or handouts that they wanted; it was mainly understanding and recognition. I agree with the member for New England when he asked: do we want farmers in Australia? The Prime Minister was able to tell them, ‘Yes, we do, and the people of Australia will not desert our farmers in their hour of greatest need.’</para>
<para>On financial counselling, I agree with the member for Parkes and many others who have had input into the process on which cabinet is deliberating at the moment. Rural counselling is critical because until it rains the suffering will still be apparent. I have spoken to constituents out west who would leave their farms, on average, for 10 days every one or two years. Stress and pressure are created when you simply cannot get away. You watch your sheep starve in some cases and there is nothing you can do. You are unable to plant a crop for maybe two or three years when you are waiting for rain. You are also unable to get away and to relieve the unending pressure—emotional and financial—on you and your family. It is very hard to deal with. I certainly advocate, as have many of my colleagues, that in enhancing exceptional circumstances we look at the effect that has on families. There is a need for counsellors to get to these farms to visit families as it is too much to expect them to travel long distances to see someone.</para>
<para>One of the hardest things I ever did as a farmer was to stand on the edge of a pit dug by the council and help shoot 700 sheep on my own farm and then bury them. Years later, every time I went into the paddock and saw the grave where the sheep were buried, it brought it all back to me. At that stage sheep were worth nothing and that is why we had to shoot them. Luckily today they are worth something. Luckily today farmers are operating in an era of low inflation, low interest rates and high asset prices, which means that, if they are forced to exit the industry, they can do so with dignity. It is this government’s responsible economic management that is allowing them to do that.</para>
<para>The member for Corio talked about the number of people in this place, the number of people at the rally at Parkes and the number of Nationals versus Liberal members. It is all irrelevant. What matters at the moment to the people that I, the members for New England and Kennedy and any rural members opposite represent—and there are not many of you—is that the government has noted that the planting window for autumn is closing and that urgent action needs to be taken. The best minds in the business are focusing on that right now and getting out a package that will provide assistance as promised by the Prime Minister.</para>
<para>The member for New England talked about things that I know he has raised previously in this House. He has mentioned that if every member of the Australian community contributed $1 a week we could raise $1 billion a year. But looking at his maiden speech, he actually notes that he was one of the few politicians who went to the 1996 election, when he and I came into this place, advocating an increase in taxation and the need for an environmental fund to activate remedial work. I do not think the farmers that I or the member for New England represent at the moment would look forward to an increase in taxation or an environmental fund. Those things are important and need to happen, but farmers need to deal with the crisis that they are facing now.</para>

<para>—The member for New England claims to represent agricultural interests. Glancing at the press releases that he has released this year, I do not see anything on farming, and I do not see anything on agriculture. I see things on ethanol, which I know is a favourite subject of his, and which is a subject well addressed by this side of the House. I see things on rail—his usual conspiracy theories. I see things on Telstra, and I see also some positive government announcements. But he is not talking about agriculture or farming. From what I have observed in the statements that he has made I do not think that he is in touch with rural Australia or the people that he represents.</para>

<para>—Because if he were he would do more than just make political points in this place. The issue is not the political points that we make; the issue is what the government is considering and what the government will do. The member for Parkes has correctly pointed out the very little that the New South Wales government are prepared to do in this time of crisis. It is not a matter of it being a tennis match between state and federal governments; it is a matter of making the state governments accountable. If they have a responsibility that they are not meeting then they should be made accountable.</para>

<para>—And if in their budget today the New South Wales government are only giving $8 million of what I think is new money—and it might not even be new money; it might be something they announced a while ago—then they need to be held accountable for that. The member for New England, as an ex-member of that parliament, should be holding them accountable too. We have been criticised for not providing necessary funding. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has said many times that we have committed $1 billion Australia wide, and we are already up to $670 million in expenditure. The member for Corio talks about cuts in the budget. But he must know full well that EC money—exceptional circumstances money—is available on demand. If you are a farmer and you qualify, you are entitled to get that money. There is not a cap on the amount that is available. So far, $670 million has been paid out. It has gone to the farmers of Australia and it has made a difference.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>In my electorate of Farrer, $32 million has been paid out in exceptional circumstances payments. I think that my colleague’s electorate of Murray, as she has mentioned, has had $60 million paid out in exceptional circumstances payments. As a federal government we have given $315 million to New South Wales and $122 million to Victoria. When you compare that against the paltry allocation made by New South Wales, their contribution is certainly pathetic.</para>
<para>While we are talking about New South Wales I should mention the touring group which came to my electorate on Friday. Interestingly enough, members of the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline>, speaking to Marty Deacon from the Murray River town of Wentworth in my electorate, found that he had a surprising message for the Prime Minister, as Fiona Tyndall of the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> reports. The message was</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... that property prices in the bush are doing it tough. But, according to him, it is state property taxes—not the lack of rain—that’s doing the most damage.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">State property taxes. The report continued:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... the biggest restraint on their business was the NSW-specific vendor tax on investment properties. It has brought sales for small farms and investment properties to a grinding halt.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is a very interesting message, which I do not think the New South Wales Treasurer has heeded. But, coming back to the member New England, because he represents a rural electorate he should—just as I, the member for Parkes, the member for Mallee and the member for Blair do—understand what Australia’s farmers need. But he voted against the Australia-US free trade bill—the most important bilateral economic agreement ever undertaken by Australia, which gives immediate market access gains for lamb, beef, dairy, citrus and horticulture. The member for New England needs to know that he is not acting in the interests of the wine grape producers—I assume there is a wine industry in New England because it is a beautiful part of Australia—the beef producers and the lamb producers that he represents. As country members in this place we should be bridging the city-country divide. Petty political point scoring is not going to do that. We need to make the people who live in the city, who do not reach across that great divide, understand what it is like for the farmers of rural Australia at the moment. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—The member for Farrer concluded by referring to ‘petty point scoring’. She and her colleague spent most of their speeches doing nothing but scoring off the state governments and attacking the member for New England. To condemn the member for New England for voting against the Australia-US free trade bill is amongst the most stupid statements I have heard in this place. Let me give the honourable member for Farrer a little education.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Americans have 1.8 per cent tariff protection and they generously gave it up—wasn’t that wonderful of them? But they kept their 47 per cent subsidy, which leaves our farmers at a 43 per cent disadvantage in the marketplace. And you condemn the member for New England for wanting to do away with it—heaven forbid! Previous speakers spoke about responsible economic management. It may be positive and responsible economic management for a lot of people in Australia. I am sorry, but I represent people that are paying nine per cent interest rates when their competitors in the United States are paying 1.5 per cent interest rates. Is that good economic management? I would say that that is disastrous economic management. It has raised the value of the dollar which, of course, has put those interest rates up and imposed them on us. Those of us in the agricultural sector are the in-debt people of Australia. We carry the debt. But on top of that the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement has driven up the dollar, so we have been cheated out of 30 per cent of our gross income. And yet previous speakers have stood up and called it good, sound economic management. I hope I am never in this place to see bad economic management.</para>

<para>—Let me turn to what we should have been speaking about here. I have great respect for Ray Braithwaite, a very great man. In one of his first speeches in this place, in answer to a claim by the ALP that they had turned things around in 1982, Ray Braithwaite said, ‘It rained in 1982.’ He meant that they had won an election because there had been a disastrous economic situation, and then it had rained. And that was very true. Drought is so important to this nation that it can actually throw governments out of office, and they should well take note of that fact.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Having said that, we took a survey in North Queensland when I was minister and asked people what was the most important thing for combating drought. We wanted to build dams. We thought they would come back and say: ‘We need dams. We need water.’ They did not say that. They said they needed roads. Everyone who returned the thing said ‘roads’, because in droughts they could move cattle out then, which they could not do before because they had no roads.</para>
<para>I once belonged to a great party. At the weekend, someone sent me two big pages on Jack McEwen. I am so proud of that bloke and I am so proud I was ever associated with him. As a young man, I had afternoon tea with him. The cunning old B took two per cent of the entire federal budget for rural roads. That would be $4,000 million a year for rural roads out of the budget currently. I doubt if we are getting $1,400 million for rural roads. There is your biggest weapon for droughts. My people now actually have to divert around roads that have fallen to pieces to an extent where we no longer can take road trains over those roads. They are more dangerous than the dirt roads, so people have diverted onto dirt roads. That is how your government has looked after these people, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley. In the Julia Creek shire, at the present rate of replacement it will be 200 years before some of the bitumen is replaced. Having said that, dams are very helpful.</para>

</continue>
<para>The member for Farrer had the incredible hide to attack the member for New England because he was advocating ethanol. These people have wheat in their electorates. Don’t they read? Don’t they know anything? There is a five per cent increase on the gross price. On the American experience, there is a five per cent increase in income on their gross incomes. How many of these wheat producers would not be in trouble now if they had an extra five per cent on their gross? Mr Deputy Speaker, you well know that in agriculture five per cent on your gross may well mean 100 per cent on your net. Those people who are struggling along on 50 or 60 grand a year will suddenly be on 120 grand a year. That is the difference that ethanol makes. If the member for New England came into this place and did not say that, he would be a disgrace.</para>
<para>For the people in the government to speak on or raise the issue of ethanol is unbelievable. The Leader of The Nationals, the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, has said again and again that he is opposed to mandating ethanol. If you can find anywhere in the world where the oil companies have voluntarily stood aside and given 10 per cent of their marketplace to ethanol, I would like to learn about it. It would be interesting and fascinating. You are doing everything you can do except mandating it. You have not done the only thing that needs to be done. This is incredible for me, Mr Deputy Speaker.</para>
<para>I return to the issue of the building of infrastructure, whether it is roads or dams. If we have dams, we grow cotton. If we have cotton, we have cottonseed meal—which provides the protein that is fundamental in drought times—available to us. If we build dams, we have sugar and we have sugarcane available to us, which produces molasses, which is feed for our stock in times of drought. If we have ethanol, we will be making money that we are not making at the present moment. In Queensland, infrastructure has been built at all times by the government. Our sugar industry involves sugar mills built by government—mostly ALP governments, I must say, and I praise them greatly. The silos were built in Queensland. The wheat industry opened up the silos built by the government. The cattle industry in my state was built by the abattoirs built by the great state governments of the past. It was to break Lord Vestey. They broke Lord Vestey, and that enabled us to get a decent price for our product.</para>
<para>If we are looking for solutions, we can look at Sir Graham McCamley, one of the greatest men the beef industry has ever seen in its history in Australia. He has put in on 3½ inches of rain. That was his annual rainfall. He fattened 1,000 head of cattle off silage. The answers are there. There is the famous Tritton family. Young Corbett Tritton is on the farm now doing exactly the same thing—and has been for 15 years now. We know that the solutions are there.</para>
<para>If people are thinking in terms of these solutions being damaging to the environment, that is a perspective from southern Australia. In northern Australia, all of our rivers are dry at this time of the year. They have a dry bed in them. No matter how many dams we build, that will not change. Every year there will be a flood. No matter how many dams we build, there will always be a flood. Our river systems are entirely different. All of our rainfall comes in three months of the year. We can do wonderful things. We are not short of water. My office in Innisfail enjoys a rainfall of 140 inches a year. We are not short of water in Australia. Most of Australia’s agriculture is produced from the Murray-Darling on 22 million megalitres of water. The Gulf Country alone has 126 million—just the Gulf Country. That is before we get to my office and the super wet belt where it rains all the time. There are 126 million megalitres of water in the Gulf.</para>
<para>Joseph, that great man in history and religion, said that there would be seven good years followed by seven bad years and that we have to put away in the seven good years. That is what dams are about. That is what allowing our farmers to make a profit is about—so they can put money aside. That is what it is about—the seven good years followed by seven bad years.</para>
<para>I make another biblical reference to the good Lord himself, when he told the parable of the talons. God has given this country great talons. He has given us 126 million megalitres of water. But for some reason we want to do 60 per cent of our farming off 20 million megalitres of the Murray-Darling and none on 126 million megalitres in the northern half of Queensland. This seems to me to be crazy. Just a few little bits of concrete that will take a little tiny bit of floodwater and put it back the other way solves the problems on the Murray Darling. It solves your problems. There is no great difficulty about this. God has given these talents to us.</para>
<para>Mr Deputy Speaker, do you remember the story in the Bible about the bloke that hid his talon under a rock. He was cast into eternal damnation. What will happen to us if we have all those resources and do not use them when our neighbours are going hungry? If people think there are problems for our  ecol-ogy, yes there are. There are seven million hectares of what are described as the richest grasslands in Australia, the Richmond-Julia Creek area, that have been taken over by the prickly acacia tree. It has completely destroyed all our native flora and fauna. I am no greenie, but no patriotic Australian likes seven million hectares lost. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para class="block">Whales are currently going up the New South Wales coast. The government has known that this slaughter has been occurring. The government passed legislation in 1999, but will not take action to defend its own legislation. The Prime Minister proudly said in 2001 that their policy would protect whale and dolphin species. Yet since then 400 whales have been slaughtered within Australian waters as part of Japan’s notorious scientific whaling program. We need to do more than send a polite letter—</para>

<para>—It is an honour to stand up here and to fight for Labor’s fairer reform package. It is my privilege to stand here and fight for seven million Australians, the great bulk of Australian workers who toil so hard to make our economy strong. We on this side of the House are 100 per cent behind genuine tax reform, a fair tax reform that recognises the aspirations of all workers. Our country saw a massive opportunity squandered on budget night in Peter Costello’s rush to buy votes in the Liberal Party room. When tax reform is done properly it can create wealth, encourage work and act as a vehicle for fairness and aspiration in our society. But the government’s budget puts the cart well and truly before the horse. It puts wealth redistribution before wealth creation. Not only that, their package redistributes wealth upwards. The benefits are dramatically skewed towards the very few high-income earners at the top, at the expense of seven million low- and middle-income earners. That is why the government are so embarrassed by the tax debate. That is why we see the sorts of antics we had from the Treasurer and the Prime Minister today. That is what makes Peter Costello’s claims to membership of the working class and the Prime Minister’s jittery and jumpy defence of his government’s working-class credentials so galling. These two ministers—the Prime Minister and the Treasurer—think ‘the light on the hill’ is a chandelier in a corporate box. They are no friend of the worker.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>From this budget we know that there is no room at the table for Howard’s battlers, who are tossed some meagre tax scraps while a few at the top feast on tax cuts 10 times as big. Just consider this: there is $24 a month for average workers and $240 a month for those who are doing extremely well. This budget should go down as the Melbourne Club budget, stitched together in the selfish political interest of Peter Costello, rewarding political mates and his country club set and damaging the country in the long term.</para>
<para>So what is the government’s response to this political challenge? They want to camouflage their embarrassment with silly political games the likes of which we saw in this House today. The Treasurer was here saying that Labor should prejudge the outcome in the Senate by indicating an attitude to the tax schedules, some 14 days at least before they even appear in the Senate. We on this side of the House say: first things first; you do not put the cart before the horse. We will argue our case in the House of Representatives, and we will argue our case in the Senate—that the legislation be amended on the merits. We will stand up and fight for seven million Australians who have been ignored by the Howard government, and we will stand up and fight for a tax package which gives justice to seven million Australians. When the fate of the <inline ref="R2346">Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2005</inline> is known, we will then outline our position on the schedules, but we are not going to play the Howard government’s silly political game.</para>
<para>Let us say that we succeed in amending the legislation in the Senate: could the Treasurer come and tell us what the status of the tax schedules would be then? You cannot put the cart before the horse. We are going to argue about and amend this legislation so that seven million Australians will get some tax justice. We are going to force the Liberal and National parties opposite here and in the Senate to vote in the interests of the vast number of people they represent in this House.</para>
<para>Consider this—fair dinkum, the National Party have got a hide: there they are on the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> this morning talking about tax relief for rural workers. Well, they can get some tax relief for rural workers, all right. In this House tomorrow and in the Senate when the bill goes there, they can vote for Labor amendments, which will give substantial tax relief to rural workers. They should forget about Peter Costello and his Melbourne Club package. They should get behind Kim Beazley’s Labor package, one that delivers some tax justice to low- and middle-income earners. They could have an immediate impact. They can vote for our package here and they can vote for our package in the Senate. They can do that, but of course they will not. They will be severely embarrassed, because they will have to go back to their constituencies and justify the decision. Our package will deliver greater fairness to 99 per cent of the people living in low-income electorates that are represented by National Party members. I hope those National Party members are hunted down by those people on low and middle incomes whose interests have been sold out in this parliament by the National and Liberal parties.</para>
<para>Of course, the Liberal Party’s defence is that they have brought down a budget which somehow delivers to those people in our community who are aspirational. Peter Costello was up in Queensland last week seeking leadership votes in a Red Rooster car park and in child-care centres and saying that the budget was about aspiration. The problem is that the budget is more about his aspirations for the elusive leadership of the Liberal Party than it is about the people of Australia. It is more about wanting the votes of the member for Petrie and the member for Bowman than it is about delivering some justice to the great bulk of the people who live in those electorates and deserve some tax fairness. The Treasurer’s tax package does say a lot about aspiration. It says a lot about who he believes ought to be entitled to aspiration. Do you know what his message is? It is a very simple one. This is the message from Peter Costello: unless you are approaching a six-figure salary, you are not worthy of incentive and you are not worthy of a decent tax cut. That is why we are going to fight in this House and in the Senate for a fairer deal.</para>
<para>In Peter Costello’s world, a hardworking family slogging its guts out on, say, a combined household income of $70,000—perhaps with a principal earner on $45,000 and a secondary income earner on $25,000—is not aspirational at all. That family only qualifies for token tax relief, a paltry $6, for which it should be grateful! Labor’s package before this House today sets out a fairer alternative and gives these middle-income earners $12 each, or $24 for the family. The steel workers the Treasurer is so keen to talk about will do well out of our package as well. A steel worker in Wollongong on $80,000 or even $100,000 would get roughly the same tax cut from us as from the government. For these reasons, I will match our tax package and our ‘aspirational’ credentials against those of the government any day and we will win hands down. There is a profound difference between Labor and the coalition. Labor believe in aspirations for everyone; the coalition, particularly the Liberal Party, only believes in aspirations for the few.</para>
<para>The Labor Party was founded on aspiration. The Liberal Party’s political existence is based on opportunity for an exclusive few—and, in this case, only for very high-income earners. We say this, and we say it with conviction: whether you lift a pick, tap away at a keyboard, run a small business or work down a mine, you should receive fair reward for your efforts, and Labor have a package that delivers that fair reward. In this debate we want to shine a light on just how skewed these tax cuts are whereby they go to just 280,000 high-income earners who make more than $125,000 a year. These are the people who Peter Costello believes deserve a tax cut that is more than 10 times larger than that going to the seven million low- and middle-income earners who make up to $63,000 a year.</para>
<para>This government thinks it is fair to give 45 per cent of the value of the tax cuts to the top 10 per cent of workers. I do not know how the member for Lindsay—the member for Herbert—is going to explain that in his electorate. He will be so embarrassed when he gets back there; he will be roasted.</para>

<para>—With these tax cuts, we see a disproportionate skewing of tax relief of the most extreme kind. Let us put this into perspective, because there is a pattern of behaviour here. These people are serial offenders. As it currently stands, over the nine years since the introduction of the GST to the end of the budget forward estimates, those on $50,000—that is average weekly earnings—will get just $10 per week from this government over a period of nine years. Think about that: $10 per week over a period of nine years. That is just over a dollar a year in tax cuts. Compare that with a high-income earner on $125,000 a year, who will get almost $120 a week over the same period. That is just how skewed these cuts are.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>This government has been no friend of low- and middle-income earners. Since 1996, only those on significantly more than average weekly earnings have seen their average tax rates fall. Average-income earners are paying as much tax as they were in 1996 as a proportion of their wages, and those on half-average earnings are paying more. How dare the government come in here and pretend to be a friend of low- and middle-income earners? It has fleeced them over the years and it has changed the system to the point we are at now—with this extreme skewing of the tax cuts right to the top.</para>
<para>What did the Prime Minister say when asked about this on <inline font-style="italic">Meet the Press</inline> last Sunday week? He said, ‘Oh, we’d only get away with it now. Do it early in the term and the people might forget.’ We are not going to let the people forget. That is the whole point of this debate. The people will not forget the fact that this government has fleeced so many low- and middle-income earners so comprehensively in this first budget of its fifth term. What has been happening here is tax-gouging through bracket creep from low- and middle-income earners to provide only real average tax—</para>

</talk.start>

<para>We need something different. To grow the economy, we need to give everyone incentive, not just the few. That is what is so shortsighted about the government’s approach. Labor see a fairer way forward. The fairer way we are fighting for today is very important not just for the living standards of average families but also for the future of our economy. To begin with, we propose genuine tax reform that tackles the participation challenge in our economy. It does not just pay lip-service or constitute ideological scapegoating, as we get from the Treasurer; we have a fair dinkum package that systematically tackles disincentives in our tax and welfare systems. Any serious analysis of the government’s budget shows that it is not up to the participation challenge. Labor’s tax package is designed to improve participation, particularly for those on lower incomes, who are likely to have the strongest behavioural approach. With Treasury coffers overflowing, it was not hard for this government to dole out hefty tax cuts and to be popular. But this self-interested, short-term approach short-changes our nation and the economy.</para>
<para>Studies of labour elasticity suggest that lower income earners are more likely to re-enter the work force and work longer hours when given added incentives. This means that reducing effective marginal tax rates among low-income earners and part-time workers has the strongest effect on labour market participation and hours worked. It is so ironic for the government to come in here and claim that it has some welfare reform package that will add to labour force participation and do good things for the future of the economy, because it has actually wound back the incentives in the tax system. In addition, in some cases its changes to the social security system have a more profound impact and cause greater disincentives for precisely those whom it says it wants to see moving back into the work force.</para>
<para>That being the case, what is the government’s justification for directing the bulk of the tax cuts to those who will not substantially alter their participation in the labour market? None. There is no participation agenda in the tax package that the government is bringing forward. It is simply a huge tax cut for a relatively small group of people which will not bring the sort of economic benefit the country so desperately needs to put downward pressure on inflation through enhanced productivity gains. Labor agree that our highest marginal tax rates need to be more internationally competitive, and our policy reflects that. But we also believe the first priority should be sorting out the disincentive problems at the bottom, because this is what is actually dragging down work force participation.</para>
<para>The truth is that the government’s half-hearted reforms do virtually nothing to undo the tangle between tax and social security income tests that combine to produce punishingly effective marginal tax rates. Our strategy for addressing effective marginal tax rates is far superior to that of the government, because high EMTRs are caused when social security payments are being withdrawn at the same time tax is being paid. The best way to tackle them is to stop tax and social security income tests doubling up. Our initiatives, when it comes to the new effective tax-free threshold and the movement of the 30c rate upwards, have exactly that objective.</para>
<para>Labor do not argue that the reforms we will put forward through our second reading amendment and subsequent amendments will solve all the problems at once, but they do set us a good deal down the path to where tax and social security interactions can be untangled and punishing high effective marginal tax rates eliminated or kept to a bare minimum. Labor’s alternative is one that we are going to challenge all of those government members with. Members opposite, surely, will have to think long and hard when they vote on our amendments. We call for those government members to vote for our superior package, which does actually recognise aspiration across the income scale and puts incentive into the system in a more equitable way.</para>
<para>From 1 January 2006, the government should (1) lift the effective tax-free threshold for those moving from welfare to work and other low-income earners by introducing a welfare to work tax bonus that replaces the existing low-income tax offset; and (2) extend the income range where the lowest 17c marginal tax rate applies by raising the threshold where the 30c rate cuts in from $21,600 to $26,400 to improve incentives for low-income earners to work and to deliver a tax cut of $12 per week for low- and middle-income earners. From 1 July 2006, the government should (1) extend the income range where the 30c marginal tax rate applies by raising the threshold where the 42c rate cuts in from $63,000 to $67,000 to compensate middle and higher income earners for the effects of bracket creep and to ensure that at least 80 per cent of taxpayers pay a marginal tax rate of 30c in the dollar or less over the forward estimates; and (2) extend the income range where the 42c marginal tax rate applies by lifting the threshold where the 47c rate cuts in from $80,000 to $100,000 to improve the international competitiveness of our tax system.</para>
<para>Labor’s proposal is fairer. It takes the prudent approach of waiting until the country is out of what we call the interest rate ‘red zone’ before the bulk of the tax cuts flow through. Even then, Labor’s package aims to fight inflation by offering better incentives to encourage people from welfare to work to boost our labour supply. We are dealing with both these questions at once, unlike the government, which seems to be completely unconcerned about the inflationary prospects in the economy and the consequent effects upon interest rates and completely unconcerned about the supply-side constraints in our economy. Our tax package deals with those supply-side constraints in a way in which the government’s package does not.</para>
<para>The Treasurer’s response to Labor’s proposal shows just how out of touch he is with ordinary workers and their families and how little a grasp he has on tax law. He claims that low-income earners will be worse off under Labor. That is just a blatant lie. If he were honest, he would admit that Labor’s package offers larger tax cuts to low- and middle-income earners than the government’s, better incentives to move off benefits and into work and larger tax cuts on retirees’ investment returns. On the matter of retirees, the Treasurer was caught out yesterday showing that he does not understand how the tax laws actually work. The income threshold where the senior Australians tax offset is reduced is calculated with reference to the value of the low-income rebate, a rebate that is being increased by Labor. Yet he came into this House and just told a blatant lie yesterday, and he was at it again today. As a consequence, seniors would actually gain a larger tax cut under Labor than under the government. It is just unbelievable that the Treasurer of this country could behave in such a way, but he did.</para>
<para>Labor will be giving government members opposite the opportunity to vote for Labor’s fairer alternative, and particularly those with significant numbers of older Australians in their electorate who will have to put up their hands once again for a deal which leaves those people behind. As the debate proceeds, the Treasurer and his backbench colleagues can vote to double tax relief for their constituents on average earnings or they can vote to line their own pockets to the tune of around $130 a week from the tax proposal contained in the budget. That is what they will have to explain to those Australians out there in the areas they represent.</para>
<para>If we add to that the additional, flagged tax cuts for donations to the Liberal or National parties of up to $46 a week, there is a grand total on offer to backbenchers of around $176 a week. Is it any wonder that on budget night we had all this cheering and whooping and yelling and smiling and jumping up and down from the coalition backbench? They are the principal beneficiaries of the package, which is of course why it was designed so: it is a package designed to reflect Peter Costello’s leadership aspirations, not the aspirations of the great bulk of people in this country who work hard to make our economy strong. They get up and go to work and do it day in and day out; they do their best to raise their kids and they scrimp and get by, making ends meet. They do not elect those members of parliament to come in here and give themselves an additional $176 per week. That is why we are going to continue to fight in the House of Representatives and in the Senate for a fairer package, Kim Beazley’s package.</para>
<para>If government backbenchers oppose Labor’s proposal, we will be happy to campaign in their electorates as they stand to gain $9,200 a year while average-income earners get just $6 a week—the scraps. Every single Liberal and National Party MP should go back to their electorate and explain why they will not support Labor’s plan for a $12 a week tax cut for low- and middle-income earners. In the interests of their constituents, we challenge Peter Costello and his coalition colleagues either to support Labor’s fairer package or to explain why they think they are worth a tax cut 10 times the size of the tax cut for seven million hardworking Australians.</para>
<para>Labor’s alternative is fair and responsible. It would deliver for the Australians dudded in Peter Costello’s Melbourne Club budget. Amidst all of the distortions and all of the crazy claims from the Treasurer and his cronies about Labor’s tax plan, we should never forget that spin is the window into the soul of the Howard government. Let us cut through all of the spin. Go down to your local footy or netball club and ask middle-income earners whether they think they are worth a tax cut less than a 10th of the size of the tax cut the government wants to give politicians and other high-income earners. I know what the answer is. I have been getting it wherever I go in Australia over the last week and a bit. People want some tax justice. They want some fairness. They want to know that their hard work is valued. They want to know that their aspirations, not just the aspirations of a select few, count with the government of the day.</para>

<para>—I want to thank the member for Lilley for saying that people will remember this budget. People will remember this budget. They will remember that it was the Australian Labor Party who sought to block the much valued tax cuts that have been proposed in the legislation before the parliament this afternoon. They will remember that they were unable to get their tax cuts on 1 July because of the obstruction of the Australian Labor Party when the Australian Labor Party knew that the tax cuts were going to become law. I remind the Australian Labor Party that we now have a situation where a single income family with two kids and earning a little more than $40,000 a year will pay no net tax. They can put in their pockets all of the money that they earn—that is $800 or so a week. That is not a bad outcome and the Australian coalition government is certainly very proud of that outcome.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I was surprised when I saw the budget delivered last Friday by another Labour government. It was very interesting; it delivered tax cuts. It was the New Zealand Labour government and—surprise, surprise—the tax cuts will be delivered in the year 2008! What are the tax cuts that the New Zealand Labour Party will deliver? For a person on a 21c marginal tax rate—the low tax rate—the tax cut in 2008 will be 67c a week. That is the record of the Labour Party in New Zealand. It would not surprise me, if the Labor Party ever got back into government in Australia, to see the same thing here.</para>
<para>The position of the government on tax cuts is very strong indeed. The <inline font-style="italic">Budget Overview</inline> of 10 May 2005 indicates that the government is providing personal tax cuts worth $21.7 billion over four years, increasing incentives to work and save, assisting low-income earners and keeping Australia internationally competitive. The <inline font-style="italic">Budget Overview</inline> observes, and reminds us all, that the tax cuts that will be delivered through this legislation build on the $14.7 billion in personal tax cuts in last year’s budget. The government will provide a further $2.5 billion over four years to boost superannuation savings by abolishing the superannuation surcharge with effect from 1 July this year.</para>
<para>This document is also instructive. I have heard the member for Lilley go on and on about the unfairness of six bucks a week and that sort of thing. He says that members of parliament—he uses the politics of envy—will get higher tax cuts. But on page 8 of this document there is a different view. It looks at the percentage tax cut across income scales. When you look at it that way you find the fairness in what the government has done. You find that a person on $10,000 a year gets about an 18½ per cent tax cut whereas a person on $125,000 a year gets an eight per cent tax cut. I think that is very instructive because you can only really properly look at these matters in percentage terms. People paying very high rates of tax do not get the same percentage tax cut as people who pay significantly lower rates of tax. I encourage the Australian Labor Party to read the <inline font-style="italic">Budget Overview</inline> document and look at the sense that it presents.</para>
<para>It is interesting to note the reaction around the country to the budget. In Tasmania, on 936 ABC radio, interviewer Tim Cox asked the Tasmanian Premier:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Should Tasmanians on lower incomes be getting a six dollar a week tax cut sooner rather than later? I won’t ask you what sort of conversation you had with Kim Beazley earlier in the week but is the Federal Labor Party doing the wrong thing in opposing these cuts? Harry Quick told us that he thought so and had told Kim so.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The Premier of Tasmania, Paul Lennon, answered this way:</para>

<para class="block">The Labor Premier of Tasmania would have argued against what the member for Lilley proposed to the Labor caucus. Lennon also said:</para>

</quote>
<para class="block">Congratulations to a sensible Labor leader for indicating what everybody else in the country knows: Labor should not be arguing against tax cuts to be delivered on 1 July. They should not be pursuing the tactic of voting against those tax cuts, of voting them down.

<para class="block">Too right it has. Alan Jones was right on the money. The Labor Party’s position on not allowing the tax cuts to proceed on 1 July has put them offside. The opposition leader answered:</para>

<para class="block">I’m not sure about the electorate—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Golly, if he is not sure about the electorate, that is a bit of a worry. He continues:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Look, I’m fighting for them. We’ve an opportunity here to put some pressure on the Government to do the right thing by them on tax.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Alan Jones responded:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">But see you’re trying to win government and the working class that you’re pitching to and which is your constituency are often miners and labourers and factory workers, those sorts of people, they’re on 50-, 60- and 70 thousand dollars. They write to me and they say they are delighted about the government’s tax cuts.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Alan Jones went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Because tax cuts though are set on a percentage basis it’s inevitable that those who pay the vast bulk of personal tax will always benefit most from across the board cuts. So for example the bloke on $25 000 did only get $6 but he got a 10 per cent tax cut didn’t he?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Alan Jones was right. Alan Jones then went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">But I see the top 25 per cent of taxpayers are paying 64 percent of all the personal tax and they’ve been stuck on that top tax bracket for a long time. Now many argue that should be cut back from 48 and a half, but what the Government did was to say well it’ll take you a little longer to enter that bracket. Isn’t that fair?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Alan Jones then put an interesting question to Mr Beazley. He asked:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">But would you consider extending the GST to 15 percent and scrap everything else, or would you say let’s eliminate all taxes and put a flat rate of 20 percent? I mean how do you make it simpler and more easily understood by everybody?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Mr Beazley waffled and as usual did not rule anything out. That is a worry. He said that he would have to go back to the act itself and take a look at the complexities and all that sort of thing. But when he was asked whether he would consider extending the GST to 15 per cent, he basically said that he would consider it. That is a concern. I can tell you the coalition will not consider changing the GST rate. It will stay at 10 per cent.</para>
<para>There has certainly been some real bitterness, which has soured Labor relations. Dennis Atkins, writing in the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline>, said:</para>

<para class="block">The big clue to an imminent election in the Territory can be found in Martin’s reaction to the Budget a week-and-a-half ago when the first-time chief minister led the charge by Labor leaders to give free advice to Kim Beazley not to block Peter Costello’s soak-the-rich tax cuts. “I don’t think we should be opposing tax cuts,” Martin said. “I don’t agree with the way they’ve been done, but every Australian will be looking forward to them ...</para>

<para class="block">Too right they are, Clare Martin. Every Territorian, every Australian, is looking forward to tax cuts. She has been very powerfully suggesting to the Leader of the Opposition that he should support the tax cuts on 1 July.</para>
<para>Incidentally, I also observe in relation to the Labor Party’s position on the abolition of the superannuation surcharge that Mr Beazley opposed the introduction of the superannuation surcharge but now he opposes its removal. That is a very interesting position—and, member for Lilley, people will remember it.</para>
<para>I conclude by observing an article by John Black, a former ALP senator for Queensland, published in the <inline font-style="italic">Courier Mail</inline> on 13 May, which is subheaded, ‘John Black argues Labor is headed for a Budget loss’. The article states:</para>

<para>—Mr Deputy Speaker, on indulgence: during the member for Lilley’s contribution he quite unfortunately directed an accusation towards the Treasurer which I think we would all agree was unparliamentary. It is hard to imagine that he will come back to withdraw, but could I suggest that you have a quiet word to the member for Lilley and point out that the provisions of the standing orders on the accusation he directed at the Treasurer have other forms which he can pursue in this House, and that might be an appropriate way of dealing with an unfortunate term that he directed at the Treasurer.</para>

In the circumstances, the point the parliamentary secretary has made is true. In using the word ‘blatant’ in front of another noun perhaps the honourable member for Lilley should have been much more careful with the use of that word as an adjective because it could have been construed as an accusation of a deliberate action on behalf of the Treasurer. Matters have moved on, but I take the point that the parliamentary secretary makes that it should be placed on the record. I caution all honourable members, including the member for Lilley, that they should be much more careful in the use of language that should be used only in other forms of the House if there was any action indicating a deliberate action of a minister or other member.</para>

<para>—I withdraw it, Mr Deputy Speaker. There was the member for Herbert blatantly avoiding any form of defence of this tax package and how it relates to his own electorate. He waxed lyrical about the macroeconomic effect of some of the tax package. He talked about each of the state premiers at great length. But at no point did the member for Herbert seek to apply this tax package to his own electorate, and at no point did he try to defend this tax package and its impact on his own electorate. But I feel for the member for Herbert. He is one of the courageous. He is not one of the magnificent seven but one of the magnificent eight—the eight government backbenchers who have been prepared to put their name on the speakers list this evening, come in here and defend this tax package. There are eight government members on the speakers list. I note the member for Herbert only took about half of the time available to him in making his contribution. I can only assume that is because he lacked any ability or capacity whatsoever to apply this tax package to his electorate and in any sense defend it. The member for Herbert represents one of those 144 electorates in this country in which the average taxpayer will get just a $6 tax cut. There are only five—Bradfield, North Sydney, Warringah, Bradfield and one other that escapes my—</para>

<para>—I stand corrected. But I thank the member for Dunkley for reminding me that it is the Treasurer’s electorate that makes up the balance of the list of five. Notwithstanding the fact that he shirked it, I do congratulate the member for Herbert for coming in here and having a go. During the debate on the budget proper last night I issued a challenge to government backbenchers. The challenge was to come in here and defend these tax cuts and their application in those electorates. I see the member for Dobell has come in. He is one of the magnificent eight, along with the member for Casey, who is one of the ginger group, so I am very pleased to see him in here attempting to defend this tax cut. There is the member for Moore, the member for Grey, the member for Blair, the member for Stirling and the member for Moncrieff—those people I congratulate.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>But there are some significant omissions from the speaking list. The one that stands out for me, because he was in the House last night when I was issuing the challenge, is the member for Paterson. The member for Paterson is absent in this debate even though the average taxpayer in his electorate gets a $6 tax cut while he gets a $64 tax cut each week. But the most notable omission of all is the member for Indi. Remember the member for Indi? She is the lady who represents a seat which has an average taxable income of just $33,331 annually. She is also a member of the ginger group. There she is in the backrooms of the parliament arguing for a big tax cut for the top end of town despite having an electorate with an average taxable income of $33,000, but she is not prepared to come into this public place and argue her case as to why she should get a $64 tax cut each week while constituents in her electorate, in rural communities, get $6.</para>
<para>The other notable omission is the member for Wentworth. Remember the member for Wentworth? Not all that long ago the member for Wentworth was on <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> radio arguing that we have got to start taxing the rich more. ‘We’ve got to start taxing the rich more,’ said the member for Wentworth. Guess what: we have not heard from him since, because he got the call straightaway—probably from the Treasurer—telling him that he had to back off because it was the government’s intention—the deal had already been done with the Prime Minister—to give most of the tax cuts to the rich.</para>

<para>—Indeed, I thank the parliamentary secretary for his intervention because it has only taken five minutes and we have got a new list. Guess what: the member for Wentworth is coming in here to defend his position. He is going to come and tell us he has not changed his mind and of course he is going to oppose the government’s tax package! It is the only way he can be consistent. If the member for Wentworth stands by his conviction that the rich in this country need to be taxed more, he has no choice but to join us on this side and oppose this government’s tax package. So I am glad the member for Wentworth has suddenly appeared on the list but, alas, I am told there will still be no member for Paterson. I am told the member for Paterson is yet to take up the opportunity to appear in this House and defend this package. To me that is a great disappointment and I am sure it is a great disappointment to the constituents of the electorate of Paterson. The Prime Minister said today during question time: ‘The people of the Hunter love this government. They think it is the best government they’ve ever had.’ Funnily enough, they keep returning Labor members. The member for Paterson is the exception, but of course Paterson goes right up to Forster and Tuncurry, which are hardly considered part of the Hunter region.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Labor is standing up against this tax package because it is just unfair. The government finds itself awash with money mainly as a result of a record minerals boom. Indeed, it is taking $93 billion more in revenue today than the former Labor government did in its last year of office 10 years ago. That is without the GST. If you add the GST, which is the government’s orphan—the government tries to disown the GST even though it obviously forms part of the Commonwealth revenue—it is $130 billion more than the revenue taken in the last year of the former Labor government. That means that this government is now raising in revenue more than twice what Labor did in its last year of office. So Labor believes a tax cut is due. Labor believes a dividend should go to the taxpayer.</para>
<para>We believe in some relief for those in the higher income brackets—of course we do—but, even more particularly, we think relief is overdue for those low- and middle-income earners who, as you might recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, missed out because all those under $52,000 missed out the last time the government sought to initiate a tax cut. They are the people we are concerned about. Taking this government’s revenue as a proportion of GDP, this government is the highest taxing government in Australia’s history. That is a fact which cannot be contested. So Labor will stand by our commitment, and I am disappointed that more of the members opposite have not come in to try to defend this tax cut and how it applies to their electorates. In particular, where are those National Party members who represent some of the poorest electorates in this country? I refer to the member for Wide Bay, whose constituents have an average income of $30,000; the member for Mallee, whose constituents get an average of $33,000-odd; and the member for Page, who had the audacity during question time today to ask the Treasurer ‘to share with the House the great benefits of this government tax package’, even though the constituents in his electorate, with an average income of just over $31,000, get the $6 tax cut for the average taxpayer while the person he was questioning, the Treasurer of the Commonwealth, gets a $64 tax cut.</para>
<para>This is the essence of the debate tonight. Labor are putting up a fairer tax package. We have a government package which is unfairly biased towards the big end of town. In fact, 45 per cent—almost half—of the tax cuts go to the top 10 earners in this country. The government package is about lifting the tax burden off the most wealthy sections of the Australian community by reducing those facing the top marginal tax rate from 10.2 per cent to just 3.3 per cent of taxpayers. So the proportion of taxpayers facing the top marginal rate is to decline by 75 per cent under this government’s tax package. The lower end only get the $6 a week cut. Only taxpayers earning more than $63,000 gain any more than the $6. You have to in fact be earning about $70,000 to enjoy a tax break of $10 each week. This is about 13 per cent of the number of individual taxpayers. What is happening is that middle Australia—the mums and dads on average wages, many of them already struggling with increasing household demands including increasing interest rates—will carry more of the load. On the other hand, those who can best afford to pay taxation will have their burden lightened.</para>
<para>I mentioned earlier that this is a tax cut that cannot be seen in isolation. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall that in the budget last year the government delivered $52 billion in tax cuts to only those who got over $52,000, so the government is becoming a serial offender. In this year’s budget, those on over $70,000 get a tax break of $10, so the effect of both budgets compounds the shift in the tax base away from higher income earners. Labor, by contrast, has targeted tax relief at those that need it most—average taxpayers. We will give them double the tax cut the government is giving: $12, not $6, to the average taxpayer. Labor provides tax breaks that do not involve a shift in the burden towards average Australian taxpayers but a fair reduction in the tax burden overall. Labor also provides generous concessions at the top end. We are still providing tax cuts for about the same proportion as the government for those on between $65,000 and $105,000.</para>
<para>I am glad the member for North Sydney is here because he is one of those who is fond of saying during question time and during other debates: ‘What about your coalminers, Member for Hunter? What are you doing for your coalminers, Member for Hunter?’ Let me share the facts with the member for North Sydney, seeing as he asks. The average coalminer in my electorate earns $93,000 a year. The immediate question which has to be posed here is: how does the Hunter coalminer fare under the government’s tax package compared with under Labor’s alternative proposal? There is a big difference: it is a total of 93c. Under the government’s proposal they would get a weekly tax cut of $36.58 and under Labor, $35.65.</para>

Of course, the all-important point is this: you do not have to raise the threshold for the top marginal tax rate to $125,000 to help a Hunter coalminer on $93,000 annually. You need only to raise the threshold for the top rate to give tax relief to the likes of the member for North Sydney, the member for Dobell and others that sit behind him. In the time I have left, I want to quickly respond to a couple of points the Treasurer made over the course of question time yesterday and today.</para>

<para>—I will get the member for North Sydney to listen to this—that you cannot provide tax relief for low-income earners who pay little or no tax. The second point goes to the Treasurer’s obvious lack of understanding of his own regulations—the regulations he introduced with the senior Australian tax offset. On the first point, I want to point out to the Treasurer that, according to the Australian Taxation Office, in 2002-03 there were 1.1 million taxpayers on incomes between $6,000 and $15,000. So I ask the Treasurer: are you saying you cannot provide significant tax relief for these 1.1 million taxpayers? We say to the Treasurer that, if he is not prepared to do so, we will. That is what Labor’s amendment is all about.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Labor has done this in a way that also encourages economic efficiency. Low-income earners not only pay tax but also, as the member for Lilley has pointed out, face high effective marginal tax rates. Labor’s plan provides tax relief to lower income earners through the welfare to work tax bonus. When phased in, this will provide a tax-free threshold of $10,000 for people earning incomes of up to $20,000, phasing out at a moderate taper rate of around five per cent. This has the benefit of eliminating tax for lower income earners and reducing the effective marginal tax rate by about 17 per cent or slightly less. If the taxpayers are in the phase-out range, this is of course significant relief for low-income earners.</para>
<para>It also represents significant tax reform. It tackles the question of EMTRs. Labor’s welfare to work tax bonus is welfare reform and tax reform combined. It embodies a tax design that will lead to dynamic gains in the economy from increased labour market participation. This will lead to higher growth and eventually, of course, higher per capita GDP. This is good policy. This framework relies on the so-called three Ps of productivity, participation and population, but from the perspective of personal income tax policy it is the issue of participation that matters most. Labor’s tax package is more focused on participation than is the government’s. It increases incentives and reduces EMTRs. Of the two models, Labor’s is more pro growth.</para>
<para>The second point was the Treasurer’s claim yesterday that our tax package fails to provide assistance to senior Australians. He is simply wrong. The member for Lilley made that clear in his media release yesterday. The Treasurer’s comments are inconsistent with the government’s regulation 150AB(3), which states that the rebate threshold for the senior Australian tax offset is calculated by a formula that includes the low income tax offset. Labor has taken this offset and expanded it significantly. So, as Labor will shortly make clear when the amendments are tabled, this will directly benefit senior Australians. The bottom line is that senior Australians will gain the full value of the welfare to work bonus if they are in the relevant income ranges. I also note that Labor’s proposed amendments will ensure recipients of the senior Australian tax offset will not only benefit from the tax as a result of the offset but also not have to pay the Medicare levy.</para>
<para>Labor has put its case. Labor supports tax relief, particularly when the government is so awash with money, but Labor will put forward an alternative—an alternative that distributes the dividend from that minerals boom back to all Australians fairly. Labor will make sure there is tax relief for the Hunter’s coalminers and will make sure there is tax relief in the higher income brackets of up to $100,000, but what Labor will not do is support a proposition that gives a disproportionate amount of the $22 billion tax cuts to the big end of town. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I rise today in support of the <inline ref="R2045">Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2005</inline>. Australians today have higher incomes and brighter employment prospects. Responsible economic management has delivered a strong economy and strong budget outcomes. The government has reduced the $96 billion debt left by Labor by $90 billion to among the lowest levels in the OECD. This has led to savings of $5.7 billion a year in interest payments alone. While our prospects are excellent, we cannot afford to rest on our past success. Australia today faces a range of economic challenges, the foremost among these being Australia’s ageing population. The number of people in Australia aged over 65 will more than double over the next 40 years. This will lead to higher pension, aged care and health payments and a slowing in the growth of average incomes. We need to take steps now to prevent an unsustainable burden falling on future generations, whilst striving to enhance the wellbeing of today’s generation. Improving productivity and participation can achieve both goals.</para>

<para>The measures in this bill will allow for tax cuts for all taxpayers in my electorate of Dobell. They will increase the rewards from work and saving and heighten incentives to work. Combined with other budget measures, particularly the Welfare to Work initiative and family benefits, this will help boost our labour force, which is a key to sustained economic growth. From 1 July 2005, all Australian taxpayers will share in tax cuts worth $2.7 billion over the next four years. This is in addition to the $14.7 billion tax cuts provided in last year’s budget. The 17 per cent marginal tax rate will fall to 15 per cent, the 42 per cent threshold will be raised to $63,001 and the 47 per cent threshold will be raised to $95,001. From July 2006 the 42 per cent threshold will be raised to $70,001 and the 47 per cent threshold will be raised to $125,001.</para>
<para>These personal income tax cuts demonstrate the government’s commitment to rewarding participation. The reduction of the lowest marginal rate to 15 per cent will assist low-income earners in Dobell and will provide an additional incentive to enter the work force. This is a very low rate. In fact, it was 20c in the dollar before the Howard government was elected.</para>
<para>At the middle to upper income levels, thresholds have been increased rather than rates cut, so middle-income earners will not have to come into the top tax rate anymore. The top tax rate will not apply to middle-income earners, Dobell tradesmen, people who work overtime, people who work on weekends, people who want to work to do better and make a living for themselves, and people who have second jobs. This move is about improving incentive to work. We do not want to penalise people for reaching higher and working harder. People have gone out on a limb—plumbers and electricians, for instance. These people have been caught in the top tax bracket in the past. They should not be in this tax bracket. In future they will not be. This bill will address that.</para>
<para>Measures in the bill mean that over 80 per cent of taxpayers face a top marginal tax rate of 30 per cent or less. Kamikaze Kim would have us believe that the top threshold applies only to government backbenchers. Will Labor members then donate the extra to a charity of their choice? I think not. Or will they determine not to determine how they will use that benefit? Our strong economy, lifestyle advantages and changes to the top two thresholds in this budget will increase incentives for Australians to work. Taxpayers will not reach the highest marginal tax rate until they earn around three times the average weekly earnings. The top marginal rate will apply to only three per cent of taxpayers from 2006 and beyond.</para>
<para>Dobell senior Australians will also benefit. From 1 July 2005 senior Australians who receive the senior Australians tax offset can earn more without paying tax. A single senior Australian will now pay no tax on their annual income up to $21,968 and a couple will pay no tax on a combined income up to $36,494. The Medicare threshold for senior Australians will be increased to ensure they do not pay the Medicare levy until they incur some income tax liability. It is disappointing that the Labor Party does not believe our Australians are deserving of a tax cut. By opposing a reduction in the lowest rate from 17c to 15c, Labor opposes tax cuts for our seniors.</para>
<para>The Australian government recognises the importance of cutting the tax burden for every Australian. Because the economy has been strong, services have been adequately funded and the budget is still in surplus, the government has said, ‘Why not return something to the Australian people by way of a tax cut?’ Alternatively, Labor believes people should pay higher taxes.</para>
<para>If this bill is passed through the parliament, every taxpayer will get a tax cut on 1 July. The Labor Party opposes this tax cut. The Labor Party wants people to pay higher taxes. The Leader of the Opposition knows this tax cut will go through one way or another and that Labor have no way in the world of stopping this tax cut. The only thing Labor can do is to delay this tax cut. I am calling on Labor to not delay the tax cut and to give the people their tax cut on 1 July.</para>
<para>Unfortunately the Leader of the Opposition’s antics are also making life harder for small business in my electorate. They will be given two sets of the schedules by the Commissioner of Taxation: one with the tax cuts included and one without. Labor’s stunts will not only delay all Australians receiving their tax cut but also create a great deal of confusion for the 850,000 employers in this country. Labor must quit spreading confusion and half-truths and stop trying to delay tax cuts. There is no sense in doing that. Australians should be entitled to the full tax cut when it was promised: on 1 July.</para>
<para>Labor continues to run a series of scare campaigns attacking some of the more vulnerable people in our community, including people with disabilities, single mums, older workers and low-income families. The truth is that every Australian will benefit from tax cuts. For example, a single income family with two children between five and 12 on an annual income of $40,000 will receive a total tax and family tax benefit advantage of $1,730 in 2005-06. This will rise to $2,188 in the next financial year.</para>
<para>In addition to the tax cuts, the level of family income allowed before family tax benefit part A starts to be withdrawn will increase to $37,500 a year from 1 July 2006. This means that you can earn more before you begin to lose your benefit. This will assist many families in Dobell, providing increased assistance of up to $12.55 a week. It is also important to note that families earning around $40,000 with two children do not pay any tax, because the family tax benefit offsets their tax liability.</para>
<para>For middle-income families, the value of changes to the family tax benefit and parenting payment produces hundreds of dollars in excess of tax cuts, but Labor do not like to highlight this. Labor do not like to be reminded that a single-income couple with two dependents have had a 29.5 per cent increase in their real disposable income since 1996 and, with the family tax benefits, they effectively pay no tax until they earn $46,000.</para>
<para>Similarly, despite what Labor would like to have us believe, nothing is taken away from single mums. No single mother currently on parenting payments will lose it. Under this legislation, a mother can be on the parenting payment until her youngest child turns six and begins school. They will then have the opportunity to look for part-time work. There are already a lot of mums out there in the work force on a full-time basis, and we want to encourage others to join the work force on a part-time basis.</para>
<para>The ALP need to understand that getting into the work force is not a bad thing. There are many people out there who want to return to the work force. It helps them because they get higher income and there are social benefits as well in participating in the mainstream. Tax cuts will only serve to further encourage people to join the work force. From the point of view of the taxpayers, the more people we get into the work force, the lower taxes are going to be overall. This is because more people in work paying a lower rate of tax can raise the same amount of money as fewer people in the work force paying a higher rate. If we can get more people into work, we are going to have a stronger economy.</para>
<para>I also welcome Welfare to Work funding initiatives of more than $2 billion in new and expanded services to help those with new work obligations find and keep a job. Welfare recipients who are able to work part time will be obliged to do so. The payment structure will be changed to provide better incentives to work. Why these reforms? Because a welfare system that focuses only on participation for those who can work full time is no longer sustainable. Increased work force participation will be required if we are to continue to improve our living standards as the population ages. This is the fact of the matter and Labor must come to realise it. As I mentioned earlier, we need to take steps now for our future while striving to enhance the wellbeing of today’s generation. Improving productivity and participation can and will achieve both these goals.</para>
<para>In conclusion, the government is committed to increasing work force participation. Personal income tax cut measures in this bill that were announced in the 2005 federal budget will further improve the structure of Australia’s tax system and increase our international competitiveness. The measures will assist low-income earners, boost disposable incomes and improve incentives for all Australian taxpayers to participate in the work force, to invest, save and increase the overall savings of our country. Labor’s tax plan is a Clayton’s tax cut: even if they were to be applied, they would not be applied until 2008. I say to the Labor Party: give up this useless opposition. Do not deny Australians their well-deserved tax cuts. Give up this opposition, which is causing confusion. Implement the government’s tax changes so that all Australians can have tax relief on 1 July. I commend this bill to the House.</para>

<para>—The core of this debate is not about whether there should or will be tax cuts; both sides of parliament agree that there should and will be a tax cut. If you listen to some of the contributions from Liberal and National Party members you may, mistakenly, not appreciate that fact. The core of this debate is the nature of those tax cuts—how they are applied and to whom the benefits will flow.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The <inline ref="R2346">Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2005</inline> is part of a package that provides big tax cuts for a few Australians and a ‘Big Mac’ for most Australians. It is a triumph of self-interest over good public policy and it is a triumph of narrow, privileged interests over the interests of the many. That is why I and the Labor Party have opposed this bill and sought to have an alternative proposal adopted.</para>
<para>Government members will have the opportunity to decide whether or not they want a fairer tax system, and I will be interested to watch particularly those members whose electorates are low-income areas. Reference was made to this during question time. The National Party benches—cockies corner on the horseshoe bend—just jump off the cliff again like lemmings, supporting a piece of legislation that dramatically disadvantages their constituents. It beggars belief that those members on the other side, particularly National Party members, ignore the interests of their constituents.</para>

<para>—I can understand the member for North Sydney in his staunch advocacy for this proposal. The member for North Sydney represents the richest constituency in this country bar none. His constituents are the wealthiest of any across the land. His advocacy for this makes some sense out of self-interest—I can at least follow some logic in that—but what continues to comfound me is why on earth members on the other side, particularly National Party members, forsake their constituencies to walk along like Liberals in gumboots, following on the heels of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, to do in their constituents in rural and regional Australia, whom they claim to represent.</para>
</talk.start>

<para>These bills and the tax cuts we are talking about are really tax cuts that are provided over three budgets. When the government announced their budget two weeks ago, the tax cuts they claimed as arising from that budget were actually an aggregate. They were the tax cuts that had already been legislated for plus the tax cuts they were announcing in the budget a fortnight ago. So there was a little bit of smoke and mirrors in the way that the government presented it. Let us look at that aggregate—what people get over those three budgets—and see what that means for ordinary Australians.</para>
<para>Let us have a look at what ordinary Australians earn, because people on the other side seem to have a very myopic view of what people in Australia earn today. Probably the highest measurement taken by the Australian Bureau of Statistics is full-time adult total earnings. By that, I mean it represents one of the highest measurements of income in this country. It takes account of adult earnings only, so it discounts all of the juniors involved; and it includes overtime and other incomes. The figure for full-time adult total earnings in the latest ABS data report was $54,423.</para>
<para>A more accurate reflection of what most people earn is average weekly total earnings, which includes part-time workers. This is a more representative sample of Australia because more and more workers in Australia work part time. The figure for average weekly total earnings at the moment is $40,794. So what does somebody on $40,000, $50,000 or even $55,000 get from the government in three budgets? Out of the budget 12 months ago, they got zero—not one cent in tax cuts from the Liberal Howard government. In the budget announced two weeks ago there were two tranches of tax cuts: one to be applied in the next financial year, starting in July; and a further budget cut 12 months down the track. So how much does average Australia get—those people on $40,000, or even those at the top end of that assessment on $55,000? From the Howard government, having got zero 12 months ago, they get $6 a week in the next financial year. How much do they get in the year after that? Zero again—not a cent. Three tax cuts in three consecutive budgets and average Australia gets not one cent, then a measly $6 then not one cent again.</para>
<para>I think most people in Australia would be asking: where does the $24 billion go? If average workers are getting, over three consecutive budgets, a grand total of $6 a week in tax cuts, where does all the money go? The answer to that is: all the money goes to the top end of town—those people earning large sums of money. I understand the member for North Sydney is keen to advocate the case for those people who earn significantly higher salaries than the average weekly earnings.</para>
<para>Let us put this into some real context. A person earning $55,000 a year—which, by any measure on our national statistics, is above the national average—gets a grand total over three budgets of $6 from John Howard. If you happen to be fortunate enough to earn double that—so, instead of earning $55,000, you earn $110,000—you find yourself in a much better position. You will get 12 times the tax cut. So if you have double the income, you get 12 times the tax cut—a bit over $82 a week. That is not a bad tax cut in anyone’s language—$80 a week after tax extra in your pocket is useful to most people in this country. I am sure all those people listening to this debate would like to get an extra $82 a week, but they will not. Most of the people listening to this debate will be average Australians, who we know earn considerably less than that. They will be getting $6 from the Howard government. Forget the hoopla, forget the rhetoric, forget the histrionics in this debate. The simple fact is that, over three budgets, the Howard government will give ordinary Australians $6. That was not just from this budget but from three budgets. That is cumulative; add it up together and it is worth six bucks.</para>
<para>Those people who earn more than $70,000 start to get extra money from this government, but if you are earning more than $100,000 then you are really doing well because that tax cut increases the higher up you go. It does not peak at $110,000; it keeps going up. If you earn $130,000 you get a bigger tax cut again. I have heard some people on the other side try to justify this by talking about the percentage of the total income that the tax cut represents. That is a cute piece of arithmetic that fails a few tests, not least of all fairness. It makes no difference to someone earning $30,000 or $40,000, an average weekly wage, trying to support themselves, a partner or maybe a family—even just trying to support themselves, frankly, on that amount of money—to tell them that they got a higher percentage tax cut. When they go to the supermarket to buy the groceries, try to rent somewhere or pay off a home loan, they do not get some concessions because their income is lower.</para>
<para>I wonder where the Liberal Party philosophy was when they started talking about percentages with the GST. They do not want to talk about the impact of the GST as a percentage of income. The simple fact is that the GST is a flat tax that disproportionately impacts on those people on low incomes. If we apply the same Liberal Party argument that I have heard in this debate to the GST, we find the reverse—that is, they are penalising low-income earners with a higher percentage of their income going into tax, in this case the GST. By all means, let members of the government hop up and talk about the percentage of income devoted to tax, but let’s be honest about it. I invite the members opposite who want to run that argument to factor into their calculations the GST payment, which is a flat percentage tax that is a much higher percentage of a $40,000 income than it is of a $100,000 income.</para>
<para>The argument that Liberal Party members have used in this debate has been given to them by the Treasurer’s office in their speaking notes as a feather to fly with, a thread to hang onto. The simple fact of life is that very few of them have wanted to get up and talk in this debate at all, very few indeed. There are about half as many government members defending this wonderful, egalitarian tax reform as there are opposition members standing here to oppose it—although I have noticed since the debate started that a couple of government members have added their names to the list, so it should be entertaining to watch their hastily prepared contributions.</para>
<para>Nine out of 10 of the highest income electorates in this country, not surprisingly, are held by Liberal Party members of parliament. One of those electorates is Wentworth. I will be interested to hear the contribution of the member for Wentworth when he arrives in this chamber. I see that he is a late addition to the speakers list. Mr Turnbull made a point of trying to grab some headlines by telling Australians that there should be an increase in the tax paid by our wealthiest citizens. This bill certainly does not facilitate that. I would expect that either he is going to recant his earlier public comments or he is going to vote against this bill. It is hard to imagine how the member for Wentworth can reconcile his public comments about the need to increase taxation on the wealthiest citizens with support for a bill that does precisely the opposite thing, as is certainly the case with the bill before us.</para>
<para>In my electorate of Brisbane more than eight out of 10 of my constituents will get $6 or less out of this budget. That leaves fewer than two out of 10 who will get any benefit other than $6 out of this tax scale adjustment. This is not a good piece of public policy. My electorate of Brisbane is actually in the higher end of incomes across the country, being an inner urban electorate, yet the great majority of constituents I represent will get just $6 and no more. That is not a fair redistribution of the wealth from the dividend of $24 billion being returned to the Australian people. These tax changes are the sort of thing that the sheriff of Nottingham would be proud of. This really is an example of giving very little to those in the greatest need—and, as I commented before, in the case of two out of three budgets giving them nothing at all.</para>
<para>As each year passes with a growing population and a growing economy, government revenue increases. That is a basic piece of commonsense. In the electorate over the years as these issues have been debated, people have said to me, ‘What we need to do is index the tax scales.’ I have to say that I do not support that. Indexation of tax scales has a couple of major flaws. One is that it assumes that the tax scales you are indexing are perfect, because you are setting them in concrete. I am not sure anybody would be game enough to say that the tax scales at any given point in time were perfect and should be set in concrete. Of course, there is one other major flaw with that argument, which is that indexation of the tax scales assumes that economic and public policy circumstances are not going to change in the future. If history tells us anything, it tells us that is not so. So it is not possible to set tax scales in concrete in real dollar terms and to index them completely. Nonetheless, it is the responsibility of the government to make sure that it returns excess tax to the people as it has windfall gains, and there is no doubt that in this last year the government has taken a much higher tax from the population than it thought it would. It is appropriate that there should be a return of much of that money to the Australian people. Of course, that money could also be returned by improving services. It is always an argument of politics as to where the balance lies. But, given the very substantial windfall to the Treasury in the last year, I do not think anyone would contest that there should be substantial tax cuts.</para>
<para>Labor has proposed very substantial tax cuts to provide some equity in the way in which Australian citizens share in that bounty. People who under the government’s present proposal would receive $6 will in fact receive $12 or more, while people on incomes of up to $100,000 will continue to receive quite a generous tax cuts. For example, under Labor’s proposal a person on $70,000 would receive $21.23. A person on $90,000 would receive $30.85. A person on $100,000 would receive $40.46. These are not insignificant tax cuts, I have to say. A $40 increase in your take-home pay is a meaningful thing for members of parliament, whose income is at about that mark. I am sure that would be regarded as a welcome thing by people in this chamber and others who earn that income. But what is more welcome by those on this side is that the return of that $24 billion is shared so that average workers who are earning their $40,000 to $50,000 at least get some greater recognition.</para>
<para>Labor’s response is a start in the debate which will continue past 30 June and past the date on which this bill is dealt with finally by the Senate. This is a debate that will continue for the next couple of years. There will be an interest at the next federal election in how tax policy is run in this country and in whether or not it is fair. In that debate, I challenge those opposite to stand before their constituents and justify a circumstance in which for two budgets out of three budgets—ordinary Australians received not one cent in tax cuts. And in the one year out of three in which they did receive a tax cut it was the princely sum of $6. What does $6 buy the average person or the average family today? You will not get much change from $6 if you walk into the corner store for a couple of ice-creams for your children. You certainly will not get much change out of $6 if you want to go and buy a hamburger. If, in fact, you want to buy anything at all, $6 will not go all that far. But over three budgets that is the full extent of the benefits that the Howard government has been willing to provide to ordinary Australians.</para>
<para>In the course of not just the next few weeks but the next two years I expect there will be very significant interest in this. I am more than happy to engage in that debate. Indeed, in a few days time my electorate newsletter will be distributed to about 65,000 homes in my electorate, and it is headlined ‘Big tax cuts for some and a Big Mac for most’. I am more than happy to have this debate with those opposite and with my constituents. I say that in the knowledge that, irrespective of whether they happen to be the fortunate few who will benefit from the large tax cuts or whether they are, like most, going to miss out, the people of Brisbane believe the system should be fair. Everyone I have spoken to in my electorate in the fortnight since the budget does not regard these tax cuts as fair. They are not fair, and it runs against the grain of ordinary Australians to see $24 billion—a very large sum of money—returned in tax cuts but only to a handful of people.</para>
<para>So that is the debate that is going to be had not just in the course of the next couple of weeks but in the next couple of years. There will be tax cuts, and I suppose, at the end of the day, if the government are not willing to change their legislation to make these tax cuts fairer, they will, after 1 July, have the power to do what they want in the Senate, and I guess that is what they plan to do. But they will do that in the full glare of public scrutiny with, I am confident, the people of Australia expressing the view that they think that is a wrong and unfair way for these things to unfold.</para>
<para>I think the provisions in this bill are unfair. They are unjust. It is, as I said at the outset, a triumph of self-interest over good public policy. As the Leader of the Opposition commented in his reply to the budget on the Thursday of budget week, anyone who thinks that people with Labor principles are going to vote to give themselves $65 a week extra while they give the people who we represent and who put us here $6 a week does not understand us.</para>

<para>—It has been illustrative to listen to members opposite endeavouring to paint the Labor Party position in the best possible light in the context of this debate in which the Labor Party are endeavouring to refuse tax cuts to ordinary Australians. It is no wonder that they have this long list of people lining up to try and spin their position into a positive one when it is pretty obvious that they will do anything they can to try and make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>But the reality in this debate is that the government is proposing tax cuts from 1 July, something that members opposite are not interested in doing. They do not want to do it. They want to stop those tax cuts. In fact, they have put up alternative schemes for supposed tax cuts under their plan that would happen as far away as 2008. They are talking about promoting something out there in the ether when reality requires, on behalf of ordinary taxpayers across Australia, the Labor Party to listen to the fact that tax cuts can happen from 1 July if they will only help. But they do not want to help. They do not want to assist.</para>
<para>Listening to members opposite, we heard a lot of contradictions. The member for Hunter said average coalminers in his electorate are earning $95,000 a year. He admitted in his speech that even with the best possible spin on the proposal from the Labor Party, compared to the proposal from this side of this House, Labor’s proposal would have ripped them off. That was the best that the member for Hunter could say about what he could offer average coalminers in his electorate. It is a terrible prospect for a Labor member to have to stand up and try to defend that. It is no wonder that they are trying their best to put a positive spin on it.</para>
<para>This, after all, is the mob that left Australia with a total debt of $96 billion. There would be no prospect at all of tax cuts if we were facing another deficit, if we were facing repeated deficits or if we had had deficit after deficit the way the Labor Party delivered. There would be no opportunity at all for tax cuts. The member for Brisbane does not even know how much a Big Mac is. He is misrepresenting even the most basic figures within the government tax package.</para>
<para>I want to remind members about some of the form of members opposite, because I think you will recall that there has been a lot of analysis of the way the government has worked to assist average workers in this country, to bring them ahead, to put them ahead of the game and to provide incentive for them to grow their wages and to climb what a former Leader of the Opposition used to call ‘the ladder of opportunity’. He has gone. He has obviously climbed off the ladder and disappeared off the top somewhere into the ether. Meanwhile, ordinary Australians trying to climb that ladder get their incentive from this government. That is where they get their incentive from.</para>
<para>If you study the tax to GDP ratio in this country, you will note that it has fallen from 23.5 per cent in 1996-97 to 21 per cent in 2003-04. I remember the member for Brisbane trying to drag the GST in. This is what members opposite always try to do. They try to present the GST as if it is some kind of stand-alone thing so they can use it to try and pump up this ratio to benefit their argument. In fact, their argument completely negates any of the offsetting taxes: the bed tax, the gambling taxes and the financial institutions duty; leave them all out of that argument. It is not surprising either, that the state Labor government are trying to cling on to those sorts of taxes. They are trying to cling on to them, because what does Labor stand for? They always stand for higher taxes. Do not listen to what they say; listen to what they do, because we have all been through the experience of listening to the l-a-w tax cuts and those kinds of things.</para>
<para>The Treasurer made a very good point in parliament when he went over a survey that was done of candidates for the 2001 Australian election. Do you remember those comments from the Treasurer? In the 2001 election, 84 Liberal Party and National Party members responded to the survey and, in particular, to the question: if the government had a choice between reducing taxes or spending more on social services, which do you think it should do? Eighty-four Liberal and National Party members responded to the question, and 65 of them said they would strongly or mildly favour reducing taxes. On that other side, 88 Labor respondents replied honestly to that confidential survey. Of them, only three said that they would be interested in mildly or strongly reducing taxes. It was exactly the inverse of the coalition position.</para>
<para>Now we have this kind of hairy-chested ‘We are going to cut taxes’ position being trumpeted by members opposite, and we know that it is a total furphy. It is a total crock. There is no way that the Labor Party, so long as the sun shines in the sky in the daytime and the moon comes out at night, will ever set about cutting taxes. Certainly, they will run up deficits and they will stick their snouts in the trough and produce all kinds of strange financial arrangements, such as the Centenary House fiasco. They will do those kinds of things, but they will never deliver tax cuts. We heard it when it was the l-a-w tax cuts—I will get to them a little later on.</para>
<para>Another issue that has been raging is the question of the extent to which the government has delivered real wage increases for ordinary Australians. This is something that I am very proud of. I have a paper here from the library which really puts down in black-and-white what the impact has been. There is a table for average weekly earnings for which there are three different columns. The first is headed ‘Full-time adult ordinary time earnings’; the second is headed ‘Full-time adult total earnings’; and the third is headed ‘Total earnings’. The data extends from November 1983 right through until February 2005, and the dollar amounts are shown in constant 2005 dollars.</para>
<para>Looking at full-time adult ordinary time earnings, in November 1983, under the Labor Party, the full-time adult ordinary time earnings of an average worker, stated as adjusted real earnings, was $779.20. Under Labor, that crawled up to $825.10 in February 1996. By 2005, under the coalition, it had jumped to $992.90. If you look at full-time adult total earnings, under the Labor Party they increased from $822.20 in November 1983 to $876.40 in February 1996. That jumped to a whopping $1,045.30 under the coalition in 2005. So, in 13 years, Labor delivered a miserable outcome compared to the coalition, which, in nine years, gave wage earners an absolutely improved position. I will get to the superannuation issue when we talk about the l-a-w tax cuts. I will get to the superannuation issue there and the kinds of furphies, nonsense and outright BS presented by members opposite when it came to the question of l-a-w tax cuts.</para>
<para>Again using the figures provided by the Parliamentary Library—and I think this is the absolute clincher—in terms of total earnings under Labor, in November 1983, $701 was the average total weekly earnings. Under Labor that declined. Over 13 years Labor produced a reduction in that figure from $701 to $697.30. They boasted about how they cut real earnings, and that is what they did—they reduced them from $701 to $697.30. It was a great red-letter day for the Labor Party when they cut the real earnings of ordinary workers. And what has happened at the other end of the scale after the coalition has been in power over this last nine years? There has been an increase to $788.50. That is absolutely chalk and cheese. On one side there was a decline in real earnings under Labor. This is something they absolutely hate; it makes their skin crawl, but it is true. The Labor Party just cannot match the coalition when it comes to delivering for ordinary workers. The Labor Party cut their wages; we increase their wages.</para>
<para>We have seen various positions put by the Labor Party. We could talk about the position raised by the member for Brisbane, who spoke about the Sheriff of Nottingham. He did not produce a tax cut that some people tried to say should have been greater; the Sheriff of Nottingham is the guy who came around and took your money. That is what the Labor Party did. Remember the l-a-w tax cuts that turned out to be nonexistent? They disappeared in the ether. If you compare the statements in Budget Paper No. 1 of 1993-94, presented by John Dawkins, with the budget statement in 1995-96 as presented by Ralph Willis, you will see they are chalk and cheese. One day it is there; the next day it is gone. That is the Labor Party for you. Do not listen to what they say—look at what they do.</para>

<para>—I will just observe that the member for Blair was supposed to be talking about the tax cuts that this government has introduced, and he rambled on about everything but. I just want to know why, when the amendment gets put, the member for Blair will be voting against Labor’s proposition to give a $12 tax cut to the vast majority of his electorate. So I rise today to support the second reading amendment that has been moved by the shadow Treasurer earlier today to the <inline ref="R2346">Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2005</inline>. Labor says that this amendment has been made necessary because this government passed up the opportunity in this year’s budget to introduce genuine tax reform for Australia—reform that could have addressed the high marginal tax rates confronted by ordinary Australians, that could have given real tax relief to Australian families, and that could have encouraged work force participation rather than great hesitation when both parents are deciding whether they should re-enter the work force following the birth of a child, or when those on welfare are deciding if they would be better off by re-entering the work force. Instead of tax reform, this budget has simply produced the big tax fiddle. But it is true to form for this government. The largest income tax redistribution this country has ever seen has occurred in this budget, from the working poor to the wealthy.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The government’s tax cuts raise three specific issues that I want to address. First, on top of the $66 billion that this government used to get itself re-elected last year, this budget provides a further stimulus of $38 billion, including $22 billion in tax cuts, thus adding to demand pressures in the economy and putting further upward pressure on interest rates. In other words, the first issue that I want to address is the sustainability of the measures that have been introduced in the budget. The second issue is the unfairness of the tax cuts. Never before has a government consistently taken so much from so many to give to so few. And the third is the reform failure inherent in this budget—the failure to use record company and personal income tax receipts to introduce genuine tax reform and genuine welfare reform to reward hard work, to create incentive and to encourage greater work force participation. It is a squandered opportunity.</para>
<para>This budget provided the government with the opportunity to rebalance growth in our economy. For too long this government has relied on domestic consumption and public expenditure to drive our economic growth. It has not created an environment conducive for growth enhancing capital investment; nor has it produced a strong export performance to ensure that net exports make a positive contribution to growth.</para>
<para>The unbalanced and therefore unsustainable nature of our economy is apparent from the state of household finances that have produced a consumption binge on the back of record high household debt and record low household savings. The government wants to claim credit for reducing public debt, but it has done it through higher taxation—the highest this country has ever experienced—and the introduction of user-pay charges for the services that people used to take for granted. In other words, the government has shifted the public debt to record private debt. In addition, continuing skill shortages and infrastructure constraints are further indications of excess demand in a number of sectors, creating supply bottlenecks and capacity constraints.</para>
<para>In an environment where domestic demand is exceeding supply and our worst ever trade performance has created record current account deficits and record foreign debt, Australia is paying a premium to service that debt, thereby putting upward pressure on interest rates. That is why Australia is suffering from the highest interest rates in the world. The government talks about how interest rates are low, but Australia has the highest interest rates in the world—higher than in the United States, Japan, the EU, Canada or Britain. This situation further undermines our international competitiveness, putting upward pressure on the dollar and hampering our export performance.</para>
<para>The government’s deceit on interest rates has already been exposed. Those opposite went to the last election promising to keep interest rates down. That promise was broken in March, less than six months after the election, when the Reserve Bank put interest rates up. That March rate increase has already more than wiped out the $6 a week tax cuts for Australians with an average sized mortgage. Just think about it. Before the government even gives the $6 that it is proposing in its tax package, it has wiped it out for people with an average sized mortgage in Australia. The government is giving with one hand and taking more with the other.</para>
<para>Far from easing interest rate pressures, this budget puts further upward pressure on interest rates. If another interest rate increase occurs, it will put most Australians even further behind. Do not just take our word for it. This is what the ANZ bank had to say in relation to this budget:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Much of the proceeds from the windfall gains from high commodity prices and strong employment growth has been given away rather than saved. This will stoke rather than constrain domestic demand. This is not a Budget to dissuade the RBA from their tightening bias and there is now an increased risk that rates will be lifted again.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I repeat that last point:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... there is now an increased risk that rates will be lifted again.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">What we have from this budget is not only poorly designed and unfair tax cuts but also, on top of the $66 billion splurge before the last election and the $38 billion of further expenditure in this budget, $104 billion in total that will exacerbate the upward pressure on interest rates.</para>
<para>There are different views on the impact the budget tax cuts will have on the domestic economy, particularly at a time when there is some conflicting data on the strength of the economy. We have seen the doubt raised by the Deputy Prime Minister because of the drought. The ink was not even dry on the budget when the Deputy Prime Minister was out there saying that growth would be revised down again. Nevertheless, it is clear that, if the government used the money to drive genuine tax reform, if it provided fair and equitable tax cuts and if it was more interested in producing a productivity enhancing outcome rather than a base political outcome, we would certainly have less upward pressure on interest rates.</para>
<para>As to the fairness of these tax cuts, they are grossly unfair. There can be no other description than that. They are tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit a few hundred thousand people and give a miserly $6 a week to seven million taxpayers. Never before has a government taken so much from so many and given to so few. The distribution is obscene, particularly when you consider that all of those earning less than $52,000 a year got nothing out of last year’s budget, and this year those earning up to $63,000 get only $6. Over the past two budgets, the government has spent $36 billion in tax cuts—$14 billion last year and $22 billion this year—but only $6 can they find for those on less than $63,000. Of the $36 billion in total, only $10 billion goes to the 7½ million taxpayers on less than $53,000. The rest goes to the people on higher incomes. What is fair about that? That is the question we asked ourselves. That is why we have moved the amendment before this House today.</para>
<para>The government’s tax cuts are skewed directly towards the highest income earners in this country. The maximum tax cut of $65 a week is available only to those with a taxable income of $125,000 a year or more. A mere 280,000 taxpayers will benefit from the maximum tax cut, while 7.4 million will receive just $6 a week. So 3.3 per cent of taxpayers get the maximum tax cut and 86 per cent get the minimum cut. Again, where is the fairness in that? This is a tax cutting budget that deliberately cuts out those who are most in need and those who are most deserving. It is a tax cut that deliberately excludes the great bulk of Australian working men and women who have contributed so much yet receive so little in return.</para>
<para>At a time when the government is rolling in tax revenue—and, let us face it, that is what it is doing because it still maintains the mantle of the highest taxing government in Australia’s history—it has squandered the opportunity to use the revenue to introduce real taxation reform in this country. When this government came to office in 1996, it had a tax base of $125 billion. It is now projected to collect around $190 billion this year and $219 billion by 2007. That is a massive increase in its nine-year period in office. No wonder people are feeling the pressure. This government is rolling in company tax revenue on the back of the resources boom generated by China, yet it still cannot bring itself to use the revenue for productivity enhancing tax reform.</para>
<para>Labor has an alternative plan—an alternative that rewards the many and not just a few, an alternative that will introduce genuine tax reform, restore incentive to our tax system and contribute to the much needed productivity boost that we now require. Labor’s plan will deliver $12 a week—twice as much as those earning $25,000 to $70,000. Over the next four years, a worker or single-income family on average weekly earnings will gain about $1,200 in tax cuts from the government. Under Labor, they would receive about $2,200 in tax cuts.</para>
<para>So there is an alternative and, as I have said on many occasions, budgets are about choices. But this government has chosen to ignore the many and reward the privileged few. Labor’s proposal is the type of tax reform that you can deliver if you operate on the basis of fairness instead of inequality, decency rather than greed and opportunity for all, not just for the few. Labor’s approach also recognises the need for incentive for those further up the income scale. We would therefore preserve the government’s tax cut for people earning from $70,000 to $105,000—a tax cut of between $21 and $40. We accept that people in those sorts of ranges are not rich. But Labor’s package for those over $105,000 would deliver a $40 tax cut, not the $65 proposed by the government. We believe that those on $105,000 plus are doing all right, and that the $40 can be effectively capped for them.</para>
<para>This question of taxation cuts has to go beyond where we go as a nation in terms of just dollars in the pocket. Labor’s plan is also about fixing a system that works against people who do the right thing—fixing it to restore incentive so that people are not punished when they work harder and try to get ahead. The current system consigns too many people to a life of welfare dependence and entrenched poverty. By restoring services and getting the incentives right, we will help people escape the poverty trap and realise their potential. There is nothing more Labor than that approach.</para>
<para>The respected Melbourne Institute has confirmed with its modelling that the tax package that Labor took to the last election would encourage more Australians to move off welfare and back into work—boosting participation and rewarding individuals but providing a participation dividend for the nation. Labor’s alternative tax package announced by Kim Beazley is based on our election model. It too will encourage more Australians to move off welfare and back into work. Our approach not only rewards the individual but also boosts participation. It is good for the individual, good for the economy and, importantly, good for society as well. This is the dynamic impact of Labor’s tax and family policy approach. It addresses the participation ‘P’ in the Treasury’s ‘three Ps’ analysis. The economy benefits because it grows faster with lower inflationary pressures. It is not just about fairness but also about driving microeconomic reform.</para>
<para>This government fails to understand the importance of incentive effects and the link with greater work force participation. It talks of the need, but it does not develop the policy to drive it. Only Labor does that. The government missed the point that the main obstacles to participation are a lack of life skills and skills and training, prejudice by employers to hire long-term unemployed or older workers, and the lack of incentive as high marginal tax rates cut in at relatively low levels of pay.</para>
<para>Labor has a plan to address these problems—a tax plan that will provide genuine relief and incentive to encourage Australians to get back into the work force, a plan to address the national skills crisis through a trade completion bonus of $2,000 for traditional apprentices who complete their training. The government’s only plan is to reward the wealthy now because politically it would be too risky to do so closer to an election. They should just be honest and admit that aspect. That is in essence what this budget is about. Labor’s alternative is to relieve financial stress where it is needed the most, via genuine tax reform, and to provide participation benefits through a combination of tax reform, greater education and training.</para>
<para>Australians are suffering under the highest taxing government in our history. Under this government there is no prospect of relief, as total government revenue is expected to remain at 23.1 per cent of GDP from next year right through to 2008-09. This government makes a virtue of essentially giving back dollops, unfairly, of what it is ripping out of people’s pockets—that is the fact of it. Yet, notwithstanding record levels of taxation income in personal tax, company tax and the GST—the tax it wants to collect but does not want to count, that it wants to say is reform but does not understand the impact that it is really having on people—together with the boost to national income from the best terms of trade in 50 years, this government is not prepared to bite the bullet on real tax reform. In opposition we are.</para>
<para>We are saying other real issues remain. Instead of fiddling with thresholds, what about cutting the rates, particularly the 42c rate? If there are any inflationary concerns and if we are serious about intergenerational issues, what about a tax rate on super contributions for all Australians, not just those at the top end? Labor is the only party prepared to consider these issues. It demonstrates through its amendments a fairer system which encourages greater participation—good for the individual, good for the economy. I want to see how many people on the other side vote against Labor’s amendments that will give a $12 tax cut to the vast majority of people in their electorates. Let them come here and deny justice to those hardworking Australians. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—The changes proposed in the <inline ref="R2346">Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2005</inline> will cut personal income tax for all Australians. From 1 July this year the 17 per cent marginal tax rate will be cut to 15 per cent, in proportional terms the largest tax cut on the amount of tax paid. The 42 per cent threshold will increase to $63,000 and the 47 per cent threshold will increase to $95,000. From 1 July 2006 the 42 per cent threshold will increase to $70,000 and the 47 per cent threshold will increase to $125,000. These tax cuts will ensure that over 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers will face a top marginal rate of 30 per cent or less over the next four years. The top marginal rate will apply to only three per cent of taxpayers from July 2006.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Senior Australians will also benefit. From 1 July 2005, senior Australians who receive the senior Australians tax offset will be able to earn more income without paying tax. Singles will be able to have a taxable income of up to $21,968, up from $20,500, and there will be no tax on equal incomes up to a joint $36,494 for a couple, up from $33,612. The Medicare levy threshold for senior Australians will also be increased to ensure that they do not pay the Medicare levy until they begin to incur an income tax liability. Currently, the maximum marginal income tax rate is around the average by international standards, but it cuts in at a relatively low income level, which harms work incentives and discourages skills acquisition.</para>
<para>OECD figures show that Australia has one of the least attractive personal taxation regimes. In the United States the top rate of income tax totals about 43c in the dollar, and it applies at $A425,000 of income. In Japan it comes in at the order of $A275,000 of income, and the level is about 46c in the dollar. In the United Kingdom it comes in at $A87,000, and it is 41 per cent. In New Zealand it comes in at $A55,000, and it is 39 per cent. Ours is 47 per cent and is currently legislated to come in at $70,000—hardly globally competitive.</para>
<para> Well-educated Australians, with the advantage of English as their first language, are highly competitive in the global marketplace. According to figures from the Business Council of Australia, a rapid increase has occurred in the number of highly skilled Australians leaving to work in other countries. The numbers of Australians living overseas on a long-term basis is rapidly approaching one million, and these are mainly the high-skill, high-value workers. Of course Australia also attracts immigrants, including skilled immigrants. But the balance has been closing. In 2001 to 2002, more than 80,000 specialist managers and selected professionals came to Australia on a permanent or long-term basis, but almost 50,000 left. These figures show that there is a growing internationalisation of the skilled labour market, and it is becoming increasingly important that Australia maintains its competitiveness.</para>
<para>Mobility of the highly skilled is likely to continue to increase due to the rapid growth of the Asian and other developing economies, pressures of ageing populations in other developed economies, the attractions of international careers as more firms operate internationally, and improved communications and travel services. The increase in labour mobility comes at a time when the rate of growth of overall work force numbers is about to slow dramatically for demographic reasons. In Australia the first baby boom generation are reaching the age range of over 55, where retirement rates increase. At the other end of the age range, the number of young people entering the work force will fall as a result of low birth rates.</para>
<para>On current trends, the rate of work force exit is expected to rapidly approach the rate of work force entry in Australia over the next 20 years. Even with current net immigration rates, this means that work force growth will largely cease. These changes combine to make it more urgent that work force participation rates increase and that Australia’s relative attractiveness, particularly for internationally mobile skilled workers, is maintained. The changes to the tax thresholds proposed in this bill will assist Australia in becoming more competitive in this labour market.</para>
<para>Highly skilled workers tend to earn higher taxable incomes, and high tax rates reduce the incentive for individuals and employers to invest in education, training and skills formation in the long run. Labor’s policy of simultaneously opposing tax cuts and claiming to support investment in skills formation by individual companies and workers therefore makes very little economic sense.</para>
<para>The top marginal tax threshold has moved from 19 times average earnings in the 1950s to just over 1.3 times average earnings today. Not only have the tax rate margins not gone up with income, but average property prices have skyrocketed and mortgage payments have gone up disproportionately to disposable income. The top marginal tax rate is now being applied to upper middle-income earners, tradespeople and people doing overtime and weekend work. The tax threshold increases proposed in this bill will correct this.</para>
<para>Projections are for a doubling of the population over 65 to around 25 per cent of the total population over the next 40 years, while growth in the population of traditional work force age is expected to slow to almost zero. Australia’s older worker participation rate is low compared to that in other OECD countries. The tax changes proposed in this bill will enable senior Australians to earn more without paying tax, therefore inducing greater participation rates. It is far better to allow people to keep more of their income, enabling them to contribute to their health and retirement costs.</para>
<para>The proposed tax cuts are not skewed in favour of the wealthy, as has been suggested. As a percentage of total tax paid, the biggest tax cut was for the poorest of workers—those earning between $10,000 and $25,000 per year. A family with two children can earn up to roughly $40,000 before they are paying net tax. With changes announced for the family tax benefit, likely inflation and social security rates, this will be around $44,000 for the 2005-06 year. Even with the tax cuts for those paying the top rate of 47 per cent, the top 25 per cent of all taxpayers will pay more than 60 per cent of all income tax collected.</para>
<para>Increasing the top marginal tax rate threshold may ultimately prove a boost, not a loss to government tax revenue, as it will discourage avoidance. When you have income tax rates that are competitive, people are prepared to pay them. Unfair tax rates encourage elaborate schemes designed to chase every cent of available deductions. However, if people comply with tax laws, the dollars ultimately are more likely to flow into government revenue.</para>
<para>There have been concerns by some that, although tax cuts are justified, they come at time when there is concern about inflation and they may act as a red flag to the Reserve Bank. However, the tax cuts represent less than 0.5 per cent of GDP next financial year, and in 2006 to 2007 they will still be less than one per cent of GDP. From the perspective of the Reserve Bank, the most important issue will be whether there has been any overall loosening of fiscal policy. With a surplus of $9.2 billion this financial year and an expected $8.9 billion next year, there has been no net effect on fiscal policy.</para>
<para>This bill proposes changes that encourage higher labour force participation across all age ranges and, importantly, increase Australia’s competitiveness internationally. However, the Leader of the Opposition has made a decision to block these tax cuts. The opposition’s hypothetical tax alternative offers low-income earners their full tax cuts in July 2008. Approximately 850,000 employers and approximately 10 million taxpayers will be disadvantaged because of the uncertainty in scheduling the changes that need to be implemented into their payroll systems. They are now faced with two sets of withholding tables from the Commissioner of Taxation. I implore the public to express their condemnation of this totally unnecessary delay.</para>

<para>—It is a pleasure to be able to rise in this debate on the <inline ref="R2346">Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2005</inline>. Those who were in the chamber at question time today would have seen some of the government’s heaviest hitters strutting, smirking and swaggering about the government’s budget and about this tax cuts debate—although, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you might well recall, much of the strutting, smirking and swaggering was actually about procedural matters associated with the House’s and Senate’s handling of these propositions rather than with the policy substance. But what is interesting is that when it moves on from delivering a cute one-liner in question time to actually trying to defend this package in detail in a 20-minute speech, you do not see too many of the government’s so-called heavy hitters presenting in this debate and trying to justify this package of tax cuts. I think there is no mystery behind that, because you do not need a PhD in economics to conclude that the government’s budget and these tax cuts fail on three counts.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Firstly, they fail on the grounds of fairness. They fail to deliver to those who need it most, particularly in the light of rising petrol prices, rising out-of-pocket medical fees, increased private health insurance premiums and the recent interest rate rise. Secondly, they fail because they put upward pressure on interest rates. This budget may have the effect of raising the Reserve Bank governor’s ire with regard to future interest rate rises. Thirdly, the budget and the tax cuts fail to provide real incentives to move from welfare to work. In particular, they fail to direct money where the biggest bang for the buck can occur—that is, at the lower end of the tax scale rather than at the upper end. The budget and these tax cuts fail clearly on those three grounds, and the government’s heaviest hitters have not presented in this debate to come to try to argue the contrary proposition. I suspect that they know it is unarguable.</para>
<para>I now want to turn to each of these areas in detail, but can I say that, on the first failure, the failure of fairness, there is not that much need to go to it in detail, because earlier speakers in the debate have clearly painted the picture of how unfair these tax cuts are. But I would like to remark that the impact of the Athens declaration on low- and middle-income Australia is truly astounding. Never before have we seen a budget, its processes and the policies it delivers so compromised by an impending leadership battle. On the eve of its delivery there was evidence and stories of last-minute rewriting and recasting of the so-called reforms, such as those delivered in the government’s welfare package and their tax cuts. We are all familiar with the stories of Treasury officials needing to work unexpectedly through the night because the budget was still in its development very late in the piece.</para>
<para>Let us be clear about the political rationale for this budget’s tax cuts. This budget is all about delivering to the government’s supporter base—that is, those on incomes far in excess of average weekly earnings. This was most certainly the if-you-have-it-flaunt-it budget, forgetting the vast majority of hardworking Australians. It is also a blatant case of the PM and the would-be PM jockeying for the support of their own backbench. So, rather than delivering to the economy a down payment for its future growth and prosperity, we have a budget which effectively acts as a down payment for an impending leadership struggle.</para>
<para>Without a doubt, these tax cuts deliver a bonanza to the wealthiest Australians. Contrary to the Prime Minister’s bluster, this is not about class; it is about fact. Fact No. 1: when we move to the income group occupied by the 10 per cent of Australia’s richest people, this government’s tax cuts deliver not in the hundreds of dollars but in the thousands of dollars—from a tax cut of $1,752 per year to a tax cut of $4,500 per year for those in the richest one per cent of Australia’s income earners. Fact No. 2: if we look at the other end of the scale, the poorest 25 per cent get an $80 tax cut, while the so-called middle get about $312.</para>
<para>Labor’s alternative delivers fairness by redistributing the very large gains at the top end to low- and middle-income earners who would have missed out or received very little from this government’s tax cuts. Labor’s policy delivers to those earning up to $25,000 a tax cut in the range of double what the government will deliver. Labor will deliver a $12 tax cut to those earning $25,000 to $70,000—double what the government will deliver. It will also deliver relief for those in the high-income bracket, but this relief will be proportionate and not penalise the ability to deliver relief to low-income earners.</para>
<para>As I said, fairness has been the much canvassed part of this debate, but let me put squarely before this House the two other tests in which this package fails. The second failure, of course, is that the budget and the tax cuts put upward pressure on interest rates. It is difficult to fully comprehend the rashness of this budget and these tax cuts without putting a fiscal context to the continuing largesse we have seen from the man who would be Prime Minister. If we look firstly at the outlay side of the budget and the net effect of policy decisions on it, we realise that the government has again broken its own records and allocated $38 billion on new spending in this budget. On the face of it, this is a phenomenal spend, and indeed it is closer to a pre-election budget spend. It exceeds every budget spend since this government’s election in 1996, except for the unprecedented $66 billion spend of the 2004-05 budget. This means that this post-election budget even exceeded the level of spending in the 1998 election year, when the coalition spent $20.6 billion in new money, and the 2001 election year, when they spent $25.6 billion in new money. This budget has managed to win some very odd records, and they are odd records that put a substantial risk onto the Australian economy.</para>
<para>The 2004-05 budget and the 2005-06 budget go down as the biggest spending budgets of all time. That is quite an accomplishment for a government which trumpets its economic credentials and campaigned on the basis of keeping interest rates down. But there are more records to be broken. It does not stop there. According to Saul Eslake’s economic team at the ANZ, in 2004 federal outlays grew by 10.75 per cent in real terms, which is the fastest rate of growth in over 20 years. If we turn to the revenue side of the budget and examine variations in the budget parameters, we can build on this picture of fiscal largesse. Parameter variations in the budget account for an additional $51.7 billion, which the government did not expect to hand down as part of its budget on 10 May. This means that changes to economic factors delivered the government an additional $51.7 billion to what was previously expected. Most of this is of course in taxation revenue. This budget, like its predecessor, has shown again how wrong Treasury’s revenue estimates have been.</para>
<para>In the 2004-05 budget, Treasury’s incorrect tax revenue forecasts contributed $34.6 billion to this budget’s bottom line. It is not far off the net effect of this budget’s so-called policy decisions. If we look at revenue forecasts as a whole, Treasury is very wide of the mark and its estimates contributed $43.64 billion to the budget’s bottom line. Placing these two aspects of the budget into their political context makes for some very interesting conclusions. On the fortnight prior to the handing-down of the budget, the Prime Minister was away from his post travelling overseas and showing all the signs of a Prime Minister with hubris—and let us remember that ‘hubris’ is a Greek word. In a flippant and offhand manner he threw down the gauntlet to his deputy, the man who wants to be Prime Minister, and so the prebudget bidding bonanza began.</para>
<para>With its leaders more concerned about jockeying for greater popularity, there appears to be widespread denial in the government about the apparent risks facing the Australian economy. There are a number of areas in this budget which draw particular attention to the potentially shaky foundations this bonanza has been delivered upon. The first sign of alarm comes from GDP growth forecasts and the puzzlingly optimistic nature of these forecasts in the light of warnings from the RBA, amongst others. GDP growth is forecast to grow from two per cent in 2004-05 to three per cent in 2005-06 and projected to grow slightly in the years following.</para>
<para>What is this forecast based on? Apparently we are told that it is based on ‘a rebalancing of economic growth in Australia from domestic to external sources’ and that this was ‘foreshadowed in the 2004-05 budget’. However, the Treasurer appears to be deluding himself as to the facts presented in his own budget papers—perhaps he is deluding himself also as to his leadership prospects. Over the past 12 months, the export growth forecast has been cut from eight per cent to four per cent and now, in 2004-05, is down to two per cent. The budget says that now it is expected to shoot up to seven per cent next year. But we know that, for the last four years, the government has persistently overshot with its export growth forecasts. It gets it wrong and it overestimates, so why should we believe it this time? But believing the government on that is fundamental to the rest of the budget, because it is one of the assumptions relied on.</para>
<para>The budget papers also talk about the current account deficit narrowing and the trade deficit becoming ‘markedly smaller’. Again, though, the Treasurer is deluding himself with regard to his own track record. This government has produced 41 consecutive monthly trade deficits, a record current account deficit of $56¼ billion and our highest ever foreign debt of $422 billion. This is notwithstanding record commodity prices, the highest terms of trade since the 1950s and brisk global growth. We have seen the value of Australia’s exports rising only eight per cent in 2004, just keeping pace with the eight per cent growth in imports and thereby increasing the trade deficit.</para>
<para>These forecasts are based also on household consumption moderating, leading to a rebuilding of household savings. The budget papers again state that recent wealth accumulation, high petrol prices and the recent rate rise will restrain consumption. With regard to the effect of the tax cuts on this, the budget states ‘some portion of the tax cuts is likely to be saved’. Again we are left to ask: where is the evidence of that statement? The government is relying on private savings by transferring the windfall from commodity prices and the Chinese boom to households. These households are more likely to keep spending, as they have done. We know—the facts show—that the household savings ratio has plummeted and is the lowest it has been in the last 30 years. This also has implications for Treasury’s outlook on growth and trade. There may be further risks if the stimulus to domestic consumption arising from record government spending generates an upside risk on imports and calls into question the forecast drop in import growth from 10 per cent in 2004-05 to eight per cent in 2005-06.</para>
<para>The Commonwealth Bank, in its post-budget presentation, also confirmed the risk that this budget poses to interest rates. It states that the longer-run concern is that this budget shifts policy to a pro-cyclical setting, due to discretionary policy increasing expenditure. The bank’s view is that this will provide a fiscal stimulus of about half a per cent of GDP in 2005-06 and three-quarters to one per cent of GDP in 2006-07. The OECD has warned about the use of discretionary policy changes because of their capacity to have a greater impact on the economy than automatic stabilisers. Not only has the government ignored this advice but also the size of the stimulus is an effective snub to such warnings. That is why Labor’s alternative tax cut plan figures on delivery from 1 January 2006 so as to allow for a cooling-off period in the economy and to help avoid raising the ire of the Governor of the Reserve Bank. Labor has pitched its tax plan deliberately so as not to put upward pressure on interest rates. That is not something Treasurer Costello concerned himself about at all in designing this budget or the tax cuts that are before the House tonight—and this has come from a government that campaigned on the basis that it would keep interest rates down. We know it has broken that campaign promise. Obviously this budget was drawn up and these tax cuts were designed without any concern for the government’s ability to keep that campaign promise in the future.</para>
<para>The third failing of the government’s tax cut plan is that it fails to provide real incentives to move people from welfare to work. Even after such a big discretionary spend, it is hard for the Treasurer to dress this package up as reform. It is also hard for this Treasurer to dress this up in any participation message. Let us face it: if the government had been serious about participation and delivering on its incentives message, it would have provided more carrot and less stick with its welfare policy and invested in reducing effective marginal tax rates at the middle to low end. For example, if the government is serious about participation, why not focus on effective marginal tax rates for all secondary earners in all households? Why just focus on single parents and DSP recipients? If the Treasurer, with his ‘demography is destiny’ mantra, were so serious about participation, why would he oppose Labor’s alternative proposal to lift the tax-free threshold to $10,000, which would directly affect about two million workers?</para>
<para>All the credible evidence suggests that improving incentives for low-income households would have the biggest impact on participation. So, if you are going to spend as much as this government did in the budget handed down a couple of weeks ago, why not make an investment in what is meant to be the key policy focus of this Treasurer? The Treasurer loves to talk the talk—‘demography is destiny’. He loves to pontificate about his <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational report</inline>. He loves to carry on about his so-called visionary view: the young man’s view of the problem of ageing in Australian society. He loves to try and scrub up his so-called credentials for leadership around these kinds of policy issues. But, when it comes to doing anything about it, even in a budget that has spent at the record levels of this budget, he does not do anything serious. He needs to be condemned and condemned strongly for that policy failure. It is certainly not something he has ever been able to explain.</para>
<para>We know that the <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational report</inline> and the more recent Productivity Commission report into ageing revealed that Australia’s population is ageing and that we face scary changes in the dependency ratio, which measures the ratio of those aged over 65 against those aged 15 to 64. This is an issue because the number of people who can participate in the labour market and contribute to our economic growth and prosperity has reduced. The big issue for the government is the impact this will have on the budget, in particular on key service delivery areas such as health. I believe we should remind ourselves of this point—a point that the Treasurer likes to talk about so much, but, when given the golden opportunity of the budget, he failed to move out from under the weight of his own ambition.</para>
<para>It is interesting to examine the factors surrounding the tax cuts and the flaws in the government’s approach in the light of the ongoing need to improve participation. I do not expect this Treasurer or this government to acknowledge the needs of those in our community who are most vulnerable. However, I do expect this government, after all its blustering and grandstanding, to act in a manner which does not conflict with the objectives of increased participation and improved incentives for all Australians, which is what Labor’s tax plan provides. Anyone in this House who is serious about keeping interest rates down, about fairness and about welfare-to-work would vote for Labor’s amendments. This government’s budget will only deliver greater hardship to the most vulnerable in our community. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talker>
<para>—I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important bill, which will cut taxes for all taxpayers in Australia. The <inline ref="R1811">Taxation Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2003</inline> will be of great benefit to my electorate of Casey and for Australia as a nation. The debate on this bill says so much about the difference between those on this side of the House and those opposite. It illustrates quite clearly and with great clarity for the Australian people that this side of the House stands for tax cuts and that the other side of the House will do everything they can at every opportunity to oppose tax cuts, just as they have done right through their period in opposition.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In the last few days the other side of the House have demonstrated complete policy hypocrisy, total policy confusion and an incompetence that threatens to handicap all of Australia’s businesses as they go about preparing for the inevitable tax cuts. That is the nub of the issue in this debate. Those opposite know that they will not prevent the tax cuts and that all they can do is delay them. But by threatening to do that they will cause great hardship to the many small businesses in my electorate and in the neighbouring electorate of McEwen. The opposition will cause great difficulties for businesses right across Australia as they go about their daily job of passing on those tax cuts. The businesses of Australia will not forget that. They will also not forget that, when the Labor Party have a choice between cheap political opportunism and doing the right thing by the business community, they will always choose the former.</para>
<para>I will address one point that the member for Lalor made, which again demonstrates complete policy confusion on the other side. She claimed that the government’s proposed tax cuts may put pressure on interest rates. She presumably did this based on the economic stimulus they will provide, which amounts to $21 billion, yet she seems oblivious to the fact that Labor’s alternative plan will cost $3 billion more—$24 billion. That is another illustration of Labor’s complete and utter confusion on this issue.</para>
<para>We are debating this bill tonight, when just two weeks ago we were about 10 minutes away from the budget being handed down. Those opposite in the leadership group had already taken their decision in the budget lockup to defeat this bill if they could—to vote against it in the House and to vote against wide-ranging tax reform that will drive Australia forward. In the last two weeks we have seen confusion on their side about how they will go about what amounts to a simple, cheap, oppositionist stunt.</para>
<para>The bill builds on the great reforms of 2000. These tax cuts will take place in two stages. From July this year the 17 per cent rate will be reduced to 15 per cent, which will benefit all taxpayers. Thresholds will be extended so that the 42 per cent rate will not cut in until $63,000 and the top rate of 47 per cent will cut in at $95,000. From July 2006 there will be further increases in those thresholds, to $70,000 and $125,000 respectively. The quantum of those changes will create greatly needed incentives—reward for effort and international competition. It will encourage Australians to work harder in the knowledge that they will benefit. It will ensure that 80 per cent of taxpayers will pay no more than 30c in the dollar, which the government has always tried to ensure through its tax reform programs. These will build on the substantial reforms of the past. In 2000 the government introduced what were then the biggest tax cuts in Australian history, and further tax reform in 2003 and 2004 increased the thresholds.</para>
<para>It is worth going back to look at the tax reform story on personal income tax to see the alternative that those opposite really offer. It is worth repeating these tax scales. In 1996 the tax free threshold was lower—it was $5,400 compared with $6,000 today. The soon-to-be 15 per cent rate that is in this bill was 20 per cent. The now 30 per cent rate was 34 per cent and cut out at $38,000; from 2006 that will be $70,000—nearly double. The now 42 per cent rate, which was then 43 per cent, cut out at $50,000—that is, the tax rate of 47 per cent applied from $50,000 onwards. That will be $125,000 in just over one year’s time—2½ times where Labor had the top tax rate cutting in. This is important because it is the tax system Labor had; it is the tax system they preferred; and, by virtue of the fact that every step of the way since 1996 they have opposed all of our tax reforms, we know that, given a choice, that is the tax system they would prefer.</para>
<para>Of course, it is not just in the area of personal income tax that we have reduced the tax burden for Australians. There is also the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate that was introduced; the effective halving of capital gains tax; the introduction of a comprehensive family tax benefits system, which has seen family assistance double from $14 billion in 1996 to around $27 billion today; and, as we saw in last year’s budget—again opposed by those opposite—the introduction of the $600 per child payment.</para>
<para>The reality of today and tomorrow under this bill compared with the days of Labor is quite stark. Labor gave us higher personal income taxes, higher tax rates, lower thresholds, no private health insurance rebate at all, no family tax benefits of the type we have, no annual payment of $600, an effective doubling of the capital gains tax as it applied and, of course, that host of indirect wholesale sales taxes that they were prepared to defend and argue for right throughout the 2000 election. There were wholesale sales tax rates of 12, 22 and 32 per cent on some goods but not on others. That is Labor’s alternative.</para>
<para>As I said at the outset, we know that Labor oppose tax reform because of what they have done in opposing government legislation. The true irony in all of this is that Labor have not just voted against our tax cuts—they will not just vote against these—they have voted against their own. The last tax cuts proposed by a Labor government, the government of Paul Keating, were the infamous l-a-w law tax cuts, which were legislated but voted against by those opposite when they had their chance in government. You would not get a clearer illustration in the House of Labor’s opposition to tax cuts than that. Nor would you get a clearer illustration than listening to the now Leader of the Opposition when he spoke about tax when last he led the Labor Party in those days leading up to the 2001 election. Of course, we know that he opposed the introduction of tax reform in 2000. On the day before the Aston by-election in 2001 he was asked about income tax and I think honestly gave his own view, which is the view of those opposite. The people of Australia ought to know it. Neil Mitchell on Melbourne radio asked the question:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... are Australians paying too much income tax?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The Leader of the Opposition’s reply was:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">No I don't believe so and I will say that with some vigour.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That was the truth of Labor’s position then and it is the truth of their position now. The Australian public ought to know and ought to know with great clarity that Labor fundamentally are opposed to low income tax. That is what is at stake with this legislation from Labor’s philosophical perspective.</para>
<para>The pointlessness of their position is that, as I said at the outset and as previous speakers have said, by virtue of the change in the Senate majority in July, Labor will not stop these tax cuts. They will be implemented. All they can do between now—this week and next week—and then is delay them through an obstinate refusal to agree to the government’s mandate. Some of those opposite, such as the member for Franklin, Harry Quick, know this is a crazy position. We have seen the laughable situation today in the caucus where they took a decision not to take a decision. Harry Quick, renowned as a member who speaks his mind, said quite openly: ‘There was a fair bit of angst there’ and ‘Let’s be honest. Why should we delay them’—the public—‘getting the six bucks?’ I can tell members opposite that that is what the public think. They cannot understand this obstinate refusal to delay tax cuts and the business community cannot understand the obstinate wish to cause a paperwork headache and a difficulty for them.</para>
<para>This is a far-reaching bill that will help drive the economy forward and create the sort of success in the future that we have had in recent years. Some of those opposite know it. I would implore them to do the right thing by their electorates and vote for this bill. For the people of Australia who have Labor members, watch how they vote. A vote by a Labor member against tax cuts now is a surety that if Labor ever had the chance in government again they would be voting to increase taxes. That is a choice that Australia faces on this bill.</para>

<para>—I rise to support the opposition amendments to the <inline ref="R2346">Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2005</inline>, the consequence, of course, of Peter Costello’s 10th budget or John Howard’s 16th budget, depending on whose leadership aspirations you are supporting. It must be reiterated that both the PM and the Treasurer were trying to capture support with this budget—the support of the business and those wealthy and loyal Liberal Party donors. Keep watching for the follow-up legislation—the direct debit legislation that makes it easy for those rewarded donors to anonymously sign over the tax cut bonuses straight into coalition campaign accounts.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The aim of any budget should be to deliver responsible fiscal policy that achieves or sustains desired levels of growth in the economy and distributes national wealth according to the needs of economic and social policy. I suppose the Treasurer felt he was in a strong position to distribute national wealth—or some of it at least, because he also wanted to stash some away in the future Costello for PM fund, given that he had an $8.9 billion surplus to play with. He and the Prime Minister frequently say, ‘That surplus belongs to you and we are going to give it back to the people who really own it.’ I have heard those words before:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It’s your money. My proposed tax cut will give you a chance to set your priorities for your family. It says that we in the federal government have a fundamental trust in the people …</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Was that Peter Costello or John Howard? No. Those were actually the words of George W Bush, but they clearly use the same text book of spin when they are about to swindle and mislead the people.</para>
<para>That statement, ‘It’s your money’ would be defensible if the people had directed where government money had been spent and if they were satisfied that the surplus was just that—surplus to requirements. But I think most Australians have a wish list that has not been fulfilled by this government, a list that includes some strategic approaches to funding training and retraining; funding knowledge and  innovation; funding infrastructure that sees water, energy and exports flow; funding that means we do not fear for the health and wellbeing of our family and friends or for our environment; and strategic funding to assist the workforce participation that most Australians desire and to ward off the approaching demographic tidal wave.</para>
<para>But when we look at the distribution of the Howard-Costello tax cuts we know that strategic economic reform was not on the agenda and we know that the only people who will have any freedom to set their personal funding priorities for their families will be those earning over $100,000 per year. So just remember, when you hear the Treasurer use the word ‘prudent’ when he talks about tax cuts, be sure to substitute the word ‘obscene’. If this budget were a fiscally responsible budget and not a ‘Look at me: I’ll be a great leader of the country’ budget, then it would have responded to the most pressing constraints on economic growth while ensuring that growth did not become inflationary and result in further interest rate rises. So let us  see how it measures up.</para>
<para>The stated aim of this bill is to cut personal income tax for all Australian taxpayers. It cuts the marginal tax rate from 17 per cent to 15 per cent, increases the 42 per cent threshold to $63,000 and then later increases the 47 per cent threshold to $95,000 and to $125,000 in 2006. The bill also seeks to amend the Medicare Levy Act to increase the income threshold that applies to taxpayers who are eligible for a senior Australians tax offset. That is nice and tidy. It sounds like everyone gets something, but let us look closer, just like Labor did when they saw this in the lockup for the first time.</para>
<para>The tax cuts proposed are skewed heavily towards the highest income earners, with the maximum tax cut of $65 a week available only to those with a taxable income of $125,000 or more, which is 280,000 taxpayers. The maximum tax cut available to those earning up to $63,000—the rest of the 7.4 million taxpayers in Australia—is a paltry $6 a week. Under the government’s package 90 per cent of taxpayers share 55 per cent of tax cuts while 10 per cent get 45 per cent of the value of the tax cuts. That does not sound fair to me.</para>
<para>An independent analysis of the government’s tax package by Australian National University academic Andrew Leigh, released today, found that 19 per cent of the government’s tax cuts will flow to the richest five per cent of households while the bottom 50 per cent will get an 11 per cent share. That is how obscene it is. And where are those richest five per cent of households most concentrated? Embarrassingly for the government, they reside in the plush blue ribbon Liberal seats of Higgins, held by Treasurer for PM Costello; North Sydney, held by Minister Hockey; Bradfield, held by Lord Nelson; Warringah, held by the minister for ironclad, rock solid safety nets; and of course Wentworth, the seat where I assume the most money has ever been spent on a Liberal Party preselection.</para>
<para>These tax cuts cannot be construed as a fair redistribution of the common wealth in anybody’s language. But this does not stop the Prime Minister from trying to justify his position. His assertion today that under his government the bottom 60 per cent of taxpayers have experienced net gains from the tax system at the expense of the top 40 per cent is ludicrous. To begin with, even with these tax cuts the Howard-Costello government remains the highest taxing government in Australia’s history, with total tax of almost $235 billion projected for this year. This is an increase of over 100 per cent since Howard came to office. Tax per taxpayer has risen by over $12,000 under Treasurer Costello, and the GST continues to weigh heavily on Australian families. By 2008-09 the GST bill per household will be almost $100 per week.</para>
<para>Since the GST was introduced in July 2000 average income earners—the same people who are looking to gain just $6 per week—will have had a total tax cut of just $10 per week while taxpayers on $125,000 will have had tax cuts amounting to $119 per week. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer argue that they have delivered more dividends to Australian families in the form of handouts and election bribes—those $600 and $1,000 quick election fixes. But it is never to be forgotten that those handouts depend on government largesse instead of sustained tax reform. This government has missed a great opportunity to engage in long-term reform of the taxation system. Instead the Treasurer has opted to spend $22 billion on personal income tax cuts without delivering any real reform. These are tax cuts pure and simple, with no pretence to being part of an integrated strategy of reform to boost participation or productivity.</para>
<para>I am always interested in what the government’s legislation means for my electorate, the people of Newcastle, so I would like to share some brutal realities with the House. In Newcastle there are almost 85,500 people aged 15 years and over who have an annual income of less than $65,000. This represents 91.1 per cent of all persons aged 15 years or more in the electorate of Newcastle. They will be thinking about that $6 a week. This means that in 2005 more than 91 per cent of Novocastrians will be getting a measly tax cut of just $6 per week, all so that Peter Costello can give $65 tax cuts to Australia’s highest earners, including his Liberal party mates sitting opposite, the same backbenchers he will be relying on for votes in any leadership challenge. The 91 per cent of taxpayers in Newcastle who are bearing the brunt of this government’s unfair tax cuts also missed out on tax cuts last year—dudded again.</para>
<para>With an average total income of just $44,011 in 2005, the overwhelming majority of Novocastrians stand to gain very little from the government’s tax cuts. Yet these are the very people who have worked hard to make this economy strong. Shamelessly, this government is unwilling to recognise their contribution or adequately recompense them for it. Seventy per cent of wage and salary earners in Newcastle are under 45 years of age. They are the hardworking families that Labor are trying to help with our alternative plan for fairer tax cuts. They are the people with mortgages and the families who are doing it tough. Miserly tax cuts of just $6 per week fail to compensate low- and average-income Novocastrians for bracket creep and for the rises in the costs of housing, health, education, child care and basic services that they have experienced under the Howard government. How can this government justify rewarding its own parliamentary members with a tax cut ten times the size of the cut it is willing to give to over 90 per cent of taxpayers in Newcastle? Shame.</para>
<para>The government fails to even blush at the Treasurer’s proposition to reward his colleagues, the ones who are considering where to lay their bets in the Liberal leadership’s golden slipper race. He is obviously just pursuing tax cuts for the rich while letting more than seven million workers carry more than their fair share of the tax burden in this country. How dare members opposite think that 91 per cent of taxpayers in Newcastle should be grateful for the crumbs that they are fed by this government. Coming on top of the proposed loss of 450 jobs at the University of Newcastle and a 10 per cent decline in business confidence in our region over the past year, the people of Newcastle can be forgiven for thinking this government just does not care about regional economies. For people earning less than $65,000, the $6 a week tax cut has already been wiped out by $339 per month in broken promises, including increased costs of child care, private health insurance and the Medicare safety net. Add the extra costs of interest rate rises to home mortgages and the ongoing burden of the GST and this tax cut looks pretty miserable. Certainly it is miserable for nine out of every 10 taxpayers in my electorate.</para>
<para>Labor’s position is one based on Labor values: what we stand for, fairness and equity. These are simple principles that dictate that wealth is good but greed remains one of the seven deadly sins. Avarice is an excessive desire for gaining and possessing wealth. We were clear from the beginning. Labor opposed these tax cuts because equity and fairness are Labor’s way. Labor’s response highlighted the unfair distributional outcomes and the government’s failure to adequately address high effective marginal tax rates for low-income earners who are trying to move from welfare to work.</para>
<para>The Leader of the Opposition’s budget reply outlined an alternative tax proposal which could be delivered for around the same $24.1 billion cost as the government’s personal income tax reductions and the abolition of the superannuation surcharge. It called for the government, from 1 January 2006, to cut the tax of people moving from welfare to work by introducing a welfare to work tax bonus. It sounds like reform to me. This should replace the existing low-income tax offset and, when fully implemented, fully offset any tax on the first $10,000 taxable income for people earning up to $20,000 a year. It would also extend the income range where the 17c marginal tax rate applies by raising the threshold where the 30c rate applies from $21,600 to $26,400. This is all to improve incentives for low-income earners to work and to deliver a tax cut of $12 per week for low- and middle-income earners.</para>
<para>From July 2006, Labor’s plan would extend the income range where the 30c marginal tax rate applies by raising the threshold where the 42c rate applies from $63,000 to $67,000. This is to compensate for the effect of bracket creep on middle and higher income earners and ensure at least 80 per cent of taxpayers pay a marginal tax rate of 30c in the dollar or less. That sounds like a competitive tax regime. It would also extend the income range where the 42c marginal tax rate applies by lifting the threshold where the 47c rate begins from $80,000 to $100,000. Again, this will improve the competitiveness of our tax system.</para>
<para>This government really should accept Labor’s tax amendments and its plan. It is affordable, it is achievable and it helps more people than the alternative. Labor’s plan over the four-year period would deliver a $12 tax cut for those earning from $25,000 to $70,000—double what the government is offering. It preserves the government’s tax cut for people earning from $70,000 up to $105,000. It means a worker or single-income family on average weekly earnings would, over the next four years, gain $936 more and it also means a dual-income family on $85,000 would, over the next four years, gain $1,872 more. These savings are considerable for working families. The Treasurer has said that families on $40,000 are doing it tough, so I imagine he should have no qualms at all about supporting Labor’s fairer tax plan.</para>
<para>Labor’s alternative tax cut approach detailed in the amendments is not only fairer than the government’s tax cut fiesta or fiasco but also improves the competitiveness of our tax system and actually comes much closer to moving everyone toward the lower tax rates desired to minimise tax avoidance or minimisation schemes. It is worth noting that earlier this year the member for Wentworth made the honest observation that the wealthiest in our community do not need a tax cut, because they can easily participate in tax minimisation schemes. And of course they do. It is just a pity that, unlike the members of the opposition, his colleagues—the Prime Minister and the Treasurer in particular—took no notice whatsoever of this self-evident position.</para>
<para>It is important in concluding to canvass the impact of the government’s tax cuts on interest rates. In his February statement to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, the Reserve Bank Governor took an exceptional position and warned the government of the need for economic reform to sustain the 14 years of economic growth experienced by this country. This was seen as a clear signal to the government that monetary policy could influence the interplay between demand and supply to maintain economic growth but that only the government through fiscal policy could institute reform that would reposition the economy and allow it to take advantage of the current economic opportunities. The governor focussed his attention on capacity constraints such as infrastructure, especially ports and export transport chains, and skills and work force shortages. It was suggested to the government in his statement that, without that reform, the risk of wage increases and the inability to maintain commodity and resources export levels was unavoidable. In March, the Reserve Bank of Australia lifted interest rates, signalling that they felt demand and consumption were still high, reinforcing their concern that demand continues to outstrip supply and that our current account deficit escalates unchecked.</para>
<para>What was the government’s response to these very sound warnings? It was to increase skilled immigration, to move more people from welfare to a cheaper version of welfare and to deliver significant tax cuts for the rich. As for infrastructure, the responses that we have seen so far include an increased spend on roads, insufficient funds to the ARTC and the deputy leader’s post-budget proposal to regulate ports—not exactly the impact and reform for supply constraints that I think the Governor of the Reserve Bank was looking for. Spare me and spare the Australian people and our economy from this wasted opportunity.</para>
<para>Interestingly, the recent admission by the Australian Bureau of Statistics that last year’s retail sales figures were understated suggests that this budget was not the time to fuel demand without doing anything about the constraints on supply. So if we feel the pain of another rate rise this year, we know who will be ducking for cover. That is when the budget will get the best State of Origin flick pass between the Prime Minister and the Treasurer ever seen. Labor’s alternative is to identify, plan and manage the infrastructure needs of this nation, to provide real incentives for people to enter the work force through reforming the effective marginal tax rates and to deliver fairer tax cuts that are economically and socially responsible.</para>
<para>Finally, members opposite have a very simple choice. They can either vote to help seven million Australian workers and their families by supporting Labor’s fairer tax cuts or they can vote to feather their own nest and play the odds in the leadership Golden Slipper.</para>

<para>—As has been noted many times, and will continue to be noted, the opposition show their total difference in understanding of the Australian economy. It is more than just being about ideology, it is more than being about basic political beliefs, which I am sure all of us bring to this place—it is the fundamental difference, the fundamental incapacity to understand what it takes to run a decent economy. I understand from the Labor Party’s perspective how they might want to talk about fairness and compassion, to highlight the difference and to play to the political marketplace, but you cannot escape from their fundamental lack of understanding on how an economy works.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The attack has been on the Treasurer. I remind the House that at the last election in October 2004—not that long ago—the Labor Party told the Australian people ‘a vote for Howard is a vote for Costello’. That is exactly what the people did—they voted for John Howard and Peter Costello as the great success team leading an executive and leading a coalition with John Anderson to one of Australia’s golden periods. ‘A vote for Howard is a vote for Costello’—and that is exactly right. This is such a good budget because we have Peter Costello as the Treasurer.</para>
<para>This issue of difference, of the incapacity of Labor to understand what it takes to run and create an economy, is just so basic. I am astounded that an opposition would be so comprehensively defeated at successive polls and still go back and do what it is doing on the <inline ref="R2346">Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2005</inline>. It just has not got the message. I will quote from some Labor colleagues. Kevin Foley, Deputy Premier of South Australia, stated:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Look, I think tax cuts to working South Australians are welcome. I think there is a strong argument, as has been put forward by my Federal Labor colleagues, that they could have been much better targeted at lower to middle income earners. It seems to be extremely skewed towards high income earners, I have to say, but tax cuts in the main I think are what the community expects from government ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Kevin Foley is saying that tax cuts are good. He is having a bit of a bob each way but, at the end of the day, the people expect tax cuts from government. Paul Lennon, the Premier of Tasmania, stated:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">At the end of the day, the Tasmanian community wants the tax cuts delivered and had I been in the Federal Labor caucus I would have been advising them not to block the tax cuts. ... nor would I have said, if I have the opportunity in the Federal Labor caucus, that it was a smart political tactic to block the tax cuts. It is never a smart political tactic to do that.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Bob Carr, Premier of New South Wales, when asked if Labor should be rejecting tax cuts, had this to say.</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">BOB CARR: Listen, you’ll have to go to Federal Labor.</para>
<para class="block">KIM LANDERS:—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">obviously the interviewer—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">And no amount of prodding from journalists would get him to budge from that line.</para>
<para class="block">BOB CARR: You’ll have to go to Federal Labor.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Bob Carr is clearly dodging the issue and saying, ‘You have to talk to federal Labor.’ Paul Lennon was very clear. Bob Carr’s is noted for his candour and in this case he just dodged it completely.</para>
<para>That is the sideshow. Let us go to the fundamentals. What works? What does not work? I am blessed with four adult children. Just about all of them have worked overseas in the international community. This generation of young adults know pretty well what is happening around the world, much more than my generation ever did. They know what a tax cut is, what competitive wage rates are and what is a fair thing. If you look at all the economies of the Western democracies, you will see that Australia was basically lagging behind in the competitive tax rate. Through my own children I know just how foolish Labor’s position is.</para>
<para>Let us be even more basic. What is the best thing that anyone can have in order to escape the welfare net or to become a positive citizen of Australia? The best thing they can have is a well-paid job. Whilst the opposition want to criticise the government for not spreading the tax cuts across the population in some equity deal, they totally fail to understand that you have to have people in the economy in a particular way which creates a stronger economy. You do not have to go back very far to be reminded what the unemployment rates were under Labor. It goes back to this basic issue of Labor not understanding how to run an economy. A job, for the average Australian, is their best ticket to their future, so let us not have any misunderstanding that the way these tax cuts are structured will give an even stronger outcome to an economy which is already strong.</para>
<para>It is more than incentive. It is more than what is fair. It is actually the basic understanding, which this government has, of what it takes to create a stronger economy: more jobs and less reliance on welfare. That is the essential nature of this budget, and we cannot even be accused of doing it for political purposes. We have a little way to go until the next election and this is the first budget after the 2004 election. The issue is about the creation of a stronger economy. It is about creating a future particularly for those who still do not have a job and about making sure that those who want to have a job in the future can keep their jobs. It relies on the right balance. The issue is not about dividing the existing cake; the issue is about creating a bigger and better cake.</para>
<para>Let us go through and tick-off on the general success of this government since 1996. It is well-documented; there is no argument. It is straightforward. Under this government there have been higher real wages, lower real interest rates, lower capital gains tax, lower income tax, the lowest unemployment rate for 30 years and the highest family payments ever. And in this budget there is a focus on carers and on the treatment of cancer and dementia. The basic proposition that the opposition are putting to the government, to the treasury bench and to the people of Australia is that somehow giving a few dollars in a different way to somebody else is going to make the difference. It just shows how much they miss the point. They have totally ignored the management of the economy for almost the last 10 years. This economy has almost got rid of its Commonwealth debt. This economy is, I would venture to say, just about one of the strongest economies, in performance, in the Western world. But that totally misses the point that you do not get to this situation by wishful thinking and by cheap political stunts.</para>
<para>It is well documented how the coalition got to this position, but can I finish up by telling the House of one of my favourite reminders about the difference between the government and the opposition, a theme which I started my speech with tonight. The fundamental difference is that the government knows that if you spend too much time fighting about the existing cake and not enough time creating a stronger and better cake you will not make progress as a nation. An example is the old Work for the Dole. I have been around long enough to remember when all the money that went into Working Nation, or whatever we called the Labor programs, had about a one per cent permanent job outcome. It cost about $100,000 per job outcome. And then along we came—we had a very strong endorsement from the people in 1996. We introduced a trial—just a pilot—called Work for the Dole. Of course, it was howled down by our opponents, who said it was the worst thing that had ever happened, that the sun would not rise tomorrow and all the usual political rhetoric. But let us look at the outcome some years on. Despite the opposition’s critique and mindless abuse of the program, it cost us about $3,500 or $4,000 per Work for the Dole participant. It achieved something like 30 per cent to 35 per cent long-term job outcomes. And now, believe it or not, the Labor Party support it, and they say they can do it better. This sort of stuff is the humbug of politics. It is why the people of Australia despair of their politicians. The people of Australia understand what it takes to run a decent economy and that is why we have been re-elected regularly since 1996. I implore the Labor Party—I should not but I will, because I think it is good for the parliament and for the people of Australia—to give us decent opposition. Do not give us these cheap stunts and nonsense, which you know are going to go nowhere. Get some policies, get a life, get on with your job of being the opposition and give us decent competition, because the people of Australia need it.</para>

</talker>
<para>—Before I go to the body of my speech, I would like to pick up on a couple of points that the member for Grey made. One was when he was talking about his children who are young adults—how they have different expectations, how they have worked overseas and how they know what is happening in the world. The member for Grey is very fortunate in that his children are able to work overseas. They certainly do not represent the great majority of young people within Australia.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The other words I have for the member for Grey are that he should look at the wage and salary earners and the income distribution within his electorate. If he did that, he would see that the average wage of all people working within his electorate is $31,813. That is based on the census figures; it is probably a little higher than that now. Those people would not be looking to get large tax cuts. They would be looking to get $6 a week. If the member for Grey was truly representing the people who put him in this parliament, he would be arguing for the Labor Party tax cuts. Later in my speech, I will go a little bit more into the package that the Labor Party is putting before the parliament.</para>
<para>Unfortunately for the people of Australia, the <inline ref="R2346">Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2005</inline> is unfair legislation—legislation that demonstrates the Howard government’s philosophies and priorities. Its philosophies and its priorities are designed to look after high-income earners and people with significant material wealth. In true Howard government style, it is legislation that gives large tax cuts to the few and small tax cuts to the many. Just to draw that out a little further, the tax cuts proposed by the government are so heavily skewed towards high-income earners that the maximum tax cut of $65 a week will be available only to people earning $125,000 a year. The majority of taxpayers will just get a $6 a week tax cut.</para>
<para>We on this side of the parliament do not think that that is fair. We do not think it is good enough. We think that people that earn lower wages and people that are middle-income earners, people that battle to put food on the table and pay the mortgage—the mortgages that have recently gone up with the rise in interest rates—deserve a bigger bite of the cherry than this government is proposing to give them. We do not think it is good enough. That is why we have come up with a much better package. There is still plenty of time for members of the government in the House and the Senate to abandon the farce that we are debating here today and deliver real tax reform and real tax cuts to the Australian people.</para>
<para>This legislation is not—I repeat: is not—designed to deliver real tax reform. Rather, it is legislation that has its foundation in the belief that it is the right of higher income earners to pay less tax, just as it is the obligation of low-income earners to pay a greater percentage of their income in tax. On many occasions in this House, we have seen just how mean spirited the Howard government is. This government saw a surplus and decided it should reward the wealthy. It put aside the needs of people who are battlers. It totally disregarded the pensioners and people who really rely on the government to ensure that they are looked after as well as people on high incomes. Unfortunately, this government and this legislation do not do that.</para>
<para>It is very disappointing because the budget was a unique opportunity for the government. They had a surplus. That surplus could have been used in many ways. Instead of being imaginative or entering into real tax reform, they decided to give themselves a pay rise—more money, greater take-home pay—and to disregard people who work so hard and for such long hours and to give them a tax cut of $6 a week.</para>
<para>Recently I was talking to a young guy who works on the railway. He works very hard—does 12-hour shifts. He thinks he is doing pretty well when he manages to bring home an annual wage of $35,000 a year. This young guy has a backache. He constantly hurts himself at work. But he dare not take a day off, because he does not have job security. He worries all the time. He has bills to pay. What do I say to him? Do I say: ‘Congratulations. The government is giving you a $6 a week tax cut, I, on the other hand, am going to get a massive tax cut’? I am truly embarrassed by it.</para>

<para>—What I intend to do with my tax cut is give it to the community in one way or another. I am not going to be putting it in my pocket. I am truly embarrassed by it. I hope that the members on the other side of this parliament feel the same way. You should go out into your electorate and talk to people who are struggling on a day-to-day basis. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Science and Training, who is at the table, may smile, but there are truly people who cannot afford to go to the doctor, buy medication when they need medication or even dress their kids properly for school. To smile about that really sickens me. I am here in this parliament to see that all Australians get a fair deal. I do not think that this piece of legislation delivers that.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I will go through what this bill seeks to do, although I am sure that many members have done that before me. This bill amends the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 and its purpose is to reduce income tax in the way that was outlined by the government in the budget. The lowest marginal tax rate will go from 17c to 15c. The bill increases in two steps the top two personal income tax thresholds. The tax amends the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to increase the income threshold that applies to taxpayers who are eligible for a rebate under section 160AAAA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. Currently, if you earn between $6,001 and $21,600 you will have a 17c in the dollar tax rate. The proposal is that that will go down to 15c in the dollar—that is the tax that you will pay, so you are getting a 2c in the dollar tax cut.</para>
<para>As I said earlier, the tax cuts proposed by the government are heavily skewed towards high-income earners. If you earn between $21,601 and $63,000 the rate will be 30c in the dollar and for $63,001 to $80,000 it will be 42c in the dollar. That is the current situation and it is proposed that the top level will be lifted to $95,000. Currently, if you earn above $80,001 you pay 47c in the dollar in tax. That level is going to be lifted to $95,000 this year. Next year that is going to be lifted to $125,000. Guess what? For those people who are earning between $6,001 and $21,600 the amount of tax that they will pay in the dollar is not going to be lowered. The threshold is not going to be lifted at the bottom end. It is not going to be lifted up to, say, $35,000. Those people are still going to be paying 15c in the dollar.</para>
<para>These tax cuts are really skewed towards people on high incomes. It seems to me that the parliamentary secretary—I hope soon to be shadow parliamentary secretary—is getting quite confused with what I am saying. If he has a look at the tax tables, he will see that I am quite correct in the figures that I am using. Under the government’s proposed tax package, 45 per cent of the value of tax cuts goes to the top 10 per cent of taxpayers and the remaining 90 per cent of taxpayers share the other 55 per cent of tax cuts.</para>
<para>The Labor Party’s response to these tax cuts really highlights the unfair distribution outcomes and the government’s failure to adequately address high effective marginal tax rates for low-income earners moving from welfare to work. This government use a lot of rhetoric talking about welfare to work. Included in this budget that they brought down are some very punitive measures that will be directed towards single parents and people in our community who are amongst some of the lowest-income earners and are most likely to end up in poverty. This government will be introducing into this House, and detailed in its budget, legislation that is very punitive to those people.</para>
<para>The government also introduced legislation that is very punitive to people with disabilities. As recently as last week, I was talking to a doctor who said: ‘I don’t know what I’m going to do. I have this patient who I believe should be on a disability support pension, but after the budget that this government brought down, I don’t know whether I can say to that person that I can fill out these forms.’ This budget and this legislation are just so full of anomalies and are obviously designed to hit those people who look to the government for help harder than those who are at the top end of the income scale.</para>
<para>Our tax package, as outlined by the Leader of the Opposition, will cut the tax of people moving from welfare to work by introducing a welfare to work tax bonus. It should replace the existing low-income tax offset and when fully implemented it will fully offset any tax on the first $10,000 taxable income of people earning up to $20,000 a year. That is real reform and a real tax cut that would help people in the greatest need, not this package that we are debating here in parliament where the government is delivering itself and its members great tax cuts. As I have already said, that is something that I find quite obscene.</para>
<para>Our tax package will extend the income range where the 17c marginal tax rate applies by raising the threshold where the 30c rate applies from $21,600 to $26,400. Once again, that is a change that will deliver real relief to people who need it the most, improve incentives for low-income earners to work and deliver tax cuts of $12 per week for low- and middle-income earners. There will be further reforms after July 2006, which will help people at the higher end of the scale by moving the 42c rate from $63,000 to $67,000. The 42c marginal rate applies by lifting the threshold where the 47c rate begins from $80,000 to $100,000. I believe that they are real tax reforms—tax reforms that will help the people that I represent in this parliament.</para>
<para>Earlier today in question time I asked a question of the Prime Minister. I asked him how he could look seven million Australian workers in the eye and tell them that they deserve $6 a week tax cuts when he was spending $250,000 on chairs for his cabinet ministers. I was appalled at the answer I received from the Prime Minister. It showed me that he did not understand the real issues for people out in the electorates. So I went back to my office and I thought about it for a while. I thought, ‘Why is it that he gets such a different message to the message that I get from the people that I represent?’ I think part of it can be answered by looking at the incomes of the people in the electorate that he represents.</para>
<para>If I could just turn very quickly to Bennelong, I will make a comparison between the incomes that people in that electorate receive and the incomes of those in the Shortland electorate. Within Bennelong only 12 per cent of people earn less than $10,400 a year. Within Shortland it is 13.5 per cent. In Shortland electorate, 3.8 per cent of people earn over $78,000 a year. In Bennelong it is nine per cent. The comparison with Bradfield is even starker. In the electorate of the Minister for Education, Science and Training 20.7 per cent of wage earners earn over $78,000. That is based on the last census data. This budget and this legislation is rewarding those people that are in the Prime Minister’s electorate, the minister for education’s electorate and, for that matter, the Treasurer’s electorate—he also has a significant number of people in that top bracket. Once again, in the Treasurer’s electorate of Higgins 14.3 per cent of people are earning over $78,000. It is quite a different situation when you look at Shortland electorate. Similarly when it comes to average wages, in Bennelong the average wage is $42,057—once again, based on census figures—in Bradfield it is $59,199, in Higgins it is $50,603 and in Shortland it is $35,889. This says  to me that we have got a government that is showing total disregard for the people of electorates like Shortland.</para>
<para>What puzzles me, though, is how you can have someone like the member for Dobell stand up in this House and support this legislation when his electorate is very similar to my own. In Dobell the average income is $35,256. Only 3.5 per cent of the population earn over $78,000, and 13.4 per cent of people are on incomes of under $10,400. It says to me that we have got members on the other side of the House that are not in touch with their electorates. They need to get out there; they need to talk to people. They need to talk to the real people in their electorates and listen to them. I have not received one complaint from one constituent about our action in opposing these tax cuts. Rather, I have had a number of calls and correspondence from constituents stating how obscene they believe it is that members on that side of the House can vote for big tax cuts for themselves while increasing— <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Under this proposal every Australian taxpayer gets a tax cut. There are a number of other things that the member for Shortland said that I think need addressing. The budget that was handed down on 10 May contained some very sensible measures to provide assistance for people to go from welfare to work. The government, unlike the Labor Party, actually believes that people on DSPs deserve to be assisted to move into work if they are so capable of doing. That should be welcomed by people on both sides of the House. I know it is welcomed by people in my electorate who are on DSPs and who want the assistance that is required so they can go into the work force and make a contribution. Finally—this is my absolute favourite—the member for Shortland thinks that the Prime Minister should have trouble looking workers in the eye. I can only quote his words. He said that he and this government are the best friends that Australian workers have ever had. There are a myriad statistics to back up that claim, including increases in real wages, something that previous Labor administrations have never been able to achieve.</para>

<para>—I do. And I think the Australian people have spoken on who they think is listening to their real concerns. In contrast to the member for Shortland, I rise to support the <inline ref="R2346">Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2005</inline>. The day that it passes is going to be a great day for Australian taxpayers, because it gives them much needed relief. It gives the government a chance to give back to those taxpayers some of their hard-earned cash.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The measures that this bill will implement have been very well received in my electorate—in particular, lowering the marginal rate of tax from 17 per cent to 15 per cent, because that is a tax cut for every single Australian taxpayer. I think that bears repeating: every single Australian taxpayer will benefit from that tax cut. Other measures contained in this bill include increasing the personal income tax threshold for the 42 per cent and 47 per cent brackets. For the coming financial year, the 42 per cent rate will cut in at $63,000 and the 47 per cent rate will cut in at $95,000. But the good news does not stop there, because in the following financial year, 2006-07, the 42 per cent threshold will again be increased to $70,000 and the 47 per cent threshold will be further increased to $125,000.</para>
<para>The sum total of these measures is that 80 per cent of taxpayers will be in or below the 30 per cent tax bracket. That is a remarkable statistic—80 per cent of Australian taxpayers will be in or below the 30 per cent tax bracket. This will allow the government to increase the incentives and rewards available to Australian workers, as well as to increase the competitiveness of the Australian taxation system in relation to other developed economies, yet I have been astonished in this debate to hear speaker after speaker on the other side rise to oppose the government giving some money back to Australian taxpayers—although I do not think any of the marginal seat holders in the ALP have yet stood to show their resolve to do so. I think that is an interesting fact. As a member who holds a Liberal marginal seat, I could well imagine how members opposite must have greeted the news from their leadership group when they emerged from the budget lockup that they were going to oppose tax cuts for every Australian taxpayer. I think their plight was best summed up by a senior Labor source—he did not put his name to the quote—who said the next day ‘We have just blown our brains out.’ I think that sums up how I would feel if I were the holder of a Labor marginal seat.</para>
<para>Why would you oppose a tax cut for every single taxpayer—from the lowest to the highest paid? Why would you oppose hardworking people getting a bit of tax relief? I note from the comments of some of the previous speakers that the Labor Party has wrapped up some of its opposition to these measures by reverting to rhetoric of the class war—the rich versus the poor, the needy versus the wealthy. But what Labor Party members do not realise is that this country has moved on. This chip on their shoulder, this us versus them mentality, is not reflected in the Australian community anymore.</para>
<para>One of the things that I was most proud of in taking the seat of Stirling from the Labor Party was that the Labor Party had always taken this area for granted. Suburbs in my electorate such as Balga, Mirrabooka, Westminster and Nollamara, where in the past the Labor Party polled up to 75 per cent of the vote, were where we won the seat. It was those booths that swung to us by up to 12 per cent at the time. This result was not just mirrored in Stirling; it was mirrored all over the country. It happened because working people knew that it was the coalition who was looking after their interests and who would continue to look after their interests.</para>
<para>The historical ties that the Labor Party has generally had have weakened in the face of the consistent results that have been achieved through management by the Howard government. It has provided real increases in wages and tangible increases to people’s standard of living. This is a lesson that the Labor Party needs to learn: it takes more to represent people than just saying that you do. You cannot come into this place and profess to be a friend of Australian working men and women and then abandon them, like the Labor Party did to the forestry workers of Tasmania. The Australian people are not mugs. They understand if people genuinely want to protect them or if they are pandering to an altogether different constituency.</para>
<para>Opposing this bill is really an example of some of these misplaced sentiments. Hardworking taxpayers deserve a break. They do not want the Labor Party to pursue a futile policy that is only going to confuse and delay the implementation of these tax cuts. And I expect that many outside the leadership group in the Labor Party would agree. In fact, some of them have even been prepared to go on the record opposing what the party has said that it would do. I can tell you that the people of Stirling certainly agree. Consistently trying to attack these sensible measures on the grounds that this is tax relief for the rich is truly absurd. Does the Labor Party really believe that a plumber in my electorate on $70,000, with a couple of children, feels wealthy? He does not. What he thinks is that he is slogging his guts out day in and day out and that he deserves a break. I would agree—and fortunately so does the government.</para>

<para>—I would like to address another furphy that has been put around by the Labor Party in this debate, and that is the relative size of the tax cuts that are on offer through this bill. Lowering the threshold from 17 per cent to 15 per cent is going to give our lowest paid taxpayers a tax cut of over 18 per cent. That is 18 per cent of their total tax bill.</para>

<para>—The reality is that this cut is larger in relative terms than the tax cuts that have been offered to workers on higher wages. This is a tax cut to people who are actually paying minimal tax in the first place. The reason higher income earners will receive a larger tax cut is that they pay more tax. These are the people who are actually carrying our tax system, yet the opposition wants to deny them the opportunity to keep a little more of their money. To characterise these people as rich and therefore somehow undeserving of this tax relief really defies the reality that they know within their own lives.</para>

<para>I, like most members on this side of the House, believe in lower taxes. I believe in it, as does the member for Moncrieff, for economic reasons, but I also believe in it for moral reasons.

<para>—I defy you to come up with any statistics that would prove that case. Governments just do not come into office and print money; they need to get it from somewhere, and we get it through the blunt instrument of taxation. The people we take it from have inevitably worked hard to earn it in the first place. In return for taking the taxation, the government provides them with services. It provides them with roads, health care and social security. But governments, once they have provided these services, should always—and, I believe, in every circumstance—return any surplus of funds to the people who have paid the tax in the first place. This government has done so and has a very proud record of doing so. Beyond the measures which we are debating here today and which were brought down in the recent budget, the coalition has always endeavoured to return excess taxes to their original source.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I will digress to provide a bit of history of when the coalition came into office in 1996, because, when we did, hidden from the public view by some very creative footwork by the now Leader of the Opposition was a $10 billion black hole in the previous government’s accounts. This fiscal time bomb that Labor had desperately hidden from the Australian people in the lead-up to the poll was topped off by a mind-blowing $96 billion of government debt. That debt gobbled up resources in interest payments that could have been better spent on providing services to the Australian people. Faced with the consequences of Labor mismanagement, the coalition was required to fix up their mess. So the Treasurer, the Prime Minister and the executive went about paying Labor’s bills and then they balanced the budget. They were so successful that we were able to give tax cuts to the Australian people in the years 2000, 2003 and 2004 and now again in 2005—a record that I am sure you will agree is a very impressive one.</para>
<para>I would be the first person to say that we should never be complacent about tax and that we should always be looking at ways to reduce the tax burden on all Australians. That is why I was so pleased to see another round of tax cuts in the budget on 10 May. The futile resistance that is offered by the Labor Party is going to achieve absolutely nothing, apart from generating confusion and adding unnecessary compliance costs on those involved in the taxation industry.</para>
<para>The tax cuts proposed in this bill are cuts that people in Stirling and across the country deserve. They are tax cuts that Labor should not oppose. To oppose these tax cuts is nothing more than vandalism and serves no useful purpose. I look forward to this measure being passed into law—as it inevitably will be—and I look forward to Australian workers getting access to a bit more of their hard-earned money.</para>

<para>—In my contribution to this debate on the <inline ref="R2346">Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2005</inline> I want to concentrate on two areas: one is the equity dimension of the proposed tax changes and the other is the economic impacts of the entire budget, seen particularly in terms of the tax package and the pattern of expenditure that is provided in these proposals.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We have just heard from the last speaker, the member for Stirling, and others who have gone before him that those on low and middle incomes who receive a tax cut of $6 a week should be grateful because this is a massive 18 per cent tax cut. It seems to me that these members are saying, on the briefing paper that the Treasurer is giving to them, that when these taxpayers go into a shop and say, ‘I would like to spend my 18 per cent tax cut,’ the shop owner would say, ‘That’s fine; have whatever you want because 18 per cent is a really large number.’ But, in fact, $6 is $6. No matter how you look at it—no matter how you cut it—six bucks is six bucks, and $65 is $65. For the Treasurer and Liberal members opposite to come into this parliament and say that $65 is a small percentage tax cut and $6 is a large percentage tax cut and therefore it is fair is absolutely outrageous and is an affront to the intelligence of every semi-intelligent member of this parliament.</para>

<para>—We now have another member saying: why; what is wrong with that? It demonstrates clearly the difference between Liberal and Labor. We have a Liberal member of parliament saying, ‘A $65 tax cut is a fair tax cut for people on higher incomes and a $6 tax cut is a fair tax cut for people on lower incomes.’ But even then they do not tell the full story, because, when we have used the $65 figure, we have not included in that the impact of the abolition of the superannuation tax surcharge. The true figure for someone earning an income of $125,000 is a tax cut—when taking into account the impact of the abolition of the surcharge—not of $65 a week but of $94 a week. So let the Liberal members of this parliament come clean and say that what they are truly advocating is a $94 a week tax cut for people on $125,000 a year and a $6 a week tax cut for lower- and middle-income earners. This is the Liberal definition of fairness, and that is what sets aside the Australian Labor Party from the Liberal Party in this country. We do not consider a $6 a week tax cut to be fair when it is contrasted with a $94 a week tax cut for people earning more than $125,000.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Another fabrication on the part of the government—in this case, on the part of the Treasurer—is an assertion that the Treasurer made the day after the budget at a National Press Club function held in Parliament House when he was talking about the tax cuts. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">These tax cuts are significantly in advance of bracket indexation.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He was arguing that the government has given back more than bracket creep over the period of this government. In order to construct that misrepresentation, he has to count the year 2000 tax cuts. But I recall that in the debates in this parliament in the year 2000 we were debating not just income tax cuts, which incidentally we voted for, but a monster new tax called the GST. The Treasurer came in here and said—and they argued in the Senate—that those tax cuts were at least partial compensation for the impact of a $36 billion GST. Now they want to double-count it and say, ‘Well, it’s giving back bracket creep.’</para>
<para>The Australian Labor Party, when in government, gave back all of bracket creep and more, giving seven tax cuts in 13 years. However, for the Treasurer to sustain an argument that this government has given back bracket creep, he has to take into account the compensation for the GST. But this government never counts the GST. It is the orphan tax. It is the tax that dare not speak its name. This government has manipulated the budget of this country, its public accounts, to exclude the GST. Go through Budget Paper No. 1 and look at the revenue figures as a share of GDP. Any way you want to cut it, try to find the three little letters G-S-T. You cannot. It is the orphan tax. It does not exist, as far as this government is concerned. Yet, on the day that the government introduced the GST, it abolished the untied grants to the states—$18 billion. It seems that is clear evidence that it was introducing a massive new tax, otherwise where did it get the money from to compensate the states when it abolished their untied grants? We know that the GST is a Commonwealth tax. The Australian Statistician knows that the GST is a Commonwealth tax. The Auditor-General knows that the GST is a Commonwealth tax. Everyone in Australia knows that the GST is a Commonwealth tax except Liberal members opposite, who continue to persist with the ludicrous argument that the GST does not exist or is a state tax.</para>
<para>Based on official budget forecasts, I have looked at individual income tax collections and forecasts as a share of GDP as one measure of whether the government is giving back bracket creep. If you do not count the impact of the GST, it is true that in the year 2000 personal income tax as a share of GDP fell from 13.4 per cent to 11.6 per cent. But thereafter it builds up again—and why? Because of bracket creep. In 2004-05, it is estimated to be 12.3 per cent. It then drops away a little because of these tax cuts targeted towards the upper income brackets. But, as a share of GDP,  by 2007-08 it is up to 12.2 per cent and then by 2008-09 it is up to 12.4 per cent. That is evidence that, inherent in the tax scales announced by the Treasurer two weeks ago, there is bracket creep.</para>
<para>Who is paying for the bracket creep? If the abolition of the superannuation tax surcharge is taken into account, we know that people who are earning more than $125,000 a year will get a tax cut all up of $94 a week. So who is footing the bill? Of course, the forgotten people are footing the bill—the shop assistants, the cleaners, the account clerks and those who work in factories. The forgotten people—those earning less than $1,000 a week who missed out on a tax cut last year—now have to be grateful for a tax cut of $6 a week. However, the insidious effects of bracket creep will eat away at those tax cuts from day one. Not for one day or one dollar does the government give back bracket creep to the forgotten people. They are the ones footing the bill for people who are on $125,000 and more a year. The money does not come out of thin air. The budget is in reasonably good shape because, in large part, the forgotten people are paying, through bracket creep, for the tax cuts that are going to higher income earners in this country—and this government has the temerity to say that is fair!</para>
<para>The irony is that the phrase ‘the forgotten people’ was crafted by the Prime Minister’s idol, Bob Menzies, who identified these people as the backbone of this country. Yet this government has been fleecing them, giving them a couple of years ago what Senator Amanda Vanstone described as a sandwich and milkshake tax cut. She said it was a pitiful tax cut. It was $4 a week. If $4 a week is a pitiful sandwich and milkshake tax cut, what is $6 a week? It is also pitiful. It is a sandwich and a milkshake and half a sandwich again. That is about it. And the Liberals say, ‘We’re looking after the working people of this country. We represent the working people of this country. They’re going to be grateful for their $6 a week tax cut—and why? Because it is 18 per cent.’ What a ludicrous argument. The Treasurer says, ‘Well, we’re giving back bracket creep.’ But they are not, because the forgotten people are footing the bill.</para>
<para>Why did the Treasurer provide such large tax cuts to higher income earners? Why did the Treasurer decide to abolish the superannuation tax surcharge for higher income earners? Because on budget night about 80 or 90 of them were sitting behind him. Never have the public finances of this country been so abused by a Treasurer seeking to achieve his own aspiration. Talk about the aspirational class! The Treasurer’s own aspirations were reflected in that budget. As we sat here, the two biggest cheers were heard when the Treasurer announced the lifting of the threshold for the top marginal rate of income tax to $125,000. Why did people cheer? Because they knew they were on at least $105,000 and would get a big tax cut. But on budget night a bigger cheer went up—not in the interests of this country, but in the interests of those sitting behind the Treasurer—when he said, ‘And remember that horrible superannuation tax surcharge that I introduced in 1997, which you pay? Well, I’m going to abolish it for you.’ Yes, there was a big cheer. The Treasurer is seeking to get the support of his party room colleagues for his tilt at the prime ministership and, in order to do so, he has abused the public finances of this country.</para>

<para>—I withdraw. I do not want to spend a lot of time on the Treasurer. Amongst the members sitting behind the Treasurer there was a ginger group—that is not my phrase; it is a self-appointed phrase—who want the abolition of the top marginal rate of tax. But they will be disappointed, because the Treasurer told the National Press Club that he is lifting the threshold but he will never abolish the top marginal rate of tax. I do not often agree with the Treasurer, but on this occasion I do. There is not a case for abolishing the top marginal rate of tax, especially when people on lower incomes pay much higher effective marginal tax rates than the 48½ per cent that the ginger group bleats about. So there you go: that is this Treasurer’s and this government’s idea of fairness.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I want to go to some of the economic impacts of this set of proposals. Mr Deputy Speaker Baldwin, you will recall in this parliament, and indeed before last election, Labor saying that the government had embarked upon an irresponsible $66 billion spending spree designed to get the government re-elected. It did not invest in the nation’s future, in education and skills, in new ideas and in infrastructure; instead, it was just a spendathon. Labor warned about the stress that that would put on interest rates and, of course, it all happened. In March the Reserve Bank increased interest rates by one-quarter of a percentage point because it knew that consumer spending was out of control. Instead of reining in consumer spending, this government poured petrol onto the flames of rampant consumer spending, and interest rates rose. Labor’s critique before this budget was that a $66 billion spending spree was financially irresponsible and would put pressure on interest rates—and it did.</para>
<para>The spending spree is now $103 billion. If a $66 billion spending spree puts upward pressure on interest rates, then a $103 billion spending spree surely does. Just recently, in the past week, the Australian Bureau of Statistics belatedly revised upwards the estimates of retail sales. When you combine that with a couple of other realities—for example, the very low unemployment rate, which I welcome, but it is certainly a sign of a tight labour market; job vacancies being the highest in 26 years; labour shortages; and problems in capacity utilisation, which is the capacity that the economy is being exhausted by this spending spree—then that is all evidence that spending is outstripping the capacity of this economy to supply it. When that happens, the pressure gets expressed in one of two ways. It spills over to imports, and it has sure done that. Despite the best terms of trade in 50 years, we have almost the worst current account on record. We have the fourth-biggest current account deficit in the world and we now have skyrocketing foreign debt. When the government rolled out its debt truck in 1995, foreign debt was $180 billion in 1995. It is now $422 billion. At some point the rest of the world will apply a larger interest rate premium, given that already our interest rates are the third highest in the world. They will say, ‘This spending spree cannot go on.’ Foreign lenders will then apply an interest rate premium, which will increase interest rates. That is one channel through which interest rates can rise as a result of the irresponsible spending spree of this government. The other channel is even more direct: spending is up against capacity, which can generate—and there is evidence that it is generating—inflationary pressures in this country.</para>
<para>Domestic prices have been growing beyond the Reserve Bank’s target range, but that has been offset by a strong dollar. This means that the price of imports is relatively low for Australians. That has been an offset to the strong increase in domestic prices. But we are just about at the end of this commodity price cycle. The reality is that the Australian dollar is a commodity currency. If we are at the end of the commodity price cycle, that would suggest a stronger possibility of a depreciation in the Australian dollar. Depreciation in the Australian dollar will force up import prices. So, rather than the external sector being an offset to strong domestic price pressures, this will exacerbate them. If this happens towards the end of this year or next year, the Reserve Bank will say: ‘What is our one job? What is our role in respect of stabilising the economy? It is to keep inflation down. The inflation figures are now outside of the Reserve Bank’s target range. We must do our job and increase interest rates.’</para>
<para>If that happens, what about the $6 a week tax cut? It will vanish. The Liberals, on the opposite side of parliament, say the people of Australia are very grateful for the $6 a week tax cut. They say that people have said, ‘Please give us the $6 a week tax cut.’ Will they be grateful if and when their mortgages go up by another quarter of a percentage point—and perhaps even beyond that? Those tax cuts will be gone, and they will not thank this government for embarking on an irresponsible spending spree that took away the tax cuts—and far more—in the form of higher mortgage interest repayments.</para>
<para>The government has embarked on an irresponsible spending spree and then made it worse in this budget. Mark my words: I want everyone to know—and many Labor members have spoken in similar terms—that, if interest rates do rise, the responsibility for that interest rate rise will rest squarely with this government and with this Treasurer. These irresponsible tax cuts and this irresponsible budget have targeted the high-income end. The forgotten people will be smashed by interest rate rises, if that is how everything works out, with a depreciating Australian dollar or domestic price pressures. That is my critique of this budget. Labor are acutely aware of this and have been making this point time and time again. That is why Labor’s tax cuts would start on 1 January. We recognise the dangers of pouring more fuel onto the fire. Labor’s tax cuts pass the test of fairness and economic responsibility, and the government’s tax cuts and budget fail on both of those counts.</para>

<para>—When I sit in this chamber and hear the member for Rankin start talking about how he is concerned about interest rates and hear him crying crocodile tears for low-income earners in Australia, I am forced to think back on the track record of the Australian Labor Party when they had 13 years in government. What did we see from the Australian Labor Party—those who would come into this chamber to lecture the Howard government and to lecture Peter Costello about economic management? What is their track record that would lend to them a notion of credibility or perhaps some semblance that they have a position of authority on which to make a contribution to this debate? The reality is that they do not have any credibility and they do not have any authority. When they come into this chamber it is nothing but the sound of a hollow drum clanging.</para>
</talk.start>

<para>The reality is that the Australian Labor Party was an abysmal failure when it came to the economic management of this country, and it has taken up until this very day for the Howard government and the Treasurer, Peter Costello, to repair the damage that the Australian Labor Party inflicted on the people of Australia. Under the Australian Labor Party we saw a reduction in real average wages, we saw public debt reach $96 million and we saw the deficit—the Beazley black hole, as it was called—reach some $10 billion in Kim Beazley’s final year as Minister for Finance and deputy leader.</para>
<para>From my perspective, the Australian Labor Party ought not to come into this chamber and lecture the Liberal Party and the National Party about economic management; they ought to come into this chamber to get a lesson. This should be an opportunity for the Australia Labor Party to fill those few opposition benches that they can and hear how they have made mistakes in the past and what they need to do to correct mistakes in the future. The Australian Labor Party—the member for Shortland, the member for Rankin and others who have spoken in this debate—talk about how they are so concerned about the inequity of the fact that we are providing Australian taxpayers a $6-per-week tax cut on average, with a higher amount for those earning in the top tax brackets. I say to them: let us face the facts and let us look at the actual tax cuts in terms of percentages, because that is the real measure—the percentage tax cuts to different individuals.</para>
<para>The Australian Labor Party likes to bandy around this notion of inequity on the basis of saying that there are so many Australians who are only receiving a $6-a-week tax cut. But the reality is that those Australians do not pay as much tax as Australians on higher incomes. If you do not pay as much tax, it is very difficult to give you a larger tax cut in real dollars. The reality is that those taxpayers who pay lesser amounts of tax are getting a much greater percentage tax cut than those who are paying top marginal tax rates. What is more, due to the fact that the Australian Labor Party are motivated by nothing but cheapjack opportunism when it comes to this debate and will come in here and pitch class warfare until their ears and noses are bleeding and make sure that they appeal to the very base instinct of Australians when they try in some way to pit those Australians who are on lower incomes against those Australians who are on higher incomes, I say to them: you ought to be ashamed not of the fact that you are getting a $60-per-week tax cut but because you will appeal to the most base instinct in a pathetic attempt to try to secure some additional votes.</para>

<para>—I understand that the truth hurts and perhaps, in a wounded capacity, the member for Sydney is concerned because she knows that what she is denying her constituents is the opportunity for real tax cuts right now under the Howard government as opposed to what is in fact a charade by the Beazley opposition that would deny hardworking, ordinary Australians a tax cut—and for those on low incomes, a tax cut of some 18 per cent.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The Australian Labor Party come into this chamber and argue that they are concerned with equity and fairness and because of this fact they actually oppose tax cuts of 18 per cent to average, decent, ordinary, hardworking Australians. They go further than that. I was having a look at the Australian Labor Party web site and I saw that they are actually having a radio campaign. They have been wasting taxpayers’ hard earned money—money for which they are paying through the nose for Centenary House—on radio advertisements to try to prop up their failing opposition leader, Kim Beazley. They are doing it on the basis of claiming that the tax cuts that this government are offering are unfair. The tax cuts are fair. The tax cuts that we will introduce, whether it is with the cooperation of the Australian Labor Party or without it, are tax cuts that we believe provide incentive and motivation to people to go out there and work hard. On that basis I say to the Australia Labor Party: get out of the way and get behind these tax cuts—make sure that those people who you pretend you are interested in being advocates for in fact enjoy the benefits of an 18 per cent tax cut and, what is more, ensure that you do not provide disincentive on an ongoing basis by denying people the opportunity to hang onto the dollars that they have.</para>

<para>— I rise in the House to raise again, as was raised by the Leader of the Opposition in the House yesterday, the issue of security—namely, the existing security measures that are in place in Australia but which are not working effectively and the lack of oversight of security risks at Australian ports and airports. As member for Kingsford Smith, both the Port Botany complex and Sydney airport are located within my electorate. I do not consider it realistic or even necessary for every Australian, from Kununurra to Kuringai, to remain in a permanent state of anxiety about either terrorism or the security of their immediate environment. Notwithstanding that, both the major port, Port Botany, and the largest airport in Australia at Sydney are sites of key strategic importance and as such need prudent and thorough attention in the new high-risk era we live in.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Instead we learned yesterday that the Inspector of Transport Security, Mick Palmer, has been withdrawn from his active involvement in that position and is now handling the Cornelia Rau inquiry. Mr Palmer’s job was to look at security weaknesses and assess Australia’s vulnerability in security areas. Instead, we find he has been absent from that position for three months and no-one is doing the job.</para>
<para>The Transport Workers Union made the federal government aware of security breaches in our transport regimes four years ago. Since then there have been on the ground lapses in security, the implication of Qantas baggage handlers in a large-scale drug smuggling operation, the possible tampering of luggage in the Schapelle Corby case and of course a baggage handler wearing a camel suit taken from a passenger’s luggage. All these breaches have taken place at Sydney airport, completely at odds with the government’s rhetoric on security.</para>
<para>The inescapable fact is that the Howard government is missing in action. The government creates the atmosphere of anxiety in the city about security and terrorism, and is canvassing various restrictions of individual citizens’ rights, but is simply found wanting on the actual nuts and bolts of having a proper system of security in our ports and airports.</para>
<para>Each year 26 million passengers go into Sydney airport, but since 2004 there have been 15 reported breaches of security at airports around Australia. Answering questions in the House on 17 November last year, the Prime Minister revealed that around six per cent of sea cargo and 70 per cent of air cargo are actually inspected by technologies capable of detecting threats. Port security around the country is subject to individual, haphazard arrangements, with a range of issues identified by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute report of 19 April this year, including inadequate security checks on crews from foreign flagged vessels, virtually no inspections of empty containers and a complete failure in important structural areas of security. As yet the government’s response has been negligible. Labor believes we need an independent audit of airport security that would enable objective consideration of our vulnerabilities and deliver recommendations to fix any problems identified. On the record of the past year it is high time for such action. In Kingsford Smith, where people live and work within a stone’s throw from Port Botany and Sydney airport, security is a life and death issue. So when will this government act?</para>

<para>—It has been estimated that volunteers in Australia contribute around $42 billion worth of time to the Australian economy. I want to draw the attention of the House tonight to an incident that took place in Queensland very recently. The <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> referred to it today. If it were not so serious, it would be a laughing matter. A volunteer at the state government koala hospital in the suburb of Moggill, in my electorate of Ryan, was sacked after she dared to raise with an official from the department of environment some issues that she thought could improve the work of volunteers in that community organisation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> article today draws to the attention of the Queensland community, particularly the people of Ryan, how absurd the situation is. A director-general of a Queensland government department has been ordered by the minister to investigate why a volunteer at the Moggill Koala Hospital was sacked. The specific reason that she was sacked was that she had asked for extra tea, coffee and biscuits to be provided to the volunteers. It is an absolute disgrace when someone of high rank in a Queensland government department is ordered to explore the matters surrounding the dismissal of a volunteer. As I said, volunteers in this country contribute an enormous amount of time and effort towards making this country stronger and more vibrant in so many ways. I cannot believe that someone who gives of their time so freely has been put through this awful situation. The lady who was giving her time so freely, Helen Darbellay, has been working for the Moggill Koala Hospital for over 10 years. She is quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> today:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">“I was pretty upset and hurt. I’ve been there over 10 years and I’ve never had any problems before,” Ms Darbellay said.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The situation where volunteers are put through this enormous pressure of being scrutinised and intimidated by an official from the department of environment is absolutely remarkable. If the Queensland department of environment thinks that volunteers should be taken for granted, they have another thing coming. Another volunteer in the community organisation said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">You can’t use my name because I might get sacked too...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This volunteer is worrying about being sacked, yet she is giving her time so freely and so generously. The sort of work that these volunteers do includes scrubbing floors, cleaning and feeding and medicating koalas, many of whom are injured through dog attacks, through being run over by cars or through disease. This reflects that these people are giving so generously of their time. They are not receiving a dollar for their time or for their contribution, and yet they are being put through this horrendous situation. I want to call on the Queensland minister, Ms Desley Boyle, to explore this matter further. I understand that she has ordered the director-general to look into it. The fact of the matter is that directors-general should not be called upon to do this sort of thing. They have far more important things to consider, such as power blackouts in Queensland and the shocking state of hospital services. In my own electorate of Ryan, I call on the Queensland government to look at investing in the local infrastructure. Moggill Road is a debacle. It is a state road, and they should be investing their time, energy and resources into that and not worrying about this sort of issue, which is upsetting ordinary people who are making a difference to our community.</para>
<para>I have a particular interest in this because I am patron of the Moggill Koala Hospital Association. It is a great privilege for me to support that, and when I see this sort of information coming to light I think it is a poor reflection on the Queensland government and a poor reflection on officials who are supposed to be appreciative of the work that volunteers are doing through community organisations such as the Moggill Koala Hospital. I want to call very strongly on those responsible to be accountable for this. We cannot have a situation where volunteers are scrutinised so heavily when they are doing good work for the community, as this lady’s case shows. For over a decade she has been giving her time and all she gets is this sort of thanks. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talker>
<para>—Tonight I want to speak about one of my constituents, Mr Gary Marshall, who is an extraordinary and creative man. He has devised a cigarette butt disposal unit known as smokers poles, or SPs. This is an all Australian invention conceptualised, designed and manufactured in Campbellfield in my electorate. Gary Marshall invented this revolutionary cigarette butt disposal unit. While no-one here encourages smoking, the reality is that many people do smoke and cigarette butts are the No. 1 litter item in Australia and the No. 1 litter item in the world, so it is important to devise more effective means of disposing of this nasty problem, particularly since the current disposal methods are seriously inadequate and potentially devastating for our environment.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The design of smokers poles addresses these problems. The units are smoke and odour free and are permanently installed where smokers tend congregate. The design is very simple and very clever. It is inspired by Gary’s own understanding of a smoker’s mentality and behaviour, because he is a smoker himself. The unit is designed to prevent interference. It is charged with lemon scented water to extinguish embers, and the water is replenished when the unit is emptied and cleaned with a portable vacuum system. The units are even designed to be cost neutral, with an advertising panel incorporated in the structure.</para>
<para>Smokers poles have already been installed in many public places across Victoria. There are two outside the building where my office is located in Broadmeadows and many successful trials have been undertaken with Parks Victoria, Bunnings and Westfield shopping centres. There are several hospitals, shopping centres and municipalities ready to commence installation. With around 130,000 cigarette butts ending up in the Yarra River each day and 350,000 ending up in Port Phillip Bay, I fully support this environmentally conscious initiative and I encourage the federal government to follow the lead of the Victorian Labor government and to support the widespread installation of these units across Australia.</para>
<para>The other reason that I wanted to speak this evening about Gary Marshall and what he is doing is that Gary Marshall is a fair dinkum equal opportunity employer. Gary currently employs around 35 people in his Campbellfield factory and, when recruiting, he specifically targets those unemployed people who are at the most risk of not finding a job. These include the long-term unemployed, mature unemployed, Indigenous Australians, migrants, the disabled and even drug dependent youths. It does not matter to Gary; he sees no barriers to employment. Provided that workers can undertake the job in a safe and efficient manner, he is prepared to give them a go. In fact, Gary treats his employees like a family and he has even driven workers to and from work when necessary. So it is not surprising that worker satisfaction is high, staff turnover is low and both Gary and his employees respect and value each other greatly.</para>
<para>I would like to quote something that Gary said to me. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The dollars are always less important than respect with employees, but I’ve always employed people above the award rate. I feel guilty paying them the award rate.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">At a time when the government and other conservative thinkers toy with the idea of abolishing minimum award wage provisions because they believe that this will actually create more jobs—although there is no evidence of that—it is important to note what this socially responsible employer is saying. According to Gary and many other people, the award rates are low, and he personally feels guilty paying those rates. I am glad the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations is in the House this evening, as I think it is important for the government to take notice and to listen to employers like Gary Marshall, whose approach is based on the knowledge that, if you treat your workers with decency and respect and if you reward their labour and efforts with dignity and fairness, then everyone is happy. Surely this is in the interests of Australia’s future productivity and prosperity.</para>
<para>In closing, I would like to commend Gary Marshall for his brilliant initiative in developing smokers poles and I would also like to congratulate him for being such a socially responsible employer. He is an exemplary Australian who leads the way, and I wish Gary Marshall every success in taking SPs across Australia and the world. I understand that smokers poles are going to be installed in Beijing in time for the Olympic Games there, and according to Gary many other countries, including Canada, have taken a great interest in this very small Aussie invention from my electorate. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talker>
<para>—I would like to speak about an issue that is of great concern not only for the constituents of Tangney but also for Western Australia and for the nation as a whole. I speak of a concept that has been proved a failure elsewhere and abandoned yet the majority of states, including my home state of Western Australia, persist in continuing with it. I am speaking about outcomes based education. In Western Australia, not only is there a failed system but the education department decrees that negative sentiment expressed publicly by any of the teaching profession will not be countenanced. This should be anathema to any Australian who treasures the right to freedom of expression. Perhaps the education department should more accurately be called the department of right speak and right think, named in honour of the late George Orwell.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>So what are the problems regarding outcomes based education? First, and most fundamentally, there is the pretence that there is no such thing as competition. All that a child needs to do is to do well against themselves. Thus you can have a child that is 12 years old, barely literate, but doing well as far as the report card is concerned as the child is at a low level but performing well within that level. By way of contrast, a child could be doing exceptionally well and working at a level well above most 12 year olds but according to the report card not doing as well, because the child is working at a high level but at a low level within that higher band. This is causing a lot of concern and confusion not only among the students but also among parents. The reality of life is that competition is everywhere. When you leave school you compete for a university place, for an apprenticeship or against others to get a job. What a shock this must be for school leavers—or perhaps not if the school leaver has been involved in school sport. There, excellence and competition between them and their peers is positively encouraged.</para>
<para>There is a problem for teachers as well. Without exception, every teacher that I have spoken to has been extremely critical of outcomes based education. There is no clear idea of what is to be taught and the assessment requirements placed on teachers are overly burdensome. We have the situation where, in Western Australia, you have the state Labor government crowing about the reduction in class sizes. They say this is a result of policies that they have introduced. The reality is different. The reduction in class sizes is due to the bleeding of students from the public system to the private system.</para>
<para>Why are the parents of these students abandoning the public system? Clearly it is due to inadequate education, and inadequate education in basic social values. To the state educators everything is relative—there is no right or wrong. To state educators there are no problems in the education system. The problem clearly, according to them, is teachers criticising the system. Given the vote of the movement of students, the parents believe, quite correctly, that the problems go a lot further than this. In Western Australia, for post year 10 schooling, the idea is to make sure that your child feels good about education rather than actually learning anything.</para>
<para>To quote <inline font-style="italic">Our Youth, Our Future</inline> by the Western Australian Curriculum Council:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">In response to concerns that reporting on levels that have comparable difficulty could affect the motivation and esteem of lower achieving students, grades such as A, B or C ... will be awarded by schools for each course unit.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In other words, there are no failures. We already have a real problem with mathematics and physics education at school and with the related ability to do these subjects at university. The resolution: it would appear that ‘maths’ will be taught—with no calculus, discrete maths or other similar subjects.</para>
<para>It is no wonder that the federal government is having to get involved in schools. Not only do we have TAFEs offering mickey mouse courses but these courses are now grist to the mill with secondary schools as well. If this is the education that our children are to receive then I despair for the future of our nation. We would be headed for a Third World standard in terms of education. I commend Minister Nelson’s push for better education. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—For decades Australian campuses have provided a rich environment for Australian youth. They have provided not only a place in which to study but also a place to explore their relationships with others through community and volunteer work in clubs of all types, the provision of student services, arts activities, campus papers and, yes, campus politics. Thousands of students have taken on broader roles, gaining skills that many have taken into later life. In many cases their campus activities led to jobs in fields that have no real career path—the kinds of jobs in which even if a degree is an advantage or even essential, work experience and a history of ‘just doing it’ speak louder than degrees. These are careers such as acting, music, journalism, activism of all kinds, community service and, of course, politics. For example, if you want to work in the field of music as an artist or an administrator, you will have worked somewhere before that, and very often the source of that early experience comes from our student associations.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Student unions have created a vibrant, creative environment for so many decades that symbiotic relations have now formed between campus life and the outside world. Student union activity is an incubator for the cultural sector as a whole. It provides a breeding ground for creative minds and allows students to develop their talents. Student union support through clubs and societies has helped some of our community’s most creative people to develop and enhance their talents. Our creative industries are populated with people who got their feet wet on their local campus or even made their reputations there. Quite frankly, there are not a lot of other breeding grounds for our future sports and arts administrators, our community writers, our actors and our musicians. I can only assume that most, perhaps all, on the other side of this House believe that this side of university life is not important and that the support that a campus gives to the surrounding creative scene is irrelevant. I can tell you that, in my area, it is not.</para>
<para>Yet this government are systematically setting out to weaken campus life and the contribution that our great universities make to the broader community. They are setting out not only to abolish compulsory student unionism but also to prohibit universities from collecting service fees for activities not directly related to a course of study. In other words, it is not just the word ‘union’ that they fear, but these very activities themselves. The effect of their bill will be to collapse the infrastructural support for community life on campus and for the broader creative sectors that gain so much of their development support from campus activity. Whether or not you agree with the unions’ position, that the unions should have had a role in this or that they should have one now—they have, they did and they do. We must all understand the position that history has put us in now and comprehend what we risk losing.</para>
<para>Like it or not, after 120 years of student associations, other industries are now woven into campus-union networks: alternative radio, music, theatre, film and even journalism, particularly at the development end, are all intrinsically linked to campus life, yet this government wants to kill off this support base. And the Nationals should have a good think too about the effect it will have in regional areas. It is hard to imagine a young band touring through Lismore without doing the free lunchtime concert hosted by the local campus union, not because uni lunchtime concerts are great fun but because it is a major part of the economics of touring for a young band. It is just not viable to tour regional areas without the support of the local campus unions. They are a major part of the infrastructure that supports developing bands. They create the regularity, the audience, the venue profile, the skilled back- and front-of-house staff and the local marketing knowledge.</para>
<para>Their influence extends beyond that. The RMIT union in Melbourne alone spawned three community broadcasters of great significance. In the seventies the student radio club lobbied and succeeded in getting an education licence for a station that grew into arguably one of the most influential, non-mainstream stations in the country: RRR. Only last year, it got another licence for the student youth network, and it is a major player in the relatively new field of community television with its station RMI-TV. These stations are not just the product of students having a good time. They, and particularly RRR, play a vital part in the discovery and breaking of new artists, and they are closely associated with RMIT’s radio and television courses. The degree, in the end, will not get the graduates the jobs; the experience on the ground will.</para>
<para>The government will win this one. But in taking aim at unions it is tearing away the cradle for future cultural and entrepreneurial contributors. There will be flow-on effects, just as there have already been in WA, where VSU has already ripped the guts out of the local music industry and impacted on the number of bands touring to the state. They may be aiming at unions but the fallout will extend far further. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Bundaberg Base Hospital has hit the headlines over recent months for all the wrong reasons. As a former member of the board of that hospital, 15 years or so before the mode of administration of hospitals was changed by the Labor state government, I take considerable pride in that hospital and its achievements. However, on 22 March this year, Rob Messenger, the state National Party MP for Burnett, one of the Bundaberg seats, raised the issue of surgical ineptitude and incompetence at the Bundaberg Base Hospital. It has since emerged that Dr Jayant Patel had botched dozens of surgical procedures in his two-year tenure at the hospital, resulting in the death or transfer of some 60 to 67 patients. What is even more extraordinary is that Dr Patel was accused of gross negligence in the US, prior to being approved by the Queensland Medical Board to work in public hospitals. It has since emerged that after the storm broke Queensland Health footed a $3,500 one-way airfare for Dr Patel to leave the country. What I find very galling is that the minister for health, Mr Nuttall, the state Labor member for Bundaberg, and others tried to infer that because Mr Messenger had exposed this doctor he had facilitated his escape from Australia. When you see that the state government itself, through the health department, actually funded Dr Patel’s airfare out of the country you realise what an abominable hypocrisy that was against the member for Burnett.</para>

<para>From the outset I asked for a royal commission, and while I do not for a moment claim credit for it, I express my pleasure that yesterday a royal commission under Tony Morris QC commenced hearing witnesses. Toni Hoffman, the senior nurse, appeared yesterday as the first witness before that royal commission. Witnesses need to be able to give evidence freely, immune from intimidation. They need to know that they are not going to face legal action or career damage. The structure that has been set up for this royal commission and the clarity and determination with which Tony Morris QC has laid down his basic charter gives me great confidence that it will not only flush to the surface the dreadful events that have occurred in Bundaberg, but also, more particularly, flush out of the Queensland health system a culture of intimidation, silence and bullying of nursing staff. Equally, it should not be an excuse, because we have had in this country a foreign doctor who has let us down, for the demonising of foreign doctors that come to this country.</para>
<para>Australian doctors go to England, Ireland, the United States and South Africa to broaden their studies. Some go for a working holiday; some will go to widen their experience; some will go to the great teaching hospitals in the UK, for example; and some will go on a semipermanent basis. Similarly, foreign doctors come to Australia for the same reasons. We have to be careful that in this inquiry we pinpoint the weaknesses in the system. If the Queensland Medical Board had been doing its job none of the doctors who have played up, including Dr Patel, would have ever got into practice. It is sad too that at a public meeting in Bundaberg my colleague, the state ALP member for Bundaberg, tried to flick this problem to the federal government, saying that we did not train enough Australian doctors. It is not so much the shortage of doctors that is the source of the problems we experienced in country Queensland; it is the distribution of doctors. There are many parts of Australia that are well-endowed with doctors; there are other parts that are not.</para>
<para>This sorry saga, which has seen that great hospital, its nursing staff and its other doctors so badly shaken over recent weeks, is now before the royal commission. I repeat: I hope Tony Morris QC and his co-commissioners will flush out all the problems. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I rise to draw members’ attention to the personification of why I continue to raise the issue of the impact of Sydney airport on the lives of Grayndler residents. Max and Cassandra Baron of Sydenham last Saturday lost 100 tiles from their house when a vortex was formed by a low-flying jet. Despite such impacts, the government has made an outrageous decision to breach its commitment to review Sydney’s airport needs in 2005. This was only discovered in response to question 421 from the member for Batman. The fact is that we do need to examine these issues.</para>

<para>A number of factors have a bearing on the average time taken to answer questions, including the complexity of the question, the need to consult other departments or agencies, and whether an election was held in the year in question.

In the House of Representatives in 2001-02, for example, 64 questions on notice were asked, compared to 106 in 2002-03 and 93 in 2003-04.

<para>The Government considers that the current arrangements for the three existing commercial television licences appear to be working well in providing quality free-to-air television to the Australian public. The issuing of commercial television licences is an important question of public policy which has historically been a matter for Government. Given the importance of this matter, the Government intends to amend the current legislative arrangements which give the Australian Broadcasting Authority the power to allocate new commercial television broadcasting licences so that the power is vested in the Government.</para>
<para>        In accordance with statutory requirements, the Government has undertaken a review of matters relating to the end of the moratorium on the allocation of new commercial television broadcasting licences, which concludes on 31 December 2006. The review did not specifically address the issue of whether there should be a new commercial television licence issued, although a number of submitters made comments on this issue. The Government is currently considering its response to this review. The question of whether any further commercial television licence should be issued after 2006 will be one for the government of the day. Matters such as the diversity of media services could be expected to be considered in the context of any decisions about a new licence.</para>

<item label="(1)">
<para>Mobile telephony is available in all areas of Australia. Satellite mobile phone services cover 100 per cent of the population and landmass, including the external territories. Telstra’s CDMA network has the greatest coverage of the terrestrial mobile phone networks, and is available to more than 98 percent of Australians, and 20 percent of the Australian landmass.</para>
<para>        People living in areas with no terrestrial mobile phone coverage may be eligible for assistance under the Government’s Satellite Phone Subsidy Scheme. The Government has allocated a total of $6.9 million to the scheme as part of its commitment to improve mobile phone services in rural and remote areas of Australia. The Scheme provides a subsidy of up to $1,500 (including GST), depending on the monthly access plan chosen, to eligible people who live or work in areas without terrestrial mobile phone coverage, including maritime and aviation users who meet the eligibility criteria.</para>
<para>        Dual-mode satellite/GSM phones and dual-mode satellite/CDMA phones are now available in the market . These phones enable the user to switch over to the satellite network when they are in areas beyond terrestrial mobile phone coverage. The Government subsidises the purchase of such phones by eligible applicants under the Satellite Phone Subsidy Scheme.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>Satellite phone services are available across 100 percent of the Australian landmass and population, and the Government provides a generous subsidy to approved applicants for the purchase of a satellite phone handset. As a result, mobile telephony is available in all areas of Australia.</para>
<para>        In response to the Regional Telecommunications Inquiry, the Australian Government made available $15.9 million to further extend mobile phone coverage in regional Australia. As a result of a competitive tender process, the Government entered into a funding agreement with Telstra to provide improved coverage to a further 62 locations around Australia.</para>

<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>On behalf of the Government, the Department of Finance and Administration (Finance) and its contracted property managers, United Process Solutions (UPS), have undertaken numerous specific measures to ensure that the Malabar Headland site is adequately administered. Numerous studies have been undertaken and actions performed to ensure that the property is appropriately managed, with particular reference to the environmental and heritage aspects of the site.</para>
<para>        A Facility Management Plan (FMP) for the site is being prepared in consultation with relevant State and local government agencies. The FMP, currently in draft form, provides an integrated approach to management of the entire site by identifying relevant environmental and landuse issues and other site constraints and providing guidance on management actions that need to be taken.</para>

<item label="(2)">
<para>The Australian Government has already recognized the environmental and heritage significance of the Malabar Headland site, as evidenced by its dual listings on the Register of the National Estate and the Commonwealth Heritage List. The process of heritage registration under the State’s legislation requires that the owner of the land be given the opportunity to object to the proposed listing. The Commonwealth has not objected to the listing.</para>

<para>The site was used for rifle shooting and other military training purposes as far back as the late 1800s. It was used for military and civilian target shooting throughout much of the twentieth century up until the present time. Land filling by the Navy and the State water board occurred from the 1950s to the 1970s. Commercial dumping of local industrial and domestic wastes occurred from 1971 to 1988. Given this history, it is not possible to guarantee that no unexploded munitions exist at the site.</para>

<para>The former Ministers for Finance and Administration and Sport and Tourism announced in September 1998 a $9 million Federation Fund grant for the construction of new firing range facilities at Holsworthy. However, the Defence portfolio has been unable to identify land at Holsworthy that could now be made available for civilian shooting because of defence capability, security and environmental concerns. Discussions are taking place with the NSW Government on sites that could accommodate the shooting groups currently located at the ANZAC Rifle Range. The major difficulty has been the lack of a suitable site within Sydney that can accommodate the NSW Rifle Association members who shoot over a long distance, which requires an extensive safety zone. The Government is currently considering options available for the shooting groups and no decision has yet been reached.</para>

<para>and (2) Job Network is administered on the basis of 19 Labour Market Regions and 137 Employment Services Areas (ESAs), the boundaries of which do not align with those of Federal Electorates. Job seekers choose Job Network members for a variety of reasons including location, proximity to transport routes and Centrelink offices, or the satisfaction of friends and others. Job seekers residing in one electorate or ESA may elect to be assisted through Job Network sites located in adjoining electorates or ESAs. For illustration, job seekers residing in the electorate of Fowler may be assisted through Job Network sites located in the electorates of Blaxland, Hughes, Prospect, Reid or Werriwa. The Fairfield/Liverpool ESA is most closely aligned with the electorate of Fowler and, therefore, answers are provided with reference to this ESA.</para>

<para>—The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>The Department of Health and Ageing assesses the potential risk to Australia of a human HPAI outbreak in the following manner:</para>
</item>
</list>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>On a daily basis the Department undertakes a systematic review of data sources, media and information from regional and global authorities such as the World Health Organization (WHO). The assessment is carried out by expert medical officers and scientists within the Department and communicated to relevant government agencies three times a week.</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>Through regular meetings of external expert groups and, when required, frequent teleconferences. These expert groups are the National Influenza Pandemic Action Committee (NIPAC) chaired by the Chief Medical Officer, Professor John Horvath and the Communicable Disease Network of Australia (CDNA).</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>On a regular basis though an Interdepartmental Committee (IDC) of central agencies. The IDC reviews the data and assess impact on respective areas of responsibility and initiates necessary action.</para>
</item>
</list>
<list type="unadorned">
<item label="">
<para>With respect to the potential risk to Australia of an animal HPAI outbreak, there have been ongoing assessments of potential risks posed by the outbreak in South East Asia. These assessments have taken place through dialogue and formal meetings with industry and government stakeholders that include the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing, AusAID, the Australian Animal Health Laboratory and other Commonwealth and state and territory agencies.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>(2)   (a) and (b) The capability of regional governments to respond to outbreaks of avian influenza and other zoonotic and communicable diseases is factored into the design and implementation of regional interventions aimed primarily at enhancing surveillance, diagnostic capacity and emergency preparedness. The Department of Health and Ageing and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry have been integrally involved with AusAID in a project to assess the capability of current countries affected by avian influenza to detect and to respond both to poultry and human outbreaks of avian influenza. The assessment has also involved organisations such as the WHO, Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), World Organisation for Animal Health, ASEAN, as well as regional governments.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>In countries where HPAI outbreaks have occurred, the Australian Government is working closely with regional governments to identify immediate assistance needs and longer term capacity building priorities. It is also working closely with the ASEAN Secretariat to identify regional, trans-border approaches to monitoring, surveillance and preparedness for avian influenza and other zoonotic and communicable diseases.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>Specifically with respect to animal health outbreak capability, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has a high level of knowledge about disease control capacity in a number of countries in the region and it is clear that a number of countries have found dealing with the HPAI outbreak very difficult. The difficulties include social, technical, economic, environmental and political factors.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>The governments of Indonesia, East Timor and Papua New Guinea presented country reports at the Quadripartite Quarantine Consultations in Canberra in February 2005. The reports included information on highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks, surveillance and diagnostic capacity and status of response preparedness.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>Further assessments undertaken by the Department of Health and Ageing in the area of human disease outbreak capability in the region include our participation in the formal evaluation of human disease surveillance systems in the Pacific and in Indonesia. Further assessment of Asian -Pacific capacity has been formalised through meetings and workshops organised by the Western Pacific Regional Office (WPRO) of WHO. Australia has been involved in these forums and the capacity assessments are available to Australia through the WPRO office.</para>

</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1) (a)">
<para>, (b) and (c) (i) The Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF) has informal knowledge of the capacity of each of these countries to respond to outbreaks of HPAI in animals. Indeed, for Indonesia (the only one of these three countries currently known to be infected) and East Timor, DAFF has been involved in direct assistance measures to improve the surveillance and reporting activities for this poultry disease.</para>
<para>(1)   (a), (b) and (c) (ii) The Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing has informal knowledge of the capacity of each of these countries to respond to outbreaks of HPAI in humans and works closely with the regional offices of the World Health Organization (WHO) which have more detailed information on the contingency plans of member states.</para>
<para>        More detailed information by country is outlined below:</para>
<para>        Indonesia</para>
<para>        The Australian Government has provided assistance for the Indonesian Government’s contingency plans through a $3 million, 3 year initiative funded under Australia’s bilateral aid program. In March 2004, emergency assistance for contingency planning was delivered through a partnership with the WHO Office in Jakarta. Activities included epidemiological investigations, a public media campaign and the supply of anti-viral medicines. More recently, efforts have focused on long-term strengthening of Indonesia’s communicable disease outbreak surveillance and response capabilities. This expanded support is being delivered through WHO.</para>
<para>        Papua New Guinea</para>
<para>        While there are no known incidents of avian influenza in Papua New Guinea (PNG), the PNG National Department of Health has broadly discussed contingency planning at Departmental Meetings since outbreaks occurred in the region in 2004. AusAID project personnel have provided support for such discussions during various technical working group meetings over the ensuing period.</para>
<para>        PNG’s National Disaster Management Office does not currently have a contingency plan in place.</para>
<para>        East Timor</para>
<para>        While there have been no known incidents of avian influenza in East Timor, the Government of East Timor has advised that it does have contingency plans in the event of an identified outbreak of HPAI in poultry and humans. Specifically, the Ministry of Health would cooperate with the Quarantine Unit of the Ministry of Agriculture in the event of an identified outbreak. Within Dili Hospital, arrangements are in place to offer initial assistance to victims in the event of positive identification of an outbreak of avian flu.</para>
<para>(2)   (a), (b) and (c) (i) and (ii) In general, in each country, the Ministry of Agriculture or equivalent is the key agency responsible for HPAI outbreaks in animals, and the Ministry of Health or equivalent is the key agency responsible for HPAI outbreaks in humans.</para>
<para>        More detailed information by country is outlined below:</para>
<para>        Indonesia</para>
<para>        The lead responsibility broadly rests with the Directorate General of Livestock Services under the Ministry of Agriculture in the case of poultry infections, and with the Ministry of Health in the case of human infection. A key aspect of aid program assistance is support for a joint taskforce between the Indonesian Ministries of Health and Agriculture, to effectively manage any avian influenza outbreaks.</para>
<para>        Papua New Guinea</para>
<para>        The key government agencies are the Curative Health Services and Disease Control Branch of the National Department of Health, PNG Laboratory Association, Centre for Public Health, the National Agricultural Quarantine and Inspection Authority (NAQIA) and the National Disaster Management Office.</para>
<para>        East Timor</para>
<para>        The key government agencies are the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Division of Quarantine) and the Ministry of Health (Division of Communicable Disease).</para>
<para>(3)   (a), (b) and (c) Risk management strategies in Australia take into account a variety of possible responses to HPAI infection that may be adopted and as such, specific enquiries have not been made of these countries. However, as Indonesia is currently infected, it has been noted that animal health authorities have used both vaccination and limited poultry destruction approaches to control HPAI infection.</para>
<para>        More detailed information by country is outlined below:</para>
<para>        Indonesia</para>
<para>        Australian Government officials attend monthly avian influenza donor coordination meetings in Jakarta, as convened by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). At these meetings, the Indonesian Government has reiterated its strategy of vaccinating and selectively depopulating poultry in high risk locations.</para>
<para>        Papua New Guinea</para>
<para>        The NAQIA does not currently have a response plan in place however it is developing a proposal for assistance from the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research to develop a response plan for the four high risk livestock disease threats, which includes HPAI.</para>
<para>        East Timor</para>
<para>        While there are no known reports of avian influenza outbreaks in East Timor, a Ministerial Decree is in place outlining procedures for handling any such outbreaks should they occur in either poultry or humans. The government of East Timor works closely with the WHO in the development of such monitoring, surveillance and response mechanisms.</para>
<para>(4)   (a), (b) and (c) (i) and (ii) Informal enquiries concerning diagnostic capacity for HPAI in a number of regional countries have been made and, where appropriate, training and other relevant assistance measures have been offered and subsequently accepted to varying degrees. The FAO and other international agencies have been active in building capacity for regional countries to control HPAI in poultry. The DAFF assists relevant agencies in East Timor and PNG to send samples to the regional avian influenza reference laboratory which is the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory.</para>
<para>        The high-level diagnostic capacity required to identify the currently circulating HPAI virus strain and other novel influenza strains is limited worldwide. The Australian Government has this capacity through its WHO Collaborating Centre for Influenza based in Melbourne, one of only two in the region, and through the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory based in Geelong. These key reference laboratories provide vital diagnostic support for other countries in the region.</para>
<para>        More detailed information by country is outlined below:</para>
<para>        Indonesia</para>
<para>        Assistance with the Indonesian Government’s contingency plans for a possible outbreak of avian influenza in humans is being provided through a $3 million, 3 year initiative funded under Australia’s bilateral aid program. In March 2004, emergency assistance for such planning was delivered through a partnership with the WHO Office in Jakarta. Activities included epidemiological investigations, a public media campaign and the supply of anti viral medicines. More recently, efforts have focused on long term strengthening of Indonesia’s communicable disease outbreak surveillance and response capabilities, including in relation to diagnosis. This expanded support is being delivered through WHO.</para>
<para>        Papua New Guinea</para>
<para>        AusAID has worked with the PNG National Department of Health to discuss epidemics management, including surveillance and diagnosis of communicable diseases. The PNG National Department of Health works directly with the WHO in this area.</para>
<para>        East Timor</para>
<para>        The Ministry of Health, with assistance from the WHO, has capacity to diagnose HPAI virus infection in humans. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, through cooperative arrangements with the North Australian Quarantine Strategy based in Darwin has capacity to diagnose an outbreak of HPAI virus in poultry.</para>
<para>(5)   (a), (b) and (c) (i) Informal enquiries concerning animal health surveillance systems for HPAI in a number of regional countries have been made and, where appropriate, training in the conduct of surveillance activities, including the design of HPAI specific surveys, has been offered and subsequently accepted to varying degrees. The FAO and other international agencies have been active in building capacity for regional countries to control HPAI in poultry. The DAFF conducts joint animal health surveys with relevant agencies in PNG and East Timor, and funds an animal health monitoring program in PNG.</para>
<para>(5)   (a), (b) and (c) (ii) The Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing has informal knowledge of the human health surveillance systems of each of these countries to detect outbreaks of HPAI in humans and works closely with the regional offices of the WHO, who have more detailed information on the surveillance systems of member states.</para>

<para>        This three year, $5 million AusAID funded program will start in July 2005 and will address gaps in the areas of surveillance and reporting, human and animal health laboratory diagnostic capacity, and emergency preparedness.</para>
<para>        The program will be delivered by DAFF; WHO; the ASEAN Secretariat; and supported by a targeted research program by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research.</para>
<para>        In advance of the above activity, in July 2004, $650,000 was also provided through the ASEAN Australia Development Cooperation Program to help build the region’s capacity to deal with infectious disease outbreaks.</para>
<para>        The DAFF is involved in capacity building in animal health in Indonesia, PNG and East Timor. The projects are implemented in response to gaps identified by the DAFF in consultation with host Governments.</para>
<para>        More detailed information by country is outlined below:</para>
<para>        Indonesia</para>
<para>        In March 2004, the Australian Government, through the bilateral aid program contributed $325,000 for initial assistance focussing on epidemiological investigation, public information and awareness raising and supply of anti-viral medications. In June 2004, AusAID signed an MOU with the Indonesia WHO Office on a program to expand that assistance to focus on strengthening the sensitivity and timeliness of surveillance, the capacity within the health system to react to surveillance data and the links between ministry of health and agriculture response structures. It will be an ongoing program with the flexibility to address any emerging issues or limitations ($3 million over 3 years).</para>
<para>        Recent discussions between Ministries of Health resulted in an agreement to escalate collaboration on communicable disease between Australia and Indonesia.</para>
<para>        Papua New Guinea</para>
<para>        The NAQIA is working with the Australian Chief Veterinary Officer to develop a proposal for Australian assistance to improve its surveillance and diagnostic capacity. NAQIA is also about to commence a regional FAO program on surveillance and diagnostics.</para>
<para>        East Timor</para>
<para>        The Ministry of Health advises that it has the ability to provide an initial response in the event of a small outbreak of the HPAI virus in humans, but would not have the capacity or resources to contain a major outbreak. WHO assesses that assistance in the area of surveillance is a key priority for East Timor at this stage.</para>
<para>        The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries advises that the current cooperation with the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) needs to be sustained because the Government of Timor Leste places great reliance on the AQIS facilities and resources based in Darwin.</para>
<para>(7)   (a), (b) and (c) (i) and (ii) Various capacity building projects in Indonesia, PNG and East Timor have included training in disease recognition, survey design and implementation and emergency response.</para>
<para>        Indonesia</para>
<para>        See information under (6) above</para>
<para>        Papua New Guinea</para>
<para>        AusAID has not provided direct aid assistance yet to prepare for the HPAI virus. Aid support so far has been provided through the establishment of the Central Public Health Laboratory which will go through accreditation in 2 years time as a WHO reference lab; production of public health manuals and discussions on epidemic responsiveness; and installation of health radios to help provide a health communication network throughout the country.</para>
<para>        East Timor</para>
<para>        There are no known cases of avian influenza in East Timor and AusAID has not received any requests for assistance in relation to Avian Influenza from the Government of East Timor. However, there has been ongoing cooperation between the Government of East Timor and Australian Government agencies as outlined in information under (4) and (6) above.</para>

</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>In 2001 when the then Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Hon Dr Michael Wooldridge, initiated assistance for people with an Inborn Error of Metabolism (IEM), of which Phenylketonuria (PKU) is the most common condition, there was extensive liaison with specialists in the field, in particular the members of the Australasian Society for Inborn Errors of Metabolism. The advice of these experts was taken on the technical aspects of the disease. This led to the grant arrangements currently in place to assist people with this condition.</para>
<para>(2)   (a) (b) and (c) There are estimated to be 900 people in Australia with an IEM, the most common of which is PKU. The majority of the new applications received for the Australian Government grant of $204 per month to assist in meeting the costs of maintaining a special diet are for babies. However, there are also applications from adolescents and adults returning to the diet as well as pregnant women.</para>

However, there are also applications from adolescents and adults returning to the diet as well as pregnant women.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>As far back as 2001, Dr Wooldridge acknowledged the difficulties faced by people with PKU, and the high cost diet that is required to enable people with an IEM to afford to stay on strict diets and consequently ensure their long term health is maintained. The Australian Government initiated a grant program to subsidise the cost of special food, and continues to provide support to people with PKU in the form of this grant program.</para>
<para>(4)   (a) The manufacturer of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), Schircks Laboratories, has not sought marketing approval from the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for the drug in Australia. Hence, no research has been undertaken here to determine the efficacy of the drug.</para>

<item label="(b)">
<para>Schircks Laboratories has advised that BH4 is produced in tablet form.</para>
</item>
<item label="(c)">
<para>As no registration for this product has been sought in Australia there is no available evidence for the Australian Government to assess whether taking BH4 tablets would enable PKU patients to relax their diet.</para>

<para>Medicines are made available on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) on the recommendation of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) - the independent expert group which advises the Australian Government on such matters. The members include doctors, health scientists, other health professionals and a consumer representative. The PBAC cannot consider subsidising a product for conditions which are outside those approved for the marketing of a drug in Australia. Marketing approval specifies those conditions where the product has been demonstrated to be safe and effective and is assessed by the TGA. The TGA has not granted marketing approval for BH4 for the condition PKU. See 4(a) above.</para>
<para>        In addition, the PBAC has not received an application for listing of the drug on the PBS. Consequently, the PBAC is not in a position to recommend the listing of BH4 for subsidy under the PBS. Neither the Government nor the PBAC is able to compel the manufacturer to apply for registration and/or PBS listing of a particular product for the treatment of PKU. Decisions on these matters involve commercial and other considerations that can only be made by the manufacturer involved.</para>

This allowance is a supplementary payment available to people who provide daily care and attention at home for adults or children with a disability or chronic medical condition.

<para>The Australian Government recognises the importance of making sure that patients with PKU have the best possible access to up-to-date and affordable medical and pharmaceutical treatments. There are a number of different medicines and products listed on the PBS specifically for use in PKU. In 2003-04 the Australian Government spent $7 million to subsidise these medicines.</para>

<item label="(7)">
<para>No cost benefit analysis has been undertaken on (a) Health Carer’s Allowance, (b) low-protein allowance and (c) specialized medical formula versus use of BH4. The PBAC would carry out such an assessment if it received an application to list this product on the PBS. However, as this drug is not registered for use in Australia and no application for its registration has been received from the manufacturer this could not occur at this time.</para>
</item>
<item label="(8)">
<para>Given the complex nature of the data required, the manufacturer of a product proposed for PBS listing is usually in the best position to submit an application in support of its request to the PBAC.

<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>According to industry estimates approximately 84 per cent of people have access to transmission of all the commercial and national television broadcasting services in their area, and around 96 per cent have access to digital transmission from at least one free to air broadcaster. Based on Australian Bureau of Statistics’ population estimates for Australia of around 20.2 million, this means that around 19 million people probably have access to at least one digital free to air television service, if they choose to purchase digital television receivers.</para>

<item label="(3)">
<para>Coverage of analog services is not universal. Some people are not able to receive analog transmissions due, for example, to interference or topography. The Broadcasting Services Act 1992 requires broadcasters to achieve equivalent coverage with their digital television services as is currently achieved by analog services, by the end of the eight year simulcast period.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>The Broadcasting Services Act 1992 requires that the digital programming be a simulcast of the existing analog programming, with some exceptions. Therefore, the majority of programming on digital television is likely to be the same as that on analog television. However, some new digital services have been provided within the parameters of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, such as the ability of the national broadcasters to multichannel. SBS has used its spectrum to provide a digital World News Channel and the ABC recently launched its ABC2 digital channel which broadcasts some unique content. The legislation also requires broadcasters to provide a minimum of 1040 hours per year of high definition digital television programming. It is not possible to quantify the percentage of new digital content as a proportion of the overall service.</para>

<para>        Where it is determined that Australia does not owe a stateless person protection obligations under the Refugees Convention, unique or exceptional circumstances may exist which warrant the exercise of the Minister’s discretionary, non-compellable public interest powers under s417 of the Migration Act 1958. Obligations under other relevant treaties such as the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights may be assessed in the context of these powers.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>The most comprehensive international instrument in relation to the reduction of statelessness to which Australia is a party is the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. As explained in response to question (2)(b), Australia fulfils these obligations through the Australian Citizenship Act 1948.</para>

<quote pgwide="yes">

<item label="(1)">
<para>According to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS), the number of notifications of chlamydia and gonorrhoea has increased over the last 10 years.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>The objective of the National Family Planning Program is to provide a balanced approach to differing family planning service models, aimed at promoting responsible sexual and reproductive behaviours, rather than focusing on Sexually Transmissible Infections (STIs) per se in Australia.</para>
<para>        One of the key components of the funding to the Family Planning Organisations under the National Family Planning Program is for the provision of sex education predominantly to groups who would not usually access mainstream health services. However, due to the large range of factors that impact on STIs, it is not possible using available evidence to determine whether any changes in the number of STIs reported in Australia is related solely to the National Family Planning Program.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>The Australian Government is currently finalising the new National Sexually Transmissible Infections (STIs) Strategy which will provide a platform for specific actions to address these infections. This Strategy is expected to be released in the first half of 2005.</para>

<para>An independent safety case review has been completed. The safety case risk assessment and recommendations have been developed into options for future airworthiness management.

<item label="(a)">
<para>Total Australian Government funding for government schools is not reported at the level of detail requested. Australian Government General Recurrent Grants for government schools are provided to the government education authority in each State or Territory, on the basis to total enrolments. The State or Territory determines where the grants are used. Payments to individual schools are not recorded.</para>
<para>                        The Department of Education, Science and Training is therefore unable to provide postcode detail for General Recurrent Grants to government schools. Government funding that can be reported at this level of detail totalled $1,215,087. Of this amount, Capital funding provided $1,200,000, Flagpole funding provided $5,087 and National Awards for Quality Schooling provided $10,000 to government schools in the electoral division of Shortland and identified postcodes in 2004. No Boys’ Education Lighthouse Schools Project funding was provided to government schools in the electoral division of Shortland and identified postcodes for 2004.</para>
</item>
<item label="(b)">
<para>Total Australian Government funding for non-government schools cannot be reported at the level of detail requested. Funding from Australian Government programmes that can be reported at this level of detail for non-government schools in the electoral division of Shortland and identified post codes totalled $28,805,885. Of this amount, Capital Grants funding provided $3,396,391, Flagpole funding provided $2,864, General Recurrent Grants funding provided $25,220,380 and Establishment Grant funding provided $186,250 to non‑government schools in the electoral division of Shortland and identified postcodes for 2004. No BELS funding was provided to non-government schools in the electoral division of Shortland and identified postcodes in 2004.</para>
<para>(2)   (a)   and (b) Details on the expenditure and location for the electoral division of Shortland and identified postcodes for 2004 are as follows: Capital Grants funding to government schools is at Table 1, Attachment A; Flagpole funding to government schools is at Table 2, Attachment A; National Awards for Quality Schooling to government schools is at Table 3, Attachment A; Capital Grants to non-government schools is at Table 4, Attachment A; Flagpole Funding to non-government schools is at Table 5, Attachment A; General Recurrent funding to non-government schools is at Table 6, Attachment A; and Established Grant funding is at Table 7, Attachment A.</para>
</item>
<item label="(c)">
<para>The purpose of the Australian Government Capital Grants is to assist in the provision of school facilities, particularly in ways that contribute most to raising the overall level of educational achievement of Australian school students.</para>
<para>                        The purpose of Flagpole funding is to assist schools with their civics and citizenship education activities, and promoting values education in Australian schools.</para>
<para>                        The purpose of Australian Government General Recurrent Grants is to help schools with the recurrent cost of school education so that they can offer students education directed towards the achievement of the Australian Government’s priorities for schooling.</para>
<para>                The aim of the 2004 National Awards for Quality Schooling was to improve teaching and learning through collaborative learning partnerships. Teachers at the College aimed to improve students’ engagement in learning and build a culture of high expectations, raising literacy and numeracy levels and addressing absenteeism and retention.</para>
<para>(3)   (a)   Estimates of total Australian Government funding for 2005 for government schools are not maintained at the level of detail requested (see response to 1a). Information about 2005 Capital Grants for government schools is not yet available. To date, no Flagpole funding or BELS funding has been provided to government schools in the electoral division of Shortland and identified postcodes in 2005.</para>

<item label="(1)">
<para>and (2) Job Network is administered on the basis of 19 Labour Market Regions and 137 Employment Services Areas (ESAs), the boundaries of which do not align with those of Federal Electorates. Job seekers choose Job Network members for a variety of reasons including location, proximity to transport routes and Centrelink offices, or the satisfaction of friends and others. Job seekers residing in one Electorate or ESA may be assisted through Job Network sites located in adjoining Electorates or ESAs. For illustration, job seekers residing in the Electorate of Shortland may be assisted through Job Network sites located in the Electorates of Newcastle, Charlton or Dobell. The Central Coast Sydney ESA and Lower Hunter ESA are most closely aligned with the Electorate of Shortland and, therefore, answers are provided with reference to these two ESAs.</para>
<para>        There are currently 16 Job Network members and other Job Placement Organisations operating in the Central Coast Sydney ESA and 29 in the Lower Hunter ESA. Their names, office locations and the number of job seekers on their caseloads are shown in Table 1.</para>

<para>Notes: Long term unemployed job seekers are those registered as unemployed for 12 months or more. Numbers for Intensive Support in 2003 are from 1 July 2003 when the APM commenced. Job seekers eligible for Job Search Support Only have been excluded from the calculation of percentages. The number of participants refers to all job seekers assisted in Intensive Support in that year.</para>
</item>
<item label="(5)">
<para>In view of the 12 month duration of Intensive Assistance it is not practical to report on the numbers of job seekers who participated on multiple occasions in 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003.</para>
<para>        Delivery of Intensive Assistance ceased on 30 June 2003. From 1 July 2003, improvements to the delivery of Job Network services were introduced through implementation of the APM. While Intensive Assistance allowed for multiple episodes of assistance, the new APM arrangements provide for job seekers to be assisted by a single Job Network member for the full duration of their unemployment, allowing the service provider to develop a detailed understanding of each job seeker’s needs.</para>
</item>
<item label="(6)">
<para>The Post-Programme Monitoring (PPM) survey conducted by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations measures job seekers’ outcomes three months after they have left assistance. PPM survey results are an estimate of outcomes levels based on responses from a sample of clients.</para>
<para>        Outcomes estimates for Intensive Assistance for the Central Coast Sydney and Lower Hunter ESAs are shown in Table 5. Table 5 includes (a) the total proportion in employment and (b) the proportions in (i) full-time, (ii) part-time and (iii) casual employment following their placements.</para>
