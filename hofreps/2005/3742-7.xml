Prime Minister, given the government’s record tax take—$100 billion more than in 1996—and today’s reports of a $10 billion surplus this year, why has the government, after nine long years, failed to invest in skills and incentives in the tax system—more than nine long years of failure now pushing up interest rates for Australian families?</para>

<para>—I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that entirely surprising and completely unpredictable question. Mr Speaker, can I say through you to the Leader of the Opposition that it is no surprise that the tax take this year should be higher than it was in 1996, because obviously we have more people; they are paid higher wages; and they pay more tax. That is the first remark I would make. The second observation I would make is that I reject entirely the proposition that this government has not invested in skills. That is an issue that will be developed further, no doubt, as question time unfolds. Finally, I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that he is the last person in this chamber to give anybody else lectures on fiscal rectitude.</para>

<para>—Can I say to the member for Kingston that, as a result of some very careful research in my office, we have come across a claim being made by the opposition that we are irresponsibly spending $66 billion. After I had this drawn to my attention, I decided to do a little bit of research as to how you would arrive at $66 billion. It throws up some very interesting issues. Of course I assume that when an opposition says that a government is irresponsibly spending $66 billion it is against the expenditure of that $66 billion.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I assume that is a reasonable proposition for that whole $66 billion. I assume that, if Labor had won the election, the Labor Party would have rescinded all of those commitments because they were irresponsible. So I decided to go through it, and I found that $21 billion of that $66 billion was increased assistance for Australian families. In other words, a third of the $66 billion represents the increased assistance for Australian families that was announced in the last budget. It also includes those very real supplements of $600 each. I know the Labor Party argued they did not exist. But I now have to tell them they do exist and the Australian families who received them demonstrated last October that they thought they existed.</para>
<para>But let us go on. There is $14.7 billion in personal income tax cuts. If I remember correctly, the Labor Party allowed those to go through in the Senate. There is $2.1 billion of investment in Australian aged care facilities. Is Labor saying that we should rip $2.1 billion out of aged care facilities? There is $3.3 billion of extra funding to strengthen Medicare—and in the words of my colleague the Minister for Health and Ageing—demonstrating that the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had.</para>
<para>But the list goes on: a $400 million enhancement to the private health insurance rebate; $2.4 billion of funds going to AusLink; $2 billion of investment in science and innovation; $2.5 billion has gone into defence and national security—presumably this great defence buff who now leads the opposition would want us to rip $2.5 billion out of defence and national security; $1 billion worth of tax relief provided to mature age workers; and a further $1 billion of tax relief for small business.</para>

<para>—Yes, a billion dollars help for small business. We are going to rip that out of small business! Listen to this. Can you believe this is something else they are opposed to: $900 million of assistance to pensioners and self-funded retirees to help with their utility payments. How mean can you possibly get! But it gets worse. There is no group in the community for which there ought to be more regard and respect than the carers of Australia. That $66 billion involves $500 million of help for Australia’s carers. It also includes $2.5 billion in superannuation incentives and $1.6 billion to the Australian water fund. But, relevant to this discussion, here is the most interesting component of all: it also includes $1 billion for vocational education and training. Yet only two days ago, here in Canberra on 6 March, these were the very words of the Leader of the Opposition:</para>

<para>—I thank the honourable member for his question. I think all members of the House now know that this year is the 90th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings and that there is going to be a particular focus on the Anzac Day ceremonies at Gallipoli. There have been some media reports—I think in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> and possibly on one of the commercial stations—about the rebuilding of an existing road around Anzac Cove. This road is being rebuilt for safety reasons. There is no question that the road does require some urgent reinforcing, and the Turkish authorities are endeavouring to complete the road in time for the 90th anniversary commemorations.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>On seeing the media reports I instructed our Ambassador to Turkey, Jean Dunn, to raise with the Turkish government the issues that had been raised in the media reports because, obviously for all of us, the site is of enormous historical and emotional importance and it would be of very great concern to us if the remains of fallen soldiers were being disturbed and dirt was being dumped onto the beach at Anzac Cove. During the course of the discussions yesterday, the Turkish authorities told our ambassador that archaeological work had been carried out prior to the roadworks commencing and that no remains have been unearthed during the roadworks. They also assured us that if any remains were unearthed they would immediately instruct that the reconstruction of the road be stopped. We appreciate that very much. I must say I very much appreciate the sensitivity with which the Turkish authorities responded to our representations. It is true that the contractors have put some earth onto the beach at Anzac Cove. The Turkish government is instructing the contractors to remove that earth from the beach so the beach can be restored to its proper condition.</para>
<para>In conclusion, I think all members of the House would appreciate the job that the Turkish authorities have done in protecting Anzac Cove and the surrounding national park and the enormous efforts they make to make the Anzac Day ceremonies there a success. I know tens of thousands—probably hundreds of thousands—of Australians have benefited from the work that the Turks have done. Very recently we had the Governor of Canakkale here. Some members will have met him; I did. Canakkale is the province within which Gallipoli resides. I took the opportunity in my meeting with him to thank him very warmly for all that the Turkish authorities are doing. From the ambassador’s discussions with the Turkish authorities I am satisfied that they are very aware of our concerns, they are aware of the media reports and they will take all necessary steps—as they have done for many, many years—to protect the dignity of the site.</para>

<para>—I will take the last part of the question and repeat again: no promises have been broken. Let me go back to the first part of the question. I have no doubt that I did say something to that effect, and those remarks would have been made in the context of the fiscal conditions of 1996. In February 1996, the person who has just asked me the question was busily misleading the Australian people by saying the budget was in surplus. We knew otherwise, and those remarks were made in the context of having not only a current account deficit but also a very large budget deficit. The reason the current account deficit now and the consequent size of foreign debt is serviceable and manageable in a way it was not in 1996 is that we have got the budget back into surplus. The government is therefore not subtracting from public savings. We have been able to do that whilst being able to invest sensibly in services for the Australian people and also to provide taxation relief which, according to the Labor Party in recent weeks, we should not have been doing. In those circumstances, I feel no discomfort at all about being reminded of that remark.</para>

<para>—It is a great pleasure to outline to the people of Ryan and the people of Australia the parameters for the upcoming budget. The government’s midyear review forecasts a surplus of $6.2 billion in this current financial year. It is important that the government run a surplus because, at a time when individuals are borrowing and at a time when we expect businesses to actually be investing, it is only the government that will be adding to savings and it will be business and individuals that will be running down savings. So it is important that the government runs surplus budgets.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Up until this morning, I thought the criticism was that the budget surpluses were not large enough, but I read in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> today some criticism that they might be too large. Can I just say the government will not be entering into the business, pre-budget, of confirming or denying any particular stories which journalists intend to write, because it puts the government in an impossible position. The government will outline and update the position at the time of the budget. But, as I said, until this morning I thought the criticism was that the budget surpluses were not large enough. That was certainly the criticism levelled at the government by Professor Ross Garnaut in his Sir Leslie Melville lecture, and it was certainly the criticism levelled at the government by an interviewee on the John Laws program last week. It was quite spooky. We had someone go onto the John Laws program last week and excite members of the press gallery by giving the government some advice. This spooky commentator seems to be Labor’s modern economic spokesman—he has been rediscovered. The spokesman was no other than Paul Keating, who went on the John Laws program on 2 March 2005 and said this: ‘I mean, the budgets really should have been in much greater surplus.’</para>
<para>For the record, as Treasurer, Mr Keating did eight budgets; as Prime Minister, four. Labor was in office for 13 years. This government has done nine budgets, and the cash balances of those nine budgets have been a surplus of 5.5 per cent of GDP. The cash surpluses of the 13 years of Keating economic management were minus 20.2 per cent of GDP. And there he was in a spooky interview on the John Laws program last week—‘I mean, the budgets really should have been in much greater surplus’!</para>
<para>We have been getting the same kinds of lectures from the Leader of the Opposition, who has been out complaining that the government has had unsustainable tax cuts and unsustainable expenditures. The Prime Minister reminded us the last time the Leader of the Opposition promised Australia it had a budget in surplus he missed by $10,000 million. We will start taking advice from the Leader of the Opposition on budget deficits when we start getting our marriage guidance counselling from Elizabeth Taylor! That is when we will be doing that.</para>
<para>We then had the member for Lilley, the shadow Treasurer who up until today has also been criticising $66 billion in tax cuts and family payments, go out there today and be asked what should happen and he says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... we desperately need investment in skills development—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">that is more spending—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... we desperately need some incentive in the tax system—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">that is more tax cuts. What is the Labor Party’s answer? Attack the government for tax cuts and spending and then demand more spending and more tax cuts. This even makes me pine for the days when the member for Hotham was the shadow Treasurer.</para>
<para>Why do they do this? Because when these ALP state secretaries go to the white bread training school they are told that whatever the issue is either it is too much spending or, if it is not too much spending, it should be too little spending. It is either too much tax or too much in tax cuts. But at the bottom of the day it is empty, vacuous, platitudinous and self-contradictory from people who have not done the work, do not understand the issues and cannot make a contribution. So I finish with a last word on this subject from Alex Sanchez. Remember him? He used to sit over there in the box last year advising the member for Werriwa.</para>

I am also pleased to say that 11 of the 21 new machines announced the other week will be in public hospitals.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In1996 there were just 18 Medicare funded MRI machines. Soon there will be 101 Medicare funded MRI machines, thanks to the policies of the Howard government. But there is more good news from the Howard government: all of the new machines will bulk-bill pensioners and concession card holders and 15 of the new machines will bulk-bill every single patient. All of this demonstrates that you can trust the Howard government with Australia’s health system. As everyone knows, the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had. We will do what is necessary to make a very good system even better.</para>

<para>—My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that, according to the Housing Industry Association, major home renovation activity is at a two-year low because of the Howard government’s skills crisis, falling 28.6 per cent in the December 2004 quarter? Prime Minister, isn’t it a fact that home renovations have jumped an average 8.3 per cent over the quarter because of the acute shortage of tradespeople driving up renovation costs? Prime Minister, isn’t it a fact that this government’s failure on skills has created this skills crisis that is driving up costs, hurting Australian families and putting upward pressure on interest rates?</para>

<para>—The short answer is no. The slightly longer answer is to remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, now that I have had an opportunity to examine the <inline font-style="italic">Skills at Work</inline> report released yesterday, that there has been a strong growth in new apprenticeships in the retail, hospitality and tourism sectors in response to rapid expansion of employment in those sectors, and that the number of apprentices commencing a trade apprenticeship increased 32 per cent between 1996 and 2003. The report also shows that 90 per cent of new apprentices have ongoing employment within three months of completing their apprenticeships. Figures released last week by the National Centre for Vocational Education Research show that commencements in traditional trades—and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was surely talking about a traditional trade if she was talking about the building industry—have increased by 19 per cent in the 12 months to September 2004. So the question of whether, over a particular period of time, there is a rise or fall in renovations is influenced by a variety of factors but it does not merit the wholly misleading and dishonest description of a ‘skills crisis’.</para>

<para>—Let me thank the honourable member for Moore for his question and his interest. The process now is that the transitional assembly is to meet and a transitional government is to be formed by that transitional assembly. Interim Deputy Prime Minister Salih said the Transitional National Assembly would meet on 16 March. The reason 16 March was chosen is that it is the anniversary of the chemical weapons attack against Halabja by Saddam Hussein. So it is a very symbolic day. It is a very important day for the Iraqis and it is a symbol of reconciliation in that country. A two-thirds majority will be required in the National Assembly to elect a president and two vice presidents, who will in turn appoint a prime minister. That process is, of course, under way already and it is very encouraging to see this democracy at work.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>What is also encouraging is that there is now international consensus. President Bush’s visit to Europe illustrated that point only too clearly. The international community is getting right behind the Iraqis in trying to ensure that the new democratic Iraq works. I was quite interested to see that amongst those who were virulently opposed to the original overthrow of Saddam Hussein was a British Labour MP called Harry Barnes. Some members opposite may know Harry Barnes. Having been a very passionate anti-war MP, he has now done the honourable thing. He has set up a group called Labour Friends of Iraq. I would like to feel that our own Labor Party could think about Labor friends of Iraq as well, and take a leaf out of Harry Barnes’s book. Harry Barnes said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I thought it was right to oppose the war. But history moves on and the Iraqi people now have a golden opportunity to take back their country and build a decent non-sectarian democracy ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Here you have the British Labour Party, even the anti-war dissidents within the government majority there, getting behind the people of Iraq. Just about the only people left who are continually harping on in a negative way about Iraq are the Australian Labor Party led by the current Leader of the Opposition. Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition made an 18-minute speech. It was another simple illustration of his capacity to walk both sides of the street. It was a speech where he said nothing positive about the Iraqi election. I think the only thing he said about the election was that he thought it was flawed.</para>
<para>The European Union, the NATO leaders and the international community all know that the Sunnis were intimidated in order to keep the turnout low, but we are being positive and constructive about the future of democracy in Iraq. The Leader of the Opposition apparently thinks that the real issue here is that the country is about to descend into a civil war. So let’s talk up that issue. He walks both sides of the street. He said, in terms of Australia’s contribution, that he thinks the maintenance of a strong position in the Persian Gulf is not an unreasonable thing on a more long-term basis. So we should have people—the Navy, I suppose—in the Persian Gulf in the long term.</para>
<para>But the Leader of the Opposition also said in the same speech that we should not commit ourselves permanently outside of the Asia-Pacific region. We should have the Navy there but we should not have the Army there! We should be there; we should not be there! He had a new criticism which was that when the al-Sadr forces were in revolt there was a need to increase our deployment in Iraq. But with Iraq so much quieter now he thinks that we should have increased our troop numbers earlier. And maybe having increased them earlier we should reduce them. He makes the argument that we do not have enough troops there—450 is not enough! We need more troops there but we should not have troops there at all! I think the Labor Party in Australia should follow the lead of Harry Barnes. They should get behind the Iraqi people, set up a new group called ‘Labor friends for Iraq’—not ‘Gough Whitlam in Blues Point Tower friends for Iraq’—and get behind the Iraqi people and support democracy. On this side of the House that is what we do.</para>

<para>—I can confirm that the role of the troops will be as I outlined in the House yesterday. I heard on <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> this morning the remarks made by the Japanese officer. I also heard the remarks of the Chief of the Defence Force that came immediately afterwards and properly explained, in a way I thought even the Leader of the Opposition might understand, very plainly the role of our forces. So far as the equipment and force protection are concerned, the advice of the Defence experts is that the equipment they have will be appropriate to the task. Given the interest of the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Barton in these matters, if there is anything additional of a confidential nature they would like to know, I am very happy to make it available. But they would both appreciate that there are some operational reasons why we do not go into all of the defensive and protective material that is made available.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is self-evident that the role of the ADF will not precisely replace the role of the Dutch, for reasons that were outlined by the British commander, I think, in the same interview this morning, when he said there had been a significant improvement in the capacity of the Iraqi security forces to look after themselves and their fellow Iraqis brought about by something the Labor Party continues to oppose—that is, the role of the coalition in training the Iraqis. Here we have this impossible contradiction in the position of the Leader of the Opposition. He says that the imperative is to have an exit strategy—the imperative is to tell the Australian people when we are leaving—but he opposes the means whereby we can leave the Iraqis safely in charge of their own security. It is not possible to have an effective coalition withdrawal from Iraq until the Iraqis are able to look after their internal and external security. Yet the Labor Party opposes us providing that. It is the ultimate example of the capacity of the Leader of the Opposition to walk both sides of the street on an important issue of national security.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Braddon for his question. He is working very hard and sits up straight and pays attention for Braddon. Of course, we visited Caterpillar Elphinstone last week. They have 627 employees and 93 apprentices, and they would take a lot more tomorrow if they could. Since this government came to office, the number of apprentices in this country has increased from 146,000 to almost 400,000. In fact, in the 18 months that the Leader of the Opposition was the minister in the government responsible for training, the number of apprentices in traditional trades dropped from 143,000 to 107,000. As he told his biographer, he did not find education and training particularly ‘straining’.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This government is investing, as the Prime Minister said yesterday, $2.1 billion this year alone in training. Of those 400,000 apprentices, 148,000 are in traditional trades. That represents 38 per cent of all apprentices in Australia in traditional trades despite the fact that traditional trades are 13 per cent of the labour market. In the election campaign this government announced, as the Prime Minister said today, more than $1 billion of extra funding to support apprentices over the next four years. That includes $91 million for scholarships for apprentices. If people going to university can get a scholarship, why can’t a young bloke who is going to be a plumber or a tiler? This government will deliver a $500 cash payment at the end of year one and another $500 at the end of year two. There is another $75 million, opposed by the Leader of the Opposition, for tool boxes. The Leader of the Opposition laughs at tool boxes. Commencing from 1 July, the government will deliver $800 for a tool box and tools for an apprentice three months into their apprenticeship. There are another 27,000 training places for school based apprentices and young and not so young people that need a bit of training before they start their apprenticeship.</para>
<para>The other rock I have been looking under is careers advice. I have discovered that not everybody who is offering careers advice to young people is well trained. There will be another $103 million delivered to improve the quality of careers advice given to children in schools.</para>
<para>I am also asked about alternative policies. Let us remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who has just asked the Prime Minister a question, that, in the last parliament, at question time—question time is where the opposition defines its priorities—59 questions on universities and five questions on training were asked of me, and in only one question was the word ‘apprentice’ even mentioned. When the Deputy Leader of the Opposition delivered Labor’s manifesto to the ACTU congress in August 2003—that is, Labor’s platform on education on training—there were 27 mentions of universities, six mentions of TAFE and two mentions of training. How many mentions of apprenticeships were there? None. How much priority does the Labor Party place on apprenticeships? Zero.</para>
<para>In terms of policies, the Labor Party needs to understand that the state governments, which run the TAFEs, last year cut 1,200 training places out of the automotive sector and 1,300 places out of utilities, mining and construction. You know what they have replaced them with? You can do feng shui—the member for Griffith would love that. There is fruit carving for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The member for Port Adelaide would be concerned to know you can do rave party management. For the Leader of the Opposition—there is a course for everybody in the Labor Party—there is belly dancing for beginners. What Australia needs is more brickies and fewer belly dancers.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Deakin for his question and for his important role in chairing the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation. As the member for Deakin knows, the Cole royal commission found an unassailable case for the reform of the building and construction industry in Australia. Justice Cole found an industry characterised by a culture of intimidation and unlawful behaviour.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I can inform the House that tomorrow I will be introducing the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005. This bill will do two things in particular: firstly, it will increase the penalty provisions in the Workplace Relations Act and, secondly, it will finally give the building industry task force the powers it needs to effectively prosecute illegal activity. This bill is intended to send a clear message to employers and unions that the government is serious about taking action in relation to what Justice Cole found in the building and construction industry. For those in the industry who may be contemplating taking unlawful action, it will act as a powerful deterrent. The increased penalties are up to a maximum of $110,000 for a body corporate and $22,000 in other cases.</para>
<para>It is unacceptable that people in this industry should continue to act outside the law. No responsible government could turn a blind eye to the problems that exist in the building and construction industry in Australia. Yet I have to report that this is exactly what the opposition has done. The Labor Party’s current workplace relations platform—written, I remind the House, by an ALP conference at which 50 per cent of the votes belonged to the unions—compels the Labor Party to vote against this law. This platform is binding on ALP members of parliament. It also states:</para>

Of course, it is the resources sector that is driving Australia’s economy through a major export contribution this year alone of $53 billion. In as little as two years, that will rise to $82 billion, and going with that is a very significant ongoing commitment to resource infrastructure development that ensures that we as a government will continue to provide a strong future for the resources sector. Here are just a few examples: a $102 million interest-free loan to Comalco to put in place a co-generation plant in the city of Gladstone; $125 million to construct multi-user infrastructure such as water recycling and air separation facilities in Western Australia—probably not far from Brand, in the area of Kwinana; and $10 million to Queensland Alumina to assist them in their conversion from coal to natural gas, underpinning the development of the PNG gas pipeline into Queensland and eastern Australia.

This government continues to target its infrastructure spending on projects with solid private sector backing—real value for the Commonwealth taxpayers’ dollar. Nothing could be more different from what a Labor government would do. The Beattie government is one case in point at the moment—a classic example of what a mess the Labor Party makes when it tries to invest in infrastructure. I read today that Macarthur Coal have been forced to bypass Dalrymple Bay, the port that was privatised by the Queensland government—the Beattie government. They were forced to bypass Dalrymple Bay and the 40-ship queue waiting offshore because the Beattie government made a mess of that lease. The reality is that the Labor Party, whether it is in state government or federal government, makes a mess of its investment in infrastructure. Peter Beattie may be looking around for someone to blame but, as I said in the House yesterday, he does not have to look very far. He can look to an old colleague Keith DeLacey. Keith said quite graphically, ‘It was the Queensland government’s decision to privatise Dalrymple Bay coal terminal.’ The Labor Party continues to make a mess of infrastructure investment while this government has a proud record.</para>

<para>—My question is to the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and relates to answers to questions she has previously given to the parliament. Can the minister confirm that on 22 June 2004 she approved a $30,000 Regional Partnerships grant to pay for staff accreditation at a long day care centre in the Deputy Prime Minister’s electorate? Can she advise the House how she assessed the needs of this child-care centre against the unmet accreditation needs of the 4,484 other day care centres in Australia?</para>

<para>—On that point of order, Mr Speaker: you last ruled on this matter on 10 February 2005, when a series of questions was asked of the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs about matters associated with the Regional Partnerships program. At that point, you ruled that if questions related to things about which she had spoken in the parliament, they were in order. This question does that as it is about the program which she spoke about in a great deal of detail and which she has now taken many questions on. So it is on all fours with the ruling you gave on 10 February.</para>

<para>—I thank the honourable member for Greenway for her question. I am interested that she asks me a question today, on International Women’s Day, about violence against Indigenous women. I want to make it very clear that violence against women in our community is never acceptable, but the tragedy and reality is that Indigenous women in Indigenous communities are perhaps the most disadvantaged and vulnerable in our society. In terms of Indigenous family violence, the victims are almost always women and children. This government is resolute in its determination to address these issues of family violence, and as Attorney I want to empower victims of family violence by increasing their access to our judicial system, where they can obtain support and assistance.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Recently I announced the location of seven new family violence units as part of a $22.7 million expansion of the Family Violence Prevention Legal Services Program. Ultimately, this roll-out of new services will see the number of units doubled, from 13 to 26, across Australia. They will provide legal support for victims. I know that my colleagues who represent rural and remote communities will welcome the roll-out of these new legal services. They include Bourke, Rockhampton, the Kimberley region, Dubbo, Mildura, Geraldton and also the Northern Territory.</para>
<para>These build on other initiatives that we are taking. They include appointing family consultants in Darwin, Alice Springs and Cairns to help Indigenous families access the courts, and funding of legal services specifically for Indigenous women through the women’s legal services in each state and territory. We are also looking at ways to recognise the extended family role in raising children in Indigenous communities, and I hope to have something to say about that shortly. These initiatives indicate the government’s very real and ongoing commitment to practical reconciliation and a better outcome for Indigenous Australians and Indigenous women and children in particular.</para>

What representations did the minister make to his former parliamentary secretary about the approval of child-care accreditation funding in his electorate under the Regional Partnerships program? Can the minister confirm that of the more than 500 Regional Partnerships grants approved up to December 2004, only one has gone to a project concerned with the training and accreditation of child-care staff, and this was awarded to a child-care centre in his own electorate? Will the minister now agree to allocate accreditation funding for all child-care staff across the nation who have identical or lower accreditation standards than the staff at the centre in his electorate?</para>

<para>—I thank the honourable member for her question. So far as I recall, I made no representations on the matter. It is not inappropriate for any member to make representations on behalf of constituents. We have had representations from those opposite in support of Regional Partnerships programs. We have had representations from the Leader of the Opposition in support of Regional Partnerships programs—and I have not claimed in this place that it was illegitimate for him to do so. He claims that all Regional Partnerships programs should be scrapped except, of course, for those in Brand as he seeks to walk both sides of the street again. But I will check. So far as I recall, I made no representations.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is a flexible program that meets some very real needs. For example, it has approved funding for 239 rural transaction centres, which provide vital banking, postal, Centrelink and Medicare services. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition would like to nominate which rural community should have missed out on face-to-face banking services.</para>

<para>—Yesterday, following question time, the Prime Minister asserted that I was wrong suggesting a majority of 13 particular nations with higher interest rates than Australia also had higher growth rates than Australia over the last year. To support his claim he tabled a document purporting to show average economic growth in these nations over the last five years. I seek leave to table a summary sourced from the OECD detailing economic growth rates of 13 nations having lower interest rates than Australia. The table shows nine of these 13 nations recorded stronger economic growth than Australia over the past year, thus dispensing with the claim yesterday that these countries had lower growth rates over the period.</para>

<para>—Mr Speaker, I have a question to you under standing order 103 and it relates to the interpretation of and application of standing order 94(a). I refer you to the House of Representatives <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for 17 February when Mr Deputy Speaker Causley was in the chair during the matter of public importance debate. Mr Speaker, I think you are aware of the course of events then. On that occasion the Chief Opposition Whip, the member for Chifley, was excluded from the House under standing order 94(a), having not been warned and whilst seeking to make a point of order. I contrast that application of 94(a) with the way in which the standing order was applied yesterday when there was the prime ministerial statement about Iraq. As you would be aware, the Leader of the Opposition was granted 18 minutes to make a statement of comparable length. As I believe the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> adequately shows, and certainly members of the House would recall, the Minister for Foreign Affairs interjected consistently for 17 of those 18 minutes. At about 17½ minutes you warned him. Then, as the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> clearly shows, he interjected again, but standing order 94(a) was not applied. I am seeking your guidance for the edification of members of the House, Mr Speaker. What is the appropriate standard: that members will be excluded without having been warned when seeking to raise a point of order; or that they be allowed to interject for 17 minutes, then, being warned, interject again and not be excluded?</para>

</talker>
<para>—Let me begin by expressing my strong support for the statement the Prime Minister made yesterday and by saying that it is a great source of pride to me—as the Minister for Foreign Affairs—and to the government, that Australia joined the international coalition to remove Saddam Hussein’s barbarous regime. Saddam Hussein was a brutal and evil dictator. He was a threat to his own people, he was a threat to international peace and security, and he defied the international community’s expressed demand that he disarm and comply with no fewer than 17 mandatory United Nations Security Council resolutions. His regime perpetrated some of the most egregious human rights abuses that the world has seen. Prime Minister Allawi has estimated that the total number of people missing from the Saddam Hussein era exceeds one million. Since the end of the war the coalition has received reports of some 275 mass graves, containing the remains of some 300,000 slain men, women and children. We have removed a regime that sustained its rule through rape, torture and murder. Over one million people perished as a consequence of the brutal war he launched against Iran in 1980. Some 5,000 people died during chemical weapon attacks on the Kurdish town of Halabja on 16 March 1988.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>There was of course debate in this country on whether we should or should not have participated in the war to overthrow Saddam Hussein, but there is no doubt that Iraqis have embraced their newly won human rights—such as freedom of speech and freedom of assembly and association—new political parties have emerged, women and minorities are engaged and welcomed in political life, Iraqis are conducting religious ceremonies and pilgrimages which were banned previously under Saddam’s tyranny, they have access to a flourishing media, with some 170 newspapers, satellite television stations and the internet, and they have exercised their right to elect their own government in the highly successful elections of 30 January. No-one has any illusions about how difficult it has been to get to this point, the point where we are at today on 8 March 2005.  Australia has made a contribution because Australia is a significant country, a country with a network of alliances and a country which has the capacity to contribute to the resolution of these problems in a more stable international environment.</para>
<para>We sent troops in the initial phase to overthrow Saddam Hussein’s regime and now we are proposing to send another 450 troops in order to provide support to the Japanese and ensure that they are able to do the humanitarian work that the Japanese Self Defence Force is undertaking in the Al Muthanna province. This was of course a difficult decision, as the Prime Minister said. It came, as he also said, out of the initial requests that were made firstly to Senator Hill and then to me when I was in London the day before the Iraqi elections on 29 January. I discussed this matter with Jack Straw, the British Foreign Secretary, and as a consequence of that he sent me a letter which I received in London on the Friday. The Prime Minister, Senator Hill and I and increasingly others discussed that during the next two weeks and eventually the cabinet made its final decision following a decision by the National Security Committee of cabinet.</para>
<para>We make no secret of the fact that it had not been our intention to send more troops until that time, that sitting fortnight—the last time the House sat—but nevertheless I believe it to be the right decision. I was supportive of the decision partly because of the role we are able to play in assisting the Japanese to ensure that there is a secure environment within which they can operate and do their humanitarian work. I think the contribution that we will make will be very much appreciated by the Iraqi people as well, and that is obviously a very important issue. My view on this overall issue is that, as other countries have made it clear—so our position is a pretty common position these days—on the question of Iraq, whatever the differences that people may have had on whether Saddam Hussein’s regime should have been overthrown or not and whatever the controversy about the weapons of mass destruction, the fact is that, like it or not—and people will take different views on that—we are now dealing with a situation on the ground in March 2005 and we have to make decisions day by day on what we do to address that situation.</para>
<para>If the international community showed a lack of resolve today and decided to abandon Iraq, the consequence would be that Iraq would be left in the hands of the terrorists and the insurgents who make up the remnants of the Saddam Hussein regime. The consequences for the 22 million or so people of Iraq would be quite dire, of course, if that were to happen. It would plunge their lives back into utter chaos. The consequences for the progress that is now being made with the slow spread of democracy and the stronger, more constructive and more positive climate in the Middle East would be disastrous. So many of the gains that we have seen—particularly, by the way, in the last few months—would be lost. Obviously the consequences for the United States and its allies from what is sometimes broadly described as ‘the West’ in the war against terrorism would also be utterly disastrous.</para>
<para>I appeal to people, whatever their political perspectives may be, to think about this issue in this context. It is reasonable enough for people to have different views over whether or not it was right to overthrow Saddam Hussein, whether the strategy on the ground has always been right since the overthrow and whether mistakes have been made—those are all important debates. I do not think there is any reason why we should necessarily walk away from those debates, but they are, in substance, historic debates. I think the real challenge for us today is to ensure that we do the right thing in the future and that the new emerging democratic Iraq is a success.</para>
<para>Australia is not a small country: it is the sixth biggest country in the world in area; it is the 11th or so biggest economy in the world; it has about the 50th biggest population. It is a very significant country. And Australia is a country which has the capacity to operate not just within the Asia-Pacific region; we have the capacity to operate beyond the Asia-Pacific region when we see it to be in our, our allies’ and the international community’s best interests. That is what we have done here. I think it would be a shameful thing if Australia were to cut and run from Iraq, to use a phrase—if we were to take the view that we should do nothing and abandon our responsibilities in Iraq. I think that would be a shameful thing. I think it would be Australia withdrawing in ignominy, and a matter of real national humiliation for us. I am actually, on the contrary, very proud of the fact that in Australia we continue to make a very strong contribution. Australia is committed also— <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline> As I was saying, we are very proud of the role we played in ensuring that Iraq is moving towards becoming a free country and we will continue to shoulder our share of the burden.</para>
<para>I must say, though, that the Labor Party’s position on Iraq has been a series of quite extraordinary outbursts over a long period of time. When the Labor Party first addressed this issue, they said they would support the overthrow of Saddam Hussein if done via a United Nations Security Council resolution or, if that resolution was not carried because of a veto, as long as there was substantial support for it. That position was abandoned, presumably as a result of a caucus decision. We had the call for the troops to be out by Christmas from Mark Latham and the claim that this had been discussed in the shadow cabinet when it clearly had not been, and that of course has been very much revealed since the federal election. The Labor Party lost the election and we then had the resurrection of the former Leader of the Opposition. Regrettably, for somebody who claims to be an expert on international security issues, he walks both sides of the street. He is not able to articulate clearly and in a way that anyone can remotely understand what the Labor Party’s aspirations for Iraq are and what the Labor Party wishes Australia’s contribution to be. We do not have enough troops there; we have too many troops there. We should bring our troops back into Asia—I am not quite sure what they would be doing in Asia. We should keep the Navy in the Persian Gulf, but we need the Navy to undertake maritime interception between the Philippines and Indonesia and we should bring it back to do that.</para>
<para>The series of contradictions and the waffle coming from the Leader of the Opposition are not just bamboozling but an embarrassment. I often say that the only people who would take heart from the Leader of the Opposition’s speech yesterday would be Geoffrey Barker and Alan Ramsay. It was a completely incomprehensible collection of thoughts, many of which were contradictory. The Labor Party needs to do what it said it would do before the Christmas period. It said it would go away over the Christmas-New Year period and consult with the United Nations, the Americans and the Iraqis on what Australia should do—</para>

<para>—We have just seen exit the chamber Australia’s now longest serving foreign minister and, I think history will record, Australia’s least significant foreign minister. In terms of his contribution to this country’s long-term national security interests and foreign policy interests, historians will make the judgment. But, if they look long and hard at this minister’s performance in the parliament, at his performance before the Australian people and at what concrete actions he has taken in his portfolio to enhance this country’s national security and long-term foreign policy interests, I believe historians will cast a harsh judgment indeed.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Dispatching troops to war in the first place is a grave decision; dispatching further troops to the same war is an even graver decision. This government has done both. Our troops of course have responded magnificently to the policy direction of the government and, as a consequence, they have done our country proud—as they constantly do our country proud wherever they serve and wherever I have seen them serve abroad, be it in Timor, Aceh or Iraq. Once again we pray for their safe return—each one of them. Each one comes from a family, from friends, from a community and from loved ones and each, therefore, is a precious life.</para>
<para>However, our purpose today is to debate the policy decision of the government on Iraq, the reasons for our involvement in this war, the consequences of our involvement in this war and what we can now do to build peace in Iraq. What were the government’s reasons for going to war? It is important in this debate to refresh our minds. They were very simple. They were threefold: (1) to eliminate stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons; (2) to prevent said stockpiles falling into the hands of terrorists; and (3) to eliminate said stockpiles by unilateral military means—absent the approval of the United Nations Security Council because the demand was so acute for our national security.</para>
<para>They were the three arguments advanced in this parliament at the dispatch box for our going to war in a foreign country. What the government did not argue was that their action in this invasion of Iraq was about international humanitarian intervention. They did not argue that they were about to liberate an oppressed people; they did not argue that they were involved in an enterprise of developing democracy in the wider Middle East. If honourable members have any doubts about any of these scores I would commend to them a quick read of the international legal opinion, which was tabled in this parliament by the Prime Minister, canvassing the reasons for this country going to war in Iraq.</para>
<para>Of course, if that is not a good enough test, honourable members could do a very simple word search. They could go the Prime Minister’s three statements delivered to the nation on why we were going to war and do a simple word search and note how many times they find in those three core statements these words: ‘weapons of mass destruction’. They were not just mentioned once; they were not just mentioned twice. A truck load of references were made to ‘weapons of mass destruction’ and their falling into the hands of terrorists. That is exhibit A.</para>
<para>Exhibit B is the statement made by the Prime Minister. If you look at the text of that statement and apply the same old word search—insert again the words ‘weapons of mass destruction’—what do you find? Not a single reference. The reason is that the entire argument which this government advanced for going to war has collapsed. Zero, zip and zilch is what you had in yesterday’s statement on the core reasons the government gave for going to war. When you have lost the reason for going to war, you have to invent a new reason. That is what this entire exercise has been about.</para>
<para>How many times have we in the opposition said of those who sit opposite us that they are loose with the truth. They are loose with the truth on national security and loose with the truth in putting Australian lives at risk. ‘Honest John’ is loose with the truth. The core arguments put for going to war are themselves the absolute essence of how this government has misled the Australian people, and people wonder why this Prime Minister’s reputation of trust in the Australian community more broadly is beginning to fracture.</para>
<para>What are the consequences of the war? Remember the objective set for this war was that it was an extension of the war against terrorism—that is, to reduce the overall terrorist threat. That was what it was about. The Prime Minister was warned, not by us but by others, as to the consequences which might arise from invading Iraq as far as terrorism was concerned. It was from no more reliable source than the British intelligence community. In February 2003, the British intelligence community wrote that the Joint Intelligence Committee:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block"> ... assessed that al-Qaeda and associated groups continued to represent by far the greatest terrorist threat to Western interests, and that threat would be heightened by military action against Iraq</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The date of said dispatch: February 2003. They read it; they had it before they went to war. We went to war in March 2003. We know this because it was subsequently outed through a Senate inquiry, which we requested and which they opposed, that this was presented to the Prime Minister. He knew that if he invaded Iraq it would actually exacerbate the terrorist threat. That was back in February 2003. Roll the clock forward a couple of years—the chickens have come home to roost. Who was their authority on this occasion? Porter Goss, the incoming Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. In his congressional testimony, which I commend to honourable members for a read about what has actually happened as a result of the Iraq war, he says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Islamic extremists are exploiting the Iraqi conflict to recruit new anti-U.S. jihadists</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">…         …         …</para>
<quote>
<para>These jihadists who survive will leave Iraq experienced and focused on acts of urban terrorism. They represent a potential pool of contacts to build transnational terrorist cells, groups and networks in Saudi Arabia, Jordan and other countries.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In other words, what Porter Goss, the Director of the CIA, is saying is that British intelligence warned this mob a couple of years ago. Remember that Iraq at that stage had had negligible contact with al-Qaeda, the mob that killed all those people on September 11, and its offshoot, Jemaah Islamiah, which killed our people in Bali not long after. Iraq, at the stage that we went to war, had virtually no connection with al-Qaeda—virtually none. What we have turned Iraq into—and this is the core national security issue at stake in this—is a new recruiting ground, training ground, facilitating pool, swamp, in which the new breed of global terrorists is being trained. This adds to the overall terrorist threat across the world.</para>
<para>If we go back again to the extraordinarily arrogant statements by this arrogant minister about his foreign policy responsibilities, I do not know how any person in conscience can walk around and say: ‘Oh, I have just gone over there and created civil war. I have also created a new training ground for a whole bunch of new terrorists. And that is all just tickety-boo; everything is just moving along fine, thanks. There are no real problems.’ This affects our security in our own region, our own neighbourhood, our own backyard. Remember the objective was to invade Iraq to reduce the overall terrorist threat. The achievement has been the reverse. Therefore, when the Australian people ask themselves the basic and legitimate question, ‘Is our security as a nation, as a people, better or worse as a consequence of this government’s decision to invade Iraq?’ any sober answer has to be, ‘It is worse.’ Because they are now out there by the thousand trained, exacerbated and excited by the events in Iraq and potentially unleashed on the world. And our authority on this? The Central Intelligence Agency.</para>
<para>What can we now do to help the Iraqi people, those who have suffered most from this war? First of all, let us just knock on the head some of this bogus, latter-day, post facto humanitarian concern on the part of those opposite. Remember the whole debate about whether they were going to take up their responsibilities as an occupying power in Iraq once the invasion had happened: if you are an occupying power you are responsible, once you invade the country, for the wellbeing of the civilian population of all 20 million Iraqis. They ran from that at a pace of knots. We reminded them time after time in the public debate and in here that they had formal responsibilities under the Geneva conventions, but they were out in a flash, or at least that is what they asserted—a month or two as an occupying power and flick pass the responsibility to others. This is the mob that now say they have this active role in humanitarian concern. Ask this government this question—and I am sorry Tweedledum, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, is not here today, because we could ask him this question and he could give us an answer.</para>

<para>—I have done it twice. Do you want me to do it three times? So here is the key question about the absolute guts of this government’s concern for the Iraqi people. Ask this government today—and we have tried to do this through Senate estimates—how many Iraqi civilians have been killed since the invasion; how many Iraqi civilians have been injured since the invasion. I would have thought that, as an occupying power in Iraq, at least until June last year, you would have a passing interest in this because you are the mob running the country. You have got rid of Saddam Hussein—and the Prime Minister has given us his reasons for doing that—you have then actually taken over the government for a period of about 18 months and you are responsible for about 20 million Iraqis, but as of the most recent Senate estimates you were not able to tell us whether there was any reliable calculation of how many people in the civilian population have been killed and injured as a consequence of the invasion.</para>

<para>They say now, ‘What about the Iraqi people?’ There are things we can do when it comes to the Iraqi people. There are practical things we can do, but this Prime Minister’s response is to add this new deployment of almost 500 troops. Despite having been ‘Honest John’, loose with the truth for far too long, he said to John Laws:</para>
<quote>
<para>I can definitely say we won’t be adding hundreds. I can definitely say we’re not going to have a capacity to put more regular soldiers on the ground. We just don’t have that and I’ve made that clear to the Americans and the British ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I do not see any weasel word in that. ‘I’—John Howard—‘can definitely say we won’t be adding hundreds.’ That is what he said last April. Of course the Prime Minister now says circumstances have changed. The reasons given are tilting points, tipping points, lipping points, backflip points—you name it, they come up with it. There is a new word every day to explain what they have done. Dutch in, Dutch out; Ukrainians in, Ukrainians out; Bulgarians in, Bulgarians out; Australians up, down—all of it a series of reasons given by this mob, if you listen on any given day, relating to their assertion that circumstances have radically changed. None of them are convincing, but the Prime Minister says, ‘Not to worry, because I haven’t misled you.’ This is the key point I wish to impress upon the parliament—because it affects all of us, not just in the foreign policy sphere. It is the new prime ministerial doctrine of truth—that is, what constitutes lying to the Australian people, what constitutes misleading the Australian people.</para>
<para>What John Howard says is, ‘Don’t worry; I don’t regret it because it was consistent with my state of mind at the time. I like to be inconsistent with my state of mind at the time but it was consistent with my state of mind at the time.’ This is worth drilling into just a bit, because it affects all of us. That is, ‘So long as I, the Prime Minister, am convinced that what I, the Prime Minister, said last year was consistent with my state of mind at the time, bob’s your uncle. Therefore what I, the Prime Minister, actually say to the parliament and people is not relevant; it is what I think in my mind is consistent with my mind as it was back then.’ How do you know what is consistent or inconsistent with the Prime Minister’s mind back then? There is only one person who can tell you. Who’s that? The Prime Minister. He is the only person who can actually define whether he has been consistent or inconsistent with his mind when he makes a statement.</para>
<para>Anything the Prime Minister actually says is irrelevant, because there is a deeper, hidden, psychological, almost Freudian truth here, which is, ‘What is deeply in my mind at the time?’ That is his benchmark for deciding whether you are misleading somebody or not. So this is basically it: ‘I, Louis XIV, the person who runs the show here, do not take questions that are inconvenient. The new standard of truth is this: it is not what I say; it is what I had in my mind at the time.’ That is the new Howard doctrine of ministerial accountability in the parliament.</para>
<para>There are practical ways in which the Iraqi people can be helped. We on this side of the parliament have argued those for a long time, because the Iraqi people have suffered much in recent years. We argued that we can assist the Iraqi people in their continued efforts against terrorism by assisting in the protection of their oil terminals on the Gulf by the maintenance of HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Darwin</inline> and those ships which have preceded it and which may follow it. We have argued that we can assist the Iraqi people through enhanced border security. Why? Because there are jihadists coming in through highly porous borders with Jordan, Syria and Saudi Arabia. Based on my last visit to Iraq, one of the areas where acute assistance is needed is in enhancing the border control systems of the Iraqi border security services.</para>
<para>We can also assist the UN presence in Iraq itself, and we have made practical proposals on that line. How about a cancer hospital? Oncology services in Baghdad are virtually non-existent. We have a policy which says we should put our shoulder to the wheel and build an oncology hospital. Why not an Australian oncology hospital to service the needs of the Iraqi people? These are practical ways in which we can assist the people of Iraq and help build the peace, but we do not believe you can do that with a Prime Minister advancing a proposition to the country based on a lie. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

It is not unparliamentary to use the words ‘a lie’; we can use them in many, many contexts. What you cannot do is accuse somebody of lying. The member for Griffith did not accuse anybody of lying. He did say something was ‘based on a lie’, but that is a different form of words, a different form of speech, and there is no precedent of which I am aware that says that phrase should be withdrawn.</para>

<para>—The member for Ballarat asked in question time about a Regional Partnerships grant for a child-care centre in my electorate, and I said that I would come back when I had more information. My department has checked the files. I can tell the House that, on 7 June 2004, I did write to the parliamentary secretary in support of this application. I would, though, just like to add a little to my answer. The child-care centre is at Bourke. It is the only centre in a 100-kilometre radius. Bourke, of course, has a very large disadvantaged community, and it would be hard to imagine a community in Australia that is doing it tougher than Bourke at the moment.</para>

<para>—As a result of the remote location and drought, it was having difficulty attracting staff. The grant was not to pay for the training of child-care staff; it was mainly to hire a temporary, untrained staff member so that the existing staff could study for their accreditation. The Commonwealth grant was matched almost dollar for dollar by cash or in-kind support from the applicant and a local business house. The project was strongly supported by the Orana Development and Employment Council, and the parliamentary secretary approved the project in line with the department’s recommendations.</para>

<para>—Unfortunately, on International Women’s Day today, we had the Prime Minister misleading the parliament on a matter that is of utmost importance to working women in particular: the government’s promise to introduce a 30 per cent tax rebate on child-care expenses. When the government went to the election last year, they promised that this rebate on child-care expenses would be payable from July this year, 2005. In question time today we had the Prime Minister in his usual triumphant and arrogant manner telling the parliament that he did not know what Labor was on about. Not only is he now up to breaking his promises but also plainly he forgets them. He said in the parliament today that we had got it all wrong and that in fact the payment was being brought forward.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Let me inform the Prime Minister about his own promise which is now, of course, yet another broken promise. The Prime Minister has only the Treasurer to thank. Just before Christmas, the Treasurer announced that this promise to allow parents to claim the child-care rebate from July 2005 would not apply any more and that parents would have to wait until July 2006. Parents are going to have to wait another whole year before they get to see any of this tax rebate. The Prime Minister forgets that the promise he made during the election was to make sure that parents could get the benefit of this tax rebate from July 2005. So, Prime Minister, it would be a good idea to tell parents the truth, that this election promise has now been broken and parents will not in fact be able to claim this tax rebate until July 2006. This means that parents are going to have to continue to pay very high child-care fees and that they will not get any relief from those high child-care fees for another year—another year past the time that this Prime Minister promised before the election.</para>
<para>This is a very bitter disappointment to Australian families, and to Australian women in particular on this International Women’s Day. It should be a day of celebration, but it is a day when Australian women will have to face up to the fact that on this very important election promise this Prime Minister has yet again broken his promise. Today is a very important day to remember all the other areas where we have a very long way to go indeed. One particular area where this government continues to fall behind is in closing the gap between the average wages of men and women. If we have a look at what has happened to the gap over the time that this government has been in power, we can see that we now have a gap of over $300 a week between men’s and women’s average total wages. The gap is about $300 a week. The total average wage earned by women is just 65 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. Women’s average weekly earnings are now $587.30 while men’s average weekly earnings are $898.20. The shocking news for women, particularly for those women on lower wages, is that the gap between men’s and women’s total average wages grew from $229 a week in 1996 to $310 in 2004. This government has presided over an increase in the gap between men’s and women’s wages between 1996 and 2004.</para>
<para>We have also seen an extraordinary increase in the number of women working in casual jobs. Between August 1996, when this government came in, and August 2003 the number of women in casual work has increased by over 18 per cent. So we now have 1.2 million Australian women working in casual jobs. That is the reality of what this government has done to working women since it came to office. An extraordinary change has taken place in our workplace. Women in workplaces have also been treated like second-class workers under this government. We have seen the pay gap increase, and we have seen more and more women having to take casual jobs where their financial security is at risk. We have women on lower earnings, and the results of that are lower living standards and lower rates of saving and, for women in many circumstances, a chronic and precarious financial outlook. One of the major problems that this government has imposed on Australian women over its time in office is to make their living standards that much worse.</para>
<para>It is in the area of child care that we have some of the most serious concerns. We all know that if good quality affordable child care is not available it is just impossible for women to return to work after the birth of their babies. We know how essential it is for women to be able to choose to go back to work, and in circumstances where for their own family’s financial wellbeing some women must work. What are the problems that so many families, so many women, present to us on a daily basis? First and foremost is how hard it is to find a child-care place. Second is how hard it is to afford a child-care place. And, of course, as a result of the Prime Minister’s broken promise, the tax rebate that he promised during the election campaign will not be able to be claimed by parents for another year.</para>
<para>It is also the case that quality is threatened, primarily because we have an increasingly severe shortage of child-care workers. There has been a lot of discussion in the parliament in the last few days about skills shortages. It does not apply just to the traditional trades; it also applies in this very important area of child care. The Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Patterson, who is responsible for this area, revealed her belief earlier this year. She said in a statement that there were no child-care shortages. I will quote a statement in the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline>:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Federal Minister for Families Kay Patterson said resources had been expanded and her spokesman said demand was being met.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Those of you from Queensland, I am sure, would vouch for the fact that that is absolutely not the case. It just flies in the face of reality and it shows how out of touch this government is when it comes to making sure that there is an adequate number of child-care places available. This minister realised the folly of her ways just a couple of days later when she admitted grudgingly that there were ‘a few areas of unmet need’, in which case she said the market would solve it. ‘The market will solve it’, she blithely wrote in a letter to the editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline>.</para>
<para>After this second instalment of the minister’s official view on child-care availability I have no doubt that each and every one of you got an avalanche of phone calls. There were various letters to the paper about how it is absolutely necessary for the government to step in and make sure, especially in those areas where it is just not economical for private operators to work—maybe in the area that the member for Gwydir just mentioned; I think the member for Gwydir might have some areas like that in his electorate and I think in Wollongong and in many other parts of Australia there would be some areas like that—where it is just not viable for private operators to work, that child-care centres are available. We do need the government to come in and make sure that child-care centres are available.</para>
<para>The cost of child care has skyrocketed under this government. Just two weeks ago a task force on child-care costs—a consortium of leading employers and businesses—put out a press release. Child-care costs, according to them, have increased at 2.2 times the rate of average wage and salary earnings in the period 2002 to 2004. Just in that period we have seen an explosion in child-care costs. This task force also found that more than 37 per cent of the workers they surveyed were likely to leave the work force in the near future because of the cost of care. That is why this broken promise by the Prime Minister is so significant: women are saying they will have to leave the work force because of the extraordinary increase in the cost of care.</para>
<para>The government said that they want to introduce a 30 per cent child-care rebate, but only two months after the election—they did not wait very long at all—before the ink was dry, they broke the promise. They said, ‘Sorry, everyone—sorry, parents—you’re going to have to wait for another whole year before you get the benefit of this child-care rebate.’ Parents have also been left not knowing what they will have to do. Do they have to keep all receipts for two years and then present all of those receipts to the tax office to claim their rebates? Parents have not been told that this is what they will have to do, so goodness knows how they are going to find the receipts when it comes to claiming this 30 per cent rebate.</para>
<para>The government also broke their promise—once again, just before Christmas—when they said that the amount of child-care tax rebate that could be claimed was going to be capped. I am sure you all remember that during the election campaign the Prime Minister said that there would not be a cap on the child-care tax rebate, but now they have decided that they spent far too much money in the lead-up to the election and that they are going to have to pull the belt in in relation to child care. The savings that this Treasurer has made as a result of these two broken promises is $344 million. So it is no good the Prime Minister coming into question time and saying, ‘I don’t know what you’re talking about.’ How could it be that the Treasurer is claiming a saving of $344 million if they have not broken those election promises? Either they have the saving because they have broken their promise or they do not have the saving and they have another blow-out in their budget figures.</para>
<para>In question time today we had an extraordinary example from the Deputy Prime Minister of how to go about making sure you have high-quality child care in your child-care centres. Obviously, the answer is to make sure that you put in your application at the right moment and be the beneficiary, under this regional rorts program, of additional funding for a child-care centre so that you can help with accreditation. Funnily enough, none of us heard about it! None of us knew that you could apply for this money. Funnily enough the regional rorts program extends to the Deputy Prime Minister’s electorate and to his child-care centre, but to none of ours!</para>
<para>Everybody wants to make sure that their child-care centres are of the highest quality. All parents want that. Certainly all childcare workers want to make sure that they are delivering child care of the highest standard. One of the major problems with child care is making sure that we have properly qualified childcare workers and that they are properly paid—childcare workers receive very low pay. Very recently we had a decision from the Australian Industrial Relations Commission awarding a significant pay rise to childcare workers in Victoria and the ACT. We certainly hope that when that is implemented it will help. Parents cannot afford to see their fees go through the roof as childcare workers are appropriately paid. That is why, once again, it is so critical that this rebate be paid, and paid on time—and that the Prime Minister is held to his word so that parents ensure that their children go to centres where childcare workers are paid properly but parents are not paying through the nose or having to leave work because they cannot afford child care.</para>
<para>Labor had quite a different approach before the last election. We recognised that there was a serious shortage of child-care places. We wanted to add to the number of long day care places, where there are very serious shortages. We also wanted to add to the number of places for after school hours care, where there are significant shortages. I do not think there would be a parent in the country who does not know how hard it is to organise child care, especially during vacations and after school. So on this very important day, International Women’s Day, it is time for us to recognise the enormous pressure that this government is putting on parents especially, as a result of its broken promise on child-care. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I find it rather ironic that this debate, an MPI alleging the failure of the government to deliver for Australian women, should be brought into the House by the federal Labor Party, hot on the heels of a Labor Party factional brawl over the leadership of the party—a brawl which saw Labor members questioning the credentials of a woman for the leadership job, based on her marital and family status. What message does the federal Labor Party send to the women of Australia? In reference to the Labor Party, Susan Ryan, a former minister in the Hawke government, said in an interview on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline>:</para>

<para class="block">It is little wonder that former Labor member Cheryl Kernot revealed a culture of what she called ‘bullying’ in the ALP.

So it will obviously be a long time before we see her again.</para>
<para>But Labor have double standards on this and on so many other issues in terms of what they say and what they do. For Labor to raise the role of women in Australian society and suggest that their record is something to emulate just exposes their rank hypocrisy. The Labor Party elected as their leader the former member for Werriwa—a man who in his public utterances single-handedly denigrated and demeaned all Australian women when in his crude vernacular he referred to a professional journalist as a ‘dirty whore’. When he spoke so disparagingly about a woman, what did we hear from the men or women of the ALP? Did anyone ask or demand that he apologise as common decency would require?</para>

<para>—to speak with any authority on the role of women in Australian society. This incident highlighted for women across Australia the double standards and sheer hypocrisy within the Australian Labor Party. At the last election, the women of Australia looked at the record of achievements for women under the Howard government and voted accordingly. I am here as a minister in the Howard government to speak with pride about the increased status of women in our society and the Howard government’s regard and respect for Australian women and their contribution to our society.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>A hallmark of the Howard government’s public policy is choice, and nowhere more so than in the area of public policy issues affecting women and their role in society. Since 1996, we as a government have recognised and embraced the changed and changing role of women within our community. We have attacked in a practical way areas of continuing discrimination. We have established practical options for Australian women—wherever they live, whatever they choose to do, whatever their personal circumstances and whatever situation they find themselves in. The government have recognised that the right solutions for women are the right solutions for the community as a whole—and they are the outcomes that women themselves want. So instead of the cliches trotted out by Labor, which reveal a mind-set that is still so out of step with contemporary Australian women—Labor are still in a seventies time warp—let us look at the undeniable facts.</para>
<para>This government has provided more opportunities and choice for Australian women than any previous government. We recognise that women fulfil many different roles throughout their lives. They have different needs and responsibilities, whether they be education, families, careers, retirement, health or aged care. The greatest opportunities this government has provided to women come from the benefits that flow from one of the strongest economies that Australia has ever seen. We have the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years. That means there is an increasing number of jobs for all Australians, including women. At 66 per cent and increasing, women’s labour force participation is the highest it has ever been.</para>
<para>In recognition of the aspirations of many women to maintain a balance of career and family, the Howard government has set record levels of support for women in many areas. Let us take child care, for example. The coalition government has spent and continues to spend more on child care than any Labor government ever did. In fact, we expect to spend around $8 billion over the next four years to support child care. Our commitment will be significantly boosted, with additional assistance of $1.1 billion to 2007-08 for the child-care tax rebate and grandparent carer measures which the Prime Minister announced in the election campaign. So we are looking at women in their roles as mothers and grandmothers. In addition, the government has funded 40,000 new outside school hours care places and 4,000 new family day care places. These have been available since December 2003. In the six years to 2003-04, around $8.8 billion has been spent on child care. That is more than double the amount spent in Labor’s last six years in office—in actual dollars.</para>
<para>Child-care benefit assists over 700,000 families a year using approved child care. The child-care benefit subsidises around 67 per cent of the total cost of full-time long day care to low-income families paying average fees. The latest available figures show that families receive an average child-care benefit payment of over $2,000 a year. Child-care benefit is indexed each year in line with the CPI to maintain the value of that payment to families—it was boosted by 2.4 per cent last July. The number of government funded child-care places and services has increased substantially since the Howard government came to office. Child-care places have increased by about 83 per cent from over 306,000 to 561,900. The outside school hours care places have increased by 277 per cent from 71,000 to 270,000. Family day care places have increased from 60,100 to 776,300. We are talking about massive increases. Child-care services have increased by some 28 per cent. Record numbers of children have access to Australian government funded child-care places. So it is a nonsense to suggest otherwise. The number of children using child care has increased by about 21 per cent since the introduction of the child-care benefit.</para>
<para>The Australian government have implemented quality assurance systems in long day care, family day care and outside school hours care to ensure the services provide quality outcomes for children. In order to be eligible for the child-care benefit and other funding support, services must comply with all applicable Commonwealth, state and territory legislation and regulations. We fund the National Childcare Accreditation Council to administer quality assurance to ensure children have a positive experience that fosters all aspects of their development. In so many ways, whether it be implementing quality assurance, the Special Needs Subsidy Scheme or the community support stream in child-care support, we are doing what we can to ensure that women have the choice to maintain their careers and go back into the work force while ensuring that their children are being appropriately cared for.</para>
<para>The Howard government are delivering for Australian women in a number of other areas. We have ensured that our tax policy provides support for families to give women choice within the family situation. The family tax benefit provides support for the cost of children to around two million families—about 3½ million children benefit from the family tax benefit. The vast majority of Australian families with dependent children are now eligible to receive the family tax benefit.</para>
<para>In recognition of the special needs of new mothers, since 1 July last year new mothers have received a non-means-tested maternity payment of $3,000 to assist with the costs associated with the birth or adoption of a new baby. The rate of the maternity payment will increase to $4,000, from 1 July 2006, and then to $5,000, from 1 July 2008. So in so many ways the Australian government is recognising the needs, the hopes, the dreams and the aspirations of Australian women.</para>
<para>Let us focus on women in the work force. Since 1996, full-time adult ordinary time earnings for women have increased in real terms—that is, after taking account of inflation—by $152 a week. That is a 21 per cent increase and represents an annual rate of growth in real earnings of 2.2 per cent. Under Labor, women’s real earnings grew at an annual rate of just 0.6 per cent.</para>
<para>The claim by Labor that the gap between male and female earnings has increased is also wrong. This can be seen in the Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates of full-time adult ordinary time earnings. Women’s earnings have increased as a proportion of men’s. The proportion has risen from 83.2 per cent in February to 84.8 per cent today, so the gap is closing, not increasing.</para>
<para>Let us consider what has been achieved under this government’s responsible economic management in relation to women’s jobs. With strong economic management and the fiscal discipline shown by the Howard government, women have benefited from the creation of almost 820,000 new jobs—53 per cent of the total of more than 1.5 million new jobs created under the Howard government. This additional employment for women comprises nearly 340,000 full-time jobs and 480,000 part-time jobs. So this balance reflects the diversity of aspirations and choices of Australian women.</para>
<para>The impact of these increasing opportunities can be seen in the rising proportion of women participating in paid work. While in 1996 49.6 per cent of Australian women were in employment, with the strong growth of the economy this is now 53.6 per cent. There has been remarkable growth in the employment of older women. Support for families with children, for women entering the work force and for women remaining in the work force has enabled so many women to choose to combine both employment and the care of their children.</para>
<para>In my portfolio, the Ageing portfolio, the government supports women in their varying roles as carers and aged care workers. In fact, women make up 95 per cent of the aged care work force. Through increased government support, women have been able to find rewarding and challenging careers in aged care. In the last budget, over $101 million of funding was made available for increased training and education opportunities. It is a fact that most carers are women. We have increased funding for the National Respite for Carers Program fivefold. This year over $105 million is being invested in the program.</para>
<para>All of these measures help underline the government’s principle of choice for women. Unlike Labor, we believe that people should have choice in how they live and how they manage their work and their family. We do not believe in one-size-fits-all systems which tell people how to live, that they must work, that they must have children or that they should or should not do certain things. We do not believe in the nanny state. We do not believe in artificial quotas, and this is in line with what Australian women want.</para>
<para>In this government, for the first time in Australia’s history, there are now nine female ministers and parliamentary secretaries. Women from the Liberal Party side were elected first to the House of Representatives and to almost all of the state parliaments. We have a proud history of supporting women’s choice and women’s role in society. It was a Liberal government that introduced child endowment, that introduced the first national child-care office, that first recognised the rights of married pensioners in the tax system and that introduced private health insurance provision. On the international front, we can be proud that Australian women now hold 19 high commission positions. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I would like to respond to a few comments made by the previous speaker, the member for Curtin. I suggest to the member for Curtin that, if we want to conduct a debate on International Women’s Day around issues of who promotes women and who wins ballots in parties, the Liberal Party is indeed—as you, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, would appreciate—not always the best example. Much of the member for Curtin’s speech, where she focused on choice and the importance that the Howard government places on the concept of choice, reflected a lot of statistics and amounts of money and not much of the reality and the challenges faced by many of the families we deal with in our electorates.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I welcome the opportunity to address the subject of this debate on matters of public importance today, International Women’s Day. There are so many areas in which the ability of Australian women to participate fully and effectively in our communities and our nation has suffered significantly under the Howard government’s policies. The Howard government constantly trumpet their two magic words—‘choice’ is one of them; the other is ‘flexibility’—and tell us how much joy and sunshine these two principles bring into the lives of Australian families. It is obvious from the real experience of families that all that has been achieved is that greater pressure has been placed on the ability of families to balance their work commitments and provide quality time for their family needs.</para>
<para>One of the most serious failures of the government has been its refusal to take on the crisis that exists in many areas in the provision of child care for working families. Indeed, the member for Curtin has just exhibited that failure again by fundamentally denying that there is in fact a problem. During the election campaign last year, the member for Throsby and I invited the shadow minister to visit our area. We did that because we needed to address the concerns that had been raised with us by so many local families. I will give just one example of the stories that were brought to us. There was a young couple we met who were very organised and proactive and who had registered for a child-care place on the day they discovered the woman was pregnant. At the time of the election they were still waiting to find a place; their child was 10 months old and the woman was to return to work in two months time.</para>
<para>The waiting lists continue to be a real issue of concern in our area, as they are in so many other places, particularly for nought- to two-year-olds. It is interesting to note the government’s speculation currently under way about requiring single mothers to return to work when their children start school. It is clear that this will place an unbearable and unrealistic demand on single mothers if they are unable to access child care. Indeed, if the existing working population is already having trouble finding child care, how much pressure will this requirement also place on the child-care providers?</para>
<para>For many women the ‘flexible’ work environment actually means casual or part-time work that is often unpredictable in hours and unreliable in income provision. In fact, the number of women in casual work has grown by close to 19 per cent since 1996. This has no doubt contributed to the fact that since 1996 the gap between men’s and women’s total average wage has widened by over $300 per week. Indeed, there are reports today that the lower wages we are seeing are also causing lower superannuation savings for women, affecting the financial security of women in retirement.</para>
<para>The other factor arising from the nature of casual work is that it severely erodes a working woman’s capacity to meet the needs of her family. I have had many local women describe the difficult dilemmas they face when a child falls sick, for example. As casuals they have no access to parental leave. They do not dare refuse a shift or ring in sick, as they know that such a black mark against their name can only mean fewer shifts in future. They do not have extended family to rely on—the reality is that many grandmothers are now working and are not readily available for emergency child care. Very often their partner is also in casual or part-time work where they cannot afford the black mark of trying to get time off work when children are sick. This is the real face of flexibility in the work force, which is wrongly represented by the Howard government as the new friendly structure that allows families to negotiate family-friendly work conditions with their employers.</para>
<para>The government so often also talks about the need for Australians to be having more children, yet over a quarter of women of child-bearing and child-rearing age are in precarious and family-unfriendly working conditions which become a major deterrent to young couples beginning families. Approximately one-third of women are in jobs where they have no rights to important entitlements such as sick leave, annual leave or compassionate leave—the very entitlements that make it possible for women to be working Australians and mothers at the same time without making heartbreaking choices between those roles. I also point to the growing trend of women undertaking greater responsibility for elderly parents who are often frail and highly dependent. Many women are working, looking after the needs of their own immediate family and also trying to juggle doctors appointments, banking, shopping needs and so forth for frail or elderly parents.</para>
<para>The shadow minister for industrial relations correctly identified today that 60 per cent of low-paid workers are women who will be seriously affected by proposals by this government to undermine the ability of the minimum wage cases to deliver some fairness to these low-paid workers. Clearly, the future for so many women workers is looking more precarious and difficult under this government. The minister for industrial relations has made it clear that fairness is not an important principle, apparently, for this government. You are only going to get the flexibility ‘f’; you will not get the fairness one.</para>
<para>In recent days we have also heard much from this government about how seriously it takes skill shortages. I have been taking issue with this claim in terms of the investment in addressing the growing demand for traditional trades apprentices. I would like to take this opportunity to point out that it is also failing to deliver sufficient funding for the training of child-care workers. As an example from my own area, there were nearly 100 young people turned away from child studies courses at TAFE this year. Sixty-two had applied to complete the child-care diploma and 33 had applied for the certificate III in child care. Clearly, the government is failing to recognise, and invest to address, a future shortage in the child-care industry as well as in the traditional trades. I might say that the vast bulk of those who were turned away were young women.</para>
<para>The other issue that we hear about constantly from child-care providers is the growing problem of recruiting workers. It is clear that the problem is not caused by any job snobbery by young people or their families, as the Prime Minister would have us believe. The problem is that funding of the TAFE sector has been frozen for so many years that young people are being turned away, even when they are looking to train in areas of skill shortage and in an industry that is critical to the capacity of families in our communities to balance their family and work commitments.</para>
<para>The same problem I have just described for child-care training applies to the thousands of women who are turned away each year from other critical training areas such as nursing, aged care nursing and teaching. International Women’s Day is obviously an important day on which we recognise—97 years after women in the United States first went on strike for better wages and improved workplace conditions—the importance of working to improve women’s wages and working conditions.</para>
<para>Women are constantly and loudly still calling for fairer access to education, affordable housing and health care, and working to expose the instances of abuse, neglect and discrimination in our society. To simply paint a picture that says that this side of the House is attempting to raise negatives in a time when all is sunshine and roses is an absolute indictment of this government for its inability to come to terms with the reality facing many families in our communities. Indeed, it does not take long in your electorate office talking to people about the challenges they face—such as the family that cannot get child care or the family that is trying to find an aged care place for elderly parents—to realise these are very real pressures and demands on working Australian families. They are very real pressures that face women in trying to make choices between work and family. It is no surprise that young people in our community who are facing the cost of housing and health care and, indeed, the pressure to work to fund their basic lifestyle are not choosing to have families. The government constantly runs the line about the importance of young families having children so that we do not have the problems of an ageing population but walks away from the things that would fix the problem. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—It is a pleasure to join the debate today on International Women’s Day. I thank all those all over Australia and the world who are taking time to mark this very special occasion. I think it was Virginia Woolf who said, ‘As a woman I have no country, my country is the whole world.’ As we used to say, the sisterhood stretches across countries, class barriers and distinctions in a way that perhaps no other connection can. I think that that is the message for today’s International Women’s Day, that we remember women all over the world.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I urge all Australian women to reach out to women on the other side of the world, especially those who struggle with poverty and disadvantage, particularly in developing countries. We should remember and support women who have not had the advantages we have had, both in terms of living in a wealthy country and living in a society where opportunities between men and women are equal.</para>
<para>We should remember women who have to watch their children go hungry or not receive adequate medication. As mothers, we should understand the heartache that that produces. That should be the main message coming from this parliament and this debate today. It was disappointing to hear the member for Cunningham and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition niggle at the government over slight differences, either in policy or in philosophy. We should, as women, unite across and in spite of our political differences and recognise together how far we have come, thanks to the guts of the women who have gone before us. They made, for example, my life so easy as a woman with three children all at school, able to take my place in the parliament today and represent the people of Farrer. There are many examples opposite of women who have small children and who, in fact, have given birth while they have been members of parliament. The flexibility and the choice that they have is testimony to the society in which we live.</para>
<para>I want today, particularly remembering that it is International Women’s Day, to spare a thought for the women of Iraq and the women of Afghanistan who have laboured under some horrendous regimes. Now that democracy is being introduced to that part of the world, they can look forward to a brighter future. I remember during the regime of the Taliban in Afghanistan seeing some file footage of some men getting into the front of a station wagon and bundling the women into the back, where there were not even any seats, just like so much baggage. The horror of that picture is something to be remembered. This is not a religious bias—this is not a criticism of Islam, which is in fact very generous towards women—this is a cultural bias in these societies. We certainly saw it in the very secular Iraq under the very brutal regime of Saddam Hussein. We should spare a thought for the women who yearn to bring democracy to a post-Saddam Iraq and who are working hard to do that. These women appreciate the difference between totalitarianism and democracy, between the worlds that separate a person whose life is controlled by a tyrant and a person who can walk and talk freely.</para>
<para>This Australian government has always had a policy of opportunity and choice for women. Recent research indicates that, since 1996, full-time adult ordinary time earnings for women have increased in real terms, after inflation, by $152 a week, which is a 21 per cent real increase in wages. I point out that statistic because those on the other side today have said that wages have somehow fallen when you compare the wages women earn to the wages men earn, and that is to be refuted. It also has to be remembered that while the aggregate wages women earn probably are less, they reflect the different lifestyle choices that women make. As an example, anecdotally, women who have been in high-flying professions might choose, when they come to the child-bearing time of their life, to drop back to not working at all and then work perhaps in a part-time, less stressful job so that they can devote that time to caring and sharing with their family.</para>
<para>It is the role of governments to facilitate the choices that families make, not—as the Minister for Ageing so correctly pointed out—to be in there telling people what to do and how to live their lives. So it is important that we should not describe the cultural characteristics of our society as being negatives for women. The fact that women choose to stay at home or leave the work force for a while in order to have and raise children or take less pressured, lower paid jobs in order to get the work and family balance right should not be a reason to condemn the government for low wages or less opportunity for women.</para>
<para>
<inline font-style="italic">Women in Australia 2004</inline>, the third in the <inline font-style="italic">Women in Australia</inline> series, was published today. I commend this publication to anyone who is interested in the state of women in society today. One of the things that was pointed out was that women do not have prominence in managerial and decision-making roles. I would like to see that increase—I am sure we all would. But I suppose it is reflective of the fact that the average working life for a man is, I think, 38 years and for a woman it is 18 years. That is not a problem; it is simply a feature of the fact that women bear the children and women generally take the time off to raise them. These are cultural features of our society and they should not be something that governments in some way should try and correct, even if they could.</para>
<para>I mentioned <inline font-style="italic">Women in Australia 2004</inline>. It is an excellent statistical and analytical reference publication and I commend the Office of the Status of Women for doing such a good job in conjunction, I think, with the Australian Bureau of Statistics. It provides a snapshot of the state of women in Australia today—the good and bad and the ugly. But overwhelmingly I think it gives a positive picture of where we are, where we have been and where we are going. Women are living longer. The retention rate at school for year 12 girls is now 81 per cent. The proportion of women in management and decision-making roles is not as high as I would like to see it but it is increasing.</para>
<para>This particular publication highlights the story for Australian women in a range of diverse areas—management, politics, rural and regional areas. As a rural and regional member in this place, I pay tribute to the work that women do, often in isolation and in very dire financial circumstances, in my own electorate and in other rural parts of Australia as they battle life on the land, with all the difficulties that that presents and continues to present as we face year after year of low rainfall and difficult commodity prices in some areas.</para>
<para>Of particular note in the publication <inline font-style="italic">Women in Australia 2004</inline> are the significant improvements in women’s employment which demonstrate the success of the government’s economic policies in providing increased opportunities and rewards for participation. People talk a lot about what the government can provide. Of course it can only provide what the economy can produce. This economy over the last 10 years has seen record growth in productivity. We are now coming up against supply constraints in the economy so, in the context of the current industrial relations debate, that is what we as a government are quite rightly paying attention to. If we can remove industrial relations bottlenecks then we can make the economy more productive. We can make it easier for businesses and easier for employers and therefore easier for the people that work for them.</para>
<para>I encounter many small businesses in my electorate overwhelmed by state government red tape. They have got to have a policy for this and a policy for that. In carrying out basic day-to-day activities, they have to check somehow that they are dotting all the i’s and crossing all the t’s. These people would love to provide the conditions that, say, a government department can—a government department which is bigger and better resourced—but they are not able to do that because they are small and they are struggling under this burden. So when we have addressed the issues of industrial relations and red tape and bottlenecks for small businesses we will then be in a position to indirectly offer the people who work in those areas a much better deal and employers will be able to be more flexible and more generous with their employees.</para>
<para>As a government we are delivering for Australian women because we manage a strong productive economy. We provide significant family support. In her speech in this debate the Minister for Ageing demonstrated how much we provide in family tax benefits. We have provided a record number of child-care places. We understand that the work and family balance is an important agenda item for this fourth term of the Howard government. In conclusion, I urge all women—young, old, single, married, in the work force or out of it—on this International Women’s Day to stand tall, be proud and take your place in the modern intelligent economy which you are a part of. Thank those who made it possible and think of those who have still some way to go.</para>

<para>—I think we would be entitled to say ‘here we are again’ when dealing with medical indemnity issues and the Howard government. It is like a perpetual version of Groundhog Day: we are back at it again, putting another patch through, another piece of medical indemnity legislation—another patch-up job that is required because they did not do the job right the first time around. I suspect that if I am feeling a little bit wearied by all of this there are probably some in the advisers box who have more cause than I to feel so.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The bill which is before the House on this occasion amends legislation first implemented to address the crisis facing the medical indemnity sector in 2002-03. Specifically, the <inline ref="R2290">Medical Indemnity Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline> seeks to correct anomalies arising from that legislation’s interaction with industry practice. Labor have not at any point opposed the Howard government’s patch-up jobs on medical indemnity. Indeed, we have on more than one occasion facilitated rapid passage of bills as necessary to help dig the Minister for Health and Ageing out of the medical indemnity hole he had dug for himself and then jumped into. Whilst we have taken that approach with the medical indemnity legislation, that is not to say that we do not think all of it could have been done better. We have made consistent suggestions to the government about how it ought to be done better and there will be some matters in that regard that I want to go to today.</para>
<para>Perhaps we should all remind ourselves where this started or at least where it first got onto the government’s radar. In truth, anybody with a modicum of intelligence could have seen that medical indemnity issues were going to be big and bad news for Australia, medical professionals and patients, but the Howard government—arrogant as it is, out of touch and often negligent itself when it comes to addressing public policy issues—managed to do nothing until the crisis burbled up in a way that it could not ignore.</para>
<para>That first happened in November 2001 when Australia’s main medical defence organisation, UMP, failed to fund $460 million worth of incurred but not reported claims—referred to in the trade as IBNR claims—‘incurred’ meaning the adverse medical event which caused an injury has happened but that the injury has not been reported. Obviously, in many examples of medical misadventure there will be long lead times before even the patient recognises that there has been an injury or the true loss flowing from the injury can be assessed. Perhaps a good example of that is a baby who is injured due to some form of medical negligence at the time of birth. It will not be possible to assess the full dimensions of the impact on the child or the adult for many years and obviously there are statutory issues about when that infant can sue and has legal capacity. So in any sense of dealing with medical indemnity issues there are also a significant number of incurred but not reported claims, and it was in relation to the funding of such anticipated liabilities that UMP basically said, ‘We can’t cope.’ UMP was at that stage Australia’s biggest medical defence organisation and significantly covered doctors in New South Wales as well as in other parts of the country.</para>
<para>In December 2001 UMP increased its premiums by 52 per cent on average to cope with the crisis. However, for obstetricians and neurosurgeons this increase was as high as 123 per cent. In February 2002 UMP also faced pressure by the prudential regulator, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, to raise additional capital to meet minimum capital requirements and APRA gave UMP until 30 June 2002 to raise over $30 million to meet these requirements. Finally, the crisis was in an unignorable form, even though the Howard government had gone on in their blithe and arrogant way of ignoring the real issues that affect Australia and certainly ignoring public policy issues which were on the horizon. In health they never do anything until there is an absolutely unavoidable crisis either of a political or true health policy dimension. But this crisis threatened to be one of both a political and a health policy dimension as it became clear that doctors might end up uncovered and uninsured and therefore unwilling to practise if UMP failed—or, if UMP struggled on, it would be in circumstances where doctors, particularly people in high-risk specialties, would be picking up enormous additional loads of medical indemnity premiums and would be looking for a way to pass the increased costs on either to government as a funder of medical services or, more particularly, to patients. In circumstances of an uncertain environment, another effect is that people in high-risk specialties pull back from doing the high-risk end of the work and choose to solely practise in the lower risk end of the work. So, for example, many obstetricians indicated that they intended to practise only as gynaecologists and not as obstetricians because of the additional medical negligence issues that arise when one is practising in obstetrics.</para>
<para>So with this crisis finally on the government’s radar, the government reacted by intervening on 28 March 2002 to provide a short-term guarantee of up to $35 million to enable UMP to meet its minimum capital requirements as required by APRA. Then in April 2002 UMP unsuccessfully sought further assistance from the Howard government to enable its directors to get personal liability insurance. On 29 April 2002 UMP filed for provisional liquidation, and a provisional liquidator was appointed on 3 May 2002. The main objectives of the provisional liquidator were to determine the company’s solvency and ability to continue trading, so the crisis was gathering momentum at that point. Finally, the Prime Minister made a commitment to ensure that, in the event of provisional liquidation, doctors who were members of UMP would be covered whilst a solution was developed to the medical indemnity crisis. The Prime Minister was blithely promising at that time that it would be a long-term solution.</para>
<para>Here we stand all these wearying years of the medical indemnity saga later and we certainly cannot report that the Howard government has managed to stumble over a long-term solution to the medical indemnity crisis. On 28 April 2002 the then Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer announced that the Howard government would guarantee claims arising from any procedures from 29 April to 30 June 2002, with those procedures being undertaken by doctors covered by UMP, and that it would legislate this guarantee and assist in determining the long-term viability of UMP. So there we have it: UMP staggering to a provisional liquidation point and the Howard government stepping in and saying, ‘Well, we’ll at least fix that in the short term and we’ll have a think about the longer term.’</para>
<para>Understandably, the AMA and doctors covered by UMP were unsatisfied by the Howard government’s guarantees and there was a climate of great uncertainty. In that climate doctors were necessarily thinking of some drastic steps such as leaving their profession entirely, leaving the high-risk end of their profession or postponing surgery until they knew, with more certainty, what the environment would be. There were then some exchanges of letters between the Howard government and affected doctors. In that environment, the guarantee that was offered by the Howard government was finally approved by the courts in June 2002. This approval included an extension of the guarantee until 31 December 2002.</para>
<para>The government also agreed to assume responsibility for the IBNR claims where the incident giving rise to the claim occurred before 30 June 2003. The Howard government indicated that it would impose a levy on members of UMP so it could recoup the amount that it had guaranteed it would cover because of the crisis that UMP had got itself into. So we have Australia’s major medical defence organisation basically not able to meet its liabilities and certainly not able to meet liabilities which will be incurred in the fullness of time as incurred claims are reported. In those circumstances the Howard government finally manages to say, ‘We’ll pick up the financial obligation for those liabilities’—which was around $460 million—‘and in exchange for that we will levy doctors over the medium term and make something that looks like our money back.’</para>
<para>As many members of this House would recall, because many electorates would have had patients affected by this crisis, when the Howard government moved to impose the levy there was a highly adverse reaction from doctors, and understandably so. There was little warning to individual doctors about what was going to happen next. Doctors around the country, but particularly in New South Wales, were opening up levy notices which imposed on them huge additional liabilities. They were necessarily very concerned about that and many of them were in the circumstance where they were going to down tools, close wards and walk off the job. It was in the face of that crisis that the Howard government had to react again.</para>
<para>Perhaps many of us would remember that, after the current Minister for Health and Ageing was appointed on 29 September 2003, one of the first things on his desk to do was to resolve this re-emerging medical indemnity crisis. A deal was struck with doctors and a high-level panel was created to talk about medical indemnity issues and seek a resolution. So we were in a situation where there was backing and filling and patching, and it was still a question of crisis. In that environment, Minister Abbott was necessarily trying to strike a deal to ensure that doctors did not desert wards full of patients because they were so concerned about their medical indemnity position.</para>
<para>Faced with this crisis, what did the Howard government do? Obviously some changes were made to levy arrangements which found greater favour with doctors—you could not characterise the doctors as having ended up happy in this set of arrangements—than the originally proposed arrangements. Then there was a series of other things added to try and pacify doctors and deal with the medical indemnity crisis. One of the things implemented was the medical indemnity premium subsidy scheme. This was about subsidising the premiums for obstetricians, procedural GPs, neurosurgeons and GP registrars undertaking procedural training. Typical of the Groundhog Day backing and filling and patching that has beset this area, that scheme in its original iteration was changed in 2004 to strike a new formula for the way the premium subsidy scheme would work in relation to doctors’ gross incomes. The government also implemented the High Cost Claims Scheme to further reduce pressure on medical defence organisations. Under this scheme, 50 per cent of insurance payouts over $500,000 are reimbursed to medical indemnity providers.</para>
<para>The government also struck a run-off cover arrangement. That was necessary because a part of the suite of changes that came into effect following the crisis manifesting itself was that the whole medical indemnity set of arrangements moved from offering doctors cover on a claims incurred basis to a claims made basis. So in the past a doctor who was in practice, say, from the age of 30 to 65 could be insured for each of the years that he or she was employed. Presuming that each year they had been working they had purchased claims incurred cover, if there was a claim that was reported when that doctor was in retirement at 68 or 72 or 75—or even if that doctor was deceased and the family was then in charge of the doctor’s estate—the claims incurred cover that the doctor had paid for whilst in work was satisfactory to meet their obligation under that claim. When the medical indemnity industry moved across to claims made cover, as it did in the course of this set of changes, it meant that, if the claim was not made in the period that you were working and paying your premiums and you had not made any further arrangements, you could end up with a claim being incurred at a time that you were uninsured.</para>
<para>For example, a doctor who was involved in an adverse medical event when they were 62 might find that the incident was not reported until they were 72 and out of the work force and no longer insured. As a result of that, there was a need for run-off cover to cover the set of arrangements where doctors had left the work force. There are obviously a variety of circumstances in which doctors can leave the work force. They can leave the work force because they have wholly retired, because they are moving into their older years and no longer want to work. They can move from the work force because of disability. They can move from the work force because of maternity. They can move from the work force because they have died. They can move from the work force because they have given up being a medical practitioner and gone into some other line of work.</para>
<para>The government has obviously found in the original iteration of the run-off cover arrangements that the definitions of when this cover was going to apply and to whom it was going to apply were insufficient, and this bill deals with the clarification of some of those arrangements. This bill also deals with another of the schemes put on to patch the medical indemnity crisis. That scheme was the Exceptional Claims Scheme, previously known as the blue sky scheme. The scheme applies when a doctor sustains a claim above $20 million—that is, a claim above an amount for which the doctor has insurance. That means that the Commonwealth will step in and pay the difference between the $20 million and whatever the claim is.</para>
<para>Whilst that has offered doctors some theoretical reassurance, as far as I am advised there has never been a claim of that order in Australia. I think the highest was a $14 million claim, which may then have been revised downwards on appeal. Obviously an anxiety amongst doctors, having seen a high-value money claim in the order of $14 million, was that they could end up being exposed to liabilities that topped out beyond insurable levels. That is what the Exceptional Claims Scheme was about.</para>
<para>All in all, the bill we have before us is another patch on the run-off cover arrangements; it is another patch on the Exceptional Claims Scheme arrangements. I think it adds to three other bills in medical indemnity that I have dealt with in the time that I have been shadow minister for health, and each of them has been about patching on a patch to try and fix the medical indemnity problem.</para>
<para>As I have had cause to remark in the House before, it did not need to be like this. And why didn’t it need to be like this? It did not need to be like this because a more prudent government would have seen the medical indemnity problems emerging and it would have got in first—not responded to a crisis after it had occurred. If the government had got in first then obviously it could have consulted. It could have better structured and better managed arrangements rather than waiting for a crisis, whacking down a solution, finding that solution was unsatisfactory and whacking down another solution and so on, which is what has happened with medical indemnity.</para>
<para>Did you need to be Nostradamus to see the medical indemnity crisis coming? Did you need to have a crystal ball of considerable power in front of you? No, you most certainly did not. All you needed to do when you were sworn into office in 1996 as a Howard government minister was to read the reports sitting on your desk. If the then minister for health, Dr Michael Wooldridge, had put himself through that process, he would have found sitting on his desk the Tito report—a report by Ms Fiona Tito, who had been asked by the outgoing Labor government to report on medical indemnity issues because the outgoing Labor government realised that medical indemnity was going to be a major issue.</para>
<para>In some senses we do not know whether Dr Michael Wooldridge got round to clearing that section of his desk or whether he did clear that section of his desk and decided to do nothing. Whilst we might not have great insight into everything Dr Michael Wooldridge did in the days after the swearing-in of the Howard government when he was looking at what was on the desk, we do know from his own words that he is very proud of not having done very much in this area of policy. At a conference at the University of Melbourne in 2003, Dr Michael Wooldridge, who had been minister for health for nearly six years after the Tito report would have crossed his desk, said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">As Minister, I was accused of doing far too little on medical indemnity. That’s completely unfair. I did absolutely nothing whatsoever.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So there it is in the former minister’s own words. It is not something that I said; it is not something that anybody presently in this chamber said. There is the former minister’s own summation of his performance in this area when he was minister. He is proudly saying in a humorous formulation of words that he did absolutely nothing whatsoever to deal with the medical indemnity crisis.</para>
<para>What has been the consequence of the Howard government doing ‘absolutely nothing whatsoever’ until the crisis was such that they needed to scramble and act, because doctors were packing in their medical practices or walking off the job because of their medical indemnity exposure? It has certainly been lots of legislative time of this parliament as we have legislated, re-legislated and legislated again to try and get this right. It has been hundreds of millions of dollars, not all of it easily tracked and added up because it has been over a number of financial years. Hundreds of millions of dollars have flowed from the Howard government into the various patch-up schemes and, of course, the original bailout of UMP.</para>
<para>One can only believe—and I am sure this is the case—that, if the Howard government had reacted in a timely way and had devised a policy solution that was going to work before the crisis was a crisis, it could have been addressed for a far cheaper sum. The real underlying work that is needed to be done to resolve medical indemnity issues remains undone, despite all of this—despite legislation. It is a perpetual Groundhog Day, where we talk about medical indemnity despite many growing old and grey puzzling over the issue. Despite hundreds of millions of dollars of Howard government expenditure, some things remain completely unaddresed and unfixed that could make a real difference.</para>
<para>One of those obviously is the question of quality control and the quality of care in our medical system. There is always going to be human error in any system that involves human beings, but most people in the medical area say that with a better focus on quality control we could limit medical misadventure, and that not only avoids human tragedies, death and disability but feeds into medical indemnity issues. The data in this area tends to be old, but it is the best we have. Data from 1999 shows that 16.6 per cent of the 14,000 hospital admissions in New South Wales and South Australia resulted in disability or a longer hospital stay than was necessary. The adverse events were due to ‘a wide range of human and system based failures’ and half of these adverse events were considered preventable. Similar data from the UK and USA shows that adverse events are at 10 per cent and 3.7 per cent respectively as a percentage of total admissions—not 16.6 per cent.</para>
<para>To draw a parallel with the airline industry which is often made: if one applied the UK rate of ‘misprescribing’ of antibiotics for respiratory infection to an equivalent error rate in flying planes, there would be a thousandfold increase in the risk in dying in a plane crash. Our rate is significantly worse than the UK rate. In those circumstances there clearly is major policy work to be done on quality and quality control across our health and medical system. That is not something that the Howard government has bothered itself with. The Howard government has also not bothered itself with structuring a system to deal with people who have long-term care costs from having sustained a catastrophic injury. The issue of caring for those people arises whether or not the cause of their catastrophic injury was medical misadventure or some other problem.</para>
<para>To conclude my remarks in this debate, can I say that the obvious new challenge in medical indemnity—one that the Howard government needs to face up to and one that flows from the patch-up jobs and the perpetual Groundhog Day that we have been through in this policy area—is a competitive neutrality issue of considerable consequence. In November 2004, news stories confirmed that UMP, the company that was going to go under, had reduced premiums. News of this caused outrage amongst other medical indemnity providers, who have not been subject to the same level of assistance from which UMP has benefited since it was bailed out. The circumstance now is that UMP members will enjoy premium reductions of up to 30 per cent a year. The Howard government has tipped out all these buckets of money to try to fix UMP. UMP is now offering its members premium reductions as a result of having been a beneficiary of these buckets of money and the other medical defence organisations are saying, ‘What about us? We did not get the same bucketload of money, so we cannot reduce premiums the way UMP is reducing premiums, and that raises a competitive neutrality issue because it obviously means we are disadvantaged in the marketplace when we go to doctors and say, “Buy your medical defence product from us, not from UMP.”’</para>
<para>Treasury is currently reviewing the competitive neutrality issues in the medical indemnity sector. Some medical indemnity providers have expressed concerns about competitive neutrality issues as a result of the way in which the government has provided assistance. Treasury’s inquiry will examine the competitive advantages in the medical indemnity industry arising from measures undertaken by the Australian government specifically to assist medical indemnity providers since 29 April 2002. This is an important review of an important issue. The review is supposed to be analysing the forms of government assistance and their interactions, assessing the implications for competitive neutrality and assessing what has happened with competitive advantages as a result. That assessment is going to extend to possible advantages such as savings on reinsurance or capital servicing costs. We look forward to that report, which is due on 15 March 2005—not many days from where we are now.</para>

</talker>
<para>—During her speech on the <inline ref="R2290">Medical Indemnity Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline> the member for Lalor used words to the effect that it does not need to be like this—a prudent government would have got in first. Of course, we lacked an expert on what was going to happen, which she might have been in her previous life when she and the firm for which she worked were the cause of the problem. The reality was that, until the plaintiff lawyers got into ambulance-chasing, the prudential management of UMP and other medical indemnity providers was excellent. They had a long history of the sorts of claims with which they had to deal and it was only when the American disease arrived in this country that those indemnity organisations were unable to manage. Yes, this government should have rung her and her partners up at Slater and Gordon, or wherever it was, and said, ‘What are your plans for the future so we can be ready for it when you extract $20 million in a single claim?’ To this date, they have not told us how much the legal profession kept, but I think Premier Carr on one occasion suggested that it could be over 50 per cent.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The reality is that this is a problem of ambulance-chasing. If we want any evidence of that, the tort reforms that have been implemented, the capping of some claims and the limiting of some claims have created a real problem—a crisis, in fact—for property developers. I read in the paper the other day that it is becoming very hard to collect the rent in bar chambers. The barristers have got no work because there has been a collapse in the market by tens of thousands of claims of this nature. We have got to look at the reality of the American disease which is fast approaching this country. As you go to the outpatients clinic on your way out after some medical process, you are confronted by people with clipboards who go through a checklist with you and, if you have missed anything under the contingency requirements, they offer on a no-cost basis to pursue an action for you.</para>
<para>Capping of claims and some of these reforms are not unique to Australia. Certain American states undertook this process some years ago and the percentage cost of delivering health care in those states is less as a consequence—not because of the payouts to the ambulance chasers but because medical practitioners feel they no longer have to protect themselves from this avaricious arrangement by prescribing every conceivable service by way of tests and other things to make sure, if at some future time a problem arises, they cannot be accused of not taking every opportunity of care. And, of course, the pathology clinics have been one of the greatest investments in history since that issue arose. The reality is that we are told by a practitioner in that field that we ought to have been ready for it. She knew we ought to have been ready for it, but there was no reason that the government of the day—and she mentioned Michael Wooldridge—should have had to have been involved.</para>
<para>The other issue that has got to be confronted in these matters is that old, old saying that there is no such thing as a free lunch. What we are talking about here is government having to spread across all taxpayers a cost that was relevant to the claims of a few and beyond the resources of medical practitioners. We remember well and truly the debate on bulk-billing. If ever there was an attack on bulk-billing, it was the massive increase in medical indemnity insurance policies. Of course medical practitioners had to increase their fees and of course the general public pay, as they are paying for what the government has been forced to do, to literally keep medical practitioners in business. It is ridiculous to say that the government got it wrong. The government did have to deal with a crisis—a crisis that was not evident until the ambulance chasers got into the business. In doing so, it has had to make adjustments over time. This legislation is further work in progress as to how we deal with various circumstances as issues arise.</para>
<para>I well remember drawing to the minister’s attention the great consideration that comes with the major aspects of this legislation as it refers to ROCS—the issue of people who have left the industry. This was a significant problem in my electorate where a very high percentage of locums who were servicing and giving some respite to single-person practices were coming from overseas. The AMA in Western Australia were great recruiters. They actually campaigned and offered this opportunity as a sort of a holiday in Western Australia where young practitioners from other parts of the world could give locum services and, in the process, see the country. Many were taking that opportunity but, as things stood originally, arguably in leaving the country they had to pay insurance premiums here in Australia for the next 20 years. That of course was unacceptable and in fact was drying up that particular opportunity.</para>
<para>This legislation has recognised the aspect of certain people—younger women and others—leaving the profession for the reasons that have been mentioned by the member for Lalor. As a consequence, it is better legislation. I am pleased that, by regulation, we have addressed the issue of locums from other countries operating around Australia and particularly in rural areas. There is nothing wrong with these measures. They do not warrant criticism, other than to say it is a great pity that they ever have to be implemented. I have spoken in this place before and attracted some criticism, but I am prepared to say again that I cannot understand how money can fix any sort of problem. The payment of money, as compensation for loss of income by a breadwinner in a family and things of that nature where negligence of whatever sort has prevailed, is of course quite proper, but in so many cases the suing of medical practitioners—particularly where a death was involved and the person concerned was not a breadwinner—in my mind is an unfair burden on the rest of society. None of these things allows for the materialisation of money. Somebody has to pay and, as we speak today on these measures, the Australian taxpayer will pay or will lose some other benefit.</para>
<para>The question is: how should we deal with medical negligence? Why does money absolve it? Why, in circumstances I think we will see less of today, should a medical practitioner stand up and say, ‘Yes, I was negligent, let the insurance company pay’? If they are negligent, why are they still practising? Either they are negligent or they are not. Negligence, particularly if it has happened more than once, should raise a question about their entitlement to practise. I can see the sense in that. But why does a bit of money fix it, and why should the wider community have to pay that money, as they do in every case, either through the fees they pay on a consultation or through the tax system? The only certainty is that if the government had not intervened in the way that it did most medical practitioners would have closed down.</para>
<para>If we think that the issue is lost in this regard, we should realise just how much difficulty this attack on the medical profession by plaintiff lawyers has caused. It is virtually impossible, outside a couple of the larger cities in my electorate, to get a local doctor to deliver a baby. I put forward a very interesting photograph to get more rural child-care assistance. The photograph was of two little kids—I think they were aged three and two—who were spending the entire day with their father in the cabin of a harvester, a header, because their mother was away in Perth to have her third child delivered. It could not be done locally. She could not be at home with the kids and hop in the car in the normal fashion and go into the local hospital to have the child delivered. They could not find medical practitioners who would pay the insurance premiums relative to what was once, if you like, bread and butter for a local practitioner. The first thing these doctors did was to deliver the local babies, many of whom can be delivered without any great risk. But you never know what the risk is now. The turnover of doctors, which again is heavily subsidised by local authorities and the local people, is such that they cannot expect to pay the sorts of premiums associated with one of the fundamentally more simple medical procedures in a high percentage of cases.</para>
<para>So I welcome this legislation. I congratulate the minister and the government on, as I say, work in progress as issues have arisen. I am quite interested in the reference of the member for Lalor to competitive neutrality. Of course that should apply. My briefing papers suggest that these days we are talking about medical indemnity insurers, MIIs, as those who are covered by these measures. In other words, it is not just UMP, although I well understand that there was originally a very substantial grant made to UMP to keep it afloat. I think these measures today deal with all practitioners, where they receive a subsidy when their premium costs exceed 7½ per cent of their revenue and where assistance is given to their insurer when claims exceed $300,000.</para>
<para>As I understand it, these matters today are not specific to UMP, notwithstanding that they were the first we had to save. So, again, the legislation has moved on. I will conclude my remarks at this stage, considering that other members need the opportunity to speak, but I repeat that the criticism from the member for Lalor is a bit like the pot calling the kettle black. She could have advised us soundly when she was still in the profession and did not bother to do so.</para>

<para>—The medical indemnity insurance crisis has been emerging since the mid-1990s. The <inline ref="R2290">Medical Indemnity Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline> before us today is yet another attempt to patch up a crisis that could well have been avoided. It is a crisis in which doctors have threatened to walk out of hospitals, and in some cases they have done exactly that. It is a crisis in which many doctors have seriously considered abandoning their professions. At a time in Australia’s history when highly skilled, professional doctors are so scarce, it would be a national tragedy if those doctors carried out those threats. But they were confronted with some chilling realities. One reality was that doctors who had spent so many years not only training for a basic medical degree at university but also training further to achieve the high levels of specialisation and skills that they possessed could be confronted with awful circumstances and therefore have to leave. It would have been a tragedy for our country if that had happened. Yet it was a very serious risk. It was not an idle threat. They were confronted with soaring medical indemnity insurance premiums and unconscionable risks to their own incomes not only as practising medical professionals but also in circumstances where they may have retired and a successful claim was lodged against them several years after their retirement for a procedure that they performed during their working life.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The government, confronted with this crisis, has lurched from one stop-gap measure to another. This is in fact the fourth piece of legislation in which the government has sought another stop-gap measure to try to deal with a crisis that it could have avoided. One attempt by this government was to cover through legislation the circumstances where a doctor had subsequently left the work force, the circumstances that I have just described. This is called run-off cover. The definitions of run-off cover in previous bills have proved to be deficient. This bill attempts to rectify those deficiencies. We hope that this is the last time that legislation will be needed to do that. We will be supporting this legislation in the hope that it will prove to be effective.</para>
<para>I said that this legislation could have been avoided. Indeed, the entire medical indemnity insurance crisis was entirely avoidable. A responsible government would have seen this crisis coming. It did not need any powers of clairvoyance. It did not need to read the tea-leaves. All it needed to do was to read a report. It simply needed to read a report that was on the desk of the incoming health minister, Dr Michael Wooldridge, in March 1996. That report was prepared by Fiona Tito in response to concerns of the outgoing Labor government that this crisis was beginning to emerge. Yet again, we have a story of a Labor government understanding the development of a problem and seeking to act on it before it became a crisis. The government changed and the incoming minister ignored that report. To this day, we do not know fully the circumstances of his ignoring the report. We do not know whether he read the report and dismissed it or, alternatively, whether he failed to read it altogether. But we do know that the minister was entirely unrepentant. Indeed, he boasted of his failure to act on the medical indemnity insurance crisis, telling a conference at the University of Melbourne in 2003:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... I was accused of doing far too little on medical indemnity. That’s completely unfair. I did absolutely nothing whatsoever.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">What a scandal that a health minister could be so proud of his wilful negligence, and what an irony when medical indemnity insurance issues can surround allegations of negligence. I certainly make the allegation of negligence against the then health minister, Dr Michael Wooldridge. At that conference at Melbourne University he pleaded guilty to negligence and boasted about it.</para>
<para>The consequences of the negligence of the Howard government in relation to the Tito report have been quite horrendous. This is the fourth piece of legislation, and the cost associated with those four pieces of legislation has run into hundreds of millions of dollars. Much of that government spending was entirely avoidable. It has also had horrendous human consequences and consequences for the viability of our health professionals and our highly skilled doctors. As in all aspects of health policy, prevention is far better and far cheaper than a cure. This government should have applied that philosophy in handling a crisis that it knew was emerging. It could have prevented that crisis; instead it has sought to cure the crisis through a series of bandaid measures.</para>
<para>There are issues of quality control in our public hospitals. Evidence has been presented that almost 17 per cent of procedures and admissions have gone wrong in some way or another at some state hospitals. Now there is a new challenge in relation to medical indemnity insurance, and it is the one to which the member for Lalor referred. It appears that UMP—the business that was about to go under—has in fact reduced its premiums after receiving huge financial support from the Howard government. That has put other insurers—competitors to UMP—in an invidious position. UMP stands to gain market share assisted by massive subsidies from the Commonwealth of Australia at the expense of insurance companies that adopted more prudent practices and were not the beneficiaries of such largesse from the government.</para>
<para>So much for the government’s commitment to competitive neutrality and national competition policy reforms. Fred Hilmer would be appalled at the government’s management of this issue. A report by Treasury has been scheduled for release, we understand, on 15 March—in just a couple of weeks time. The member for O’Connor said in his contribution to this debate just a moment ago that this legislation is further work in progress. That is a very ominous statement for the member for O’Connor to make. We will be interested to see what the Commonwealth does, in response to this report, about the very clear evidence that the principle of competitive neutrality has been violated by the government’s handling of the medical indemnity insurance crisis and by the financial support that it has provided to UMP. This is yet another example of the mismanagement of the Australian health system by the Howard government.</para>
<para>Many will recall that the previous coalition government that ruled from 1975 to 1983—a seven-year period—had seven different health policies in those seven years. The one commitment that the government had was to the dismantling of Medibank, the Labor creation of the previous period.</para>

<para>—It was Medibank, not Medicare. The government did indeed dismember Medibank, but it did not know what to put in its place so it made seven different decisions in seven years. It took the incoming Hawke government to address the situation where two million Australians were without insurance cover. Some of those Australians who then did get admitted to hospital had their hospital expenses covered by a benevolent hospital. But it is completely unacceptable in a modern society for two million Australians to be living without the knowledge that they have insurance cover against some bad health experience. Medicare, introduced by the Hawke government, ensured universal health insurance. Those two million Australians could breathe and live a bit more easily upon the election of the Hawke government.</para>

<para>—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am talking about health insurance cover. I certainly would have expected the member for Bowman to understand that health insurance cover to Australians is entirely relevant to this debate because we are in fact discussing medical indemnity insurance, and I am speaking about the issue of health insurance cover more generally. I pointed out that in the period since this government has been elected the Prime Minister has not been committed to a national health insurance scheme. He in fact referred publicly, just some time ago, to the system that was in place before the introduction of Medibank, before 1972. The Prime Minister declared that he believed that to be a very good system, a system which did not provide health insurance cover for all Australians.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>So where to from here in respect of insurance and the provision of affordable quality health care to Australians? The health minister before the last election attacked Labor on the basis of assertions that Labor supported the pooled funding system for health care in Australia. He described it as a $60 billion behemoth. Yet, straight after the election, the health minister said that it would be a good idea if the states gave their hospital systems to the Commonwealth so that there would be a pool of Commonwealth funds covering both hospitals and aged care. The irony here is that this was the fundamental philosophy behind Medicare Gold—an arrangement where there would not be cost-shifting between the Commonwealth and the states in respect of health and aged care. At present, hospitals are a joint responsibility and aged care is a federal responsibility. There is an ongoing problem of cost-shifting as one level of government seeks to push patients into the care of another level of government.</para>
<para>The truth of the matter is that the health minister himself is advocating a pooled funding arrangement. Yet the Prime Minister has said: ‘No, it is not going to happen. There will be no transfer of hospitals to the Commonwealth.’ I understand why the Prime Minister would do that. Every day we see in the media reports of hospital waiting lists and the occasional horror story in hospitals. Probably the Prime Minister thinks it would not be a very clever idea for the Commonwealth to be taking responsibility for those adverse news stories. There is certainly a conflict over this between the Prime Minister and the health minister. I do note that the New South Wales Premier, Bob Carr, thought it was a pretty good idea to give the running of hospitals to the Commonwealth.</para>
<para>This has to be the most centralist government that the Australian people have experienced. The health minister says he wants to take over hospital cover, and we know what is happening with industrial relations and other areas. If it did happen, the Commonwealth could pool funds for hospitals and aged care. But in my view, if there were to be any sort of pooled funding model, there would need to be provision for copayments—that is, not copayments by those who lack the capacity to pay but by those who have the financial capacity to pay.</para>
<para>I refer to a model that is in practice in the United States, one of the more free enterprise nations on this earth. It is called Kaiser Permanente. In that model, which is an operating model, there is a pooling of funds to cover an integrated health care system that includes health promotion programs, prevention, early diagnosis, primary care, hospital care and aged care. The virtue of Kaiser Permanente is that there is always an incentive to seek the most cost-effective solution. We know that prevention is more cost-effective than cure. Indeed, the diseases that kill most Australians are largely preventable. In the land of free enterprise a pooled funding arrangement applies. Across the Tasman pooled funding arrangements apply; the New Zealand government has introduced a pooled funding system. That now covers more than 50 per cent of New Zealand citizens. Significantly, that New Zealand system does involve copayments.</para>
<para>An opportunity exists for the federal government—now that it has been re-elected and does not necessarily have to attack Labor with assertions that it was supportive of the pooled funding arrangement—to overhaul federal-state relations in relation to Australia’s health system. I call on the government to take on the reform mantle that is needed there. Although our health system is one of the very best in the world, we are confronted with the challenges of the ageing of the population. In 40 years time, if current projections turn out to be broadly correct, there will be four million more Australians over the age of 65. Four million more Australians over the age of 65 means a lot more health care and a lot more age care. It is at this moment that we should be looking at reforms of our health system to ensure they are sustainable; otherwise, through avoidable problems, health expenditure, including medical indemnity insurance, will become a big challenge and an enormous drain on our resources—absorbing resources that could be used instead to ensure that every young person in Australia has the same life chances, irrespective of whether they come from disadvantaged or wealthy backgrounds.</para>
<para>I will conclude by saying that we will support this legislation. The statements made by those on the government side that it is a work in progress are ominous. We have had four pieces of legislation already. We await the report from Treasury on competitive neutrality and we hope and pray that the next piece of legislation that comes into this parliament on medical indemnity insurance will be the last.</para>

<para>—I rise today to support the <inline ref="R2290">Medical Indemnity Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline>, which makes modifications to a series of medical indemnity arrangements in this country. I am compelled to comment on the contributions from the members opposite, hopefully before the member for Rankin leaves. What has been demonstrated from both contributions is a staggering vacuum in fine details and proposals for what the opposition in government would have done with the medical indemnity crisis. What we have so far from two contributions is effectively drawing the Labor wagons into a circle, holding the Tito report above their heads with everyone else pointing at it and saying, ‘That’s what we would have done to fix the problem.’</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We know they had a penchant for asking for inquiries and reports, but it is an incredibly simplistic approach. We know that an enormous amount of those dues that accumulated under UMP did so between 1983 and 1996. I also suspect that a great proportion of the profession would be thankful it was our government on the watch at the time that a solution had to be found.</para>
<para>Today’s bill demonstrates responsiveness and communication with the profession in an incredibly difficult piece of indemnity legislation. Many of the health workers could really only imagine at the time this was happening that a solution could be found in the short term. UMP was representing 60 per cent of doctors. We were in crisis at that time. I remember the early nineties when we were already aware of that situation evolving but there was no solution to be found.</para>
<para>In response to this crisis the government has rolled out a series of measures to alleviate the upward pressure on insurance premiums and the unsustainable operating environment that insurers had to work within. I did not want to cast the first political stone in this debate, but for the shadow health spokesperson to comment that we were legislating, re-legislating and legislating again—‘patching up and bailing out’—and then to propose that the alternative was to simply focus more on quality in health care is, I think, overly simplistic. Every developed economy is focusing on quality in health care. We have a National Institute of Clinical Studies that does just that. An enormous amount of resources are committed by the federal government, and we are in step with what is happening in the US and the UK.</para>
<para>The comment that a possible alternative for the federal government was structuring the long-term care arrangements for those who are catastrophically injured again misunderstands that this crisis was inherently driven by a combined state and federal issue. We had the capping and the controlling of tort law reform being predominantly a state issue, yet with the federal government effectively wearing the problem. So, in this federalist environment, a solution was never going to be easy. It really did have to reach a point in the crisis where all players were motivated to act. I do not take this opportunity to criticise state governments. I think they made a reasonable effort across the board, in their own ways and in their own time, to find a solution to tort law reform.</para>
<para>Today I will touch briefly on the four areas where minor improvements have been made. We have already alluded to the run-off cover indemnity scheme. Let me give a background on that scheme. Traditionally, doctors were using a claims based approach and not an incurred based approach. We know that in insurance, once medical indemnity came under the Insurance Act 1973, they were expected to move to a claims incurred arrangement, which meant that the insurance had to cover not just events that occurred in the period with which one was insured but for long after. In medical indemnity, it is enormously difficult to predict how you have to set your premiums for events many years, if not decades, into the future. The agreement was to fall back to a claims based approach, to allow doctors to insure in that way; and for the government to step in—in this case the Commonwealth—with a run-off cover indemnity arrangement, where the government assisted and bore some of the responsibility for that long-term cover.</para>
<para>A doctor now with a claims based policy can leave practice and retire safe, knowing that that arrangement is in place. A doctor who is pregnant can leave with maternity leave and take care of her child and, as long as she is not practising, know that that cover is available. Finally, someone who is permanently disabled or suffers a major injury that prevents them from practising can also have that security. The Commonwealth also reimburses the medical indemnity providers for the costs of managing that run-off scheme. But keep in mind that the cost of that scheme is around 8.5 per cent—or, in UMP’s case, 9.5 per cent—of the cost of the total amount of the premium. It is a large amount. So what is changing? The eligible run-off claim for doctors who have some but not total cover means that they are now protected. If a doctor has coverage for obstetrics but carries out a gynaecological procedure, and down the track finds that they are not covered for that procedure, the run-off cover will protect them, so long as they had some level of insurance and were practising in a prudent manner.</para>
<para>In schedule 1, items 17 and 18 prevent double counting of that support payment. That is important so that this run-off scheme payment is not included in the premium outcome upon which that payment is calculated. That provides enormous reassurance to those who are leaving the profession, and particularly those who are retiring.</para>
<para>The High Cost Claims Scheme addresses an issue that has been of enormous concern to the medical profession. The solution found by the Commonwealth was that, for all claims over $300,000, the Commonwealth would assist with 50 per cent of the cost. That reduces the cost of insurers finding reinsurance. That exerts a downward pressure on insurance coverage because many of the insurers were having difficulty matching their level of reinsurance—the degree to which they go around and obtain secondary cover—with setting the level of their premium. This scheme will help enormously. It now gives insurers a 12-month waiting period after it is entered on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments to apply any decrease in that percentage payable for an eligible high-cost claim. It effectively makes it easier for medical insurers. All of these amendments, small as they are, are bringing more closely into alignment the work of medical insurers with community practice.</para>
<para>Another change is to the Exceptional Claims Scheme. As I have already said, once medical indemnity fell under the Insurance Act 1973, medical indemnity cover provided to doctors contained a cap of $20 million or $25 million on the amount of damages that may be paid under the policy. Obviously some doctors realised they would be financially exposed if an award were to be made to a patient in excess of that amount. That put them in a difficult position of potentially being personally liable for certain amounts in a claim made against them. The Commonwealth has again stepped in and assumed liability for 100 per cent of those damages that exceed the doctors’ insurance cap.</para>
<para>How could an alternative approach from the opposition have made any difference to these issues? I really think it is enormously simplistic, if not a little vacuous, to say, ‘We called on Fiona Tito to write a report in the final, dying days of government,’ because there was no evidence that any progress was being made while the opposition were in power. It is overly simplistic today not to present a few alternative solutions, if the opposition are in fact so uncomfortable with some of the items and the legislation that has been developed throughout 2002, 2003 and 2004.</para>
<para>Technical changes have also been made to the Medical Indemnity Premium Subsidy Scheme—a scheme which I too hope to be eligible for in my clinical career. Where a doctor’s gross medical indemnity costs become so high that they exceed about 7.5 per cent of gross earnings, the Commonwealth again has a scheme so that, in particular, a procedural specialist only pays 20 cents in every dollar of the insurance over and above the 7.5 per cent. That has been enthusiastically welcomed by the profession. Of course, these premium subsidies are paid directly to medical indemnity providers and doctors receive premium subsidies automatically through reduced premiums from the insurer.</para>
<para>It should also be noted that the bill today modifies the functioning of this scheme slightly so that it is broadened to all medical indemnity providers and not just the well-known medical defence organisations. That is relevant for doctors who are often working in the public system. They too can be covered by this scheme.</para>
<para>Premium subsidies also apply to procedural general practitioners. Many of those GPs in rural areas were being forced out of procedural work—general practitioners were putting down the scalpel because the insurance premiums became completely unaffordable. Once again, the solution here was to say, ‘Let’s look at a similar GP doing non-procedural work in the same location who has the same insurer and we will insure 75 per cent of the difference between the procedural and the non-procedural GPs’ insurance premiums.’ Again, 10 years ago, when I was a remote and rural general practitioner, a solution like that was unheard of. This has been a significant contribution both from the Department of Health and Ageing and from the doctors with whom they have liaised and consulted.</para>
<para>Small changes have also been made to the incurred but not reported protocol, which is how one handles claims that are likely to be brought before an insurer but have not yet eventuated into a claim—they have merely been reported by the doctor. There will be changes to that so that insurers will be covered for claims of incidents that are notified to them and the costs that are borne by the insurer, even if they do not progress to a formal claim from an injured patient.</para>
<para>There was a comment today from a leading medical practitioner in Queensland who said that we had a lot to be grateful for in this legislation and that by and large the issue of medical indemnity had been sorted out. A comment like that from the medical profession was almost inconceivable four years ago. I know from what has happened in Redlands Hospital that the issue of medical indemnity has all but disappeared from the common rooms and coffee rooms of hospitals. Morale is higher in Redlands, in particular, which is a fine hospital. Redlands is waiting for an emergency department upgrade promised by the state government, which is coming soon. What are not appearing are the nine renal chairs that allow dialysis to be done in our area. That puts an enormous burden on the nearby Princess Alexandra Hospital and obviously upon a lot of annoyed renal patients.</para>
<para>The topic of indemnity has almost disappeared from hospitals and from practices around the country. It was once said—I am not quite sure by whom—that, like God’s infinite mercy, professionals should never really rely on government when it comes to sorting out indemnity issues, except as a last resort. That is exactly what happened in 2002. I was flying across the Gulf of Carpentaria when it happened, I recall. At that time there were no clearly understood solutions to the problem. It almost had to reach this stage in negotiation before all of the groups involved, including the state governments, could be brought to the table to have a summit. That is exactly what this government organised. I am thankful that that happened. It happened under the watch of a government that was able, willing and keen to strike a solution for the benefit of the profession. Announcements were made in December 2003, and all of those measures have now been implemented today. Consultation with doctors, of course, remains ongoing. It will have to—there will be further finessing. Again, it is overly simplistic to say that this has been a botched job, a patch job or a bailing out, because there was really no other way, and I am yet to hear from the opposition that there was any other way of handling this issue.</para>
<para>I am glad that the elements of the bill today will be working as they were intended. The small changes, many of them technical, some of them quite detailed, do just that. I congratulate not just the current Minister for Health and Ageing but also his predecessor, Minister Kay Patterson—and also Minister Helen Coonan for her work as Assistant Treasurer—on the work they have done in helping medical indemnity insurers, because they know, as we do, that by helping them we help doctors, which, in turn, helps patients.</para>

<para>—Again, it is a pleasure to rise in the House to add my comments to the debate on the <inline ref="R2290">Medical Indemnity Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline>. This has been a long-running and sometimes terribly volatile issue in my electorate. Some 18 months before UMP collapsed, I had visits from my obstetrician, Dr John Curry, who came to tell me that there had been calls on the profession. He felt that there was going to be a disaster with UMP and needed to raise my awareness of this issue, which he did. We travelled to Canberra on numerous occasions and addressed backbenchers and committee meetings and pulled together meetings of backbenchers. Specifically, Dr Curry highlighted the issues he felt were going to happen, certainly with UMP. He felt that there was no money in the system and that the call was significant on the profession. He said that, unless somebody stepped in and did some work on tort law reform in the states, particularly in obstetrics areas, looked at the 21-year statute of limitations and at the way in which certain cases were playing out whereby compensation was being paid in the extreme, this was going to be a major issue that we would face as a nation. We did a lot of work on this matter. Many of my specialists came on board and explained that they thought there was a problem.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Then we had a problem because there was no indemnity cover in the state hospital system, so all my specialists in the Riverina decided not to offer their operating services. I was involved at the time in the process of trying to resolve the issue with New South Wales Minister Craig Knowles. Finally, commonsense prevailed and the state government, to their great credit—and it is not often that I give credit to the state government—decided to pick up the indemnity in the public hospital systems for medical practitioners. It was very much appreciated by me and all of my medical specialists, GPs and others, because it certainly resolved the issue of getting cover in the public system. It stopped a mass exodus from the public system to the private system whereby we would have had an enormous gap in services that could and should be provided by the state hospital system. The issue was resolved at the eleventh hour on Christmas Eve. It was pretty significant and pretty hair-raising to think that, after the new year, no specialist services, operating services and visiting medical officer—VMO—services would be available in the state hospital system in my electorate.</para>
<para>We then moved to the UMP crisis—and what a crisis it was! It saw, very quickly, the mass exodus of specialists who had decided to retire, or who were thinking of retiring, in three to five years. They were insecure about what was going to happen in the future and not quite sure what was going to happen in their family lives and with the assets they had built up over a long period. We put in a lot of work and a lot of effort. Various crafts assisted me in trying to resolve this issue. One of my good general surgeons, Henry Hicks, was absolutely sensational. He, along with Dr Gerard Carroll, a heart physician in Wagga Wagga, and Dr John Curry, an obstetrician, assisted me in resolving this issue, particularly in my electorate. It seemed as though this matter was just going to escalate—and it did.</para>
<para>Obstetricians have one private outlet in the Riverina—that is, Calvary Hospital—and they decided to remove their services from that hospital. We have about 600 or 700 deliveries per annum in the private hospital and about 700 to 800 in the Wagga Wagga Base Hospital. It was obvious that the base hospital was not set up to take all the deliveries from right across the Riverina into their sector, and we had a crisis. Two thousand members of the community—mums and dads with prams and babies—marched up the streets of Wagga Wagga to demonstrate that they needed this facility at Calvary Maternity Hospital and that we in the government desperately needed to resolve the issue. There was a significant amount of discussion and negotiation, as a former speaker has said, by ministers and the Assistant Treasurer at the time, and we ended up resolving the problem in the short term.</para>
<para>We then introduced a levy system and, of course, some anomalies started to develop in that system. We saw new entrants coming in. One of the surgeons in my electorate, Dr David Littlejohn, was a new entrant in the system, and it seemed that he was going to have to pick up the tail and pay for the mistakes of people before him. That, of course, needed resolving. This issue has been a moving feast for ministers, because every day there was a new and extremely significant issue that they had to deal with and try to resolve. The Australian public were beside themselves because they thought there was every chance that they were going to lose their services. It certainly did have a major impact, particularly on obstetrics. We saw many of the obstetricians in my electorate move out of obstetrics entirely and into the field of gynaecology to reduce their premiums. This left a great shortfall in obstetrics services, not just in my electorate but right across Australia.</para>
<para>In what I think is its absolutely best performance to date, in an effort to underpin services right across Australia, the government has had to deal with a moving feast of variable issues that were surrounding things that governments had not previously been involved in. It did not just involve obstetricians, orthopaedics or surgeons; it also involved anaesthetists. A host of different specialists had been impacted upon by the very difficult circumstances with United Medical Protection. So I congratulate the government on all the processes it undertook to ensure that everybody’s interests were served—not just those of specialists, GPs, obstetricians and surgeons, but also those of all Australians.</para>
<para>Some positives have grown out of this. There are some positive advantages in what has happened. After we had the march in 2000 up the streets of Wagga Wagga, we developed a new program called the rural obstetrics training network. I sat down and thought that if the UMP issue was going to cause such a crisis in my region, what were we going to do to stop people from being discouraged from entering obstetrics because of the 21-year statute of limitations? I decided to work with a group of specialists to determine how we could deliver obstetric services into the future in rural and regional areas. From that came the birth of the rural obstetrics training network and we now have a very good pilot project operating out of Wagga Wagga which is looking at how we deliver obstetric services for rural and regional people into the future. It utilises midwives and a whole host of different mechanisms that need to come into play in before and after care in obstetrics services.</para>
<para>I am very proud of this. Dr Ian Stewart is a practising obstetrician and gynaecologist. He has now reduced his hours to part-time gynaecology in order to take on the directorship of the rural obstetrics training network. In my opinion, nobody has more experience in the needs of rural obstetrics than Dr Ian Stewart, and he has been prepared to forgo his own monetary benefit to ensure that he can put together a valuable project that can be applied anywhere in Australia. The project will ensure that we are best utilising the service of midwives and it will encompass regional universities such as Charles Sturt University, which has a magnificent nursing and midwifery course. It will put a process together to provide a different form of delivery of service for those people who are removed from many of the major areas of delivery. At one stage, we thought we would have to airlift mums to Sydney or to a metropolitan hospital just to have simple, straightforward procedural deliveries, which would certainly not have been a good use of taxpayers’ money.</para>
<para>As I said, this is a long-running issue that I have been absolutely involved with, well and truly before the problems with UMP, simply because of the understanding that the specialists that work in my area had to be involved as part of the solution and not just as part of the problem. I am very fortunate to have each and every one of the specialists in my area. We have recruited specialist services due to all of these guys putting in together and utilising their own money, their own time and their own travel to get other specialist services into the Riverina. The average age of specialists in the Riverina now is between 40 and 45, which is absolutely sensational. We have one of the best medical work forces in specialty services. We are certainly lacking in some areas but the Riverina is starting to be well supplied with specialist services. The government has assisted the Riverina in many, many ways to ensure that specialists remain committed and have the incentive to move forward and to be able to continue to offer these services into the future.</para>
<para>In other positive news in my region, according to a recent newspaper article Cootamundra is also benefiting from an increase in professionals who are providing obstetric and maternity care. This is fantastic because, while most regions are seeing a reduction in these services, I am starting see a significant increase, mainly due to the commitment of the existing specialists there. The article in the Cootamundra <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> on 2 March 2005 states that two new midwives, and a new general practitioner with an interest in obstetrics, have moved into the town of Cootamundra. The report says: ‘We have been short of midwives for a long time and Cootamundra is very lucky. Not only do we have the two new midwives but we have a new doctor in Dr Scholz.’ Scholz is a significant name because Granny Scholz delivered Sir Donald Bradman in Cootamundra and now Dr Scholz is there providing obstetric services.</para>
<para>Now that I have finished making conversation in the House, I am pleased to congratulate the government on the very fine effort that they have put in and in particular I congratulate the Minister for Health and Ageing on the services that he has secured for rural and regional Australia.</para>

<para>—I am very pleased to sum up the second reading debate on the <inline ref="R2290">Medical Indemnity Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline> and I would like to thank all members who have taken part. I would particularly like to thank the member for Riverina for a very interesting tour de horizon of the medical services available in her electorate. I am not entirely unfamiliar with them, having visited a couple of times and also having pedalled through a large slab of her electorate in company with, amongst others, the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads. It is good to see the medical services of the Riverina appropriately eulogised in this place by a very hardworking local member.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Eighteen months ago there was a genuine crisis in our health system. A large number of visiting medical officers were resigning their public hospital positions because they believed that medical indemnity premium increases were the last straw. They believed that they were being hit with unconscionable burdens as a result of changes to the tort culture, particularly in New South Wales but also in Queensland and in other states. As a result the government established the Medical Indemnity Policy Review Panel comprising a series of distinguished leaders of the medical profession, along with John Phillips, former Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank; Nancy Milne, the insurance partner at Clayton Utz; and the then Minister for Revenue, Senator Coonan and me as co-chairs. But the key people on this review panel were Dr Bill Glasson, the President of the AMA; Dr Andrew Pesce, the insurance expert on the AMA; Dr Sue Page, President of the Rural Doctors Association of Australia, and Professor Don Sheldon, Chairman of the Council of Procedural Specialists. That committee spent a very intensive six to eight weeks looking at the problem and coming up with a series of recommendations which were ultimately accepted, almost in total, by the government just before Christmas in 2003—and which, I am pleased to say, have brought stability to this sector since.</para>
<para>I do not say that it is a perfect system and I do not say that it will not be in need of further work in the future, but certainly the crisis has passed. The medical specialists rescinded their resignations, our hospitals began to work normally again and the Damoclean sword hanging over them was withdrawn. This was very good news for the people of Australia but it was particularly good news for the standing and public respect of the medical profession. Every one of us in this place owes a great deal to the medical profession. None of us enjoys perfect health all the time, and invariably when ill health strikes it is the medical profession which takes the lead role in restoring us to health.</para>
<para>While many doctors earn large incomes, the vast majority of them carry very heavy responsibilities, work very long hours and earn comparatively modest rewards for the training, dedication and time that they bring to their jobs. It is right that we as a society do not impose unduly heavy burdens on them. Thanks to the Medical Indemnity Subsidy Scheme, finalised by the government as a result of the work of the review panel, doctors who face very high premium costs will have 80 per cent of those premium costs—above 7½ per cent of gross private medical income—met by the government. That is the essence of the scheme put in place by this government to meet the crisis, but there are other important elements: the ‘blue sky scheme’ to cover doctors who face claims in excess of $20 million; the High Cost Claims Scheme to cover doctors who faced claims in excess of $300,000; and the very important retirement Run-off Cover Scheme to cover doctors who had retired from practice but who still faced the possibility of claims as a result of the long tails on these sorts of actions.</para>
<para>As I said, it has not been an absolutely perfect set of arrangements. Obviously it has cost the taxpayers of Australia heavily. The package put in place after the review panel did its work cost an additional $200 million over the forward estimates period on top of about $350 million that had previously been invested by the government in medical indemnity insurance premium support. But the package has worked well and this legislation is designed to clear up technical difficulties which have arisen in the operation of the scheme. In particular, we have tried to ensure that the legislation precisely matches the intent of the government back in December 2003 and that it precisely matches the practical operation of insurance schemes of this type.</para>
<para>The legislation is highly complex and technical but it has been drawn up in the closest possible consultation with the insurance sector and expert members of the medical profession. I know that the legislation has the support of the medical profession and the medical indemnity insurance sector. I know that it is in the best interests of patients that we should pass this bill and I particularly thank the opposition for being as constructive as they have been on this whole issue.</para>
<para>Before closing, I should also thank the public servants of my department, who have toiled mightily over this issue for the last two or three years. We tend to take the Public Service for granted—and certainly the general public often talk dismissively of Canberra as if it were a paradise of overpaid and underworked public servants and people such as ourselves—but the fact is that the Public Service of Australia always get the job done. Sometimes, as our experience grows, what they do needs to be finetuned and further improved, but they always get the job done. In my experience as Minister for Health and Ageing there has been no finer illustration of the Public Service at its best than the work that the Department of Health and Ageing did to resolve this very acute, very pressing and very serious problem. So I thank and congratulate them on behalf of the government and the people of Australia. I particularly single out Charles Maskell-Knight, who is in the advisers’ box this evening and led the team which did such a good job. Thank you very much indeed.</para>

</talker>
<para>—The opposition will support the <inline ref="R2284">Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2005</inline> through this parliament. The bill seeks to reinforce the structural adjustment focus of the Farm Help program by tightening the definition of ‘full-time’ farmer and by providing the ongoing monitoring of those who have accessed the re-establishment grant, to ensure that they do not go back into farming.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In June 2004, some eight months ago, I debated legislation to extend the Farm Help program to 30 June 2008. The opposition has been broadly supportive of the thrust of this element of the Agriculture Advancing Australia package. This program forms part of the government’s Agriculture Advancing Australia package and is aimed at supporting the ongoing process of structural adjustment in the rural sector. However, if the number of farms accessing this program is supposed to be an indication of the success or otherwise of the program, then the statistics would seem to indicate that it has been a failure. Farm organisations regard this program as largely having failed to meet its objectives, and, on the government’s own stated objectives, it has failed badly. On that basis, I move:</para>
<motion>
<para>That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</para>
<para>“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for the failure of Farm Help and other programs to deliver appropriate structural adjustment assistance where it is needed in the farm sector”.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">Farm Help has been operating since December 1997 to facilitate adjustment by providing assistance to people on farms in severe financial difficulty. Program components include up to 12 months of income support at the newstart allowance rate, up to $5,500 in professional advice and training, the development of an activity plan customised to each farm family situation and a re-establishment grant of up to $50,000 for those who decide to exit farming. The Farm Help program was renewed in the 2004-05 budget for a further four years and will conclude on 30 June 2007.</para>
<para>The farm exit provisions of this program have been the centrepiece of the government’s structural adjustment efforts in the farm sector. But in most years the program has been significantly underspent. While the amendments proposed represent an improvement on the current situation, particularly in terms of accountability for assistance received, they will do little to encourage an increasing number of marginal farmers to exit farming.</para>
<para>The main elements of this bill are that it will amend the definition of a farmer as ‘a person who has a right or an interest in land used for the purposes of a farm enterprise’ and that it will define a ‘full-time’ farmer, for the purposes of the Farm Help provisions of the bill, as a person who, for a continuous period of at least two years immediately before they apply for entry to the Farm Help program, is a farmer, has derived more than 50 per cent of his or her gross income from the farm enterprise, has contributed more than 50 per cent of his or her capital to the farm enterprise and has spent more than 50 per cent of his or her working hours on the farm enterprise.</para>
<para>The bill will also provide a greater degree of flexibility in administration. For example, a person may be unable to satisfy the income test because, during the two-year period, the enterprise has experienced flood, drought, bushfire or some other natural disaster; an unforeseen extreme variation in seasonal norms; a market collapse; or serious illness or disability. Accordingly, a person is considered to be a full-time farmer if they can demonstrate that they meet these circumstances and other qualification criteria. Of course, there is another provision of the bill to enable ongoing communication with Farm Help re-establishment grant recipients. This provision basically allows for the tracking by Centrelink of people who have received assistance under these provisions.</para>
<para>One has to ask why these matters have not been adequately addressed by the government before this time. It is quite extraordinary that here we are some seven years after the introduction of the scheme, and the government is still grappling with the definition of a farmer and a full-time farmer. I think it demonstrates the sort of tardiness in the preparation of legislation and the administration of schemes that is typical of a government in terminal decay, as is this one.</para>
<para>The government introduced the scheme in December 1997. One has to ask where the minister has been since that time in tightening up the provisions of this particular legislation. At least, I suppose, some seven years down the line we are finally getting some certainty into these definitions. Of course, in doing so, the minister simply demonstrates once again his incompetence in this portfolio.</para>
<para>The process of structural adjustment in farming has produced mammoth changes in our agricultural sector. Of course, this is what this particular legislation is designed to address. I have, on more than one occasion in this place, referred to the impact that it has had on my own farming family, who farmed a small, mixed dairy farm in the western district of Victoria some four decades ago. That process has produced quite profound social changes in rural communities, often with great pain to families who were farming and who, in a historical sense, have farmed as a lifestyle choice as well as a means of earning a living and supporting a family.</para>
<para>The process of structural adjustment has been propelled by a range of factors. In Australian agriculture in recent decades, we have witnessed quite consistent growth in the annual productivity of the sector of between one and two per cent. This has been driven by massive investments in technology on the farm, land productivity improvements, huge strides in plant and animal genetics, the decisions of government to remove the regulatory framework under which industries have operated for long periods of time, an expansion of market opportunities, the upskilling of farmers, the introduction of new management and information systems, some improvements in essential infrastructure and, of course, significant gains from a concerted research and development effort in the sector. Together these have driven the creation of new opportunities and new efficiencies in Australian agriculture. They have also, however, contributed to the massive structural adjustment in the sector that has occurred in recent decades.</para>
<para>Other influences have contributed to the process as well. Climatic changes, such as the recent drought, have put enormous pressure on the financial viability of many farm enterprises in affected areas, with corresponding pressures on businesses and local communities. The overall issue of climate change and the potential impact it might have on the farm sector are the subject of considerable debate in the general community and in farming circles today. That certainly was not a debate that was taking place with any intensity some five years ago, but of course it is upfront and centre in the considerations of farmers and their leaders today.</para>
<para>I have taken the view in that debate that the sector must look to innovative opportunities and not simply wallow in the negative aspects about the extent of the sector’s contribution to the problem. The reality is that managing this problem and related problems, such as the increased incidence of pests and disease, may well be beyond the management skills of many farmers in some prone areas, forcing the pace of structural adjustment even faster.</para>
<para>Similarly, the changing nature of consumer preferences in how they buy and consume the output of the sector has dictated changes in the structure and will do so in the future. Consumers can be very fickle indeed in changing their preferences and having their needs and wants met, and sometimes the resources in agriculture are not flexible. Some industries, such as the stone fruit industry, require significant time frames for adjustments to occur and significant investments to meet new consumer demands, so the process of adjustment for many in the farm sector is a difficult one indeed.</para>
<para>Likewise, the changing nature of the domestic and the international marketplace and the dominance of huge retailers are putting significant pressures back on farm. These changes are eloquently outlined by Mick Keogh, the Executive Director of the Australian Farm Institute, in a perceptive article in the February 2005 edition of the <inline font-style="italic">Farm Policy Journal</inline>, entitled ‘The industrialisation of Australian farming’. He refers to the fact that this process of industrialisation appears to be rapidly developing in agriculture. I forgot to bring that article with me today to quote from it in this debate, and I regret that because it is an excellent article. It is very perceptive and very detailed, and I think it makes very important reading not only for farmers but for those in agribusiness and those who have an interest in the process of structural change in the sector.</para>
<para>Farm structures have adapted to accommodate these new arrangements. Keogh refers to the emergence of large-scale corporate farms. They have emerged and they are highly integrated into current food marketing systems, with direct contractual arrangements between those large corporate enterprises and large retailers that literally bypass traditional marketing systems. Keogh provides a very comprehensive analysis of the nature of these new marketing arrangements and the impact that they are having on the contractual relationships in the agricultural sector, on intellectual property rights and on patterns of trade.</para>
<para>In the face of these particular changes I think Australian agriculture has shown remarkable resilience, but there are even more economic changes bearing down upon the sector as we speak. We are going to see further structural adjustment in this sector as a result of the rising interest rates under the Howard government. It is now a matter for the public record that the Prime Minister and the Howard government have deceived farmers, as they deceived other Australian households and businesses before the last election, on the matter of interest rate rises in the future. The Prime Minister is in his usual pattern of doublespeak on this matter in what I consider to be a pathetic defence of his deception.</para>
<para>The economic framework has direct relevance to the pace of structural adjustment in the rural sector, and it is that issue of structural adjustment that is the focus of this particular piece of legislation before the House. Before the last election the Prime Minister led farmers to believe that interest rates would not rise. The Reserve Bank has recently increased them by 0.25 basis points, and it would appear there are more rises in the pipeline. What is the impact of this on the farm sector? I refer to a press release by the National Farmers Federation on 2 March 2005 where they have analysed the quantum of the impact that that is likely to have. Mr Charles Burke, the Farm Business and Economics Committee chair, had this to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Around 10 per cent of total farm cash costs go towards servicing average debt levels of about $370,000 per farm.</para>
<para class="block">This means that today’s move by the RBA will cost Australian farmers another $120 million a year and squeeze margins which are already under pressure from high exchange rates and high fuel costs.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Here we have the triple whammy: the rise in interest rates, courtesy of the Howard government, which is adding $120 million to farm costs; a squeeze on margins which are already under pressure from a high exchange rate, which in part is due to the policies of the Howard government; and, of course, high fuel costs, which in part are a result of this government’s involvement in the Iraq conflict. So in a whole raft of economic policy areas we have a direct pressure on farm costs and on farm adjustment—which is the subject of this particular bill—as a result of the policies of the Howard government. Mr Burke went a little further. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The rate rise also comes on top of one of Australia’s worst trade performances on record. The Current Account Deficit has hit $15.2 billion or 6.5 per cent of GDP.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I think that is perhaps a little bit on the light side. But it is the impact of our trade performance on exchange rates and on rural exporters that he goes on to analyse. He says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Higher interest rates will push the exchange rate higher, damaging exporters and fuelling more imports.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He further concludes:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We need to boost exports to address the record current account which means that ideally, our interest rates should be falling relative to our major trading partners.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">As we know, Australian interest rates are at decidedly higher levels than those of our trading partners. The high interest rate regime in Australia is fuelling the pressure on the exchange rate and this, in turn, is damaging farmers as significant exporters in this country. The foreign account relies very heavily on the input of the farm sector as far as earning national income goes in the international marketplace.</para>
<para>So here we have, as a result of the Howard government’s policies, a double whammy coming to farmers. Courtesy of the Howard government’s economic policies, we have a rise in interest rates which is adding to farm costs to the tune of $120 million on this occasion—and that is not taking into account the massive increase in costs that has occurred as a result of interest rate rises that had already occurred courtesy of this government. I would say that, just as a rough rule of thumb, the interest rate rises courtesy of the Howard government have added some half a billion dollars or more to farm costs, and that is not an insignificant amount. And then, of course, as this feeds into the higher exchange rate, farmers as exporters are penalised. Their income is reduced from their exports into the international marketplace. So there is a squeeze on their incomes, their costs increase and their financial viability is further threatened.</para>
<para>I am very interested in the interest rate debate because we know that the Prime Minister is apt to get up in this parliament and talk about high interest rates under Labor. But of course he conveniently forgets that when he was Treasurer of this country not only did he leave us with a deficit, which in current dollars would be the equivalent of $30 billion, but he presided over interest rates to businesses of 15.8 per cent. And the Prime Minister has the gall to get up in this parliament and criticise the Labor Party for high interest rates. One thing that we did do, something which really assisted farmers to cope with this issue of structural adjustment, was break the back of Liberal inflation in this country—the double-digit inflation that prevailed when the Liberal Party was in power under the Prime Minister’s stewardship as Treasurer. We broke the back of Liberal inflation. We set the basis for the low interest rate regime that this country now enjoys. So the issue of the total economic performance of the country is very important to this process of structural adjustment and it is very important to the issues we are debating here today in this legislation.</para>
<para>I go to the statistics that relate to the Farm Help Re-establishment Grants Scheme. We have seen that the number of exits under the legislation has not been of any substance since the year 2000. For example, in 2000-01 there were 182 re-establishment grants. In the next two financial years, 2001-02 and 2002-03, there were 161 in each of those years. It further declined in 2003-04 to 102 re-establishment grants. We can go to various industry reform packages that the government has introduced since it has been in office. If we look at the Sugar Industry Reform Program, for which funding of some $94 million was made available over the years 2004-05 to 2006-07 for re-establishment assistance, we find that, as at 4 March 2005, 82 growers had accessed re-establishment grants under that industry reform package for 2004-05. That is not a lot, given the noises that the government was making about the need to encourage many sugar farmers to exit the industry because of the economic challenges it faced.</para>
<para>With the Pork Producers Exit Program, the government and the minister’s estimated target was 140 producers, but only 74 have received pork producer exit grants. We see a similar situation occurring in the Dairy Exit Program where Centrelink have advised that there have been approximately 138 grants awarded under that program. So it is hardly a massive structural adjustment tool. It is no wonder that many in the farm sector have been very critical of the government for its administration of this particular piece of legislation.</para>
<para>If we go to the National Farmers Federation submission to the review of Agriculture Advancing Australia, we see that very little has been done by the government to address their concerns in this matter. For example, the National Farmers submission said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Farmhelp and similar exit programs should provide incentives for farmers considering retirement or industry exit to link with young individuals pursuing industry entry, therefore facilitating and accelerating the generational transfer of viable farm businesses;</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Nothing has been done on that particular request. The submission also said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Retraining Grant and the entire Professional Support components of Farmhelp should be available to farmers prior to them making their final decision on exiting the industry (through taking the Re-establishment Grant), therefore providing additional confidence and guidance to farmers in considering their future options;</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This is one that has been done. But then, further down in the submission, National Farmers suggested that Farm Help:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Introduce flexible measures to allow support to continue beyond the first 12-months in circumstances where farm exit maybe inadvertently delayed (ie: problems in selling property etc) or where an assessment of farm viability may take longer than this period;</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">On that sensible suggestion, nothing has been done. The National Farmers also state:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">In lieu of a bank statement documenting a farmer’s credit rating, allow Rural Financial Counsellors to certify the legitimacy of an individual farmer’s Farmhelp Application.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">We know that in this provision accountants can now certify, but the request of the National Farmers Federation to extend this certification to rural financial counsellors has not been granted. There is another particular request that was made by the National Farmers Federation:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Increase the net assets threshold for the re-establishment to $150,000 therefore enhancing the financial capacity of farm families to successfully re-establish following exit and reduce the likelihood such individuals will require ongoing welfare support following exit.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Nothing has been done. The problem in this particular area is getting worse as asset values rise. I mention this because although we have some definitional tinkering in this piece of legislation, the substance of what farmers require from it has not been addressed by the government. We will be supporting this particular legislation through the parliament but I think it is now a matter of public record that farm organisations are very disappointed in the administration of this area of policy by this minister and by the government.</para>

</talker>
<para>—Mr Deputy Speaker, of course I am opposed to the amendment, but I will speak to what has just been outlined by the member for Corio, which is the opposition’s inability to grasp the importance of this <inline ref="R2284">Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2005</inline> as it affects farmers, particularly in the electorate of McMillan. More importantly, through the whole of a 30-minute address the member for Corio did not mention one positive statement about what the opposition would do if it were in government. In fact the member for Corio seems very comfortable in opposition. He said that the opposition is broadly supportive of the government’s programs. From the list of positives he read out about the government’s programs, I would say that the opposition is totally acquiescent to the government’s programs, particularly with regard to agriculture. Would the member for Corio, if he were the minister, do anything different from what is being done by this government? I suggest not. Throughout his address he was positive about the government’s programs. He said that the opposition supports what the government is doing and that the only massive readjustment program was Paul Keating’s interest rate regime of 17 to 22½ per cent. That is what changed the industry forever and did so much damage.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I want to refer to the member for Corio’s address because he did mention one article. I mention another, a very positive article that I will not have time to address. On the <inline font-style="italic">Insiders</inline> program on Sunday morning there was a woman involved in agriculture, and particularly chemicals, who spoke to the nation through the program about interest rates and how they affect the farming community and the fact that good farmers factor in the range in which interest rates may climb or fall in a given time. Where is the difference between the government and the opposition on interest rates? The range under the Howard government has been between six and eight per cent—rises, drops. Under Labor, interest rates moved between 10 and 17 per cent. So I would not like to take the member for Corio’s figuring on his cost to agriculture to this point and then add what it would cost the farming community of Australia under Labor if we were moving between 10 and 17 per cent.</para>
<para>However, enough about what the member for Corio has said, because he did not outline where he had a problem with this legislation. We will be positive. This bill is of importance to the seat of McMillan because McMillan is dependent on agriculture, with the dairy industry at its heart. Reconstruction and deregulation of the industry have required greater efficiencies with fewer farmers milking more cows and producing more milk. Our dairy industry in Victoria now supplies 63 per cent of Australia’s milk production. Further efficiencies, though, are inhibited by a number of measures—and, as the member for Corio mentioned, we have just come out of a prolonged drought. We have a shortage of labour and now in many areas an increase in the cost of land affects the opportunities for neighbouring farmers to buy the land at a reasonable price for viable milk production. The bill may help free up some land by helping farmers on unviable small holdings to take the opportunity to exit the industry.</para>
<para>I am reminded today of the mendacity of the member for Corio as he stepped between the cow pats of the dairy herds in McMillan where he made an offer to local farmers to turn back the clock to 1950. He had a range of statements that he made only in McMillan. They did not go out of McMillan because he did not want to spread the news outside the local papers. He got tremendous coverage. He was all over the place. He really led some people to believe that he had the magic pudding in the back of his car for the dairy industry of Australia. But he was misleading the farmers and the people. We have the leaders of Fonterra and other industry leaders saying, ‘We have a great opportunity now to move forward with our dairy industry because of its efficiency and quality.’ But we will never be able to supply the markets that are available to us and we will always be looking for new people to come into the industry. How can we do that?</para>
<para>This legislation is particularly important to the farmers, particularly dairy farmers, in McMillan because of the dominant role that dairy plays in the total economy of my electorate. Indeed, McMillan is only one of a small number of federal electorates in which primary industry plays such a dominant role. The agricultural sector in the seat of McMillan is dominated by the dairy industry, which accounts for almost half of the total farming in the electorate and makes a significant contribution to the state and national economies. McMillan also boasts a beef cattle industry and a range of smaller agricultural and horticultural sectors, all of which are important contributors to the local economy.</para>
<para>The dairy industry in McMillan is emerging from several years of dry conditions which have had a serious impact on both farm production and employment—and farm families. Despite these leaner years, it continues to make a major contribution to our local economy. Over 1.2 billion litres of milk annually, almost a fifth of Victoria’s total production, comes out of the seat of McMillan. This is a sizeable contribution to the Victorian economy, with the dairy industry accounting for more than $3 billion in domestic sales and more than $2 billion in export sales. These sorts of figures can only be achieved by an industry that is continually striving for greater excellence. The dairy industry has gone through massive reconstruction over the past 30 years. Coming from a dairying community, I have lived with those changes for most of my life, with the greatest reform, outside of the high-interest years of the Hawke-Keating government, coming from deregulation five years ago.</para>
<para>Since the 1970s the number of dairy farms has been reduced by more than 50 per cent, while herd numbers and production have increased, so there are fewer farmers milking more cows and using greatly improved management processes. It is the desire of this House and the government that this momentum be maintained. We have to help the industry by creating an environment that makes it possible for the dairy industry to further improve all its management and ways. At the moment global demand for dairy products far outstrips production and, as the world’s fourth largest exporter, Australia appears well placed to capitalise on this demand, and the dairy farmers in the seat of McMillan will be best placed of those across the nation to capitalise on this opportunity.</para>
<para>In the short time I have today, Mr Deputy Speaker Baldwin, I want to refer to some of the environmental programs that local farmers are putting in place in McMillan. Outside of those that are well known to you—the sustainable farms program, Landcare programs and other programs—56 per cent of our dairy farmers have been involved in property revegetation, 64 per cent of our dairy farmers have some remnant vegetation on their properly and 57 per cent of our dairy farmers with waterways have all or most of them fenced off from livestock. Eighty cent of our farmers have formal effluent management systems, and there is potential for a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions through reducing or using the methane gas emitted by cattle, though improved management of organic matter, fertilisers and irrigated pastures will be of importance as the industry moves forward. The opportunity to grow the dairy industry in Australia is before us now. I believe that the opposition is supportive of this bill. I believe that this is an opportunity for us—and I know that you have dairy farmers in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker—to show that these people are our future and that dairy will be a part of Australia’s future and a part of Australia’s growth and export opportunity.</para>

<para>—I rise to support the <inline ref="R2284">Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2005</inline> as tabled by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. This bill reinforces the structural adjustment focus of the Farm Help—Supporting Families Through Change program. Farm Help is a program that has been operating since 1997 to provide support to people on farms in severe financial difficulty. Since the program commenced, over 9,000 farmers have received income support and some 8,000 have received advice and training, while over a thousand have received assistance to re-establish themselves outside the farming sector. The government has spent over $187 million on the Farm Help program to date. It has done this because it recognises not only the monetary value of the sector to the Australian economy but also the value that our rural heritage and community bring to Australia as a nation. It also recognises that, while ‘structural adjustment’ is a nice succinct academic term, at the end of the day it is real families who are affected by the process and these people deserve our support.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Because Australia is a net exporter of agricultural produce, which has traditionally formed a large part of Australia’s economic base, there has been investment in the sector over many years. My father, Dr Bob Fawcett, played a key role in this over his working life, developing new technologies and practices for reduced tillage and dryland farming. Increasing sophistication in farm management, meteorological forecasting, market analysis and an ongoing focus on sustainable land use have increased the potential value of the primary production sector. Despite these advances, those involved are still vulnerable due to factors which are beyond their control. Key amongst these factors are such things as export conditions—the exchange rate, markets, competition, the yields and prices and the vagaries of weather—long-term droughts and even short-term events such as cyclones or a late rain. My family has been affected by this, with some members farming north of the Goyder’s line in marginal areas where one year in five they are lucky to get a good return on their crops. Others have suffered the changes that have made their small holdings unviable and forced them to move off the land.</para>
<para>Farmers whom I represent in Wakefield are prime examples of some of these factors. This year they had a growing concern about the expected yield of cereal crops due to a very late break in the season. When rains did come, many became optimistic that, despite the late start, crops were looking very good. But the unseasonably dry and windy conditions on 12 and 13 October caused significant moisture loss from crops approaching harvest. This led to crop losses and to yield estimates falling by up to 30 per cent in many areas. In some areas, farmers failed to even get their seed back, which represented a significant unexpected loss to their farm businesses given the large investment in fuel, time, herbicides and fertiliser expended in anticipation of at least some return. As well the resulting poor harvest now means a downturn for local business, who were hoping for an ongoing investment in farm infrastructure and machinery maintenance or upgrades.</para>
<para>Farmers therefore may face not only the costs of long-term issues such as the compounding effects of land and stock degradation due to drought and the ongoing costs of living outside metropolitan areas but also these unexpected losses in income. At times like these they need support but also certainty—something that this bill will deliver. The government rightly has a focus on getting results for the people of Australia. Despite the comments of the member for Corio, the timely introduction of the Farm Help program is one example of where the government saw and responded to a need. The government also has an obligation to exercise good governance over taxpayers’ hard-earned money, which is why it maintains the Australian National Audit Office and is now responding to the mid-term evaluation report conducted by the Audit Office on this program.</para>
<para>The purpose of the amendments contained in this bill is to reinforce the structural adjustment focus of the program and, in doing so, to remove ambiguity about eligibility for assistance. It will do this through: defining a farmer as someone who has a right or an interest in land used for the purposes of farm enterprise; defining that a full-time farmer is one who, for a continuous period of at least two years immediately before applying for the assistance, can demonstrate that more than 50 per cent of their income, capital contributions and work time result from their role as a farmer; recognising that there may be circumstances where a genuine farmer does not in fact meet these criteria due to circumstances beyond their control, and so there is a discretion clause; and, lastly, putting in place penalty provisions to ensure the ongoing integrity of the program by enabling the departmental secretary to notify recipients of their obligation to inform Centrelink if they change their address or choose to re-enter farming within five years of being paid the grant.</para>
<para>My electorate of Wakefield has been blessed to not suffer some of the long-term drought issues affecting other parts of Australia, but, as a representative of an electorate with a large number of primary producers, I recognise the unique pressures faced by these enterprises and by the families who both enable and depend on them. I therefore welcome the renewing of the farm support program for four years as of the last budget and support these proposed amendments to strengthen the legislation which demonstrates this government’s commitment to this important sector of our community.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I rise tonight to speak in this very important debate on the <inline ref="R2284">Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2005</inline>. The purpose of this bill is to bring forward amendments to the area of legislation related to the Farm Help program. This program has been running since 1997 and is widely supported by the farm organisations. When we need to make amendments to the program it is important that we do so with the support of the opposition, and I hope we receive that support.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Due to the collapse in commodity prices or the unfair trade practices of other countries and the impact that they have on our farm sector, structural adjustment is something that goes on all of the time. As hard as we and our Minister for Trade, who tonight is on his way to China to negotiate the scoping parameters of a free trade agreement with China, fight in this place, international trade is not always fair. It certainly does not always have a level playing field. So often the impact of unfair trade in the international trading environment is felt by our farmers across Australia. But it is not only the unfair trade practices of some countries that impact on our farm sector; it is also drought. I want to touch on some of the ways extreme drought is impacting on the agricultural and pastoral sectors and on families in my electorate.</para>
<para>Since its inception in 1997, the Farm Help program has had tremendous support. An indication of that is the fact that some 9,000 farmers have sought support from this program since its introduction. I think that clearly demonstrates that this program is needed. Just those figures alone suggest the sort of magnitude of support that is going to farmers, and without this program there could well be 9,000 farm families put under even greater stress. Some 8,000 of those 9,000 farmers have received valuable advice and further training in business practices and some 1,000 have accessed the re-establishment grant of up to $50,000. I know from people in my own electorate that it is indeed a very painful process for so many farmers to have reached the point where they need to exit farming and receive that grant.</para>
<para>I want to touch on the issue of household support and how it is helping so many families. I mentioned earlier in my comments tonight that farmers are accessing this support, not just because of collapsing commodity prices but because of extreme drought. This government has been very supportive of our farm sector. I am pleased to see the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry enter the chamber. He knows only too well, as a former farmer himself and from his travels around Australia, how this exceptional drought—a once in 100 years event—is impacting on farm families.</para>
<para>In the west of my electorate people are now entering their fourth year of extreme drought. Only last week I was in western Queensland, in Longreach, speaking with representatives of Anglicare Central Queensland. They gave me a report of the impact that the exceptional drought is having on the families of this very vast region of central western Queensland. Their experience shows that most property owners are entering their fourth year of drought. They are down to about one-third of their viable stocking levels and their debt-to-equity levels are rising all the time. Notwithstanding that land prices have improved, the debt levels of families are rising faster than the value of their land. So, with the debt-to-equity level rising, families are finding it more difficult to continue to go to the bank and seek additional accommodation.</para>
<para>Anglicare pointed out their concern about the social effect that this drought is having on so many families. In their report to me they say that many women are an integral part of the property work force—if I could put it that way—because they are out there working with their husbands and their children, in some cases, just to keep the family business enterprise together. But some of these women have now gone to town to give their children access to education so that the women do not have to supervise their children’s education as they did when they were receiving lessons from the School of Distance Education. In other words, the women were being a governess as well as being that extra pair of hands on the drought-stricken property.</para>
<para>I was disturbed to receive this report from Anglicare. Among some of the references made to me by the drought coordinator for Anglicare Central Queensland were that many of the women in these families just simply cannot cope, as I mentioned earlier, with the role of being a mother, that extra pair of hands and teacher of their children who are being educated from home. The drought is taking a huge toll on these farm and property families and on their lives.</para>
<para>Anglicare in western Queensland are continuing to refer many men and women to the Royal Flying Doctor Service mental health unit and to other services—such is the stress that these families are under. The extremely high use of antidepressants is also a very worrying factor. One thing that the drought coordinator said to me was that not only women but more and more men are being referred by Anglicare to the Royal Flying Doctor Service mental health unit, which is based in Longreach.</para>
<para>That is why this program is so important. The Farm Help amendments before the House tonight are supporting those families who are under extreme stress. Sometimes when I stand in this House I find it rather hard to describe the mental state of these families and other people who are living in the towns. School numbers continue to fall as people move away from these towns in western Queensland. They have not only dealt with the structural adjustment in the wool industry and with it their declining fortunes but they have seen loss of employment opportunities for the shearers and their families, who have now moved away because of the decline of the wool industry.</para>
<para>In Quilpie alone there are now 40 houses for sale. It is a town of about 700 to 800 people. What prospects there are for the sale of those houses, I do not know, but that is the sort of roll-on effect that this exceptional drought and the decline in fortunes of the wool industry are having on these small country towns. As I said earlier, school numbers are falling in most of those western Queensland towns. It is a reflection of the impact that the structural adjustment and the exceptional drought has had on those families.</para>
<para>So many families are being forced off the land through no fault of their own. They have been forced off because of exceptional drought—not bad management. It is not because of bad decisions that they have made; it is because of the exceptional drought. The drought has not broken and the seasonal outlook for this year, sadly, looks as though we are heading into another El Nino effect. That, too, creates enormous stress for those families who are already stressed with trying to cope with the impact of this exceptional drought.</para>
<para>The amendments before the House tonight are very worthwhile. I strongly support them. I support the farm household support program because of the way in which it is helping people who need our help. We are a lucky country and we can afford to support families. That is what the <inline ref="R2284">Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2005</inline> is doing: it is supporting families in circumstances where they desperately need our help.</para>
<para>The other point I want to raise tonight is how the household support program will help the families of our citrus growers in the Emerald shire in Central Queensland. Those families are being affected by quarantine restrictions that have been placed on that shire because of an outbreak of citrus canker in the citrus industry last year. Those families also need our support.</para>
<para>I thank the minister, who is in the House tonight, for his diligence and determination to try to work with the state Minister for Primary Industries and Fisheries in Queensland, Henry Palaszczuk, who just reneged at every point in trying to negotiate a Commonwealth and state joint sharing of the financial support that we need to be giving these farmers affected by an outbreak of citrus canker—not only on their farms but in the region as well—because of the quarantine restrictions apply to these farmers and have had a financial impact it is having. In that region, of the orchardists I spoke to, already there have been 40 permanent jobs lost. Something like 1,500 workers in the horticultural industry would normally be there working the orchards right now, pruning them for the harvest later this year. They are no longer there because there is no prospect of being able to sell the product on our domestic market, should it come to fruition this year. The only option is to sell this product into overseas markets, where there are no restrictions on citrus coming from an area that is under quarantine because of the citrus canker outbreak.</para>
<para>This program for household support will also help those families, particularly those in my electorate in the quarantine zones. Special provisions that the minister was able to get approved by cabinet will mean farmers will be able to access invaluable household support to support their families. It will also support families from outside the quarantine zone in Queensland if they can demonstrate that they have been affected by the quarantine as it applies in Emerald shire and the impact it has had on the citrus industry in Queensland.</para>
<para>I am delighted to have made a contribution to this bill tonight. I say to the other side of the House: we need your support on these issues, because we are supporting families. These amendments to the Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2005 that amend Farm Help will go a long way to alleviating some of the stress and trauma that families go through when in so many instances they find themselves in situations where they must adjust out of farming and accept the up to $50,000 to help them start a new life. I commend the bill to the House and support this bill and the actions of the government.</para>

<para>—I thank all of those who have contributed to this debate on the <inline ref="R2284">Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2005</inline> and, in particular, the member for Maranoa, who from the experiences of his own electorate has been able to give a real insight into why this bill is so important. It is, of course, true that there is a large number of Australian farmers who are going through very difficult times because of the drought, including many in your own electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Baldwin.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>A range of programs have been put in place to assist Australian farmers. More than 30,000 farm families have benefited from this drought assistance since it began. There has never in Australian history been a greater effort provided by a national government to assist people facing the effects of drought. The Farm Help program also provides assistance in good times to help farmers better prepare for drought, to address the various issues of concern in their industry, to help them deal with the need to improve farm skills and to provide support to those farm families that have to make the very difficult decision about whether or not there is a future for them in the industry. Ongoing programs of this nature I think have a very, very important role to play in ensuring agriculture remains strong and prosperous in our nation.</para>
<para>There have been a number of particularly difficult issues to confront as industries face changing world situations, problems in endeavouring to compete and alterations to their regulatory systems which place extreme pressure on some of those industries—particularly in less favoured areas. But there is nothing more heartbreaking for anyone in agriculture than to see their crops die or their animals struggling because of the impact of drought. It not just has an economic impact on communities but also depresses their will and kills the spirit of so many in rural and regional Australia. The assistance that is being provided by way of drought aid has helped many families. I am disappointed that there has been a lack of cooperation from the states in the delivery of these arrangements; nonetheless, the Commonwealth has tried to provide real and practical assistance and tens of thousands of Australian farmers have benefited.</para>
<para>In relation to this bill, which makes amendments to the Farm Help arrangements, it is particularly important to recognise some of the context in which the Farm Help program exists. The AAA—Agriculture Advancing Australia—program is the government’s overarching commitment to all farmers and an ongoing commitment to the development of self-reliant, competitive and sustainable rural industries. AAA began in 1997 and in seven years has provided over $1 billion towards a range of programs to help ensure the long-term prosperity of Australian agriculture and agricultural communities. Over 150,000 primary producers, representing more than half of the Australian agricultural sector, have directly benefited from the package. AAA was renewed in the 2004-05 federal budget due to its success as a trigger for positive change in rural and regional Australia and in recognition of the considerable assistance it was providing to farming families.</para>
<para>Perhaps I could mention on this occasion some of the recent successes of AAA. The Rural Financial Counselling Service, which is funded under the AAA program, has responded promptly after the devastating bushfires on the Eyre Peninsula. I visited that area with the honourable member for Grey just the week before last to announce some new Commonwealth government assistance to the producers in that region. As soon as the fire had been through, there was a need for some emergency assistance, and the Commonwealth is playing its role in that regard. But many families face the despair of having lost significant parts of their property—and, in some cases, family members and loved ones.</para>
<para>The Eastern Eyre Rural Counselling Service located at Tumby Bay, north of the disaster area and the most affected by the bushfire, is providing a focal point for general assistance with the disaster response. Through the South Australian Association of Rural Counselling Services, additional counsellors were deployed into the impacted area on a rotational basis from Kangaroo Island and several other South Australian counselling services. The Rural Financial Counselling Service has been reviewed with a view to further improving the efficiency, timeliness and sustainability of the program and its delivery. What it has been able to do to assist in the South Australian bushfire disaster is an example of how important these services are in rural communities.</para>
<para>Farmbis continues to be a key element of the AAA package and last year was renewed for a further four years with a government commitment of up to $66.7 million. The government has been working closely with the states on new program arrangements and has finalised agreements with Western Australia, Victoria, Queensland, Tasmania and South Australia. I am very disappointed at some of the comments being made by the New South Wales minister. We are still waiting for New South Wales to commit to the Farmbis program. Even though they announced with much fanfare funding in their last budget and in subsequent budgets, we now have Minister Macdonald endeavouring to play games and pretend that, somehow or other, he is waiting on a commitment from the Commonwealth in relation to the financial arrangements. That commitment was made ages ago. All of the other states have managed to pick up on that commitment, but New South Wales, in spite of their earlier promises of funding, are obviously looking again at where they are moving. The Northern Territory also have not yet formalised their funding commitments to the program. I hope that, as soon as possible, those remaining states and the Northern Territory will ensure that primary producers and rural land managers continue to benefit from the training opportunities in business and natural resource management skills that are provided by the Farmbis program.</para>
<para>The AAA Industry Partnerships program is encouraging industries to be proactive in responding to challenges and opportunities. It is working in partnership with Australia’s agricultural, fisheries and forestry industries to assist them to improve their resilience and self-reliance. A key part of the Industry Partnerships program is the successful Young People in Rural Industries program. Since 2001, the government has provided over $2 million in funding to further the skills, knowledge and participation of young people in rural industries. I have to say that that is an element of the AAA package that gives me a great deal of satisfaction. To see the talents and the skills of many of the young people who have the potential to make such a significant contribution to Australian agriculture certainly gives me heart and the will to ensure that we provide the kind of environment that can properly reward their enthusiasm and commitment to their industries.</para>
<para>A further AAA success has been the Farm Help program. It continues to provide assistance for farmers working towards adjustment. Farm Help has a long record of achievement. Since the program commenced on 1 December 1997, over 9,000 farmers have received Farm Help income support, almost 8,000 farmers have taken up advice and training sessions and over 1,000 farmers have received re-establishment assistance. In that regard, the criticism from the honourable member for Corio of the failure of farmers to take up the exit package is obviously hollow. The member for Corio can surely not have been believing his own words when he criticised the fact that around a thousand farmers have taken up this exit package. He also made reference to the take-up of exit packages specifically provided in particular industries. Is he not aware that 82 farmers so far have already taken up the sugar package re-establishment grants, that 74 took up the Pork Producer Exit Program and well over 140 took up the Dairy Exit Program?</para>
<para>There has been a response by farmers unable to continue in the industry to take advantage of these exit programs which help to smooth their passage to an alternative lifestyle. It is not easy for farmers who choose to leave the career that has perhaps supported them throughout their lives and may have supported their families for generations. There is a sense of failure in many instances and an uncertainty about their capacity to deal with what a new life might hold in the cities or some other places. This re-establishment grant helps farmers to adjust to those circumstances. It gives them an opportunity to undertake some new training and to equip themselves effectively for a new life.</para>
<para>The purpose of the <inline ref="R2284">Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2005</inline> is to reinforce the structural adjustment focus of the Farm Help program. It seeks to do this by clarifying the qualification provisions for entry to the Farm Help program and by enabling ongoing communication with Farm Help re-establishment grant recipients regarding their undertakings not to re-enter farming and to notify a change of address. These provisions aim to improve the effectiveness of administration of the Farm Help program by allowing for follow-up to determine whether the program has assisted farmers to re-establish successfully out of farming. They are also to ensure that they comply with their agreement not to return to farming within five years of receiving the re-establishment grant. The opposition has indicated support for the bill but has moved a second reading amendment criticising the government for the failure of people to take up the various exit packages, to which I think I have already provided a response. Clearly the opposition amendment is without substance.</para>
<para>But I must also refer to the major point of the comments on the bill of the member for Corio where he spent a great deal of time criticising the government about interest rates. I am amazed that any member of the Labor Party could come into this parliament and criticise this government on the question of interest rates. Farmers well remember that when Labor was last in government they were paying interest rates of around 23 per cent on their loans. Can anyone imagine in this day and age, when interest rates have been around five, six and seven per cent for an extended period of time, the burden on their mortgage if they were paying the sorts of interest rates that farmers were paying when Labor was last in government—figures like 20 to 23 per cent? No business can sustain that kind of interest rate bill. For the opposition to come into this parliament and criticise a government that has adopted and delivered a low interest rate policy is clearly the height of hypocrisy. On those grounds alone I think the contribution of the member for Corio should be dismissed out of hand.</para>
<para>Nonetheless, I am grateful for the fact that, in spite of his spurious criticisms and inaccurate comments about the purpose and relevance of elements of the legislation, the opposition have indicated their willingness to support it. I thank all of those who have made a contribution to the debate on this bill. The AAA program continues to be founded on the success of its key components, which are the catalysts for prosperity and growth in Australian agriculture and for the sustainability of rural communities. I commend the legislation to the House.</para>

<para>—Labor will be supporting the <inline ref="R2291">Family and Community Services and Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (Further 2004 Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline>. However, I would like to take the opportunity presented by this debate to highlight the government’s continued neglect of our social welfare system and the implications for struggling Australian families. As is the case with most of the government’s agenda in this area, Labor supports the bill not because the measures within it are strong or the best approach to dealing with the issues we face as a nation but because they go some way to alleviating the hardships created by the government over the last nine years.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Many Australians continue to suffer because of the government’s mismanagement of our social security system, and Labor has no intention of standing in the way of any relief they can get. Disappointingly, however, this bill makes no attempt to address the underlying structural problems in our social security system. This is particularly evident with the government’s consistent failure to address the flaws in the family tax benefit system. We continue to see hundreds of thousands of families hit with large family tax debts year after year, and we have learned that some of Australia’s wealthiest families, with earnings of over $1 million each year, are still being paid obligation-free payments of up to $3,000 a year in the form of FTB part B. Yet the bill makes no attempt to address these obvious inconsistencies. Instead it introduces another quick fix, demonstrating yet again the government’s bandaid approach to social security. So I want to take the opportunity to point out the failings of this bill and show how these are symptomatic of the government’s continued mishandling of our social security system. I have also moved a detailed amendment that deals with these problems.</para>
<para>In summary, the bill proposes to amend the following legislation: A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999 and A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999 to introduce a new family tax benefit part B supplement from 1 January 2005; A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999 to replace the existing formula to the child income cut-out amount for the family tax benefit with a specified index cut-out amount; and the Social Security Act 1991 and the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986 to exempt aged care accommodation bonds from the operation of the assets test. I will deal with each of these measures in turn.</para>
<para>As part of its election policy ‘Extra assistance for families’, the government promised to increase the maximum rate of FTB part B by $300, starting from 1 July 2005. The government subsequently announced that it would backdate the new payment to 1 January 2005 and that it would now be paid as a lump sum on income reconciliation after the end of the relevant income year. It is claimed that schedule 1 of the bill gives legislative effect to this commitment through the introduction of a new FTB part B supplement. The annual amount of the new supplement will initially be set at $302.95 for the 2004-05 financial year. This amounts to a daily figure of 83c. As the FTB part B supplement commences from 1 January 2005, and there are 181 days in the period 1 January to 30 June 2005, the maximum FTB part B supplement for that period would be $150.23. The FTB part B supplement will be subject to a one-off six-month indexation arrangement on 1 July 2005, which reflects its 1 January 2005 commencement, and then will be indexed on 1 July 2006 and each following 1 July according to annual movements in the CPI. Of course the creation of another FTB supplement was not what the government promised at the election—and I will return to that point later.</para>
<para>Schedule 2 deals with the child income cut-out amount. An individual cannot be an FTB child if, among other things, the individual has adjusted taxable income, for the relevant income year, that equals or exceeds the cut-out amount. The relevant eligibility rules and definition of ‘cut-out amount’ are in sections 22A and 35 of the Family Assistance Act. Under the bill the current definition of ‘child income cut-out amount’ will be replaced with the amount of $11,233 from 1 July 2005. This amount will be subject to annual CPI indexation to maintain its value in real terms. The new amount is apparently higher than the cut-out amount of $11,218 that would have been applicable from 1 July 2005 under the existing formula in family assistance legislation.</para>
<para>Schedule 3 deals with accommodation bonds. As part of its election policy, the government promised that accommodation bonds paid to an aged care facility would be exempt from the Social Security Act and veterans’ entitlements assets tests. Currently where a customer pays an accommodation bond to an aged care facility the refundable balance of the bond is held as an asset of the customer for means testing purposes. This may result in a reduction in the pension the customer receives and may in some cases mean that a pension is no longer payable. These amendments therefore mean that many older Australians will be able to receive a higher rate of payment or obtain a payment they would not otherwise have had.</para>
<para>These amendments will also allow customers to pay their accommodation bonds by periodic payments and to rent out their former home without the rental payments affecting their rate of payment. Customers in this situation will also be able to retain the asset test exemption for their former home during any period in which they rent it out. This change mirrors existing concessions available to residents in high-level aged care who pay accommodation charges. There will also be provision for customers, who will now be eligible for either a social security or veterans’ affairs payment because of these changes, to have their payments backdated to 1 July 2005. The backdating will be available where customers apply to Centrelink or the Department of Veterans’ Affairs for a payment prior to 30 December 2005 or, if they have special circumstances, prior to 30 June 2006.</para>
<para>I now want to deal with the government’s broken promise to increase family tax benefit part B. As I indicated earlier, the proposed changes to family tax benefit part B included in this bill are not what families were promised during the election campaign. Indeed, eligible families will now only receive half of what they were promised during the financial year. As part of its election policy—Extra assistance for families—the government promised to increase the maximum rate of FTB part B by $300, starting from 1 July 2005. Families had every right to assume that the $300 annual increase would be made available to families through their regular fortnightly family tax benefit payments and that this money would start to become available after 1 July this year, but this has not occurred.</para>
<para>Under the arrangements included in this bill, families will not receive the promised $300, which will now be paid as a lump sum, until after 1 July 2006. Instead, the Minister for Family and Community Services announced on 9 February 2005 that eligible families would be paid a $150 bonus, a bogus bonus, at the time they lodged their tax returns for the current financial year—that is, after 1 July 2005. This so-called bonus is only half of what eligible families were promised at the election. So we have seen the government swing into full mean and tricky mode by fudging the accounting and then having the audacity to dress up the revised measure as somehow being a bonus for struggling families. In a breathtaking display of hypocrisy—and this is pretty incredible for that minister—the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Patterson, continues to have the hide to claim that this consolation payment of up to $150 is somehow a bonus for families. Senator Patterson clearly, as usual, does not understand her own election promise, which was that families would get the full $300—not $150—starting from 1 July this year. It is either that, or the minister is plainly being deceptive. The delayed payment of the full $300 was confirmed by officials from the Department of Family and Community Services at the Senate estimates on 16 February 2005. It is also clear that families no longer have the choice of receiving the additional money through their fortnightly payments. The removal of any choice is contrary to the government’s rhetoric that families should have the choice of receiving regular fortnightly payments or a lump sum through the tax system.</para>
<para>In the last week we have seen even more damning evidence that the government’s family tax benefit system is not working. New figures have revealed that Australia’s wealthiest families continue to be big winners from family tax benefit part B. Nearly 30,000 families with annual incomes of over $100,000 received family tax benefit B payments worth up to $3,000 a year during the 2002-03 year. At the same time poorer families continue to be confronted with a mounting FTB debt load year after year. Imagine how these families felt when they saw the reports last week that wealthy families, earning hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, were able to get family payments. While wealthy families are pocketing thousands of dollars in payments, other families are being saddled with family tax benefit debts every year. Where is the fairness and equity in all of that? The fact that wealthy families are being rewarded with up to $3,000 a year in obligation-free family payments shows the failure of the government to provide assistance to those families who need it most. If the government were really serious about welfare reform then fixing this glaring inequity would be a good starting point.</para>
<para>The largesse for Australia’s wealthiest families contrasts with the government’s harsh plans to take away payments from people with a disability, and sole parents. While the government is happy to pay wealthy families thousands of dollars each year it wants to force single parents back to work as soon as their children start primary school. This demonstrates why Labor remains committed to introducing a single family payment with a consistent income test for all Australian families. This is the best way to ensure that our system of family payments is fair, consistent and targeted to those families that need the help most. Struggling families have every right to demand an explanation from the Howard government about why its policies continue to reward wealthy people at the expense of people who have a genuine need for assistance.</para>
<para>The government is also setting out clearly to target single parent families. The broken promise to increase family benefits to single parent families is one of the three major hits on these families since the election. And it is the same story with the promised child-care rebate. Shortly before Christmas last year, the Howard government broke its promise to introduce an uncapped 30 per cent child-care rebate this year. The rebate will now be capped, and families will not be able to claim one cent until after 1 July 2006, a full year later than the government promised at the election. The rebate would have provided much-needed relief to single parent families struggling under the weight of high child-care fees. Now we learn that the government wants to force single parents back into the work force as soon as their children start primary school. These three hits on single parents demonstrate that the Howard government is more interested in cost cutting than in looking after the needs of families or giving them the capacity to participate fully in the work force. Single parent families are right to be anxious about what will happen next time they appear in the Howard government’s firing line.</para>
<para>We have also seen the government continue to leak information about its plans for so-called welfare reform. The government basically wants to make it harder to access payments so that it can save money but not necessarily assist people to fulfil their capacity. The government does not seem to understand that real welfare reform is about making the social security system simpler, fairer and more accessible for the six million Australians who access income support payments each year. There has to be a system which invests in their capacity and provides incentives. Real welfare reform is about unlocking the welfare trap that this government has created in both the tax system and the family payment system and investing in the capacity of individuals to participate in the work force. Neither of these things is happening. Successful welfare reform should develop opportunities for the full work force participation of those who are receiving payments.</para>
<para>As always with the Howard government, its plans are simplistic and narrow. The narrow cost-cutting focus of John Howard’s agenda is best summed up in his failed attempts to limit access to the disability support pension. By recycling these plans, the government has again shown that it cannot tell the difference between cost-cutting and reform. Labor recognises that encouraging people to move from welfare to work is a policy objective in its own right, and one of the most important we can have. We want fewer people on welfare and more people in work. By helping people make the transition from welfare to work, we can deliver social and economic benefits for individuals, their families, their communities and the nation as a whole. Welfare reform should deliver increased work force participation, which has been recognised as an economic priority for a very long time. But, as the Reserve Bank and others have noted, skills shortages and stagnant work force participation are big threats to Australia’s continuing economic prosperity.</para>
<para>After almost a decade in government, John Howard still has not made any progress on welfare reform. As always, the government is long on rhetoric but very short on action. That sums up the story of the Howard government: nine years of failure to invest in people and real welfare reform. It has a tax system which punishes people trying to move from welfare to work, whereby some of the people on the lowest incomes in our community lose more than a dollar for every additional dollar they earn. Rewards should be there for working harder—for people trying to move from welfare to work and for people working overtime. People should not be financially punished for becoming active in the work force, but that is currently the situation we have in the intersection between the family payment system and our income tax system.</para>
<para>Labor took up this challenge seriously at the last election. Labor’s policy was not perfect, but it did seek to fundamentally address the punishing effective marginal tax rates that are holding our economy back. It had the overriding objective of boosting participation, particularly amongst jobless families. Income splitting was allowed, enabling a tax-free threshold of up to $12,000 for one parent. Combined with the new working tax bonus, the incentives for jobless parents to move off benefits and into work were dramatically improved, slashing effective marginal tax rates by almost 20 per cent. Family tax benefits were combined into a single payment, ensuring that multiple benefits could not be withdrawn at the same time. The income threshold before payments were withdrawn was lifted substantially from just over $30,000 per year to $50,000 per year, massively improving the rewards for work for middle-income families.</para>
<para>The Melbourne Institute assessed the impact of Labor’s package on participation and concluded that up to 71,000 extra people would be drawn into the labour market, including 49,000 jobless parents, with the potential for savings in social security outlays and extra tax revenue rising to more than $1 billion per year. That is welfare reform. We do not have welfare reform from this government. What we really have is a welfare trap which the government remains unwilling to unlock because it will not deal effectively with the problem of high effective marginal tax rates. Nor will it come to grips with the need to invest in the capacity of people, particularly those who are denied access to rehabilitation—disability support pensioners who could do some activity in the labour market if they had real access to support when it comes to rehabilitation.</para>
<para>In comparison to Labor’s scheme, the Howard government’s family benefit changes announced in the 2004 budget were estimated by the Melbourne Institute to result in 22,000 individuals leaving the work force. So Labor has been leading the way in constructing a participation agenda—the agenda which the government claims to have, but which it does not practise. The government has put in place a welfare trap by not putting the necessary resources forward to invest in the capacity of individuals and by not reforming the intersection between the tax system and the payments system, which punishes so many Australians who want the opportunity to move from welfare to work.</para>
<para>It is with these remarks in mind that we have moved our constructive amendments to point out that this government has reneged on two key election promises. When it comes to the 30 per cent rebate for child care, the government has fiddled the system. Essentially, people cannot access any of that rebate for something like 18 months. What sort of payment or initiative is it when this government thinks it is assisting families by telling them it is going to give them a 30 per cent rebate for child care and then makes them wait 18 months before they see a dollar? It is just incredible. I do not think I have seen anything from this government that is more out of touch than this proposal. The government tells families to keep receipts for child care, which many of them cannot afford, for 18 months and then it might give them a quid—and does not bother to tell anyone how it intends to do it.</para>
<para>Similarly, the fiddle that they have done with family tax benefit B is a shocker. These measures combine to essentially rip $550 million out of their original election commitments. Why don’t the government own up and say, ‘We promised too much; we’re ripping $550 million out and putting down an affordable scheme’? You would have more respect for them if they said that. But we get these sneaky cutbacks hidden underneath which we had to tease out from them in estimates committees. Their reneging on the child-care promise was announced two days before Christmas by Treasurer Costello, hoping no-one would notice.</para>
<para>So $550 million has been ripped out of the commitments and taken away from families in yet another broken election promise. When you look at all these things combined, what this country desperately needs is some real welfare reform which invests in people and provides incentive and the backup to give people the capacity to stand on their own two feet. They have not been getting that for nine years and there is nothing in this bill to deliver it.</para>

<para>—The Australian Labor Party will support the <inline ref="R2195">Family and Community Services and Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (2004 Election Commitments) Bill 2004</inline> before the parliament. It is interesting that there has been discussion about ‘sneaky cutbacks’, the government fiddling with the system, ‘bogus’ bonuses, payments not being real and in ‘mean and tricky mode’. I do not think the Australian people believe the Australian Labor Party when they hear that kind of rhetoric. They know what is proposed in the bill this evening is certainly of benefit to all Australians.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I am also moved to defend the current Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Kay Patterson. There could not be a more decent and caring person in that particular portfolio. Senator Patterson knows the portfolio backwards. She knows what Australian families face and she argues fiercely for them in the cabinet. She is a great advocate for those who need income support or other benefits, for Australian families and for older Australians. This bill tonight is the result of her advocacy. Senator Kay Patterson is indeed a fine minister in this portfolio, and I would not have any other.</para>
<para>Another thing that concerns me is the continuing attacks from the Australian Labor Party on the agency that delivers the benefits that are in this bill this evening—Centrelink. Centrelink is the model of a welfare delivery and income support system that the entire world could take note of. Centrelink is a marvellous organisation. Centrelink deals with such a huge volume of inquiries every day, does it extraordinarily efficiently, yet cops extraordinary criticism when once or twice something might go wrong. Mistakes will happen no matter what. There are always mistakes. They are never wilful, but they happen. When they happen once or twice in millions of transactions every day, I get pretty cranky that such criticism is directed against the good people in Centrelink right across this country. I pay tribute to Peter Doutre, who looks after the northern region from Gladstone and Cape York to the border. Peter Doutre and his people are just fantastic and a model of what happens right across the country. I certainly respect and compliment the people of Centrelink and the great work that they do for all Australians on behalf of the Australian government.</para>
<para>I have also heard criticism tonight that welfare reform is about the government saving money. It is not. Some of the welfare reform that occurs—and some is in the bill tonight—actually costs the government fairly significant amounts of money. I want Australians to understand that just cutting costs is not the agenda of the Howard government; it is delivering services and support to Australians who need it at the time that they need it.</para>
<para>I heard criticism in the debate tonight about the government wanting to limit access to the disability support pension. Right now there is a fellow in my electorate who is on the DSP and he runs a concreting business. How can that be? How can he be getting a disability support pension and at the same time be the principal working in a concreting business? That is wrong. Yet the Australian Labor Party say to the government: ‘We’re not going to help you fix that. This is a cost-cutting measure.’ No, it is not; it is a measure to look after people who actually need looking after and to not look after people who do not need support. All Australians would support that—all Australians, apparently, except the members of the Australian Labor Party.</para>
<para>We have heard criticism tonight that there has been no progress on welfare reform in nine years. Goodness gracious me! The Australian Labor Party ought to ask Australian families how they feel about that. They ought to ask Australian families about the payments that the Labor Party claimed were not real. They might find that Australians are very satisfied with the progress and the reform that has occurred under the Howard government in the last nine years.</para>

</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>In relation to progress on welfare reform, of course the government have not been able to implement all the reforms we wanted to. And why not? Because the Australian Labor Party stood in the way of sensible reforms. I do not think you could point to a single reform by the Howard government—all the difficult things we have done over the last nine years—that has not been proved to be right. We have fought tooth and nail to get them through the Australian Senate, and when they have been implemented the government have been vindicated in what we wanted to do. The reforms have been very effective for Australia. We will continue to do that and Australians will be better off because of it.</para>
<para>I am particularly pleased to see the changes to the accommodation bonds in the bill before us tonight—a very sensible measure indeed and one that will be welcomed by older Australians who currently are not exempt from lump sum accommodation bonds being taken into account in relation to their social security benefits. This not only applies to social security recipients; it also applies to recipients of veterans’ affairs pensions, and so it should. It should be consistent. The government has ensured that the relevant acts will be amended, when this legislation passes, to have consistency across benefit delivery to all Australians. In exempting this particular accommodation bond from the assets test, the government has also been mindful to exempt situations where residents might not sell their home but instead rent it. The government has very sensibly exempted the rental payments to avoid those payments affecting the person’s pension. This is an example of the Howard government’s caring attitude towards Australians in these sorts of circumstances.</para>
<para>We have heard about the other two parts of this bill, the FTB part B supplement and the child income cut-out amount. All of these measures in the bill are good news for Australians. They are good news for older Australians and they are good news for Australian families. My allotted time has now expired so I commend the changes in the bill.

<para>—Before I turn to the contribution I intend to make in this debate, I have to pick up on some of the comments made by the previous speaker. We on this side of the House know that when they on that side of the House mention ‘welfare reform’ and ‘welfare to work’, they are not talking about caring for the person or getting the best outcome for the person, they are talking about cost cutting. Cost cutting is what this government is about. It is not about getting the optimal outcome for the person who may be in receipt of the welfare. When I heard the previous speaker pull up a person from his electorate who may be running a concreting business and use that as an example of why there should be a reform to the disability support pension, it made me sick. As somebody who worked for 13 years with people with disabilities, constructively trying to get them into the work force, giving them the skills and confidence to go in there and try to get a job, I have to say that to hear that member on that side of the House denigrating people and trying to scapegoat them, stereotype them and make out that anyone getting the disability support pension or benefiting from the current system is in some way trying to rort the system is absolutely disgraceful. The member should hang his head in shame. To say that the Howard government is noted for its caring attitude, for its caring nature, for being caring towards all those people who are on welfare is an absolute joke. He must take the members of this House for idiots if he thinks that is what the people of Australia think of the Howard government. Members of this House sit in their electorate offices with constituent after constituent coming in to see them to complain about actions taken by the Howard government, so I would have to say that the member is deluding himself.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I will turn to the substance of what I wish to say in this debate. I and members on this side of the House support the <inline ref="R2291">Family and Community Services and Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (Further 2004 Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline>, but our support is somewhat tempered by the government’s failure to fully deliver on an election promise it made to the Australian people. I suppose you could say that we should not be surprised by that, but the Australian people voted for this government and believed what it had to say. Unfortunately, they have put their trust in a government that has made a name for itself for not delivering or not quite telling the truth about matters that it puts to the Australian people. Unfortunately, part of this legislation falls into that category, and I will touch on that in a moment. But, overall, I think that the bill does deliver some meaningful gains to the Australian people.</para>
<para>The bill seeks to implement the introduction of a family tax benefit part B supplement, and I will concentrate on that a little later. There are changes to the formula for calculating the child income cut-off amount for family tax benefit and exempting aged care accommodation bonds from the Social Security Act and the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. When this legislation is enacted it will introduce a new family tax benefit part B supplement and that will be effective from January 2005. It will replace the existing formula for the child income cut-off amount for family tax benefit with a specific cut-off amount of $11,233 and there is a new formula for annual indexation of this amount. It exempts aged care accommodation bonds from the operation of the social security and veterans’ affairs assets test.</para>
<para>I will concentrate on that last part first. I like to be positive. I was a little bit negative at the start of my contribution to this debate but I will be positive now. I think that it is a very good move to exempt aged care accommodation bonds from the Social Security Act and the veterans’ affairs assets test. This is one of those matters that I have had constituents come and talk to me about. It is a matter that has created great angst for elderly people and for their families. It is something that I have made representation to the government about and that I have tried to support for a long time. It is very commendable that finally the government has embraced this matter. By doing so, it is assisting those elderly people who find they have to move into low-care accommodation and making it a lot easier for them to make the transition.</para>
<para>I mean ‘easier’ not from a financial point of view but from a psychosocial point of view. It is very hard for an older person to make the decision to leave their home. They are very attached to it. The ownership of that home, the memories that go with it and everything else that is associated with it are very important to them. When they do sell the home and then find out that it can affect their social security or veterans’ benefit, that further exacerbates the anxiety that is caused because in many cases they feel that they are losing the security that the money they had for their home gave them. This legislation puts them in a similar position to those people who are currently in receipt of social security and veterans’ payments. So I see that as a very positive move by the government and a very positive part of this legislation. I am sure the members on the other side of the House will recognise that I do not give compliments lightly, but I think this is positive and that it should have happened a long time ago. On that point this legislation gets a big tick but, unfortunately, there are other parts of the legislation that I am not quite so happy with.</para>
<para>I support the second reading amendment. The first part of that amendment is about the failure of the government to pay families the $300 increase in the maximum rate of the FTB part B starting from 1 July 2005 which is what was promised in its election policy—extra assistance for families. But, once again, the government has walked away from a promise it made to the Australian people. It thinks it can shuffle sideways and it thinks that it can trick the Australian people. It does not understand that Australian people actually rely on the government and they believe the government. Every time the government changes its position, every time it does not deliver properly, it not only undermines itself, it undermines all members of parliament. It creates a belief in the community that you cannot trust members of parliament because they do not deliver on what they say.</para>
<para>The government says one thing before an election and does another thing after the election. I find that particularly obnoxious because as a member of parliament I always try to be very honest with the people that I represent in this parliament and I place great importance on the fact that, as members of this House, we have an obligation to the people we represent and to all Australians to tell the truth. By not fully delivering on that promise of $300, the government stands condemned. But I know I should not be surprised. I know people on this side of the House share my feelings. I think that it is very disappointing.</para>
<para>The next part of the amendment is to condemn the government for hypocritically claiming that the payment of up to $150 that families will now receive from 1 July is a ‘bonus’ when in fact it is only half of what was promised in extra assistance. That goes back to what I was saying a moment ago, because a bonus is not getting half of what the Australian people believed that they would be getting by voting for this government. What they are getting is trickery and deceit and the government stands condemned for that.</para>
<para>The next part of the amendment criticises the government for not giving families choice in receiving the additional family tax benefit part B money fortnightly or having it paid in a lump sum as part of eligible families’ tax returns. Families find that quite disturbing. It is important that people have choice about how they receive their payments. I suppose if you look at the daily amount it is rather small, but if you are on a tight budget and you need that money on a fortnightly basis, you need it then; you do not need it at the end of the financial year. The government just does not understand how hard it is for families. It does not understand that people actually struggle on a day-to-day basis to make ends meet. It does not understand the difficulties that families experience. And to remove that choice, in itself, can create hardship for people. I know that many people of the other side of this parliament have extreme wealth and do not understand just how important it can be to have that money on a fortnightly basis.</para>
<para>The final part of our amendment, which is pretty self-explanatory, is the failure of the government to address the work disincentives caused by the family tax benefit B. It is all driven by their ideology, by their philosophical bent. They are not looking at the real issues, at how their decisions, their actions, affect Australian families.</para>
<para>This is a government that gives on one hand and takes on the other. It throws money at Australian people before the election and then it takes it back afterwards—in this case, it takes half of it back. It is a government that talks about keeping interest rates low—and what happens after the election? Interest rates are on the way up. That in itself creates enormous hardships for families. I have already had families contacting my office, talking about the hardship that this will create. This is a deceitful government. Its failure to fully deliver on its election promises in this legislation demonstrates its deceit. The Australian people recognise this deceit and if the government continues in this way they will send it a very strong message at the next election.</para>

<para>—I rise to support the <inline ref="R2291">Family and Community Services and Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (Further 2004 Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline>. Before the member for Shortland leaves, I note that it is terrific to see that she recognises the things that the government is doing even though, along with the rest of her party, she seeks to mislead the Australian people time and again by listening only to the parts she wants to and by spreading misinformation in this place as well as in the media about the things the government has done. The good news is that the people of Australia are far smarter than the ALP and the member for Shortland realise, hence the result of 9 October last year.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This bill is about the government’s ongoing commitment to listening to and acting in support of three of the most significant parts of our community: families, seniors and veterans. On the first occasion I was privileged to speak in this place I highlighted my belief that families are a key part of our society. Part of the reason I chose to stand for election to represent the people of Wakefield here was a commitment to families. I welcome any move toward supporting stronger relationships and functional, loving families. This commitment to raise the amount of family tax benefit part B through a supplement is a welcome addition to the other practical outcomes this government has delivered to the people of Wakefield. I am happy to say—and I am sure that this will disappoint the member for Shortland—that these outcomes do not go unnoticed.</para>
<para>While I was doorknocking the many young families living in new housing developments such as Blakeview, Hillbank, Hewett and Andrews Farm, many spoke of their relief that the Howard government has kept interest rates in a low band of around six to eight per cent compared to the 10 to 17 per cent of the previous, Labor government. This means that families can enjoy the security of their own home. Parents I have spoken to have welcomed the facts regarding immunisation. The member for Shortland has said that this government is about money and that it does not care about people. She is partly right. This government is about money, because of the outcomes that it brings for people. While the last Labor government spent just $13 million on vaccines keeping our children healthy, in the next financial year the Howard government will spend $286 million on vaccines—a 22-fold increase on the 1996 figure. This means that childhood immunisation rates, which were at just 50 per cent in the early 1990s under Labor, are now amongst the best in the world at above 90 per cent.</para>
<para>Furthermore, groups such as the Clare and Gilbert Valley Council in the north of Wakefield have gone from telling me about the shortages of child care in their area to now telling me that because of the policies of the Howard government they have a number of providers vying to provide long day care in Clare. The residents of Kapunda and surrounding districts have told me of their excitement about the $519,000 incentive funding made available recently by the Howard government to enable the establishment of a child-care centre and the opportunities this will open up for families in their district.</para>
<para>While this family tax benefit supplement will assist families, I note in the legislation the measures needed to take account of the single parent situations and situations where custody is shared. Wakefield has a large number of families whom this will apply to, and often the children involved require additional support and help, particularly with early learning. I have begun discussions with local church, community and education groups to examine the best ways this government can provide targeted support to these communities of children in need. I am passionate about this not only so that these young people can have a better childhood but so that they have the opportunity to achieve their full potential as they grow into young adults—the future of our society.</para>
<para>These same clauses in the legislation highlight to me once again the enormous financial and emotional cost of relationship breakdown and the dysfunction that so frequently follows in our community. An article on the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> of 10 February this year highlighted the fact that, while not all marriages work, successful relationships are possible, that they are about choices and support and that, importantly, the benefits of successful marriages flow not only to the couple involved but to their children as well as the broader circle of people touched by the family. With this government, I will continue to work with the people of Wakefield and Australia to identify and promote ways to better value and support healthy, viable marriages.</para>
<para>This bill is also about the Howard government delivering outcomes for pensioners and veterans. Whether it was in Davoren Park, Elizabeth Grove, Salisbury North, Mallala or Riverton, talking with pensioners and self-funded retirees highlighted to me their concerns about the viability of their lifestyle now and at the point when they move into care of some kind. These people welcomed the Howard government’s provision of a utilities supplement which will help them meet practical needs; the $148 million package for elderly carers, which will provide more financial help and respite; as well as the increasing rebate for private health insurance for older Australians.</para>
<para>Another real concern, however, was the potential impact of the costs of aged care. They saw that the inclusion of the accommodation bond in assessing their social security payment and the retention of the family home, which in the eyes of many is an inheritance, would affect their disposable income through both asset and income testing. This bill will not only resolve this issue, by exempting the balance of the bond from the assets test, but also it will provide certainty as to the status of their former family home. If the property is rented out and the income is used to pay periodic bond payments, the rental will be excluded from the social security income test and the home itself will remain exempt from the means test. Importantly, these amendments also apply to veterans. They will enjoy the same benefits and have more certainty about their future once these amendments to the social security law, the family assistance law and the Veterans’ Entitlements Act are passed.</para>
<para>Unlike the member for Shortland, the Australian people recognise that these amendments—this follow-through of the commitments made during the election—are just the latest instalment from a government which over the last nine years has consistently listened to, and delivered results and real benefits to, the families, pensioners and veterans in Australia’s community. I am therefore happy to support the bill.</para>

<para>—I am certainly pleased to speak this evening on the <inline ref="R2291">Family and Community Services and Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (Further 2004 Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline>. The bill sees the Howard government following through on a commitment that we made during the election campaign to ensure that we provide in a very full way for those people in our community that rely on family tax benefit part B, as well as providing increased certainty for veterans under the veterans affairs assets test when it comes to dealing with social security. As well, the bill replaces the existing formula for the child income cut-out amount for family tax benefit part B with a set amount of $11,233. I am also pleased to speak to this bill because it addresses the primary concerns of two communities in my electorate of Moncrieff, particularly those people on the Gold Coast. They are of course the veterans community on the Gold Coast and those many Gold Coasters with young families that rely on the support that the Howard government provides them through family tax benefit part B.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Before I get to the detail of the bill, I would like to make some comments on family tax benefit part B, particularly the fact that the government took the decision to pay the increased amount of $300 from 1 July onwards as a lump sum payment. This is an important component of the government’s legislation and goes to the core of the fact that the Howard government recognises that Australian families benefit from lump sum payments. Despite the many concerns that the opposition raises, I would contend that those concerns are false and hollow and that the rhetoric that the Australian Labor Party engages in, especially when it comes to lump sum payments made by the Howard government to support hard-working Australian families, is done for no reason other than cheap political point scoring.</para>
<para>I am pleased to associate myself very closely with the Multiple Birth Association, one of the many very active community groups in the Gold Coast community. The Multiple Birth Association have a very active membership. I am a big supporter of theirs and I am very proud of the work that they do as advocates for those people that have had twins or triplets and the like. I am also very proud of the role that they play in keeping informed those people that are encountering a lot of the burdens and challenges that go with having multiple children from the one birth, by taking them through the process and teaching them about mechanisms that they can use and also about assistance that is available, so that the experience of young children is one that is ultimately not too stressful for the parents concerned. I think we would all recognise that perhaps having twins or triplets in one birth would present a series of unique challenges for many families, so the role that the Multiple Birth Association play is an important one, and that is why I am pleased to assist them.</para>
<para>Recently, during the campaign, I had the opportunity to have the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator the Hon. Kay Patterson, visit my electorate for a short while. While the minister was there, I made sure that she had the opportunity to meet with representatives of the Multiple Birth Association. We made sure that we took the opportunity, while we were discussing the challenges that they face, to discuss the ways in which family tax benefits have been of assistance to them. I would highlight the message that came through very loudly and clearly from the large number of mothers that were there on that particular day to meet with the minister. They indicated their overwhelming support for these types of payments being made as lump sums. The reality is that, contrary to what the ALP says, it is not a case of families going out and squandering the money on all sorts of inappropriate purchases or activities. The vast majority of families use this money very effectively to ensure that they make available to their young children the very best that they can. This might include, for example, using the lump sum to purchase seats for their vehicle, new bunk beds or other equipment that is crucial to ensuring that the children that are born into these families have the very best possible start in life. That is why I am particularly pleased to support this bill.</para>
<para>In particular, the announcement during the 2004 election campaign that the government would increase the rate of family tax benefit part B by $300 per annum from 1 July 2005 was one that I had no difficulty at all in highlighting to my electorate and explaining the benefits that would flow from it. I am certainly pleased about it and I know from the mothers I have spoken with at the Multiple Birth Association as well as other people who have approached me at the listening posts that I hold in the community that parents like lump sum payments and they like the fact that they provide them an opportunity, as I said, to purchase a new set of bunk beds or the kind of equipment that they need for their children.</para>
<para>Likewise I am pleased that now the federal government has been able to ensure that aged care accommodation bonds are exempt assets when it comes to social security and the veterans entitlements assets test. This has been an issue that a number of veterans have raised with me. On the Gold Coast there is a very large and significant veteran population. The Gold Coast has the fourth largest veteran population in Australia and I am very pleased that the government has been able to move in this way thanks to its economic responsibility. Thanks to the good economic management of the government we are in a position where we can exempt aged care accommodation bonds from the social security and veterans entitlements assets test.</para>
<para>The reality is that many veterans rely on this exemption to ensure that they are able to obtain the greatest entitlement that they can. It is an entitlement that I know veterans appreciate. On the Gold Coast my relationship with a number of veterans groups—in particular the Nerang RSL, the Surfers Paradise RSL and the Southport RSL—has shown me that this issue was important to them, and I am pleased the government has been able to respond in this way. The third aim of the bill is to replace the existing formula for the child income cut-out for family tax benefit with the new set amount of $11,233. This is an important amendment. Whilst I will not go into detail, I know that it will be most welcome. In summary, this is an important bill. I know that all areas of the community will benefit from it. I am pleased to support it.</para>

<para>—It is a great pleasure to conclude remarks on the <inline ref="R2291">Family and Community Services and Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (Further 2004 Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline>. This very important measure is further evidence of all the things that the Howard government has been able to achieve through its sound management of the economy and particularly helping those sections of the community most in need. I commend the member for Moncrieff for his remarks. I particularly relate to the comments he made regarding the exemption of the aged care bonds from the means test.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Two important commitments made by the government during the 2004 election campaign will be put into effect through the social security, family assistance and veterans entitlements amendments made by this bill. They are aimed at Australian families with children and older Australians—arguably those Australians most in need. Under the first of these commitments, families will benefit from the introduction of a new family tax benefit part B supplement. The new supplement will be paid on top of the standard rate of FTB part B as a lump sum on income reconciliation after the end of the income year. This mirrors the payment arrangements for the FTB part A supplement introduced last year.</para>
<para>The initial annual amount of the new supplement for 2004-05 will be $302.95. On a daily basis, this comes to 83c. The first payment of the FTB part B supplement will be made at the daily rate for the remaining portion of the income year after commencement of the measure on 1 January 2005. Therefore, the maximum FTB part B supplement for this financial year would be 181 days at 83c per day, or $150.23. The FTB part B supplement will be indexed annually on 1 July according to the annual movements in the consumer price index. However, the first indexation, on 1 July 2005, will be a one-off six-month indexation arrangement to reflect the supplement’s commencement on 1 January 2005.</para>
<para>The bill will make a further amendment to FTB to repeal the existing formula set down for the FTB child income cut-out amount. A child whose income equals or exceeds the cut-out amount cannot attract payment of FTB. The formula is being replaced with a specified amount of $11,233, which represents annual indexation of the existing amount for 2004-05 of $10,948. This new cut-out amount, which will apply from 1 July 2005, will be CPI indexed on 1 July in each following year. The new amount is higher than the amount of $11,218 that would have been applicable from 1 July 2005 under the existing formula.</para>
<para>The second of the election commitments addressed by this bill has been made by the government to give older Australians peace of mind and greater capacity to manage their transition to aged care. The measure is to exempt aged care accommodation bonds from the social security and veterans entitlements means test. If a customer pays an accommodation bond to an aged care facility, the refundable balance of the bond is currently assessed as an asset of the customer under the means test. This may reduce the customer’s payment or rule out payment altogether. These arrangements will significantly improve that situation so that many older Australians will receive more or will receive a payment that was previously unavailable.</para>
<para>Furthermore, customers who pay their accommodation bonds by periodic payment will now be able to rent out their former home without the rental payments affecting their rate of payment. They will also keep the assets test exemption for their former home while ever it is rented out. This advance is in line with the current concessions available to residents in high-level aged care who pay accommodation charges. Customers who will now be eligible for either a social security or veterans entitlements payment because of these changes may be able to have their payment backdated to 1 July 2005. All that will be necessary is for these customers to claim payment from Centrelink or the Department of Veterans’ Affairs before 30 September 2005 or, if they have special circumstances, 30 June 2006. I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para>—The <inline ref="R2281">Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 1) Bill 2005</inline> is the fourth bill we have dealt with that tidies up a host of bungles that have now been discovered in the Higher Education Support Act. This is in addition to the hundreds of government amendments moved when the act was originally passed back in December 2003—all this for an act that has only been in force for about nine weeks. When the original legislation was introduced in September 2003, the Minister for Education, Science and Training tried to convince us that we had to pass it without amendment as a matter of urgency. This is the sort of arrogant and sloppy legislation that unfortunately we can expect to see a lot more of once the government has absolute control over the parliament from July this year.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The bill before us has four main elements: firstly, to meet funding commitments made in the lead-up to and during the election; secondly, to provide the fourth round of technical amendments associated with the implementation of the Higher Education Support Act passed in December 2003; thirdly, to alter the composition of the governing council of the Australian Maritime College so that it complies with the national governance protocols; and, finally, to give access to table B providers to the capital development pool.</para>
<para>I will go through the first part of the legislation. The bill includes $48.7 million over four years for the following initiatives: 100 new student places in radiation therapy, 40 new aged care nursing places, 12 new medical places for James Cook University, infrastructure funds for James Cook University, infrastructure funds for the new Australian Maritime College campus at Point Nepean, infrastructure funding for IT for Charles Darwin University, and national institute funding for the Australian National University.</para>
<para>The Australian Labor Party support all of these worthwhile initiatives, but we note that many of the commitments are to be delivered to universities in highly marginal coalition held seats. This is an issue I will return to later, but I must say I feel a bit sorry for the universities that do not happen to be located in marginal electorates, and it does call into question the way in which this government allocates funds to our universities.</para>
<para>As I indicated, this is the fourth bill to tidy up the mess that the minister presented to this parliament in 2003, and from the look of the program we have even more to come. Every time we look, we are faced with another tidy-up bill to paper over a few more of cracks in what appeared at the time to the minister to be a faultless bill.</para>
<para>The technical amendments before us today deal with the following issues. Firstly, they make clear that compliance with the tuition assurance requirements for higher education providers is ongoing, not only at the point of approval. Secondly, they alter the minister’s powers to exempt higher education providers from the tuition assurance scheme to allow conditions to be placed on the exemption. Thirdly, they clarify the conditions under which the Howard government’s seven-year learning limit must be recredited and the HECS-HELP loan recredited should a provider be unable to offer a unit in which a student is enrolled. Labor will support all of those amendments.</para>
<para>The most significant policy issue in the bill is the proposal to give table B providers access to the $43 million a year capital development pool for university infrastructure. Since general capital allocations were rolled into operating grants for universities more than a decade ago, this is now the only capital funding to universities over which the Commonwealth has discretion. The current impact of this section of the bill would be to give Bond University, the University of Notre Dame and Melbourne College of Divinity the ability to apply for grants under the capital development pool. However, this list could grow as additional providers are added to table B in the future.</para>
<para>While we will not be opposing this provision, the opposition do have a number of concerns about the lack of transparency and about the way in which this proposal has been introduced. It is important to note at this stage that extending the number of institutions that will be eligible to access the fund without an increase in the size of the fund amounts to a real cut in funding for what is already pretty dilapidated university infrastructure.</para>
<para>Like many of my colleagues, I am aware that our universities have countless examples of need for capital development to either expand or replace existing infrastructure. The government in this legislation is cutting the finite pie into a larger number of pieces. Of course, the size of each piece will inevitably get smaller. If the government is serious about providing support where it has not previously done so, it would be good if the government decided to make available increased money as it increases the number of institutions that can apply.</para>
<para>It is also worth noting that there was absolutely no prior warning and no public discussion of this initiative prior to the bill’s introduction to the House just three weeks ago. There was certainly no mention of it before the election and there has been almost no explanation of the rationale for the change, just a pretty bland statement of the outcome. There has been no explanation of where this proposal might sit within the government’s broader ideas being floated by the minister at the moment about which higher education institutions are going to be eligible for public subsidies. These are very significant changes that the minister is floating and, as I say, it would be useful to know where this change fits within his thinking.</para>
<para>There has been absolutely no discussion about whether this proposal will be used as a precedent to extend funding under more significant programs. There has been no comment on whether the government has similar plans to extend access to other funds to the much more numerous higher education providers outside table B. So we are certainly very keen to hear the government’s response to these issues and get a much more detailed rationale from the government to inform consideration by the parliament. I look forward to the minister’s response to our concerns when he sums up and to further exploration of his response when the bill reaches the Senate, but in the end we will not be standing in the way of the change.</para>
<para>As I said, there was no mention of this proposal to expand the number of institutions eligible for the capital development pool before the election—absolutely no mention at all. You might ask how the minister could have told us about it during the election campaign because he did not actually release a higher education policy. Of all the things we have heard about from the minister, all the kites that have been flown, not one of them was talked about before the election. Maybe it was something that was out of the minister’s control. We certainly had the impression that the government wanted to talk about anything but the changes that it has now foisted upon our universities and, more particularly, foisted upon students and their families. Students and families are by no means impressed with the government’s continuing attempts to expand the number of full fee paying places at our universities. Students and parents do not support the increases in HECS that have now impacted on so many students around the country.</para>
<para>Maybe it is no surprise that we had a government that was not prepared to talk about higher education before the election, but it is pretty extraordinary that immediately after the election we have a minister who, out in the media, is floating ideas all the time but who made no effort to discuss those with the Australian people before the election. Even if the government had decided to release a policy before the election, you would have to wonder whether anyone would have believed what it said, because the government when it comes to higher education promises before elections certainly has a bit of a track record of giving up on those promises pretty soon after.</para>
<para>I remember the now Leader in the Senate promising before the 1996 election that a Howard government would not introduce full fees for Australian undergraduates. One had only to wait until August, following the election in March, for that promise to be ignored—it did not take long at all. The government, of course, decided they would introduce full fees for Australian undergraduates, and now we have fees of up to $210,000 at one university. Students can now buy their way into university, ahead of students with better marks, but of course only if you have these massive sums of money—$100,000, $150,000, $200,000—outrageous sums of money, whereby students are jumping the queue and buying a place at university.</para>
<para>The government, as I said, have got form. Once again, in 2001, they went to the electorate and promised they would not increase the proportion of full fee paying students. That promise was not worth much. By 2003, the same minister that we have now was announcing his intention to lift the number of full fee payers by increasing the proportion of courses that can be taken up by full fee payers to 50 per cent. This was pulled back somewhat in the Senate to 35 per cent, but we will have to see how long that lasts once the government has absolute control over the parliament from July this year.</para>
<para>We also should not forget that the minister told us in the parliament that the deregulation he was pushing through when he introduced the last round of changes to higher education would not mean huge HECS hikes. He actually had the audacity to say to the parliament:</para>
<quote>
<para>What that means in real terms is that the HECS charge for most courses in most universities will not change at all.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Nothing could be further from the truth, as I am sure you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker. It did not last. Within a year, the vast majority of universities had put their fees up for all possible courses, and most of them by the maximum allowed under the legislation. You would have to say, when it comes to higher education, the government’s track record of saying one thing before an election and then doing something completely different is pretty strong. They did not say anything about this clause in the bill before the election; they have just dreamt it up since the election. They did not bother talking to the public about it, and here we have it in a piece of legislation.</para>
<para>The other serious concerns that we have about the impact of the government’s changes on higher education particularly go to what is happening to the number of places in our universities. Last year, under this government, the number of HECS students actually fell by more than 8,000 while the number of full fee paying places increased by 2,500. What an extraordinary record for a government. The government is very fond of claiming that full fee paying students do not displace a single HECS student.</para>

<para>—I rise today to acknowledge the women in my electorate and around the country who every day break down barriers and overcome obstacles to build full lives for themselves and their families, women who rise through the ranks, women who break into new career paths for women, women who find ways to mix family with career and women who choose to stay at home and cope with the financial penalties that arise from that choice—the ordinary and extraordinary women who, at a time of changing roles for men and women, work every day to find ways to fashion lives of their own choosing.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>International Women’s Day, 8 March, is just over 30 years old, but the fight by women for women is much, much older than that. Mary Wollstonecraft, who wrote <inline font-style="italic">A Vindication of the Rights of Women</inline> in 1792, said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I do not wish women to have power over men; but over themselves.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">She was years, perhaps centuries, ahead of her time, but today her words are absolutely appropriate. Women all around the country and women that I meet every day want and expect power over their own lives, yet we find on a daily basis that there are barriers for women seeking to exercise that power—barriers that governments have the capacity to overcome.</para>
<para>A couple of months ago I met a woman in Rydalmere who had an eight-month-old child. She had put her child on the waiting list at the local child-care centre when she was still pregnant. She did not have a car; she needed to use the local centre. When the child was eight months old, she planned on going back to work, so she started looking for work. She found work that would start two months after that. A month before she was due to start work, the local child-care centre phoned and offered her a place for her child. At that stage, because she had not started work, she could not afford the fees, so she said, ‘Can I delay it for a month?’ The child-care centre said, ‘No, we have to give the place away.’ A month later, when she tried to start work, she could not find child care for her child. When she had child care she could not afford it; when she could afford it she did not have child care. So this is a woman who remained out of the work force and is still out of the work force while she tries to find a child-care place and a job which appears in the same week.</para>
<para>I met another woman raising three children on her own who was desperate to go back to work and had the skills to go back to work, but because of the way the family payments and the tax system are structured the day she went back to work she was worse off. If she could have afforded to have been worse off, she would have gone back to work, but she simply could not afford it. So there was a woman with the skill and the will to work who was trapped by her circumstances.</para>
<para>When I meet with businesswomen I am astonished at how often a group of quite senior businesswomen will sit around talking about the difficulties they have with child care. Even given the opportunity to talk about business, when meeting with senior business figures their main priority is how difficult they find it to balance their careers with child care. When I go to a child-care centre expecting to talk about child care, I am amazed at how often I find myself talking to women about how difficult they find it to find work. So it does not matter whether you are talking to women without work or women with work, the issue remains the same: it is about ways to find a balance between children and career.</para>
<para>It also is apparent that women are the first to suffer from any downturn in conditions—a downturn in the economy or in working conditions. When the labour force is increasingly casualised, it is women who are the first into the ranks of casual labour. It is women who first suffer that lack of security and income. When we do not provide appropriately for the aged, it is women who drop out of the work force to care for their parents first. It is women who bear the burden of downturns. But, as I said earlier, Mary Wollstonecraft, well ahead of her time, got it absolutely right. I know from my conversations with many women that they expect us to get it right. They expect us in this House to make it possible for them to do what they know they need to do with their lives, which is to build lives that suit them. Whether they choose to stay home or go back to work, whether they choose to go back full time or part time, whether they choose a casual work lifestyle or a part-time work lifestyle, they expect us to take the barriers down so that they can actually make their own choices and build their own lives.</para>

<para>—I rise in the House today to congratulate the Right Reverend David Chislett SSC, the Rector of All Saints Anglican Church, Brisbane, on his consecration as a bishop in the Church of God on 16 February 2005 at the Parish Church of the Good Shepherd, Rosemont, Philadelphia, in the United States of America. I know Bishop Chislett very well. I have attended All Saints Wickham Terrace for years, first when I was a student at secondary school. I am a former altar server, parish councillor and synodsperson.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Bishop Chislett was consecrated to serve the traditional Anglicans in this country and Forward in Faith Australia who are dismayed at the heterodox views of many of the Anglican bishops in this country. Bishop Chislett will work with the Traditional Anglican Communion to bring orthodox Anglicanism to a new future. The chief consecrator was Archbishop John Hepworth, the Australian Primate of the Traditional Anglican Communion, and there were a number of co-consecrators, including the Anglican Bishop of the Murray, the Right Reverend Ross Davies, and the Anglican Bishop of Ruvuma in Tanzania, Bishop Kapinga. It is important to recognise that the Anglican Church over the years has always claimed to be part of the One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, and in fact the threefold order of ministry is the same as in the great communions of the West and the East—that is, the Roman Catholic Church and the Churches of Eastern Orthodoxy.</para>
<para>I am indebted to the Bishop of the Murray, who participated in the consecration, for some of the remarks I am about to make. I was always taught that the Anglican Church is the Catholic Church of England but, regrettably, in 1992 the Church of England broke with Catholic order when it legislated to allow for women to be ordained to the apostolic ministry of the priesthood. In the same year the Anglican Church of Australia enacted similar legislation. Traditional Anglicans would consider this to be a breach of Catholic tradition and Catholic order, and in fact it does present a situation in the Anglican Communion today in which we have impaired communion and where many bishops and people feel unable to be totally in communion with all in the Canterbury Anglican Communion. In England when this occurred in 1992 there was a provision made for provincial episcopal visitors, and a number of ‘flying bishops’ were appointed to minister to those congregations that were not able to accept the ministry of their bishop who had ordained women, thereby leaving the Catholic faith.</para>
<para>In the Australian spirit of a fair go it is not unreasonable that the Anglican Church in Australia should have made a similar provision for those Anglicans who, in all conscientiousness, were unable to accept the departure from Catholic order. I have observed the ministry of Bishop Chislett at All Saints Wickham Terrace. I have seen him build a congregation which was quite small into one that every Sunday now has more communicants at high mass than St Johns Anglican Cathedral in Brisbane. He has pastoral gifts, principles, integrity and is someone who should be held up as a role model for all Anglican clergy. Bishop Chislett will continue as the Rector of All Saints Wickham Terrace while carrying out his new episcopal ministry on behalf of traditional Anglicans in this country and Forward in Faith Australia. He will also work as part of the Traditional Anglican Communion and the Anglican Catholic Church in Australia.</para>
<para>I commend Bishop Ross Davies for his courage in participating in this consecration, along with the other bishops. Bishop Chislett is an example to all of us. He is an outstanding pastor and for 10 years has served conscientiously as the Rector of All Saints Wickham Terrace and he is a person who will enhance the future of Anglicanism in this country. Bishop Chislett understands the Anglican Church is the English expression of the Catholic faith. He is quite uncompromising and highly principled. He is a person I want to salute in the federal parliament as a person who should enjoy the admiration of all of us.</para>

<para>—I am very proud to rise and speak on behalf of the women of Richmond to mark International Women’s Day. In talking to many women across my electorate I find that opportunity is a common theme of our discussions. Women want the opportunity to further their education, to balance work and family commitments and to access decent health care when they need it and when their families need it. Of course, all of this is made a lot easier when women live in a safe and secure environment. Late last year I met with the women who run the Tweed Shire Women’s Service. They provide support, counselling and a safe haven for women who have been the victims of domestic violence. When I was a police officer, the sad truth was that I spent a great deal of my time attending domestic violence situations. In my experience, when women live in a safe and supportive environment it is only then that they can find real opportunities.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Let me turn to another issue that, because of this government’s complacency, is limiting opportunities for women. Across my electorate there is a shortage of child-care places. We are the second fastest growing region in the country, and I speak to families every week that are waiting to get their children into child care. For too long child care has been underfunded and, on top of this, it is becoming increasingly unaffordable for working families. In another broken promise to families in my electorate, the Howard government has reneged on its pledge to pay a 30 per cent tax rebate on child care this year. Now, families will be forced to wait until July 2006. The Prime Minister is so out of touch with ordinary working families that he has failed to deliver this much-needed relief. This government has indeed become so complacent that it no longer believes it should keep its promises to Australian families.</para>
<para>Parents are battling to get their babies and toddlers into long day care and family day care, and when those kids go on to school there is a shortage of available vacation and after school care. I recently visited a local child-care facility that provides after school care and vacation care. The manager of the centre told me she was literally overrun with parents wanting to put their children into vacation care. She simply could not cater to them and had to turn so many of them away. This often means that working families have to find alternatives that simply do not exist. One solution is to provide more funding and therefore more child-care places. Child care has been neglected; it is as simple as that.</para>
<para>As a mother of two young children, Alexandra, who is 6, and Joe, who is 5, I know that the reality is that a lack of child care limits opportunities for women. In 2005 women should not have to choose between continuing their career or education and having a family. If they choose to stay at home with their families, they should be able to do so without feeling financial pressure to go back to work straightaway. But the government’s broken promise has only added to that pressure.</para>
<para>These are not just women’s issues; they are also community issues. Women make up more than half the population. It stands to reason that issues affecting us affect the entire community. It is unfortunate that women are paying the price for this government’s complacency. I also often speak to many elderly women who have so much difficulty in accessing health care, decent dental care and home care, and they have difficulty in finding places in aged care centres as well. There is a whole range of issues in relation to women that are so important, and I have been very proud to stand here today and speak on behalf of the women of Richmond.</para>

<para>—I rise to speak about the effects of truck traffic on residents of the Bonner electorate. In particular, I wish to draw attention to a notorious section of the national freight route known as the Brisbane urban corridor, the BUC. To residents of my electorate the BUC is more commonly known as the Mount Gravatt-Capalaba Road. This is not a new issue. It first surfaced in the early 1990s and it has continued to be of great concern to the local residents ever since.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is no coincidence that I have chosen this to be the first matter that I have raised in the House. This issue is as important to me as it is to my constituents. The Brisbane urban corridor cuts across Brisbane’s southern suburbs and links the Ipswich Motorway to the Gateway Motorway. This 11-kilometre corridor includes Mount Gravatt-Capalaba Road, Kessels Road, Riawena Road and Granard Road. It is a road corridor that was clearly not designed to carry the traffic it now carries. Each day up to 50,000 vehicles travel on this route. Although there are many different users of the BUC, there is no doubt that truck traffic has the greatest impact on the surrounding suburbs.</para>
<para>In the Bonner electorate, residents of suburbs like Wishart, Upper Mount Gravatt, Mansfield and Eight Mile Plains have to live with the effects of this traffic every day. It has a major impact on their quality of life. This is a fact that nobody disputes. Elected representatives from all levels of government and from both major political parties are united in their recognition that truck traffic on the BUC is a serious problem. In particular, I wish to acknowledge the efforts of my colleagues the honourable member for Moreton, Mr Gary Hardgrave, and the councillor for Wishart, Mr Graham Quirk, who have fought tirelessly for around a decade to highlight the need for action on this issue.</para>
<para>In 2002 the Howard government demonstrated their commitment to local residents by funding a major study aimed at finding solutions to the problems on the BUC. This study received feedback from close to 2,000 people, and more than 20 separate community meetings were held during the process. The results of this study confirmed what residents already knew: truck traffic was a problem that impacted on their daily lives in a major way. One local family who participated in the study commented, ‘Traffic, pollution and trucks make our life miserable.’ Although this is the comment of just a single family, I know that it reflects the feelings of thousands of people living along the BUC.</para>
<para>The outcome of this planning study was a series of recommendations aimed at improving traffic conditions and reducing the amount of heavy vehicle traffic on the BUC. I am pleased to report that two of the most important recommendations to come out of the study are being implemented as I speak. Starting on 28 February, a 12-month trial commenced to allow trucks to travel toll free at night on the Gateway Motorway extension and the Logan Motorway. These toll roads are the major alternative routes to the BUC. The study found that many truckies were using the BUC to avoid the motorway tolls. This trial is aimed at getting non-local and non-essential truck traffic off the BUC when residents are trying to sleep.</para>
<para>In addition to this trial, new number plate recognition cameras have been installed on Mount Gravatt-Capalaba Road to monitor traffic. These cameras will help us to identify overloaded trucks, oversized trucks, speeding trucks, noisy trucks and polluting trucks. The cameras will also help us to determine the effectiveness of the toll-free trial. In the short time since the trial started I have already received some very encouraging feedback. One Upper Mount Gravatt resident told me that even after just four nights he had noticed a dramatic reduction in traffic noise and truck traffic. I have had similar feedback from other residents. While we still have a long way to go, I am delighted that we have now taken the first crucial steps towards achieving better outcomes for residents living along the BUC. I look forward to working with local residents and my federal and state colleagues to ensure that we continue to make progress over the coming months and years.</para>

<para>—Today, 8 March 2005, women in this place, in our home towns, across this nation and throughout the world celebrate International Women’s Day. I pay tribute and my respects to Indigenous women around the country who are still struggling for equality and justice in the areas of health, education and employment. I also pay tribute to the members of the Newcastle branch of the Union of Australian Women.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>All of us have older women in our electorates who were in the midst of the major struggles to try to achieve justice and equity for themselves and their generation but more particularly for their daughters and their granddaughters. These are the women of the Save Our Sons campaign, who protested against Australia’s involvement in the Vietnam War, and they are still actively protesting against violence in all forms including Australia’s involvement in Iraq. Their grandmothers fought for the right to vote for women; they fought against discrimination against women and for free and accessible education and equal wages for women. Unfortunately, today women still lag far behind men in wages, are still under represented in our parliaments and do not sit in equal numbers as CEOs or executive officers of our major companies. Women still carry the greater responsibility for child rearing, housework and caring for elderly parents—to name but a few.</para>
<para>Another major struggle of our grandmothers and mothers was, and is, that relating to women’s reproductive rights and women’s rights to control their own fertility. Unfortunately, the Australian public has been once again assailed with the abortion debate. Who raised and who is leading the current debate about reproductive rights in this country? Some conservatives and some church leaders, led by none other than Australia’s self-appointed morals crusader, the Minister for Health and Ageing. Be afraid; be very afraid. We have here a minister for health in a conservative government who is vehemently opposed to women having control of their own fertility and reproductive rights.</para>
<para>Women’s access to safe, legal abortion is a major public health issue. Mortality from abortions has declined since 1971, when many states changed their legislation to provide some protection for abortion providers. Prior to 1971, abortion was a major cause of death related to pregnancy, with an average of 25 per cent of maternal deaths being attributed to abortion. Since 1971 deaths associated with abortion are rare. The World Health Organisation estimates that globally 19 million unsafe abortions take place each year and that 68,000 women die as a consequence of this. The majority of unsafe abortions occur in developing countries where unsafe abortions are characterised by unskilled or undertrained practitioners, unsanitary facilities, a lack of post-abortion care and hazardous techniques. The WHO characterises unsafe abortion as one of the neglected public health problems in developing countries.</para>
<para>Unwanted and unplanned pregnancy is linked to a range of social, cultural, economic and psychological factors. Of course, we know there are no simple solutions that will reduce the rate of abortions—and taking Medicare funding from the procedure is not the very least of them. This so-called solution, promoted by anti-abortionists, would only serve to deny access to abortions for poor and rural women, therefore allowing only wealthy women to terminate unplanned or unwanted pregnancies.</para>
<para>There is evidence which indicates that comprehensive sex education and access to contraception are effective in lowering the rates of pregnancy, particularly amongst young women. Comprehensive sex education does provide young people with more support and guidance to delay their first sexual intercourse and develop a healthy attitude towards sex and sexuality. There is no evidence that abstinence-only programs successfully delay the onset of sexual intercourse. In fact, abstinence-only programs undermine the use of contraceptives once young people become sexually active.</para>
<para>Abortion is the only widely practiced medical procedure that is criminalised in this country. The termination of pregnancy is contained under the Criminal Law in every state and territory except the ACT. Recent data from the Australian Survey of Social Attitudes show that 81.2 per cent of Australians, regardless of gender or religion, agree that women should have the right to choose an abortion. Some 42.4 per cent of Australians strongly agree and 38.8 per cent agree that women should have the right to choose an abortion. Only nine per cent of Australians either disagree or strongly disagree that women should have the right to choose an abortion.</para>
<para>I conclude by reminding the House of Labor’s platform concerning reproductive rights. It reads:</para>

</talker>
<para>—During the recent election campaign and in my first speech in this House, I indicated that I would act without fear or favour on behalf of the residents of Hasluck. There is considerable concern amongst constituents and residents in my electorate about the proposal to build a brickworks on Commonwealth land which is currently leased by the Westralia Airports Corporation and is immediately adjacent to the Perth airport. I understand that a couple of weeks ago a notice, effective from 14 February, was served on the West Aviat Golf Club on Kalamunda Road, South Guildford, by the Westralia Airports Corporation Pty Ltd. It gave the West Aviat Golf Club only 30 days—just one month—to vacate the property, with all that that entails. This is allegedly so that the land can be used to build a brickworks. I find it rather amazing that a group of people can be treated so harshly by any organisation. These constituents and residents have lived in the area for a long time and have leased the golf course area since 1984 for that particular purpose. They have put their own blood, sweat and tears into creating this golf course at their own expense and through their own efforts. They have created an excellent recreational area for use by residents.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I have had representations on these issues from councillors of the City of Swan, from Kalamunda Shire and from representatives of local community associations from High Wycombe, Hazelmere and Rose Hill expressing concerns about health, safety and the environment, and the impacts that these potential arrangements will have on their amenity.</para>
<para>I have received many emails and have spoken with many residents about their concerns. Their concerns about the proposed development of the brickworks on the site include the lack of a consultative planning process; the potential environmental impacts on adjacent residential areas, lakes and wetlands; and the safety to aircraft from the heat emitted from the chimney stacks of the proposed brickworks and from the nearby asphalt plant. Importantly, they are concerned about their health and the air quality resulting from the emissions. In addition, on land adjacent to this area there is a waste material dump site, previously used as a building waste recycling operation. It is alleged that asbestos is contained in this waste dump, and they are concerned about the potential threat and hazard of that.</para>
<para>I would like to read from some of the emails I have received:</para>
<quote>
<para>We appeal to you, as a representative of the federal government, to block the moves being made at present to build another brickworks in the Midland environs, of which Hazelmere forms a part, on the West Aviat Golf Club, which club members have constructed with their own hands and, out of their own toil and labour, have maintained a beautiful landscaped area, incorporating two man-made lakes, which are visited by birds of many varieties.</para>
<para>Please give this appeal your urgent consideration and try to get your colleague the Hon. John Anderson to rethink the matter and get WAC to leave us on the land which we have invested so much in by way of money, blood, sweat and frustration only to have it taken away from us in just four weeks.</para>
<para>According to the honour book, over 6,000 members of the public used the course last year. In 1984 the land was leased to Transport Australia institute, the parent body of the West Aviat Golf Club, which was built and maintained by the members on a purely voluntary basis and still is.</para>
<para>The site is marked on the airport master plan as precinct 3 and was previously zoned as recreation and sport. It was vested by the federal government of the day back in the 1940s and is used as a camp for country people to send their kids to today.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I assure the residents and my constituents in Hasluck that I will work as hard as I possibly can to achieve the best possible outcome for our community in this matter. I have made representations to the appropriate minister and will pursue those issues on their behalf. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—It is my great pleasure to be here to make some comments about some issues relating to my electorate, as the debate on the <inline ref="R2279">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2004-2005</inline> and related bills allows me to do. I would like to speak about several organisations in my electorate which deal with children and which I have had some experience with over the years. One is a school which deals with kids who have severe behavioural and other difficulties and are between years 7 and 10 in secondary college. Another is a school which deals with primary-age kids with real problems as part of an overall network called the Child and Family Care Network.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">First I will talk about a school in my electorate called Berengarra. Berengarra School is part of the local community and does an incredible job with kids in years 7 to 10 who have real problems. About four years ago, I was very pleased to go to the 25th anniversary of Berengarra. I was recently down there again talking to the principal and others about potential relocation plans that they are looking at, and talking about some of the work that they have done. As I mentioned earlier, it is a school which deals with kids who have real problems. I have some details about that which go back to information provided by the school, which I would like to inform the House of. It reads:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Increasingly employers, parents and many teachers are expressing concern about the nature and outcomes of our schooling system. This concern is not just about academic outcomes; it is also about the increasing number of kids attending mainstream schools whose behaviour is outwardly disruptive or quietly self detrimental.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Mainstream teachers are not trained to deal with kids that have severe behavioural problems and the stress of trying to has often meant that these students are excluded from school. On the other hand the many anxious or depressed students who do not attract attention, suffer silently until attempts at self-harm bring them to notice.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">There is one school, which, due to a lack of funding, is generally unknown even amongst mainstream schools. The schools who do know about Berengarra often have the wrong view about how it functions and what types of children it accepts.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">There is one general perception, however, that is absolutely correct, and that is, that Berengarra provides an effective place for training kids who are in an immense amount of pain.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Against all odds, the teachers at Berengarra have developed a unique and cutting edge environment in which they tackle the problems of truancy or school refusal, early leavers, behavioural dysfunction and academic failure.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">This School is a model of best practice, which mostly goes unheralded, except by the many students and families whose lives have been turned around by their association with the talented group of teachers that make up Berengarra.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Berengarra is a small independent school, which has been working with some of the most difficult kids in this state for the last 25 years. The kids who are angry, depressed and anxious and have no chance at succeeding in regular schools.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">How do they do it?</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">It has nothing to do with high fees or expensive resources. In fact, Berengarra struggles financially while it maintains a strong commitment to keeping fees at a minimum, assisting low income families who are often the most in need.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">A major focus is on developing self knowledge and self management strategies.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The objective of developing academic skills is always predicated on the acquisition of socially acceptable behaviours and responses. What Berengarra does differently is to set realistic achievable goals for each student, on the understanding that overcoming the accumulated negative attitudes towards teachers and learning, requires time, patience and courage from the students, along with extraordinary attributes from the teachers.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Berengarra staff work with students in classes of 10 or 11 boys and girls. Inevitably the boys outnumber the girls 10 to 1. What may work well with one student may have the reverse effect on another and of course what works well with boys rarely works with the girls.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Statistics show that 90% of students are inclined to regularly seek attention inappropriately, even in a small group situation and 86% cannot cope with any task and become extremely frustrated and no matter how much they need it, 28% refuse help when offered.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The key to Berengarra’s success is its guiding philosophy which determines staff selection and the development of curriculum that involves the basics, such as English, Maths, and, practical and creative subjects which include a range of electives such as farm work and rock climbing.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">One example of this is the breeding program of hens and roosters that are exhibited each year at the Royal Melbourne Show. In maths the livestock is weighed and measured and the students are encouraged to handle the animals with care.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Science often involves flight, such as building and launching rockets which allows for a great release of energy, in a positive way. As well as being fun.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The students are challenged and engaged while dealing with their specific areas of dysfunction through cognitive behavioural strategies. All students receive individualised attention, which, is the prime ingredient in developing generic and specific skills.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Everyone at Berengarra believes in the worth of the students, they understand and respect students who often covert desire to achieve. Through experience, staff know that even the most resistant kids will revel in small successes and respond positively to teachers who give them a chance to feel good through achieving what is meaningful to them.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Often we do not understand the nature of the problems that some of these kids have and the sorts of issues that are therefore faced by them, their families and their teachers. We in the community often dismiss them as being troublesome kids that you wish were not in the same class as your kid. That is quite understandable. It is a feeling I have had with my own children.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I have some statistics which relate to the sorts of students Berengarra has been seeing. The statistics state:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">All Berengarra students have seen or are seeing a psychiatrist or psychologist, 59% are receiving more intensive guidance.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">37% of Berengarra students are hyperactive or have been diagnosed with ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder).</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">54% have notable learning disabilities and or difficulties, many kids require specially prepared work and one-to-one assistance.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">74% of students have problems with work presentation and 87% can’t meet deadlines and therefore fail to cope at mainstream schools.</para>

<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">These are the typical characteristics of any given group, Berengarra class sizes consists of 10 to 11 students. The most common behaviour that becomes unacceptable in mainstream schools being the constant excessive bad language.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The programs offered at Berengarra are specifically designed to address these needs and are continually under review.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The progress of Berengarras body of students is monitored daily and individuals are usually reviewed once a week, although at times daily, even hourly progress reviews are required.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The review system allows teachers to exercise a tailored approach to each student’s developmental needs, accommodating the many changes students make as they work towards returning to regular schools or TAFE.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">That is what it is all about. It is about getting them back into the mainstream system.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Students generally spend one to two years at Berengarra and are assessed on an ongoing basis to find out the appropriate direction for them when they move on. The intention is to basically re-establish self-esteem, try to give them the social skills to be able to handle themselves in a normal school environment and a normal community environment and the confidence to better understand what they are doing. The academic program is designed to minimise disruption caused to students from being taken out of mainstream schools and gives them the best possible opportunity to go further outside that environment.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Berengarra takes a very tough section of the student community and gives them an opportunity to get back into a situation where they can be solid students and solid members of the community. It is work that is done on a daily basis, and I would like to congratulate everyone at the school for the work they have done. It was good to catch up with Mark Heuston, the principal, and to talk to him about the issues that are being faced. I would certainly like to mention Ian Watson, who was the principal there for some years. He was the principal when I visited the school some time ago for its 25th anniversary. He has since retired, I understand, but is still involved with the school on a more voluntary basis. I wish him all the best.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Berengarra is located on the site of the Child and Family Care Network, which I mentioned earlier. The Child and Family Care Network is an excellent organisation that services the Monash area. Since I became the member for Bruce I have had dealings with that organisation on a range of issues and programs. It does work right across age groups. I can remember at earlier times attending programs funded by government for the training of young adults, and a range of other courses over various years, where I have gone along to present awards and otherwise take part in the activities at the school. In fact, I think that Kim Beazley attended as opposition leader at the Child and Family Care Network during the 1998 election campaign, when we launched our youth policy there. It is a non-political organisation. Its whole basic reason for being is to deal with the needs of young people and provide them with opportunities. It has done a great job over a long time now. It descended from the Burwood Boys Home. I understand that it now has a history of around 100 years of caring for children and families.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Child and Family Care Network take a holistic approach. They see that you cannot look at these things in isolation and they work to try to ensure that they are providing services that fit the needs of the people they are seeking to serve. One particular aspect of what they do at the Child and Family Care Network involves the Cheshire Education Centre, a school that deals with primary school aged kids who have problems. Beyond that they are doing a bit of a restructure at the moment and are developing, establishing and funding a kids centre, which will be providing a range of services at a purpose built facility. I was happy to have a look at some of the construction work just the other day. I think that is going to be providing an innovative and successful service, particularly for kids in the zero to six age group, a time that more people have become aware of as being crucial to the development of the adults that they later become. I wish them all the very best with the kids centre. It sounds like a very interesting and exciting project. I may talk about that later if I have a bit more time.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I would like to talk a bit more about the Cheshire school, which I mentioned a bit earlier. The Cheshire school is a program of the Victorian based Child and Family Care Network, which provides a 12-month intervention program for primary age students with social, emotional and/or learning difficulties who are unable to be maintained within a mainstream school. So it is a younger age group than we were talking about with Berengarra. They have found that the cycle of failure experienced by many of Cheshire’s students leads to significant behavioural, social and emotional difficulties at home and at school. School life is a daily battle for their students, and they quickly learn to ‘act out’ or withdraw to shift the attention away from their underlying difficulties.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Students at Cheshire are provided with a unique 12-month time out from mainstream schools to develop their self-esteem, resiliency and confidence in a safe and supportive environment. At the end of their time at Cheshire the students are successfully transitioned into a mainstream setting. Cheshire currently caters for 16 students on a full-time basis, with a new intake of students each term. In line with the Child and Family Care Network’s focus on early intervention, the Cheshire school is in its final stages of building a classroom to cater for eight more students who have been deemed not ready for school at kindergarten prep level. With the generous support of the Brockoff Foundation and Rotary, this new classroom has been designed to cater for younger children. In fact, they have now completed that. I inspected it the other day, and it certainly was an impressive facility. A lot of work was being done with some very difficult kids. While I was there I did a flag presentation and the kids came out and helped me. It was great to see them. It clearly showed that the work that the teachers were doing with them was having an impact. The nature of the problems that these kids have are heart wrenching and terrible, but I also have some testimonies from some of the students about why they came to the school. I think they are quite touching and give you a bit of an idea of the way that they see the world. They are unattributed, so I can use them—I checked that with the school. I will read a couple to give you a bit of an idea of the sorts of situations these kids come from:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I came to Cheshire because I was bullying people. I used to kick big kids because I wanted to and they were not allowed to kick me back. I came to learn how to make friends and be nice to people. I have to learn how to do my school work. Sometimes I’m nice to people. I still kick sometimes at home but not at school anymore. I’m concentrating and I do my work better. My numbers are better. My spelling is better and I’m getting good at reading. I get to do the fun things because I’m good here. Sometimes I miss out if I’m not good. When I go to my new school I have to be good and work hard.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">At kinder I hurt kids. I pushed them and I kicked them. One kid at kinder was my friend. I didn’t hurt him I just played with him. At Cheshire I be friends with people. I don’t hurt people. Sometimes I throw sand and I get into trouble. I can draw kittens and cats and dogs and people. I can dance and sing beautiful. I can skip with a red skipping rope. When I am a good boy at school I get to do something special. When I go to my other school I will still be good but I was naughty at Kinder.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">That is from a grade 4 boy.</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I came to Cheshire because I was having problems making friends and I was bossy. I was sad a lot and people didn’t want to play with me. I was scared of making new friends and felt very lonely. I have new friends now and they like me.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">That is from a grade 5 girl.</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I was real bad. I would swear, throw things, stand on tables and I’d punch the teacher, run up and down the corridor, go up onto the roof and yell real hard so it would go through to the other classrooms. The teachers would give me a suspension or would take me somewhere to calm down. The last time I went on the roof and jumped down the school kicked me out. I had to stay home for 9 months. Some people got the idea for me to come to Cheshire. Mum said I had to be good or I couldn’t go I went to Cheshire for a look around and I reckoned it was quite nice, I liked the small classroom because I could get help for my work. People had time for me. I changed my reading, my times tables and all my work things. My behaviour has change. Now people help me, I am nice, I don’t swear, I don’t be mean or hurt people. I feel happy now, I’ve even got friends. I like how I am now.</para>

If it’s really bad you miss excursions. I sit on the chair nicely and I do my work. I like writing stories best and learning about bugs.

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">That is from a grade 2 boy aged 8.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This booklet is full of testimonies from kids facing different situations but basically, at the end of the day, trying to grow up, which is always a difficult thing. What you see when you read through these stories is quite touching. It goes to the essence of what sorts of kids sometimes come out of our school systems and what sorts of kids sometimes are produced within family environments, and why it is important not to just take a view that they are not retrievable. The fact is that schools like Cheshire, for kids that age, and schools like Berengarra, for kids at a later age, do a lot of incredibly important work trying to deal with the problems that these kids have created and have had created for them.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">When you look to the future of a country it has often been said that we measure the level of civilisation by how we treat our elderly, on the one hand, and how we treat our children, on the other. When you look to the future and to what can be done, the point has also been made, and it is an important economic point, that the sort of money that gets spent on dealing with early childhood development issues is an investment in the country’s future, not only because of the individuals’ lives that it can save and the circumstances of the families and communities that it can improve but also because of what it does for the future of the country. The savings that can be made in the future by investments at early ages to deal with those problems can be phenomenal. Those savings come by dealing with early identification of problems and illnesses, by—hopefully—preventing criminality at a later age, by reducing incarceration and prison time and by reducing policing costs.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There is a lot that can be saved if governments look to the future by dealing with the issues that we face with our young people. Schools and organisations like the Child and Family Care Network in Berengarra do a lot of important work. They do not get recognised enough. I am very pleased to be here today as their local member to say a little about what they have done. To all those involved with those organisations I would like to say congratulations on a job very well done.</para>

<para>—I am pleased to support the <inline ref="R2279">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2004-2005</inline> and cognate bills, which are an example of the ongoing excellent economic management of the Howard government. They are important bills to go through this parliament so that government, the Public Service and other instrumentalities can continue to do good work on behalf of the people of Australia. That strong economic management by the Howard government has certainly been reflected in the electorate of Eden-Monaro over the last few years, where we have seen quite strong growth in most parts of the electorate.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Eden-Monaro has seen growth through additional people moving into the area. We have very strongly growing towns. Often it is an easy throwaway line these days to say that numbers in rural Australia are reducing. Sure, there are towns that unfortunately are reducing. But there is also very strong growth in many of the regional towns and not so big towns, which is certainly occurring across the electorate of Eden-Monaro.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There is growth not only in population but also in economic activity. As a consequence, there is growth in numbers of people in work and therefore a reduction in the number of people out of work. In fact, last year in Eden-Monaro the unemployment rate dropped to below five per cent. It is an unemployment rate less than the national average, which was an incredible achievement. You do not have to go back too many years to find unemployment substantially higher. In parts of the electorate it was not only in double figures but up around 20 per cent. Now all parts of the electorate are well below that double figure mark and across the electorate it fell below five per cent, which is extremely encouraging.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As we have heard in some of the debate that has gone on in recent days, that good work produces another problem: a shortage of labour and a shortage of certain trades and other skills. It certainly was not a problem 10 to 15 years ago, when so many of those people were unfortunately unemployed. But, because unemployment has plummeted, all those people are in work and that puts pressure on the labour market. It is a problem, I think, we would rather have than the reverse, which was there particularly in the early nineties.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Quite a number of things are happening to meet those challenges. One of the things that was announced in the election campaign last year was the establishment of the Australian technical colleges. One of those will be established in Queanbeyan. It has been very encouraging to see the community within Queanbeyan, and people from the ACT, as well, looking at this technical college and wanting to be involved in its establishment. We have had a number of meetings involving the chamber of commerce from the ACT and our Business Enterprise Centre in Queanbeyan. The newly formed Queanbeyan Business Council has certainly got it as a top priority. Everybody is working together to come up with a model to put forward once the opportunity to tender for this technical college comes about in the next couple of months, to ensure that it is a real global solution. When established in Queanbeyan it will tap into people within the ACT. As now ACT schools take students from Queanbeyan, so it will be with the technical college.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is also great that people are acknowledging that it does not have to be just in one town—that, in fact, it can tap into other parts of the region. The discussion so far is about how we can tap into the coast and the mountains as well and perhaps have students from those regions do some of their core subjects in their schools down the coast—at Batemans Bay, Narooma et cetera—but also be part of the Australian technical college that is to be established in Queanbeyan. So these are exciting times, and they are the things that will start to address some of the issues relating to skills.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">While in the electorate of Eden-Monaro we have all this growth, we also face some threats. Unfortunately, one of the threats that we face is in fact from our neighbour, the ACT. Queanbeyan is trying to grow but is currently being prevented from growing because of access to water. Although a fair bit of the water is stored in New South Wales over at Googong Dam, it is controlled by the ACT government. The ACT government is trying to keep most of the development in this region within its boundaries and, I think, has been extremely slow to work with the New South Wales government and the Queanbeyan council to provide the sort of water that is needed for the growth that there could potentially be around Queanbeyan.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We have to get over the problem of the border and we have to think more about being a region, rather than a ‘them and us’ situation. I am pleased that recently the Mayor of Queanbeyan, Frank Pangallo, met with Jon Stanhope to try to progress this, but I think it needs a bit of impetus from the New South Wales government as well. It requires that cross-border agreement, and I do not think the New South Wales government quite understands the urgency of it. I hope that progresses so that we can see some reasonable development occurring, because everybody benefits. Many of the people who might live over in my electorate in Queanbeyan in new developments will work in the ACT, and they will certainly at times shop in the ACT. People who live in the ACT work in Queanbeyan and often shop in Queanbeyan. We have all of that cross-border stuff, so growing the whole region helps everybody and nobody should try to keep that growth to one side of the border.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The other aspect of cross-border cooperation that I would like to talk about briefly today relates to the jail that the ACT government says it is going to build at Hume, which is right on the border. The nearest population to that jail is, in fact, in New South Wales; it is not in the ACT. After pressure from ACT residents and voters, the ACT government decided to stick it on the doorstep of Jerrabomberra and Letchworth, where the people who will most likely be affected do not get a vote in the ACT. We have had an ongoing battle about this. Even though the land for the original preferred site for an ACT jail in the Majura Valley has been made available by the Commonwealth, the Chief Minister refuses to take up that offer and still wants to pursue this jail at Hume.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">From a planning point of view, I have to question this. Taking the politics out of it, purely from a planning point of view I have to question the location. Anybody who comes into Canberra from either Jerrabomberra or Queanbeyan via the Monaro Highway or from Tuggeranong every morning would know the type and extent of traffic there. What the Chief Minister is proposing will put another set of lights smack bang in the middle of the Monaro Highway to give access to this jail, which would be an absolute disaster. It would also become the thing you would see as you left Canberra to head towards the mountains or the first thing you would see coming into Canberra from the mountains. I do not think it is the sort of thing that you want on a gateway, particularly when there are far better sites available. But the Chief Minister is determined to pursue this because it is in a location where he will get no flak from his voters or residents as none of them are nearby. The only neighbours are across the border. He is being a really bad neighbour over this, particularly given that there have been other options.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The most frustrating thing from my point of view is that I have constantly written to the Chief Minister about this issue since it started, but he has refused to reply to me. I wrote to him on 11 February 2004, after he made the announcement, when I received masses of leaflets from residents of Jerrabomberra and Letchworth opposing what he was doing. To this day, I still have not received an answer to that letter. On 20 February, the state member for Monaro, Steve Whan—a member of the Labor Party—and I, the federal member, wrote an unprecedented joint letter to the Chief Minister. We got a letter from Katy Gallagher, acting Attorney-General, thanking us for a letter to the Attorney-General. Yes, Jon Stanhope is the Attorney-General, but we did not write to Jon Stanhope as the Attorney-General; we wrote to him as the Chief Minister. We still have not had an answer from Jon Stanhope.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We went through other matters that had gone on for months with respect to the availability of the land in Majura. Consequently I held a rally at the end of August, and hundreds of people turned up on the Monaro Highway. I have never seen so many people turn up to something like that. I wrote to Jon Stanhope and told him about it in case he had missed it on the news. That letter was dated 7 September, and I still have not received an answer to it. I do not know what is wrong with me that he cannot write me a letter and defend his position, but he just will not write to me.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">My constituents keep asking me what is going on with the jail, and I tell them that I keep writing to the Chief Minister but he will not answer me. Then, all of a sudden, I got a letter from the Chief Minister, which was written just before Christmas. He wrote to me asking for copies of documents under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. Although he had not responded to any of my correspondence, he wanted all documents that I might have in my possession on the decision by the Commonwealth to provide the land for his jail at Majura Valley, and he told me I should respond within so many days. He demanded a response from me immediately, but he still has not responded to my letter of 11 February, to the joint letter of 20 February 2004 or to the letter of 7 September. I wrote back to him in January and said that I would get some advice. He then wrote to me on 2 March and said: ‘You didn’t respond to me quickly enough. If you don’t give me these documents within 14 days, I’ll commence proceedings in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.’ The arrogance of the man! He has not even responded to my first letter, which I personally delivered to his office along with a big box containing well over 1,000 leaflets that had been returned by residents of Jerrabomberra and Letchworth opposing the location of this jail at Hume. And this is the sort of carry-on that we get.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I do not think that a jail in the ACT is necessary. We read in the paper just the other day that the ACT is in a bit of strife and looking at a tough budget. That is because the current ACT government have not created anything since they came to government. Their money, including record GST, has gone into all sorts of programs but they have never put it into any wealth creation for the region. They are going to spend $110 million on a jail, which I say they do not need. They currently send their prisoners to the various jails in New South Wales, and New South Wales is very happy to have them. Perhaps the ACT government think crime will be a growing thing and that this will be an economic activity for the ACT. It will not create anything in that respect, and it will continue to cost them more money. They would be far better off putting the $110 million into the hospital that they badly need—and I know the ACT Liberal Party proposed that before the ACT election. That would have been a much more sensible use of the money in a social sense.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The other option would have been to put that $110 million into a decent convention centre for the ACT, which would create some economic activity. Apparently the ACT government are going to spend about $40 million doing up the current Convention Centre, which all the experts say will be a bandaid measure. The ACT government ought to be creating some real wealth for the future, for example growing an industry rather than a jail. That is the sorry saga of what is happening at Hume.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I know that Defence adjoin this block at Hume, and I think they are not real fussed about having a jail next door to the fairly strong and important facility of HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Harman</inline> because it has certain telecommunications et cetera. I will say no more, but I do not think that they really want to have the jail next door. I do not think the jail is needed at all but it would be really nice if I could at least get answers to some of my correspondence on behalf of the residents I represent in this matter, who are certainly not pleased with the jail.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I notice that in parliament last night the member for Fraser, speaking in the debate on the appropriation bills, talked about planning issues in the ACT. Normally I might have some sympathy for some of the things that he said about this problem with the NCA, local planning et cetera, but when you see a local government acting in this quite irresponsible way from a planning point of view, I think in some respects it is just as well that we have the NCA to keep an eye on things.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I would have thought the NCA—and I have written to them—would have had a view about the entrances and exits to our nation’s capital. I agree with the member for Fraser inasmuch as the most important parts for the NCA are around the parliamentary triangle and those aspects, but I would think that the NCA quite rightly should have a very strong view about the entrances and exits to Canberra. To have a jail stuck on one of the major entrances and exits to Canberra is not good planning; it will be very poor planning if it creates incredible traffic problems—which it will. So they are some of the challenges in this area.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In the couple of minutes left, I will finish on a happier note for my electorate and that was the announcement that was made on the weekend in relation to age care places. We certainly have an ageing population, and in my electorate, particularly on the coast, we have a higher proportion of the aged population than in many other parts of Australia. We have seen a growth in numbers in aged care facilities and, fortunately, we have had some terrific growth in the number of facilities that we have and each year more and more places are provided by the federal government. We have had a terrific expansion over the last nine years.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">That expansion has continued with the most recent announcement of a number of grants and additional places. I am particularly pleased with a number of them. In Cooma, the Sir William Hudson Memorial Centre, which is a high-care facility for seniors, was successful and received a grant of $1 million towards a quite large expansion which is really needed in the mountains. They were just ecstatic when I contacted them on Friday afternoon to let them know that that grant had come through, because it means that a very large expansion can occur. It is a community based organisation and the local community have put together substantial sums of money themselves. This grant means that that project can now go ahead. Also in Cooma, Yallambee Lodge, which is a low-care facility, was successful and received $850,000 to assist its further expansion. It was also given eight low-care places in this announcement. Once again, it is a community based organisation and it does a fantastic job there.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In Bombala, one of the smaller towns in my electorate, there are a lot of people who want to stay in their town when they get to the point of needing to go into an age care facility. They do not want to have to move to Canberra or to Sydney or elsewhere. They have a wonderful facility there, Currawarna Home for the Aged, and it was also successful and received $1 million in grants to enable expansion of that facility and 10 low-care places. Once again, the local community do a fabulous job in looking after that facility. In addition, Nullica Lodge down in Eden received $768,000. They got a grant of $1.3 million a couple of years ago, and they have had the most amazing muck around, mainly because of state government regulations with bushfires and other things. What they have had to go through has been just incredible.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As a consequence, the costs of expansion should have cost less than $2 million but they are probably now closer to $3 million. The additional $768,000 will help Nullica Lodge to get that facility going. We also had some additional places in Queanbeyan for Kawaree Lodge—seven additional low care places—and a new service down at Batehaven, Batemans Bay, which is really growing quite substantially. We have a number of great aged care facilities there, but there will be a new service: Glen Residential Care Centre. Twenty-four high care places and 38 low care places have been provided for that particular service at Batehaven. These are excellent additional facilities for the aged in Eden Monaro. We are really looking after the people who have been great pioneers for our region and allowing them to stay in our region as they get on in years. I thank the Minister for Ageing for those particular grants.</para>

<para>—I rise in this debate on the <inline ref="R2279">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2004-2005</inline> and cognate bills to speak on the threats to human communities and their economies from climate change brought on by global warming and the measures that need to be put in place to address this truly paramount issue. I speak at a significant moment when the international treaty framework that has been developed to address global warming, the Kyoto protocol, has come into force around the world. Despite being a party to the treaty negotiations—and, in fact, gaining a considerable advantage through the so-named ‘Australia clause’ which saw Australia rewarded with a particularly achievable target; namely, 108 per cent of 1990 levels—the Howard government has subsequently walked away from the treaty. We are informed by the government that it is not looking at entering into global negotiations on climate change until 2012. Additionally, a number of government members have risen in the House and questioned the existence of the greenhouse effect and global warming.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">To someone who has recently entered the parliament and has heard the debate and seen the extensive amount of information about global warming that is available to anyone who takes an interest in this issue—and who, like many members of the public, has an awareness of the general consensus that has emerged backing the validity of likely climate change as a consequence of a warming planet—these views are alarming. It is true that there is a vociferous collection of sceptics and those supported by the fossil fuel industry who gainsay climate change, but the facts speak otherwise. The greenhouse effect as a theory was first mooted in the 19th century. It was first mentioned in Australia in the Australian Conservation Foundation’s publication <inline font-style="italic">Habitat</inline> in the 1970s. If one takes a step back and considers that the life-giving properties of the planet are maintained through our atmosphere, and that we inhabit a closed, delicately balanced system, that allows life to flourish and that has evolved over millions of years, then the case for global warming through a greenhouse effect whereby increases in gases emanating into the atmosphere resulting in less reflection of the sun’s heat off the earth with a concomitant rise in temperature within the atmosphere is well-made. Even more so are the facts—significantly the parts per million of carbon dioxide have increased from around 200 to 380 parts per million over the past 100 years.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The huge increase in human population and corresponding production of pollution and assorted greenhouse gases by motor cars, power stations and so on makes such a phenomenon very likely. To argue against its existence is akin to arguing that a lack of rain does not cause drought. Still some on the other side fulminate against science and available evidence, and the government itself has maintained the position that to bring the treaty into law would harm the national interest. Doubtless one reason for this harks back to the original consideration by the Howard government of an ABARE report from around 1997 on the economic impacts of containing climate change. That report claimed that the economic damage to Australia would be great. Members of the House may not be aware that participation on the steering committee that provided the economic models which informed this report was possible only for those organisations who were invited and paid for the privilege at a cost of some $50,000. The consequence was a report which was one-sided, dominated by the views of the fossil fuel industry. Alternative views, including those of non-government organisations, were blocked. If you could not pay, you could not say anything about this issue. The then Commonwealth Ombudsman found that ABARE had breached Australian public sector standards and recommended guidelines be drawn up to cover the use of private money by public agencies. Times have moved on since then, but the position of the government is unchanged and there remains much confusion amongst members of the government on this issue.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Mr Greg Hunt, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, said on 7 December 2004:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">This is an agreement which is not equitable, which does not address the needs of the environment and which threatens Australian jobs.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">But the Prime Minister had said earlier ‘we achieved a win for the environment and a win for Australian jobs’. On the day the treaty came into force, energy Minister Macfarlane was quoted as saying:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Whether or not these emissions are causing climate change or not, I don’t know. If you go back across history millions of years, carbon dioxide levels go up and down and global warming comes and goes ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">But Senator Ian Campbell, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, to provide some clarity, said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">... it is important that we understand that climate change is not something that can be left open to debate.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes"> The minister for the environment at least had that part right. The <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Telegraph</inline> calls 2004 ‘the Year of the greenhouse’. As temperatures continue to rise, with 1998, 2002, 2003 and 2004 the hottest years since measurements began, NASA climatologist James Hansen says simply:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">There has been a strong warming trend over the past thirty years.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">But more than that is the fact that global warming affects all the constituent parts of the ecological fabric of the planet: rivers; oceans, which are warming; atmosphere; habitat; glaciers; and coral reefs. Professor Sir David King, Chief Scientific Adviser to the United Kingdom government, put it thus:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">There is no bigger problem than climate change. The threat is quite simple, it’s a threat to our civilization ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">We are witnessing an enlarging, ominous pattern that will consume us unless we act resolutely. As I said in my maiden speech, whilst the Howard government fiddles, we in Australia burn.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Critically, our continent, with its greater climate variability—the land of droughts and flooding plains we love and know well—is comparatively more exposed to global warming. The predictions by the CSIRO that some regions, like south-western Western Australia, will be more prone to drought, are coming true. This region can fairly be called one of the world’s first climate change regions. Rainfall there has dropped by 20 per cent over the past three decades.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The impacts of climate change are many and manifold. They include threats to supplies of drinking water for many in the poorest nations, as well as the citizens of Western Australia. Coral reef collapse and rising sea levels are a problem already in the minds of our low-lying Pacific neighbours. I will come back to that later. Positive feedback loops develop that exacerbate the global warming trend and, of course, the likelihood of an increasing tempo of species extinction. Still the Howard government ignores the significance of increasing data and predictions on this issue, despite the fact that we have a great deal to lose with the advent of a hothouse world.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The essential argument is still made by the government that Kyoto, a modest platform for international greenhouse gas reductions, will destroy our economy. It is an argument without merit and exposes the government to the charge that it is incapable of appreciating the true threat to the national interest—and the international interest—that lies in stalling on global warming. The Kyoto Protocol Ratification Advisory Group considered this question. The committee included Peter Duncan, former Chief Executive Officer of Shell, and former Liberal leader John Hewson. Its findings were simple: there would be no adverse impact to our economy if Kyoto were to be ratified. Indeed, if we had access to the trading mechanisms under the Kyoto protocol, the costs of compliance would be significantly less.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Criticism of Kyoto tends to focus on its effectiveness, the likelihood of its realising its ambitions and the flaws, imagined or otherwise, in its processes. Some of these criticisms have legitimacy, but they miss the central point: an international framework is a preliminary but essential step in addressing global warming, and there will be of necessity a suite of policies and practices, additional to simply signing on to the modest reductions under Kyoto, which countries will need to adopt. Kyoto is not the endgame, but it is surely the beginning. The modest reach of Kyoto will need to be greatly expanded in time, but the platform for future action will be based on the world’s economies operating in the framework of the Kyoto protocol—something this government has simply ruled out.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">What about the likely economic impacts of global warming over time? The Financial Initiative report of the United Nations Environment Programme, UNEP, recently calculated that the economic costs of global warming are doubling every decade. Using historical data from reinsurance giant Munich Re and assuming that current trends continue, by 2065 the economic costs of natural disasters and an increasingly volatile climate will exceed that total world output. It has been estimated that a two degree centigrade to 3.5 degree centigrade increase in temperature in a country like India would result in a decline in farm revenues of nine per cent to 25 per cent. Clearly, for those in the farming communities in south-western and south-eastern Australia, the effect of likely drought as a result of climate change, and its impact upon stock in particular, will impose a great cost.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Meteorologists believe that variations in extreme weather typically associated with the El Nino cycle are also likely to become more common and more intense with increased global warming. The last strong cycle, in mid-1997, continuing through 1998, had a major global impact. Estimates of global loss range from $US32 billion upwards. That is very costly. UNEP reports that the number of people affected by global environment disasters driven or exacerbated by global warming has increased to over two billion in the last decade, with economic losses in the 1990s amounting to $629 billion from this issue alone.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The World Health Organisation, UNEP and the world meteorological program report that at least 150,000 people die unnecessarily each year as a direct result of global warming. The AMA has repeatedly warned of the impacts on air quality, particularly in the western suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne, and the consequent increases in respiratory diseases people will suffer in these regions. Malaria, which is already the second leading cause of death in the world for five-year-olds to 14-year-olds, is also expected to reach higher levels because of climate change.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In our region of the South Pacific we have seen a significant increase in the number of people affected by disasters in the last 30 years. For example, Fiji receives around $US30 million in aid annually, but about 25 per cent of donor projects are in sectors which are potentially affected by climate change. Previously in the House, I read some of the words that introduce the Otin Taai declaration, produced by the Pacific Churches Consultation on Climate Change. People met in the small island state of Kiribati during March 2004. I know that members opposite have a keen interest in the health of church communities, so I will read from the Otin Taai statement:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">Here on the small island atoll of Kiribati, the impacts of human-induced climate change are already visible. The sea level is rising. People’s homes are vulnerable to the increasingly high tides and storm surges.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">But in recent meetings of the South Pacific Forum, when member states sought to raise this issue and the prospects for their citizens, the Australian government shut down debate. Shame!</para>
<para pgwide="yes">At a basic level, it is clear that global warming is of a size that threatens to reverse human progress—in the case of our responsibility to the human community, making unattainable the international targets on halving global poverty by 2015, known as the Millennium Development Goals. The future under the Howard government is grim. As land clearing emissions stabilise at a low level over the next few years, Australia will be responsible for a rapid increase in energy related emissions, leading to a total rise in greenhouse emissions. We will clearly exceed the parameters of Kyoto down the track unless urgent action is taken. According to the Australian Greenhouse Office, greenhouse gas emissions will actually increase by 23 per cent by 2020.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">What should the government be doing? It should implement a national target and plan to reduce greenhouse emissions by at least 60 per cent of 1990 levels by 2050, with a 20 per cent target by 2020 to show real progress. We already have the likelihood of a one per cent increase in global temperature, but to avoid an increase in temperature of two per cent—which climate scientists call the ‘tipping point’—industrialised countries need to reduce their emissions by 60 to 80 per cent by 2050. That is the current state of play. In 2003, Prime Minister Tony Blair pledged that the UK government would cut its emissions of CO, the main greenhouse gas, by 60 per cent by 2050. A commitment to set a national target in Australia would help to avoid the worst impacts of climate change and allow this country to innovate and to begin to develop a low emissions economy.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We need short- and long-term targets that provide an overall framework which allows industry and the economy as a whole, including the skills and job space, to adjust within a reasonable time frame. This means that industry can plan with certainty, in the course of normal capital replacement cycles, and it allows for the encouragement of new technologies, new industries and innovators to come forward to meet the challenges we face as a nation experiencing global warming. What is stopping action by this government? For example, the <inline font-style="italic">Clean energy future for Australia</inline> report concluded:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The barrier to … [a 50% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from the stationary energy sector by 2040] is not that the clean technologies cannot produce enough energy at relatively affordable prices, nor is it that the cleaner fuels are not available. The barrier is a lack of achievable policies and strategies for facilitating the transition to new fuels and commitment by decision-makers.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Proposals advanced by progressive business and conservation organisations with a mandate and an interest in this issue have demonstrated that a 20 per cent cut below 1990 targets by 2020 requires emissions to be cut by approximately 108 million tonnes. As an example, the following initiatives will achieve over 90 million tonnes of savings: reductions from the land use change and forestry sector, which in 2002 contributed 29.2 million tonnes; in the stationary energy sector, 40 million tonnes can be saved by replacing coal fired power stations of 40 years of age or older with a mix of combined cycle gas plants and wind power; four million tonnes can be saved by the uptake of cogeneration by large industrial users of thermal energy; four million tonnes can be saved by approximately 50 per cent of residential dwellings using solar hot water. Energy performance codes currently in place are expected to save seven million tonnes by 2010—this saving could be increased substantially with stronger mandated standards for the period 2010-20.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Of course, national leadership is required. The current lack of a national framework to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is creating business uncertainty and leading to a proliferation of disparate policies and measures at state and federal levels. As the Business Council of Australia and the Australian Chamber of Commerce said in 2003:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">To deliver substantial, least cost greenhouse gas abatement it is essential that a national approach be applied. The effect of piecemeal measures is that certain industries, dependent upon location and output, will bear a disproportionate cost burden placing pressure on their domestic and international competitiveness.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">In order to remove uncertainty, national leadership must be provided by the federal government to establish a price on the pollution of carbon dioxide. By putting a price on greenhouse pollution, we can ensure those responsible for causing greenhouse pollution will pay for the environmental damage that it causes. Revenue from a carbon levy, for example, can be used to fund tax cuts or to increase spending in non-polluting practices. Numerous industrialised countries have now introduced a carbon levy or are about to do so, including Denmark, France, Norway, Sweden, the UK and Germany. Alternatively, an emissions trading scheme with a cap on carbon dioxide emissions could create an economic incentive and reward for companies to reduce greenhouse levels. Providing the necessary stimulus would necessitate legislating a stringent greenhouse gas trigger in the Environment Protection Biodiversity Conservation Act. That, of course, is Labor policy.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Setting targets of the order needed to rein in global warming will require a large increase in the share of electricity coming from renewable energy such as wind, sustainable biomass, solar-thermal, geothermal and other renewable sources. One study estimates that wind and biomass energy could supply around 50 per cent of Australia’s electricity needs by 2040. A strong mandatory target for renewable energy will ensure these technologies achieve a commercial critical mass to grow and expand beyond 2020. We estimate that an MRET target of 10 per cent by 2010 would be a job creator. Additionally, measures to increase Australia’s energy efficiency by setting a mandatory national target to reduce stationary energy use would be important.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Improving energy efficiency is recognised as an important and especially cost-effective way to reduce greenhouse pollution. The new solar power tower project near Mildura will cost less than a regular power station. It will require no fuel, will produce no pollution and will provide electricity 24/7 for a quarter of a million people in a city equivalent to the size of the city of Geelong, in Victoria. Indeed, a paper for the Ministerial Council on Energy concluded that energy efficiency savings could deliver a $1.8 billion benefit to GDP, creating around 9,000 jobs and reducing emissions from the stationary energy sector by nine per cent over 12 years.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There is a strong environmental, social and economic case for the federal government to play an important role by setting national directions and reducing greenhouse pollution from our cities and towns. The policies that I have mentioned today, identified by any number of organisations and entities and well supported by the public, would help put Australia on the path to delivering the significant reductions in greenhouse emissions that scientists say are necessary to prevent the worst impacts of climate change. We owe nothing less to the generations that follow.</para>

<para>—I am very pleased to speak on <inline ref="R2279">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2004-2005</inline> and the associated legislation because I believe the Howard government has done more for the people of the Gold Coast and the people of Australia than any previous Australian national government. In particular, I am pleased to say that, thanks to the economic responsibility and the good economic management of the Howard government, all Australians have benefited as a consequence of record low unemployment, record low interest rates and the fact that under this government we have now had nearly 14 years of continued economic growth. In summary, the Howard government has provided in a very meaningful and real way for all Australians—for those Australians who are trying to pay off their mortgage, for those Australians who are trying to get an education and for those Australians who are trying to get a job. In every one of these key respects, the Howard government has ensured that all Australians are materially better off today than they were when this government was first elected in 1996.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I would like to focus on some of the benefits that have flowed to the people of my electorate of Moncrieff and more broadly to the people of the Gold Coast. Under the Howard government, there have been a number of key areas in which the people of the Gold Coast have significantly benefited, thanks to a number of policy initiatives that the government has taken. These are policy initiatives that are only possible thanks to the strong budget surplus this government has run since 1996 and thanks to the economic responsibility which has delivered record economic growth now for, as I said, nearly 14 years.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I will focus on some key aspects of federal government policies. Of particular concern to the people on the Gold Coast is our principal industry, the tourism industry. The tourism industry is the lifeblood of the Gold Coast, accounting for some 37 per cent of our local economy when one considers both direct and indirect inputs flowing from tourism. The tourism industry suffered significantly for a large while as a consequence of what I call the three horses of the apocalypse for the tourism industry: the collapse of Ansett, the SARS epidemic and, most disturbingly, the attacks on September 11. These three issues, in particular, were of great harm to the tourism industry across Australia and were felt very strongly by the people of the Gold Coast. We also saw the slow decline of Japan over the past decade, which has seen a record fall in the number of Japanese tourists—who were traditionally amongst the most prosperous and influential tourists coming to Australia, thanks to their generally longer periods of stay and higher levels of average daily spending while they were in Australia.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In every respect, the future of tourism on the Gold Coast is looking a lot brighter. We now have a resurgence of Japanese tourism which has been funded, in part, by virtue of the fact that the Howard government has provided record additional funding to the tourism industry. We have also seen the restructure of Tourism Australia. We have seen, for example, the incorporation of the Bureau of Tourism Research and See Australia. They are all now under the umbrella of Tourism Australia. This restructure at a national level means that people on the Gold Coast can take great stock in the fact that the Howard government has, under its white paper, a 10-year plan for tourism—a long-term plan that is delivering real results and record numbers of new tourists to the Gold Coast, including a greater number of domestic tourists to the Gold Coast. Each time an international tourist or a domestic tourist comes and visits our fair city it means more money in the pockets of ordinary Gold Coasters, and this is a great shot in the arm for our local economy.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Of course, it does also present some challenges. In this regard, the Gold Coast faces a number of unique challenges that are not felt in other parts of Australia. Principal among them is the fact that the Gold Coast is the fastest growing region in Australia. As a consequence of this rapid population growth, we as a city face a number of challenges, not least of which is investment in infrastructure. On this point I would like to draw some stark contrasts between infrastructure investment under the Howard government and the absolute lack of investment in infrastructure by the state Labor Beattie government. When it comes to investment in infrastructure, as I said, because the Gold Coast does have such a rapidly growing population, there is a need to continually update and invest in infrastructure.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">One of the key areas—and it was in fact an issue that I raised in my first speech—was the need in Gold Coast City for there to be more university places. When taken on average against the rest of the country, the Gold Coast faced a significant shortage of tertiary education spots. On average, it was calculated to be about 3,000 places short of the national average. After making continued and strong representations in this regard to the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, the Hon. Dr Brendan Nelson, and arguing very passionately and strongly, together with my federal colleagues, that the Gold Coast needed a significant allocation of new university places, I was very pleased that we saw in last year’s announcement by Dr Nelson a record allocation of new university places to the Gold Coast. This allocation of new university places saw the Gold Coast campus of Griffith University receive the highest single allocation of new university places in the country. It is something that was certainly argued for and passionately believed in, but I am very pleased that the minister listened and, more appropriately, that the minister responded in such a true and meaningful way. It now means that we on the Gold Coast have a better chance than ever for our rapidly growing population and, in particular, for young people to be able to secure a job and be likely to stay on the Gold Coast.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Another key piece of investment in infrastructure on the Gold Coast by the Howard government was the allocation of a new medical school. This again has been an issue that our city has been fighting for for nearly two decades now. I was very pleased, having been a strong advocate for the need for our city to have a new medical school, to see the Hon. Kay Patterson allocate funded student places at that medical school. As I drive from my electorate office in Short Street in Southport, I am delighted to see, a mere 500 metres up the road, the now almost completed Griffith University medical school—seven storeys high—which will most certainly be an iconic institution in the health and medical precinct of Southport on the Gold Coast. This significantly represents a very substantial investment in infrastructure which, once again, provides unsurpassed opportunities for local students to secure a place to study medicine on the Gold Coast and, more than likely, to remain on the Gold Coast. A double injection of benefit flows from that: not only do local kids have a greater opportunity to study medicine locally but also, once they graduate, we are going to retain a higher number of doctors on the Gold Coast. That means that Gold Coasters will have increased access to doctors, which of course is always a great and positive thing.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In those two respects, these are some of the most significant investments that we have seen by the Howard government. But there has been more than that. When it comes to road and transport infrastructure, I am pleased that the Howard government has invested over $140 million in improving local roads, plus a one-off grant of $120 million to ensure that the Tugan bypass will be completed. Some people might ask: why is it a necessity for the federal government to invest $120 million of taxpayers’ money into a project that should be funded by the Queensland state Labor government? My response to that is that it is necessary because the Queensland state Labor government continually chooses to ignore the needs of the Gold Coast and to shirk its responsibilities with respect to investment, in particular, in road and transport infrastructure. A case in point would be the absolutely woeful state of affairs when it comes to public transport infrastructure on the Gold Coast. Compare and contrast the needs of the Gold Coast with those of Brisbane. The Gold Coast is now a city of some 500,000 people. Thanks to a subsidy from the state government, it has a public transport bus service. The size of the subsidy is a mere $6 million per annum. That is the contribution that the Queensland state Labor government makes towards public transport infrastructure on the Gold Coast, and I might add that it is a very lousy $6 million.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Let us contrast that to Brisbane—a city that is twice the size of the Gold Coast, granted—which receives hundreds of millions of dollars of subsidies from the state Labor government. I am at a loss to understand why Premier Peter Beattie would think it is appropriate to provide hundreds of millions of dollars of public transport subsidies to Brisbane—to fund the Queensland city rail network, to ensure that there is a ferry service and a bus service, and to invest hundreds of millions of dollars into new road transport projects in Brisbane—but not to put money towards the equally important needs of the people of the Gold Coast. I know that the people of the Gold Coast are waking up to the fact that the Beattie state Labor government is short-changing them. It goes further than that.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I have heard ALP members opposite raise concerns about changes the Howard government made to tertiary education policy. This is an interesting case in point. I often hear members opposite complain about the fact that we have given some tertiary institutions the opportunity to increase the HECS fees charged to students by 25 per cent. They wail and complain about how this is a disincentive to so many students who would like to go to university but refuse to be laboured with a debt and an increase in that debt of some 25 per cent as a consequence of Howard government changes to tertiary education. Yet the most expensive university course is still cheaper than it is for students to undertake vocational education at TAFE on the Gold Coast—and TAFE fees have to be paid up-front.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Despite all the rhetoric from the state Labor government and from the federal opposition here in Canberra that there is in some way a great injustice when it comes to tertiary education, they do nothing to support those students who would like to undertake vocational education on the Gold Coast. They ignore the fact that on the Gold Coast students have to pay some $5,500 per annum up-front with no assistance from HECS, whilst at the same time there is a small group of privileged students who go to university and are subsidised by taxpayers to the tune of approximately 75 per cent of the cost of their course of study. If that is not an injustice, I do not know what is. I do know one thing, and that is that students on the Gold Coast will continue to move away from the TAFE system and vocational education as a consequence of the policies of the state Labor government.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I would like to focus on a number of other areas in which the Howard government is providing support to local Gold Coast families. I note the time, so I will touch on these issues as rapidly as I can. One of the most important policy initiatives that I know receives widespread community support is the Work for the Dole program. The Howard government has provided over $7 million to fund the Work for the Dole program. This has allowed nearly 3,300 local young people to gain work skills, and to give something back to our community. Over the past four years I have been to many Work for the Dole projects. I can say with great sincerity that, at every single one of those projects, participants rave about the value they get out of undertaking those projects. They speak in glowing terms about how much they enjoy the projects and about the fact that they believe they are gaining real skills and a true insight into what it means to work and to develop work habits. They feel a sense of pride at their accomplishments in the local community. More often than not, they can drive past those projects in subsequent months and know that they have been involved in creating something for the residents of the Gold Coast, and more broadly for the people of Australia, through their involvement in Work for the Dole.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There has also been an investment of more than $11 million in local environmental projects, including the restoration of the Federation Walk at the Spit—a project that I have been closely involved with. This is a very important project, as it is one of the last remaining areas of sand dune vegetation on the Gold Coast. I am very pleased that the people of the Gold Coast can now, through an investment of some $11 million, enjoy Federation Walk, as well as other key environmental areas on the Gold Coast. Once again in this vein, may I say that I am disappointed that, after all this money and after the investment of hours of hard work by local communities on the Gold Coast, the Spit should be under threat by the Beattie state Labor government, who intend to put a cruise ship terminal at the end of it. At a time when the federal government is providing funding to ensure that there are opportunities for the people of the Gold Coast to enjoy one of the last sand dune vegetation remnants on the Gold Coast, an area that is generally regarded as having very high levels of development, the Queensland Labor government is threatening that by proposing to put a cruise ship terminal in the actual area that we are trying to protect. A terminal would have thousands of tourists passing through that area, with a need for greatly enhanced infrastructure—in particular, a wider road, with higher levels of traffic, through an area that is considered so environmentally sensitive that the federal government has been putting millions of dollars into trying to protect it, through direct funding as well as through Work for the Dole projects and dune revegetation projects.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">More broadly the Howard government, through its private health insurance rebate, has facilitated access to private medical insurance for one in two local residents. This has eased significantly the pressure on the Gold Coast Hospital and has ensured that people have easier access to the public hospital system. Again, it stands in stark contrast to the efforts of the Queensland Labor government. At a time when the federal government is doing what it can to take some of the pressure off the public health system by having those who can afford to use the private system take up places in that system, the Beattie government is doing what it can to try to blow out the waiting lists at the Gold Coast Hospital by not making sure that there are sufficient services to meet the growing levels of demand on the Gold Coast.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In addition to the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate, the Howard government has also introduced an additional $7.50 payment to bulk-billing doctors, a payment which will apply to people on the Gold Coast. This means that people who have children or who have Commonwealth concession cards will now have increased opportunities to utilise the services of bulk-billing doctors. Again, this is something that I know is very well supported on the Gold Coast.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">With respect to local apprenticeships, on the Gold Coast we have seen the investment of some $53 million to provide real jobs to over 6,750 Gold Coast residents of all ages. It is in contrast to the Labor Party’s previous efforts; it represents a 156 per cent increase in apprenticeships when compared to the legacy of the Labor government that was in power prior to the election of the Howard government.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Howard government has a very proud record when it comes to assisting veterans and war widows. The Gold Coast has a significant veteran and war widow population—the fourth largest in Australia. I am very pleased to be part of a government that takes seriously its responsibility to thank and to continue to provide for those who were prepared to put their lives on the line so that we as Australians can enjoy the great democratic freedoms and responsibilities that we do enjoy, living in a nation such as Australia. In this respect, I am very pleased that 14,867 Gold Coast veterans and war widows share in around $293 million in pensions and benefits each year. In fact, our local veterans are now receiving an average 55 per cent more funding than they were under the Australian Labor Party. So there is an extra 55 per cent of funds going to local war widows and veterans. I know how important that money is to them and I know how important it is to them, and how much they recognise, that the Howard government understands the contribution that they have made in the past and is prepared to stand by them at a time when the Australian Labor Party would callously turn its back on them.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In addition to that, I am pleased that the Howard government has been able to put record amounts of funding into the cadet service. I was formerly an Air Force cadet, and I was very pleased with the exposure I gained as one. It instilled in me a sense of discipline, and I know that that is something that many parents are seeking for their children. In this regard, I am very pleased that $14 million is flowing through Defence spending to our local community, including some $424,000 towards cadet activities for Gold Coast youth.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">When it comes to the elderly on the Gold Coast, I am very pleased that the Howard government has been able to deliver some $46 million for community aged care packages, as well as boosting residential aged care funding by a third. The Howard government has provided some $296 million to local aged care facilities, including increasing the funding by some $3,500 per resident.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In every one of these respects, it is clear that the Howard government has delivered in spades to the people of the Gold Coast. I am certainly pleased to be a strong advocate and ambassador for our city, the fastest growing city in Australia. People recognise the great benefits that flow from living on the Gold Coast, and they want to continue to enjoy the lifestyle benefits and the economic benefits. It is my responsibility, and I am in fact duty bound, to ensure they continue to enjoy those benefits by making sure this government continues with its strong and proud record of delivering locally for residents of the Gold Coast. Thanks to the Howard government, I can honestly say the people of the Gold Coast are much better off. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—When we speak of national security policy in 21st century Australia we think of a range of different challenges. There are the familiar challenges: the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; the problem of territorial disputes across our region, as in the Korean peninsula, the Taiwan Straits and Kashmir; and the emerging challenge of Islamist terrorism in South-East Asia. Then there are the other, less familiar national security challenges: large-scale trafficking in narcotics, international organised crime and unlawful international people movements. And then there are the new challenges, principal among which is the challenge of internationally communicable diseases.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Australia’s long-term national security depends on our government allocating appropriate resources to each of these challenges in order to provide for the safety and security of our people. My purpose today is to sound a warning in relation to the newest of our national security challenges, and that is the prospective impact of HPAI, highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, on the security of our wider region and therefore Australia. My purpose is also to begin to examine the extent to which the region is prepared for this contingency and how Australia in assisting in building regional capabilities, in addition to auditing our own, can help. My purpose is not to be alarmist but rather to be constructive about what has been done and what needs to be done.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">What is avian flu? According to the US centre for disease control, avian influenza viruses are infectious diseases circulating among birds worldwide which are caused by various strains of the type A influenza virus, one of the three types of flu viruses, A, B and C. Type A viruses occur in a variety of animals. As wild birds, particularly waterfowl, are the main hosts for all subtypes of A viruses, they are believed to be the source of the type A flu viruses in other animals. Usually the wild birds that are the host to the virus do not get sick, but they can spread influenza to other birds. Infection with certain avian influenza A viruses, such as some H5 and H7 strains, can cause widespread disease and death among some species of domesticated birds. Low pathogenic forms of avian influenza viruses are responsible for most avian influenza outbreaks in poultry. Such outbreaks usually result in either no illness or mild illness—for example, chickens producing fewer or no eggs—or low levels of mortality. But when higher pathogenic avian influenza viruses cause outbreaks, between 90 and 100 per cent of poultry can die from infection.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In early 2004 a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza, known as H5N1, swept across much of Asia, leading to the culling of 120 million birds. Influenza A viruses are normally seen in one species but sometimes can cross over and cause illnesses in other species. According to the World Health Organisation, the first documented infection of humans with an avian influenza virus occurred in Hong Kong in 1997, when the H5N1 strain caused severe respiratory disease in 18 humans, of whom six died. The infection of humans coincided with an epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Hong Kong’s poultry population, caused by the same strain. Extensive investigation of the Hong Kong outbreak determined that close contact with live infected poultry was the source of human infection. Studies at the genetic level further determined that the virus had jumped directly from birds to humans. Rapid destruction within three days of Hong Kong’s entire poultry population—estimated at around 1½ million birds—reduced opportunities for further direct transmission to humans. Most influenza experts agree that the prompt culling of Hong Kong’s poultry population probably averted a pandemic.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The total number of confirmed human cases of avian flu since the most recent outbreak in Thailand and Vietnam on 28 January 2004 is 55. Forty-two of those cases were fatal. There are indications that avian flu could be passed between humans, but it has so far not been proven conclusively. In one case in Thailand a girl and her mother both died, which indicated that the probable transmission of the virus was of that type. The girl’s aunt, who was also infected, survived the virus. UK virology expert Professor John Oxford has said that these cases indicated that the basic virus could be passed between humans and predicted that similar small clusters of cases would be seen again. It is not the only instance where it has been thought bird flu has been passed between humans. In 2004, two sisters died in Vietnam after possibly contracting bird flu from their brother who had died from an unidentified respiratory illness. In a similar case in Hong Kong in 1997, a doctor possibly caught the disease from a patient with the H5N1 virus, but this was never conclusively proven.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">What is the risk of a pandemic? In a recent article in the <inline font-style="italic">New Yorker</inline> magazine, Michael Specter described a pandemic as the viral equivalent of a perfect storm. He said that there are three essential conditions for a pandemic which rarely converge and which are impossible to predict. First, a new virus must emerge from the animal reservoirs that have always produced and harboured such viruses—one that has never infected human beings and therefore one for which no person would have antibodies. Second, the virus has to actually make humans sick. Finally, the virus must be able to spread efficiently, through coughing, sneezing or a handshake. For H5N1, the strain of avian flu found in Thailand and Vietnam last year, the first two conditions have been met. It is new and it is deadly.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Pandemics are not new to the 20th century. The great influenza pandemic of 1918-19 known as the Spanish flu caused an estimated 40 million to 50 million deaths worldwide and infected hundreds of millions of other people. In the US it took more lives than all combat operations in the 20th century. In Australia it led to 11,500 deaths. And remember that this was in the days before international travel on the scale we see today. According to the WHO, the world generally experiences three or four pandemics a century. Most scientific experts agree that another influenza pandemic is inevitable and possibly imminent.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">On 12 November 2004, Michael T. Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, warned:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">There are disquieting signs that the H5N1 virus circulating in Asian poultry flocks could do as much damage to humanity as the ‘Spanish flu’ virus of 1918 ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Dr Osterholm has warned that the avian flu virus could trigger a pandemic ‘if it acquired the ability to spread easily from person to person’. In particular, he warned:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">At minimum, assume we will not have a vaccine in the first 6 to 8 months of a pandemic.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Dr Osterholm estimates that a 1918-like virus arising today could cause as many as 177 million deaths around the world. On 21 February this year, Dr Julie Gerberding, head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that the avian flu was the world’s number one health threat. She stated:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">This is a very ominous situation for the globe ... We are seeing a highly pathogenic strain of influenza virus emerge to an extraordinary proportion ... The reason this is so ominous is because of the evolution of flu ... You may see the emergence of a new strain to which the human population has no immunity.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Dr Gerberding has also said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I think we can all recognise that a similar pattern probably occurred prior to 1918.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Shigeru Omi, Regional Director for the West Pacific Region of WHO, at a WHO conference in Thailand on 26 November, said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I believe we are closer now to a pandemic than at any time in recent years. There are a number of reasons for this, but the three basic ones are as follows: First, the extent of the current outbreak in poultry is historically unprecedented in terms of its geographical spread and impact. So far, more than 120 million poultry have died or been destroyed. Despite the intensified efforts of affected countries, there are indications that the disease may remain entrenched in this part of the world. The second reason for concern is that history has taught us that influenza pandemics occur on a regular cycle, with one appearing every 20 to 30 years. On this basis, the next one is overdue.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Finally, on his resignation as US Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services on 3 December 2004, Tommy Thompson warned of the possibility of a global flu outbreak. He lamented there was still not a vaccine for the avian flu and criticised Congress for not approving more money to tackle the disease. He said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">This is really a huge bomb out there that could adversely impact on the health care of the world.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">What are the international responses to date? The three relevant organisations are the World Health Organisation, the WHO; the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, the FAO; and the World Organisation for Animal Health, the OIE. The WHO has been playing a key role, providing impartial guidance to countries at risk on scientific research and development and national and global action for influenza control, coordinating virological and epidemiological influence control and surveillance, and in assisting affected countries implement identified priorities in preparation for the next influenza pandemic—including through the development of vaccines and the vaccination of those who have had close contact with poultry. The FAO has also been active in assisting countries to build their own surveillance and early warning systems, establishing contingency plans, and building a global information system for disease monitoring. The FAO also plays a role in promoting research on disease control and eradication methods.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In April, the OIE is planning to launch a new worldwide Avian Influenza Network, which will facilitate collaboration with the WHO on issues related to the animal-human interface, develop and harmonise research projects on avian flu in different parts of the world and offer veterinary expertise and new skills to affected countries to assist in the control and eradication of avian flu.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In the US, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention has developed an International Emerging Infections Program to deal with the emergence of precisely the kind of threat posed by avian influenza. The program, based in Thailand, has been described as a kind of radar defence system for microbes. It was created in response to the emergence of unexpected viral infections, particularly animal illnesses that infect humans and make them sick. Because these types of viruses inevitably emerge in Third World countries, the program was based in Thailand. Mark Simmerman, from the CDC, described the rationale behind the program as follows:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">... the feeling was that maybe if we were out there with our ear to the ground, listening and watching, we might be able to catch something before it’s too late.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">What are the implications for Australia? A total of five outbreaks of avian flu have occurred in Australia so far, with the last occurring in New South Wales in 1997. Each outbreak was quickly eradicated, but in every case there was evidence of contact between farmed poultry and water fowl. Migratory water fowl are thought to be one of the main means of spreading bird flu viruses between continents. AQIS has conducted surveys of wild birds which have confirmed that various strains of avian flu do circulate among wild birds in Australia.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Australian government’s efforts to combat avian flu have included, firstly, efforts by AQIS in relation to the disease surveillance program, including baggage screening for passengers arriving from Asia, and the seizure of all poultry products such as meat, eggs and feathers. International mail is also being screened and poultry from ships’ stores confiscated. Secondly, there are farm biosecurity measures designed to prevent contact between commercial poultry and wild birds by protecting feed and water supplies, limiting entry to farms and physically isolating the poultry. Thirdly, there has been the development of an Australian veterinary emergency plan to deal with a variety of animal health crises, in line with OIE guidelines. The plan includes a proposed response for an outbreak of avian flu in Australian birds.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The bureaucratic mechanisms which have been established across the country for dealing with infectious disease outbreaks include: the Office of the Commonwealth Medical Officer; the Australian Health Disaster Management Policy Committee; Communicable Diseases Australia, a branch of the Department of Health and Ageing; Emergency Management Australia; Communicable Diseases Network Australia; and the National Influenza Pandemic Action Committee, a committee formed in 2003 to plan for pandemics and monitor avian flu.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Some avian flu specific measures were announced in the 2004 federal budget, including the stockpiling of antiviral medications, the expansion of the National Emergency Medicines Stockpile and the strengthening of detection measures at international borders. The challenge for Australia’s institutional arrangements in dealing with infectious diseases, influenza pandemic is one of effective national coordination. This, in turn, affects our capacity to enhance capabilities across the region. As the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing said to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Coordination is the key. You can plan for certain incidents but, generally speaking, surge is something that requires a national solution.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">According to the government’s framework for an Australian influenza pandemic, if Australia were struck by a flu pandemic today like the Spanish flu, it could expect at least 42,000 deaths per year, representing a 30 per cent increase in overall mortality rates. A significant outbreak in Australia would threaten our agricultural industry, trade, tourism, transport, business and economic growth generally.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">On 28 January 2004 the Treasurer, Mr Costello, expressed concern that an outbreak of avian flu could have an impact on Australia’s tourism industry like the SARS virus did in 2003. The Asian Development Bank has also warned that the avian flu has the potential to cause overall losses of tens of billions of dollars in Asia and to have significant implications for the Australian economy. Treasurer Costello’s concerns about the potential economic impact of an outbreak of avian flu in January 2004 appear not to have been shared entirely by his colleague the foreign minister. Later that same month, when asked about the risk posed to Australia by avian flu, Mr Downer told radio 3AW’s Neil Mitchell:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">... I’m not a scientist but, I suppose it’s conceivable it could come to Australia but I think that’s, frankly, a little unlikely and I haven’t been advised that there’s a real threat that it will come to Australia.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Regrettably, I regard that as a statement of complacency. The government has announced that it will provide up to $1 million through AusAID to meet the immediate needs of regional organisations to deal with the recent outbreak of avian influenza virus in Asia. Up to $500,000 is being provided to the WHO to use Australian expertise in epidemiology, laboratory techniques, animal health, virology and public health in the affected countries. Funds will also be used to purchase equipment and laboratory supplies. Guidelines and training materials will be produced and translated into local languages.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">But $1 million provided through AusAID, while better than nothing, does not represent a comprehensive strategy to deal with the potentially devastating effects of an outbreak of avian flu in our own region, our neighbourhood, our own backyard. Let us be clear about Australia’s interests in the event of an avian flu pandemic in Asia. Such a pandemic poses more than simply the devastating economic impact on Australian agricultural, tourism and transport industries that has been foreshadowed by the ADB and others. A pandemic of the proportions contemplated by experts would not only have serious economic ramifications for our regional neighbours but would also result in a massive loss of human life. If Dr Osterholm’s predictions are accurate, the death toll could reach 177 million worldwide. A human tragedy on this scale would make the aftermath of the tsunami look small indeed.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Despite Australia’s relative geographic isolation as an island state and the stringent border protection and quarantine regime Australia already has in place, the reality is that with up to 3.8 million people movements between Australia and Asia each year the risks of virus transmission represent a significant challenge for our national authorities. And, of course, the greater the extent of any pandemic in Asia, the greater the risk that the pandemic could spread to Australia. The government’s response to the threat posed by avian flu has been focused on preparing Australia’s response to an outbreak of the disease within our own borders. It is an open question whether the government’s domestic efforts to prepare for a possible outbreak of avian flu—including its biosecurity measures, quarantine controls and disaster management contingency planning—will prove to be adequate to combat an outbreak of avian flu in Australia. These are questions to be answered by the relevant domestic policy ministers, and in particular the health minister. It is also an open question whether the preparations within the region are adequate to deal with a future pandemic. This is a question of foreign policy as well.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I note that, in the wake of the SARS virus, APEC has established an ad hoc health task force to address health related threats to economies, trade and security. This is to be welcomed. The region needs, however, a comprehensive regional strategy to deal with the threat posed by avian flu. The strategy would include as a priority an urgent audit of the capacity of our neighbours in the region to detect, investigate, diagnose and report the virus. The strategy should demonstrate a detailed approach on how to manage and control any outbreak once detected. The countries at risk in the region need to do more to prevent an outbreak by improving biosecurity at poultry farms. This should include controlling the movement of personnel and the movement of birds that may contain the virus. Given the potential harm to Australia’s health and economic security, the government must demonstrate leadership within the region. A comprehensive regional strategy on avian flu would help Australia identify the gaps in regional capacity to deal with a future pandemic in our own region and enable us to target appropriate assistance through AusAID’s annual budget of $1.8 billion.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">For example, there are fears that avian flu could spread through Indonesia reaching Papua province and then Papua New Guinea, bringing it much closer to Australian shores. In this context, Australia has a clear interest in doing more to ensure the preparedness of our closest neighbours—Indonesia, East Timor and Papua New Guinea—for an outbreak of the virus. Robert Webster, who holds a chair in virology at St Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, was quoted in a recent <inline font-style="italic">New Yorker</inline> article. He has been studying avian influenza of the decades. Nobody knows more about the origins of the virus, how it changes or what those changes might mean. He is regarded as an international expert. He said, and I will conclude with his quote:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">“This is the worst flu virus I have ever seen or worked with or read about. We have to prepare as if we are going to war—and the public needs to understand that clearly. This virus is playing its role as a natural bioterrorist. The politicians are going to say Chicken Little is at it again. And, if I’m wrong, then thank God. But if it does happen, and I fully expect that it will, there will be no place for any of us to hide. Not in the United States or in Europe or in a bunker somewhere. The virus is a very promiscuous and efficient killer. That much we have known since 1997.</para>

<para>—I rise today to debate <inline ref="R2036">Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2004-2005,</inline> <inline ref="R2279">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2004-2005</inline> and <inline ref="R2278">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2004-2005</inline>. In addition to the usual funding allocation for parliamentary departments, these bills are needed to begin paying for some of the reckless spending undertaken by the government to secure their fourth term. I would like to use my time here today to highlight some of the areas where I believe the government have misallocated their funds and set wrong priorities. I would like to begin by adding my name to the growing list of people who are concerned about the effect some of the government’s more flamboyant spending will have. I am particularly concerned about the effects on families in my electorate. A brief look at the budget of a family in the electorate of Canberra will reveal a familiar pattern of expenses: mortgage repayments, car repayments, child-care costs and private health insurance are all common features. Taxpayers have been given the nickname of ‘Howard’s battlers’. The Prime Minister can be especially proud of that nom de plume right now because, thanks to him and his government, battling is exactly what many of them are now doing.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">During the last election campaign the Prime Minister and the coalition parties campaigned on one central issue and one central promise or undertaking—that a Liberal government would keep interest rates low. The Prime Minister toured the country with the words ‘keeping interest rates low’ etched into his plastic podium. Negative attack adds cluttered our airwaves with half truths and accusations designed to scare people paying off large mortgages. Throughout the campaign the Prime Minister’s spin doctors were always ready with statistics quoting the amount of extra money families would supposedly pay each month if a Labor government were elected. Voters everywhere were led to believe that a re-elected Howard government would not put upward pressure on interest rates. This was despite Labor election promises being dwarfed by the coalition’s $66 billion spending spree. Now that the election is behind us and the dust has cleared, the podium has been packed away—perhaps in the same place as that famous debt truck, wherever that has been packed away. What about the Prime Minister’s promise? How does the government plan to keep interest rates down? Simply put: maybe it cannot.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Now we are faced with another tap-dancing act from the Prime Minister as he tries desperately to make the Australian people forget that once again he promised something which he probably cannot deliver. Now he blames the Reserve Bank, he blames the world economy and he tries to explain away the key promise of that election. This behaviour has become standard procedure for the Prime Minister. After four terms in office his pattern has become as predictable as the tide: say and do whatever it takes to win the election and then when called to account for his behaviour back-pedal, obfuscate and do whatever it takes to confuse the issue until it blows over. The Australian Prime Minister has shown no remorse, indeed he has stuck to his story on the airwaves, on television and here in this place, hoping against hope that the opposition and the Australian people will not remember that plastic podium and his latest non-core undertaking.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Australians paying off their mortgages are right to be afraid of a rise in interest rates. Personal debt has exploded over recent years under this government and even the slightest rise in interest rates will have a devastating effect on many families. The average size of a home loan taken out in December 2004 in the ACT was $234,600. Assuming a 20-year term and an interest rate of 7.05 per cent, the monthly repayment would be $1,826. At an interest rate of 7.30 per cent the monthly repayment rises to $1,861, which is a $35 increase. This is just the average. A quick glance at any real estate agent’s window in Canberra will tell you that it would very difficult to get a house for $234,000 here. For a young family paying off a house in Tuggeranong, in my electorate, the interest rate increase will have a real impact on their weekly finances. The price of the government’s re-election has to be paid for by someone. Unfortunately, it appears that the cost will be borne by those who are probably least able to afford it.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I now turn to the issue of private health insurance, which sadly balances very well against the issue of interest rates. Private health funds recently received the green light from the federal minister for health to increase their fees, adding to the list of increased costs faced by families in my electorate and around the country. This increase is the highest since the Howard government introduced the private health insurance rebate and is the fourth consecutive annual rise. Canberra families will be forced to choose between paying almost eight per cent more for their private health insurance, choosing a lower level of cover or possibly dropping out of the private system altogether.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Along with the cost of insurance, the out-of-pocket costs that are not covered by the gap are increasing. The government can run as many publicly funded advertisements with pretty umbrellas—I remember them well—as they want, but the fact of the matter is that private medical insurance is becoming more expensive in Australia. The private health funds state publicly that an increase in premiums is needed to cover the rising cost of claims, hardly an unbelievable assertion considering the logic behind the government’s plan to get more and more people into the private system. They expected younger people who are healthy to take up private health insurance and, because they are healthy and rarely need to claim, the insurance company would have an increased profit because it would not have as many claims to pay. Then the company would take the profit from those younger folk who do not claim and use it to subsidise those members who claim more often or who claim for more expensive treatments. The problem is that when you hit them with interest rate rises, drive up personal debt and threaten their job security, these people are going to look for ways to cut costs from their budget. When faced with the choice between paying for school books and paying for health insurance, paying for health insurance is less likely to stay in the budget.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As the cost of private health insurance climbs, it will get harder for people to pay their premiums. As more and more people are forced, once again, back into the public hospital system, the pressure on our hospitals and GP clinics will increase and the gap between public and private treatment quality will continue to widen. I ask two questions: where does the health minister think the system is going and how far is he willing to let it go? The health insurance rebate came with promises from government that costs would be held down, that health services would improve. But what do I see? In my community, I see ever-increasing private health insurance costs and elderly public patients waiting months, if not years, for a hip replacement while their counterparts, who can afford insurance, are being treated sooner. It is a really serious issue: a two-tier system becoming a system of those who can afford treatment and those who have to wait. I call it a very unhealthy health system. It is something that I believe we all need to be very concerned about.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Another issue of concern which was talked about earlier today is child care. Child-care workers in Australia earn less than people in most other occupations. In November last year the ABS advised that child-care workers had an average full-time weekly wage of $424.10, which equals just over $22,000 a year. In January this year, after two years of hearings, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission finally approved an increase of $64.50 per week for qualified workers and $82.20 per week for diploma certified child-care workers. While the increased pay is obviously very welcome—and I applaud the AIRC on its long overdue decision—child-care workers’ wages are still amongst the lowest in the country.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Child-care providers in Australia are extremely dedicated to their work. They have to be. When you know that Woolworths will give you more money to pack shelves than the wage you receive for looking after children, you really do need to be committed to stay in the profession. Unfortunately, the turnover rate of staff of 27.5 per cent highlights the simple truth that commitment alone will not pay their bills. Members on my side of the House will continue to fight for better conditions for child-care workers in Australia, and I hope that the government will recognise the need for greater funding and start providing the level of support these people deserve.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As if the situation faced by healthy children in child care was not bad enough, I understand also that the Minister for Family and Community Services is planning to review the in-home care program which, amongst other things, provides care for profoundly disabled children who cannot be cared for by a mainstream service or facility. How on earth are these children supposed to receive the level of care they need if the government stops funding their carers? The answer is that families will be expected to pick up the extra burden. Parents that are already full-time carers and exist on the small amount of funding they currently receive will be stretched even further. At what point will this government recognise that being in power means you have a responsibility to all Australians and that the funds the government cuts affect people who deserve better?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Hard decisions have to be made in government—we all know that—but I would have thought that threatening to cut funding that benefits the families of disabled children was beyond the pale, even for the current executive. I would have thought that providing for our children was more important than dredging a creek to shore up numbers. I will reflect on that a bit further. In recent months, in the latter part of last year, I had the absolute privilege of visiting a small number of families that have a profoundly disabled young child. The pressure on those families—the costs involved and the way that the whole family ends up being involved in the care of that one little person—is enormous. What those families need is a government that will come in underneath them, support them and offer whatever it can, not a government that, for some ridiculous reason, puts pressure on them and threatens the funding that supports those families. I plead with the government to think very carefully before it goes down that road. It is a very dangerous trip to take. It is entirely unacceptable, and I would suggest unfair and un-Australian, to the families concerned.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In my reply to the Governor-General’s speech last month I spoke about the unfortunate comments of the Minister for Workforce Participation regarding coercing disability support pension recipients off the pension and into work. His comments were based on a pilot study that provided intensive assistance to DSP recipients that wanted to find work. The pilot study report is publicly available and has received coverage in the mainstream press. I will point out just a few problems with the minister’s argument. Almost half of the DSP recipients initially interviewed were excluded before they could participate in the program. Less than half of the pilot participants were placed in work or education. Of those lucky enough to be placed, only 22 per cent found full-time work, with 31 per cent being placed in part-time work, 39 per cent in casual employment and eight per cent beginning some sort of education program. While these figures may look promising at first glance, consider this: initially 1,130 people were met by the providers involved in the study. Of those 1,130, 239 had been placed in either work or education when the pilot study report was published on the department’s web site in December 2004.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The minister expects us to believe that, because 239 out of approximately 1,000 DSP recipients who wanted to find work and were enthusiastic enough to volunteer for the pilot, and believed they could do it were placed in some sort of work or education, all DSP recipients should be put under greater pressure. We have all heard of the carrot-and-stick analogy for motivation: reward those people who try to find work and punish those who try to play the system. Of course people with a disability would prefer to work. Of course they would prefer a life different from the one they have. Of course they wish to participate fully in our community, and many do despite their disability. Of course they should be supported in their endeavours. However, when I hear the Minister for Workforce Participation talk about using coercion to move people off the disability pension, it is difficult to see the future in a positive light. What is the real agenda here? Is it cost saving? Will it save money? Is it just deciding to wedge a particular group in our society for political purposes, to get on the back of people with a disability, or is there a real, honest, genuine reform agenda? I need the government, as do many people, to state its true claims in this regard.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The ACT is often described as a public service town. While it is true that many government departments are based here, Canberra residents hold a wide range of jobs and our economy is sustained by many industries. We have cooks, plumbers and lawyers; we have teachers, waiters and electricians. Canberra residents fill the same jobs found in any other inland city and will prosper or suffer along with the rest of the country after 1 July. Attacks on unions, job security, workers rights and the Industrial Relations Commission have already started and can be expected to increase soon after the Senate changeover. When the current government gains control of the upper house, I fear that residents of my electorate will find themselves in the firing line, along with many other Australians.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The industrial relations system is designed to protect the rights of Australian workers while allowing business to function. Minimum conditions and the minimum wage are based on hearings in front of the IRC and discussions between employee groups and employers. I fear that the time of basing these decisions on careful argument and the best interests of all parties is about to end. We hear members of the government suggesting that minimum conditions should be set at a national level. We hear members opposite expressing their belief that we should be legislating national standards independent of the IRC. Suggestions reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> recently include cutting the number of workplace conditions determined by the AIRC to between six and 12, depending on who you ask. Once again the government is hoping that the Australian people will not look too deeply into its plans. There are already far too many Australians who have jobs yet exist below the poverty line. There are far too many people for whom the slightest financial squeeze will make a huge difference. The IR system is here to protect Australian employees, and now more than ever they need protection.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I note that Appropriation Bill (No. 3) contains extra funding for the Job Network. The Job Network will certainly grow if this government gets its way. The Liberal Party has continually made clear its intention to overturn unfair dismissal legislation as it applies to small business. Members on our side of the House, along with unions and employees set to have their jobs threatened, wonder how anyone could possibly be in favour of unfair dismissal and offer no protection.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The flow-on effects from the government’s IR reforms have the potential, in my view, to devastate families, local economies and the Australian culture as we know it. Instead of introducing legislation that blind Freddy can see is going to hurt employees and their families, why don’t we consider the following? Don’t take away job security when the economy is looking shaky and don’t believe for a second that workers rights in Australia were achieved through the random benevolence of employers. We need to really think where conditions for employees in this country came from. Rather than ridicule our history, we have to look carefully at how we can make our country better in the future rather than threaten it.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">When you take interest rate rises, attacks on workers’ rights and the rising costs of health care and private health insurance and then throw in a slowing economy, the future is not quite as bright as we would like to see. With a greater amount of time, I could have covered many other areas that I believe need attention—for example, HECS increases, family tax benefit debts and effective tax rates that hinder welfare recipients in their attempts to move from welfare to work. These are just some of the subjects that have been canvassed by other speakers in this place and warrant further careful discussion.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I believe very strongly that this government needs to stop coasting on what it sees as its past accomplishments without recognising the massive economic reforms that took place under the Labor governments of Hawke and Keating—which is a statement of absolute fact, despite the present government’s arguments to the contrary. The government needs to stop squandering the opportunities provided by that history and to stop investing in Tumbi Creek dredging. It should be creating proper infrastructure in this country—real serious stuff that is going to have an effect on all of our families and all of our workers and on our economic prospects for the future. If we started to do that, I would have a far more positive view of the future than, sadly, I have at the moment.</para>

<para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2279">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2004-2005</inline> and related bills. During the election campaign, the Prime Minister constructed a political campaign that gave the electors of this country the impression that interest rates would not rise under a Liberal-National coalition government. That was the subliminal message that the Liberal Party campaign pumped out only a few short months ago. Australia now faces the prospect of even higher interest rates and higher inflation, which is a direct result of the government’s complacency and sheer laziness. The government has always been aware of the skills shortages. The government has been aware of infrastructure bottlenecks. But it sat on its hands and has simply been smug, lazy and complacent.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">We have heard Treasurer Costello and Mr Howard continually deny that there is a problem with the current account deficit. They have blamed the situation on the dollar and the drought. The Treasurer would have us believe that the Labor states are the main contributors to the current worsening of the economy. He has set up a smokescreen to attempt to divert attention away from his incompetence by his outrageous claims that the states are in breach of the original GST agreement.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">What the Treasurer has not said is that the Victorian state Labor government has exceeded its GST charter by abolishing financial institutions duty, quoted marketable securities duty and, from 1 July this year, bank account debit tax as per the GST agreement. In total, those tax cuts amount to in excess of a billion dollars a year. In addition, Victoria has abolished duty on non-residential leases, representing about $50 million or $60 million a year; abolished duty on unquoted marketable securities; and, last financial year, abolished stamp duty on mortgages, which alone represents approximately $230 million a year in savings for home owners.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The truth—something that this Treasurer avoids at all cost—indicates that by 2005 the states will undertake a series of other measures, including removing levies on quoted marketable securities, and also undertake to review bank account debit tax duties on leases, including on residential leases, duties on mortgages and stamp duty on business conveyancing—representing something in the order of $500 million per annum. As I said earlier, the truth is that the Victorian state government has already achieved—and in some instances exceeded—its requirements under the GST agreement and is well on the way to full compliance within the time frame set out in that agreement. Victorians this year will pay $9.4 billion in GST to the Commonwealth and will get back just $7.8 billion. The two states that drive more than two-thirds of Australia’s economy, Victoria and New South Wales, are penalised by this Treasurer’s method of distributing this huge Howard government GST rip-off.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">And what a rip-off it is. What has worsened this appalling tax grab by the highest taxing federal government in our history is the squandering of over $66 billion of hard-earned taxpayer funds to buy their way back into government. We have already seen compelling evidence that the government used these resources to pork-barrel in their marginal and targeted seats. No doubt we will see more evidence over the coming months.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This could have been a good opportunity to start to address poverty, something more and more Australians are experiencing as a direct result of the Howard government’s economic policies. By any measure, poverty is a significant and growing problem in Australia. Over 2.5 million Australians are living below the poverty line. One million Australians have some work but not enough to lift them out of poverty. Labor is serious about tackling growing poverty and inequality. In order to put the spotlight on the issue and to canvass a range of solutions, the Labor Party established a Senate inquiry into poverty which concluded in March 2004, with a final report entitled <inline font-style="italic">A hand up not a hand out: renewing the fight against poverty</inline>. The report was tabled in the parliament last year. It represented the first thorough investigation of poverty and financial disadvantage in 30 years. It found unacceptable levels of poverty and hardship in our community. After 13 years of continuous economic growth, these outcomes should not be tolerated. In tackling poverty, Labor, as always, has committed itself to action, not just words.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Our nation needs to develop a whole-of-government agenda and a community action plan like that which Labor outlined for the 2004 election. The federal government should engage with state and territory governments, churches and community groups to develop a plan of action to tackle poverty. Former Labor leader Mark Latham wrote to all premiers and territory leaders last year to seek their support for a partnership—through the Council of Australian Governments, COAG—to pursue policies that would reduce the level of poverty we currently face. In July 2004, the then Leader of the Opposition and each of the state and territory leaders signed a communique committing to put poverty on the agenda of COAG. Labor had also agreed to hold a summit of political, church and community leaders to devise a national plan for tackling poverty. For years church leaders have requested that action be taken to address growing poverty in our community. Labor is the only political party that pledged to support such action.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The endless debate about poverty measures and poverty lines is used by those who try to deny there is a problem and a need for action. A future Labor government would be accountable for the level of poverty in our community. We are prepared to measure our efforts to tackle the problem. Labor committed to develop a comprehensive set of poverty reduction targets across all areas of government. The targets concern living standards, income poverty and income inequality; unemployment, long-term unemployment and employment security; skill and educational participation, attainment and competence; health status and access to health services; access to affordable housing; and available and affordable child care, aged care and disability services.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">A future Labor government will again make a significant investment in services that assist in tackling poverty. For example, prior to the last federal election Labor announced $1.9 billion funding for health to boost Medicare and increase bulk-billing rates and $300 million for a Commonwealth dental scheme to provide up to 1.3 million additional dental procedures for people on low incomes; $2.4 billion funding for education, including an additional 20,000 university places and 20,000 TAFE places; and $1.4 billion funding for labour market and literacy programs and new affordable housing.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Affordable and accessible health care is essential in addressing poverty. For this reason Labor is determined to lift the bulk-billing rate from 67 per cent to 80 per cent so that every Australian can afford to see a doctor when they are sick. Poor dental health can cause other medical complications and it strips the unemployed of work opportunities and dignity. Labor’s national dental scheme would have ensured that people on low incomes did not miss out on basic dental health care. I will have more to say on dental care shortly.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Access to a decent education lifts children out of poverty, and post-school qualifications are the best safeguard against long periods of unemployment. That is why Labor announced a policy to boost the number of university places by 20,000 and the number of TAFE places by a similar amount. Labor also pledged to reverse the Howard government’s 25 per cent university fee hikes. Labor also pledged to provide rent assistance to students aged 25 and over receiving Austudy and to reduce the age of independence for Youth Allowance from 25 to 24 years. Labor pledged to invest $400 million to help secure affordable housing for low-income earners. This $400 million would have delivered an additional 11,350 new homes for low-income families and new housing partnerships aimed at delivering 9,000 units of affordable housing. Under Labor’s national strategy for housing, additional funding would have been made available for homeless people and for Indigenous housing projects.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Labor committed to a $700 million youth guarantee to assist young people who leave school early. Under Labor’s plan, all 15- to 18-year-olds would get support to either study at school, TAFE or university or be in a job or apprenticeship. Labor also committed to invest an additional $212 million in programs and support for the mature-age unemployed. Labor announced a commitment to a universal tax-free baby care payment for new parents which would have been indexed to net minimum wages. In addition to this payment, Labor announced an $80 million Read Aloud scheme which would have provided reading material for young children and access to literacy programs for their parents. Some $10.2 million was earmarked for playgroups for parents of young children and $33 million to fund 10,000 mentors for young Australians. Labor committed to providing more early childhood and preventative services to reduce the number of disadvantaged children who potentially end up becoming disadvantaged adults. Labor listened to the churches and front-line agencies like St Vincent de Paul, Anglicare and UnitingCare, who advocated for greater action in tackling poverty.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Howard government committed one of its worst acts of vandalism when it abolished the former Keating Labor government’s Commonwealth Dental Health Program in 1996. It continues to ignore its responsibility to provide dental care for low-income Australians. The Howard government has a mean-spirited attitude towards low and medium-income families, especially those who reside in non-coalition electorates. Many Australians do not seek dental appointments because they simply cannot afford them. A national survey found that one-third of Australians in the $30,000 to $50,000 household income bracket had not been to a dentist for over two years, due to their inability to pay. Poor dental health means pain, inconvenience, poor general health, embarrassment and discrimination. Despite state governments’ increasing expenditure on dental programs, there is now a huge unmet demand for publicly funded dental programs.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In May 1998, the Senate Community Affairs References Committee report on public dental services found that when the Commonwealth Dental Health Program was abolished there were approximately 380,000 Australians waiting an average of six months for public dental care. By May 2000, that figure had blown out to half a million people waiting for between eight months and five years for public dental care. It has now blown out to over six years for clinics that service people in my electorate of Bendigo. The collection of national figures has since been scrapped so there are now no records kept at a national level.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Labor has always believed that Australia should use the prosperity that the coalition is always bragging about to help these people get the basic health and dental care they need and deserve. Labor had pledged to invest $300 million in Australian Dental Care, over four years. My colleague the member for Lalor was one of the architects of that great policy. I am sure it is a policy we will be happy to take into the next election as well. This would have resulted in $120 million per year for our program when it was fully operational. Labor agreed to work in partnership with the states and the territories to implement Australian Dental Care—a genuine partnership with the states and territories that would have delivered services to agreed national benchmarks. This would have provided up to 1,300,000 extra dental procedures for Australians, enough to clear the existing backlog and substantially reduce the waiting lists. Many people on the waiting lists for dental care are elderly. We can do better as a nation and a government to make sure that they have their suffering dealt with as soon as possible.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Labor’s plan would have revived Ben Chifley’s vision. He inserted an amendment into the Constitution in 1946 that said affordable dental treatment was as essential as other medical treatments. Dental care is a national responsibility—something the Prime Minister would have us believe he has discovered. The changes announced last year by the health minister are a weak attempt at a political fix in the run-up to the 2004 federal election. The Prime Minister has left Australia as a waiting list country with a waiting list government. The Howard government has allocated a miserable $5 million per year for four years, and only for dental patients with additional chronic health illnesses caused by their dental problems. These patients must suffer dental related chronic health problems for six months before they can get assistance. For pensioners and low- to middle-income earners this amounts to nothing less than torture.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Under Labor’s plan, the federal and state governments would have combined together in a great national effort to fix the dental health crisis. Under Labor’s plan, concession card holders—such as pensioners, health care card holders and their dependants—would have received free check-ups when they need them as well as subsidised dental treatments, restorations and dentures. Labor’s plan would also have assessed the dental health of every person admitted to residential care and put in place an action plan to provide ongoing care, something that Deputy Speaker Bronwyn Bishop would realise is badly needed, given that she is a former Minister for Aged Care.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">On 28 June last year Frew abattoirs in Kyneton announced that they would shut down most of their operations, resulting in 150 employees losing their jobs. The company had succumbed to the pressure caused by large export abattoirs dumping excess export products onto the domestic market at a much reduced price. Frew Kyneton provided meat products totally for the domestic market. The company had always enjoyed a good relationship with their employees and the union, and the decision to scale down their operations was a bitter blow to the company, meatworkers and their families as well as the Kyneton economy. Kyneton meatworkers with families who received part of their termination payment in the previous financial year ran the risk of incurring substantial Centrelink debt under the Howard government’s unfair family payment system. Some former employees at Frew in Kyneton received part of their termination package in this financial year and obviously did not factor in the amounts when previously applying for family payment benefits under the current system. These workers could not have predicted the situation they found themselves in and, through no fault of their own, will have to pay back large sums under the government’s grossly unfair family payments system.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In letters to the relevant ministers and departments I requested some concessions be given, given these appalling circumstances. But I have now been informed that the Howard government, through the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration and member for Murray, Dr Sharman Stone, has rejected my request and refused to grant approval to waive these debts. This is yet another example of just how callous and unfair the Howard government’s family payment system is in its current form. These workers who have worked hard and under difficult circumstances have been penalised through no fault of their own because of this government’s mean spirited attitude to working Australians. This coalition government has about as much compassion as the Third Reich when considering the plight of Australian workers.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In conclusion, I want to take this opportunity to draw this parliament’s attention to a recent decision by the Australian Broadcasting Authority regarding an application to a test transmission from Strengthening Goldfields Community Radio in my electorate of Bendigo. They submitted an application to the Australian Broadcasting Authority for a temporary community broadcasting licence for the Maryborough community on 15 July 2004. A letter was received by the SGCR from the ABA on 15 September 2004 requesting more information about community support et cetera. A supplement to the application, including more support information, was submitted to the Australian Broadcasting Authority on 1 October 2004.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Notification was received from the ABA on 24 November 2004, via Telstra, rejecting the Strengthening Goldfields Community Radio’s application for a temporary community broadcasting licence stating that the frequency that SGCR proposed to use would interfere with Sunbury community radio. A letter to the Strengthening Goldfields Community Radio confirming the rejection of the application for a temporary community broadcasting licence was received on 17 January 2005. The reason given for the rejection is that the frequency identified by Strengthening Goldfields Community Radio has the potential to interfere with 3VYV Yarra Valley co-channel and government requirements for more ABC services in the area.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">So this application was refused because, according to the ABA, it had the potential to interfere with another transmission emanating from miles away. All Strengthening Goldfields Community Radio asked for was permission to broadcast a low-powered test transmission to ascertain if the ABA’s decision was based on a fact, and it was refused. If ever there was a need for an investigation into an organisation, the ABA must be the perfect example. This organisation always seems to go out of its way to block worthwhile community initiatives and usually based on the flimsiest of evidence. It is time there was a worthwhile examination of its role to see if it is adequately serving the communities that it is supposed to.</para>

<para>—I believe this debate on <inline ref="R2279">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2004-2005</inline> and related bills and the additional portfolio estimates for 2004-05 gives us an appropriate opportunity to review where the Howard government is up to with implementing its health policy platform. Before the 2004 election, people would have frequently heard me saying—in this place and also around the country—that the Minister for Health and Ageing, Mr Abbott, was a political fixer, that he had been put in there to try and deal with the Howard government’s serious political problems in the health portfolio but that he lacked a vision for the longer term. It pains me to say that, surprisingly, I am now longing for the good old days when I could make that criticism of Minister Abbott. At least in the good old days—whilst I disagreed with what Minister Abbott was doing and whilst I thought it was all short-term, quick political fixes and fundamentally flawed—Minister Abbott was doing something. Now, post election, Minister Abbott has given up on health—his ideas and energies are elsewhere and he is doing absolutely nothing at all.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">For an insight into Minister Abbott’s thinking, I suggest to members in the House that they need to mark late January in their calendar as the time when they will receive the words from on high, from the hill—January is when Minister Abbott makes his annual address to the Young Liberals conference. Why Minister Abbott is always a speaker at the Young Liberals conference and other ministers do not appear to get a guernsey on the agenda is a matter about which I could only speculate. However, I notice that from time to time there is speculation in the media that it is something to do with numbers in the Liberal Party and recruiting. These are not matters for me to discuss, but I am sure they are things that members of the Liberal Party in the House might well have a view on. So Minister Abbott—year in, year out—turns up at the Young Liberals conference in January and he gives an address. On 18 January 2003 Minister Abbott—of course, he was then in his former portfolio as Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations—gave an impassioned address about the need to address the high effective marginal tax rates that people face, which discourage them from making the transition from welfare to work. It was an impassioned address, but in policy terms what actually happened? Unfortunately, the record shows absolutely nothing.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Then, in 2004, Minister Abbott came to give the address to the Young Liberals. At that stage he was the minister for health but clearly did not have a big health policy picture to outline to the Young Liberals. Instead, obviously inspired by having seen the Russell Crowe film <inline font-style="italic">Master and Commander: the Far Side of the World</inline>, he engaged in an address which somewhat heroically, you would have to say, and in a fairly laboured fashion, manages to compare the Prime Minister to Russell Crowe—not a comparison that would be top of mind in many people’s summary of the two. I do not think I have ever had anybody say to me that they found it difficult to work out which one was the Prime Minister and which one was Russell Crowe. Maybe there is someone who has laboured under that difficulty, but I have never met them. If there is someone who has laboured under that difficulty, then they would make a good friend for Minister Abbott, who said in this address:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">But if Crowe had played an Australian prime minister handling contemporary challenges in much the same way—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">that is, when he cuts a sailor down and loses his life to save the rest of the boat—</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">it’s certain the moral guardians would have damned him for having blood on his hands, sacrificing another to save himself and looking after his influential mate rather than everyone else.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">We probably all remember the scene from the film and, if anybody chooses to get it out on DVD, I invite them to make the comparison between Russell Crowe and the Prime Minister and see how far they get.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Interestingly, the minister’s mind had turned back to federal policy by the Young Liberals conference this year—something for which I am sure we would all be grateful, given his ability to review films. In this, he manages to get out the following line of health policy. He says that he wants federal funding to be matched by federal control in a range of unspecified joint projects, beginning with hospitals. He specifically said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Once the Commonwealth Government is engaged in any particular area of responsibility, how can it avoid the demand to provide leadership? These questions are likely to consume a great deal of time and energy during the Howard Government’s fourth term.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">That was Minister Abbott in late January this year speaking to the Young Liberals conference, reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 24 January. So, there is Minister Abbott in late January filled with grand dreams about the Howard government, the federal government, showing leadership in the area of health, and this is going to be a grand project that is going to take much of the time and energy of the Howard government during its fourth term. Well, it was with some surprise that I found, basically a month and a day later, that Minister Abbott had completely changed his mind. The grand plan was abandoned—not the sort of stout resolve that I suspect Russell Crowe would have shown in comparable circumstances. Minister Abbott, in late January convinced of the need for a new grand plan for health, by late February—25 February to be precise—has come to completely the reverse conclusion. Minister Abbott, in his speech to the CEDA conference on that day, said the following:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Federal Government can’t make the states run their public hospitals better (at least during the life of the current Health Care Agreements). The Government can’t force private doctors, private hospitals and private health funds to act in their mutual self-interest if they’re determined to be hairy-chested with each other.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">There may be a small influence of Russell Crowe in that. He goes on:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Often, despite the power of the purse, the Federal Health Minister is little more than a kind of constitutional monarch limited, in Bagehot’s words, to the right “to be consulted, to encourage and to warn.”</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">We know that the question of constitutional monarchy is one that is always close to the heart of the current minister for health and, I know, it is close to the hearts of other members in this place. Whilst I do not share their view, I admire their enthusiasm for what inevitably will be a lost cause in Australian politics. But I do not think that I have ever heard a government minister before compare themself to being a constitutional monarch. Minister Abbott appeared to be having some sort of Princess Mary moment.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">When Minister Abbott was having that Princess Mary moment, he was effectively saying that, even though he is the Minister for Health and Ageing, he is basically content to sit on the sidelines and do absolutely nothing; that he is going to be consulted and will perhaps encourage and warn but is not intending to act in any way, shape or form. I do not think the Australian taxpayers pay Minister Abbott as our Minister for Health and Ageing to be consulted, to encourage and to warn, and we already have Princess Mary, so we do not need a pale imitation. What we need is for Minister Abbott to do his job, which is to run the health system. But that is a job that he appears completely unwilling to do.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I wish for the good old days when Minister Abbott was at least doing something. Now he does nothing whatsoever. Let us go through the list of things that Minister Abbott is not doing. We know that he is not properly scrutinising private health insurance premium increases, because year after year—just as he did last week—he goes out for a press conference and with a self-deprecating shrug of the shoulders basically says: ‘All prices go up. C’est la vie; such is life. That’s very difficult.’ That is Minister Abbott’s approach. He does not actually do any of the things necessary to change the private health insurance system. He is full of criticisms of anybody who has a public policy solution to the sustainability of the private health insurance system. For example, he was very critical of Labor’s Medicare Gold policy, despite the fact that it would have decreased private health insurance premiums for Australian contributors by 12 per cent and would have saved $500 million a year in wasted expenditure because older Australians end up in public hospital beds when they do not need to be there.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Amongst the list of things that Minister Abbott is not doing, he is not doing anything about keeping private health insurance premiums down, even though the Howard government promised to do that—particularly at the 2001 election, when it actually promised to reduce premiums. Minister Abbott is not doing any of that. He is just standing by on the sidelines, shrugging his shoulders on cue. He most certainly is not doing anything to fix the fact that $500 million each year is wasted because older Australians end up in acute hospital beds when they do not need to be there; he is not doing anything about that.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">His indifference to the task appears to be having an impact on the management of health issues by the department of health. During Senate estimates hearings only weeks ago the department confirmed that resources were being stripped away from areas such as GP research and work on quality and support for private health care. The secretary, Ms Halton, admitted to budget cuts in areas such as GP research and data collection and to declining support for quality initiatives in the private sector, but she managed to make a number of statements about ‘core business’ and doing the ‘important things’. One can wonder what the ‘important things’ are that the department is doing if it is not supporting GP research, work on quality and support for private health care and data collection. What is it that the department could possibly be doing that is actually an ‘important thing’ if it is not doing those things? We know that the department is not in the business of doing any modelling or policy development work, and it is increasingly not collecting data that would assist in those processes.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">On the list of things that Minister Abbott is not doing is this: he is not reviewing the health system and working out the reform agenda, because the Prime Minister gave that job to someone else immediately after the election. Maybe the Prime Minister was the first to realise that Minister Abbott was going to adopt a constitutional monarch approach for this three years of his portfolio and so decided that if he wanted someone to review health and come up with some policy answers he needed to get someone else. He now has Mr Podger conducting the Podger review, and the department verified at Senate estimates that it is having nothing to do with the Prime Minister’s review which is being led by Mr Podger.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">What more evidence do you need that the policy input of the minister for health is not only nonexistent but apparently not wanted, other than the fact that the Prime Minister is running the Podger review and the department of health, under Minister Abbott’s stewardship, is having absolutely nothing to do with it. If Minister Abbott objects to this apparent emasculation of his role in the future of health reform, he has not said it publicly—and he most certainly cannot have said it to the Prime Minister. At the same time we find that, when it comes to the PBS, health policy does not get run by Minister Abbott; it gets run by the Department of Finance and Administration. We know that when the government decided, in the middle of the election campaign, to make hundreds of millions of dollars of savings on the PBS and sought to impose a 12.5 per cent cut on the price of generic drugs to generate that saving—that saving being directed to funding a quickly cobbled together measure because the government was worried about votes bleeding off it from older Australians because of Medicare Gold—that was driven entirely out of Finance. That continues to be the case. Here we have a Minister for Health and Ageing who is not in control of health policy on an area as important as the PBS.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">At the same time we have Finance apparently fattening up Medibank Private for sale. Once again, this is something that the minister for health does not appear to have anything to do with. You would think that, if you were going to sit there as the minister for health—as a constitutional monarch waiting for someone to consult you so that you could encourage or warn but not actually do anything—you would manage to run a pretty lean office and department because they would not be doing very much. But Minister Abbott is managing to pull a remarkable trick: he is doing less work. The work is done by others; it is most certainly not done by his department. It is done by everybody else but his department—by the Prime Minister’s department and the finance department. Minister Abbott is doing less work but departmental staff numbers are up and so are consultancy fees. This means that, while the department is doing less policy development work, it may be outsourcing more but with no apparent savings for the department. This would suggest that the minister has turned the department into administrative bureaucracy that outsources all new work but has managed to do that in a setting where he has achieved no savings and no apparent benefits in terms of the quality of advice or policy. I would think that these things are very concerning for those who follow the health policy debate.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We are going to have a complete absence of Commonwealth leadership on something as important as health policy during the life of the Howard government because Minister Abbott does not want to get it done. If he did want to get it done, there are certainly enough challenges on the minister’s table. In that regard, the following challenges need to be addressed, and need to be addressed soon. We obviously have a circumstance where better support is required for the public hospital system. That has been true since the Howard government ripped $970 million out of the health care agreements. It was even more true after the Howard government ripped a further $400 million out by revising the wage-cost index that it was going to use. More support is needed for our public hospitals from a minister who does not just talk about the need for reform periodically when he needs a one-liner and muses about the Commonwealth taking over the public hospital system. We need that reform to be diligently pursued by someone who is interested in doing it. We need reform of the private health insurance system to make private health insurance affordable for Australian families. No-one is doing that task. We need someone to do the hard policy work on the PBS to work out how we are going to sustain our PBS over time, not someone who makes some quick individual savings. We need someone who is prepared to stump up to the huge challenge of the health and medical work force and the complete crisis in that work force.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">When people opened today’s newspapers they would have seen the absurdity that you can qualify for a bottle of Grange now if you can find a doctor. A work force agency is rewarding doctors with a bottle of Grange if they put them onto a lead which enables them to find an overseas doctor who might migrate to Australia. I do not think our medical work force issues should run off the provision of free and very expensive wine. I think our medical work force provision should run off proper planning, proper work force design, proper training and proper distribution. Minister Abbott is not looking at any of those issues and not making any policy changes that would make a difference to the lives of Australians when they need to see a doctor.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">At the same time, we have seen Minister Abbott’s policies from before the election—in the days when he was being the political fixer and not the constitutional monarch—start to unravel in a way that is costing, and costing dearly. The blow-out on the safety net is now a matter of public record. It is enormous. Every day you open the newspapers there is a new source of the blow-out. There has been more publicity on the blow-out figures during the course of this week. What we legitimately fear is that one of two things will happen: either the Howard government will cut other areas of health to keep funding the blow-out on the safety net or, at some point, in complete contradiction to its election commitments, it will prune back the safety net blow-out.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I warrant that when that happens it will be Treasury that is in control of it, not Minister Abbott. It is a legitimate expectation for Australians that ministers of the Howard government diligently do their job using the powers in their hands to do so. That is not something that Minister Abbott has shown any predisposition to do since the last election, and Australians require that job to be done.</para>

<para>—This debate on the <inline ref="R2279">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2004-2005</inline> and associated bills which deal with the budget appropriations takes place against a background of a slowing economic growth rate and a recent rise in interest rates. That is a rare conjunction of two events. Seldom in the course of the last 25 years have we seen a government so poorly manage events as to cause an increase in interest rates at the same time as our economy slows. It reminds many of us of the record of the current Prime Minister when he was Treasurer. He had an unchallenged record during that period. He is, I believe, the only Treasurer in the history of this country to record inflation and unemployment above 10 per cent at the same time. No other Treasurer in this country has ever managed to get things so wrong as to cause unemployment and inflation to both be above 10 per cent at once. There have been Treasurers who have presided over higher unemployment or higher inflation, but no-one else has performed so badly as Treasurer as to get both of them so wrong at the same time. That is what John Howard did when he was Treasurer. Events in the last couple of weeks have reminded us of that as we have seen interest rates rise at the same time as the economic data tell us that our economic growth is slowing.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">They also bring to mind the very dishonest way in which the government and the Liberal Party campaigned during the course of the last election over the question of interest rates. That has been a matter for some broader discussion in the parliament, so I will not dwell on it. But I do think that there are some important points that need to be recorded in this debate on the appropriations.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Whatever the crossing of the t’s and dotting of the i’s may show in terms of the record of events during the election campaign, there is no doubt in anyone’s mind about the message which this government, its members and the Liberal Party publicity machine sought to give to the Australian people. It was that record low interest rates would remain low under John Howard and the Liberal Party. ‘Vote for the Liberal Party and interest rates will not go up.’ That was the clear message being transmitted—I have to say by very sophisticated and effective means. I take my hat off to the people and the strategists in the Liberal Party who thought up some of that material; it was first-class but totally deceptive.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">At the time those things were being said in the campaign, economists around Australia were being interviewed and writing articles about their views on these things. All of them said the claims of the Liberal Party, the government and the Treasurer about these matters were nonsense. I will refer to a couple of those. One of the economists during the course of the election campaign made this comment:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Anyone promoting the forecast that mortgage rates will jump to 10 or 12 per cent is either dopey or dishonest or both.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">David Koch put it quite plainly in an article in August in the <inline font-style="italic">Sun Herald</inline> where he said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Any financial planner or stockbroker making the same claim as Peter Costello would go to jail under the current security laws.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">He did not pull any punches about the deception that the Liberal Party and their advocates were playing on the Australian people. Nor did 14 other economists who were surveyed at the time by Reuters. On 24 September last year Reuters conducted a survey of market economists, asking 14 of them whether they thought interest rates by the end of 2007 would be any different under a coalition or a Labor government. Not one forecast a difference in interest rates as a result of the election outcome.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I think the fair point to be made is that, whilst that issue was very effectively campaigned on as a political tool, it was done so dishonestly. The impressions that were given were clearly intended to produce fear and concern in the minds of people that were not substantiated by a thread of economic fact. The only thing from the election campaign that could possibly impact on interest rates was the extent of promises for spending commitments. Were the government of the day to go crazy and spend huge amounts of money beyond the nation’s capacity to pay, then of course that would put upwards pressure on inflation and interest rates. If you have a look at the detail of the commitments of the Labor Party on the one hand and the Liberal Party on the other, you discover that the Liberal Party promised to spend billions more than Labor.</para>

<para>—As I am reminded, there were $66 billion in election commitments in the course of less than 12 months. To the extent that governments do influence these things, the upward pressure was actually coming from the Liberal Party. In a debate on appropriations we should not forget the way in which that campaign was so dishonestly conducted.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para pgwide="yes">I want to refer to a more recent revelation. The government have now discovered that there is a skills shortage. This is not news to people in industry, people in trade unions or people in educational institutions. Having created the skills shortage over the course of the last decade through their neglect of education and training facilities, they now tell young Australians to just drop out of school at year 10 and become apprentices. That is the solution that ministers have offered for this crisis that was created by their own policies and lack of proper management. True to form, the government will blame anyone but themselves for this dilemma.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The issue of the skills shortage and how we got to this point is reasonably complex. There are a lot of reasons why there are difficulties in some trades areas in gaining the recruitment that is needed. I have listened with interest to the comments of a number of ministers in the parliament and outside about the skills shortage and their plea for school students to simply leave at year 10 and take up apprenticeships. I think they have absolutely the most frightening response to this situation, which will not provide a long-term solution and will in fact exacerbate our long-term skills shortage problems.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The proposal that people leave at year 10 forces 15- and 16-year-olds to make life-determining decisions that frankly are difficult for most to alter later in life. This government’s approach to lifelong learning has made it even more difficult for these people to alter those choices further down the track. It places people in an economic and employment straitjacket. It denies them the life skills and the cognitive problem-solving skills that higher secondary education does provide and which are essential in the 21st century. It is the wrong prescription.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There is no doubt that we need more skilled people, but I ask those ministers, Liberal and National Party members of parliament and corporate executives who are urging 15-year-olds to drop out of school after year 10: how many of them sit down with their 12- and 13-year-old daughters, sons and grandchildren and say, ‘Dear, what I want you to contemplate is not aspiring to go university. I think you should leave school after year 10 and take up an apprenticeship, say, as a carpenter or an electrician’? I have to say that electricians are a highly skilled group of people. How many of them have said: ‘My dear, loved grandchild, son or daughter aged 12, I don’t want you to look at completing year 12. I certainly don’t want you to look at going to university. I think you should turn your ambitions to leaving at year 10 and becoming a hairdresser, a forklift driver or whatever it might be.’</para>
<para pgwide="yes">All of these occupations are essential, and they are all undervalued, but there is monumental hypocrisy from the top end of town in this debate. The top end of town knows that the people who by and large drop out of school at age 15 or 16 come from families whose parents do not have a higher education. Typically they come from families with a low socioeconomic status. This is the worst possible form of social engineering. This is the ultraconservative management of our society telling people from working class backgrounds that they should not aspire to a different type of occupation or lifestyle from that in which they grew up. They are telling parents that they should not wish that for their children.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I happen to come from one of those families. My parents wished that for me, and I am very grateful that I had the opportunity. I am indignant that the government is trying to socially engineer a strict class-divided system that this country left behind somewhere in the 1960s—at least I hope it did. The OECD have done a number of reports on this matter, and the evidence is overwhelming. Their <inline font-style="italic">Education at a glance: OECD indicators 2004</inline> report said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Employment ratios rise with educational attainment in most OECD countries. With very few exceptions, the employment ratio for graduates of tertiary education is markedly higher than the ratio for upper secondary graduates.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">A simple and understood proposition is that, if you have a higher education, you have a much better chance of getting ahead in this world and getting a well-paid secure job. Elsewhere in the report it said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Employment ratios for females with less than lower secondary attainment are particularly low.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Girls are more disadvantaged than boys in a lot of these countries. There is more than ample evidence around the world, and there is more than ample evidence in Australia, to illustrate the point. The most recent Australian Bureau of Statistics labour market indicators report noted:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">For people without non-school qualifications, the unemployment rate was 7½ per cent. For those who had completed year 12, it was 10 per cent.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">There is a real difference in your employability, depending upon whether or not you complete year 12. Quoting further from the Australian Bureau of Statistics data:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">People who had completed year 12 generally experienced better labour market outcomes, as shown by higher labour force participation rates, higher employment to population ratios and lower unemployment rates than those who had not completed year 12.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">How much evidence does this government need to comprehend that turning people away from school at age 15 or 16 dramatically diminishes that person’s lifelong employment opportunities? Yet that was the answer we heard from minister after minister last week. This is not lost on our education community. The Australian Council for Educational Research, a highly respected body that is involved in education development, and research noted:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Those whose parents work in manual occupations, students from trade, skilled, semiskilled and unskilled occupational backgrounds have higher rates of early school leaving, particularly for boys.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">It also noted that about 20 per cent of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander students in the sample left school by the beginning of year 11, over twice the rate of other students.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There is an overwhelming case to encourage all of our students to complete year 12. Within those post-compulsory education years 11 and 12, many schools now offer a variety of courses, some of which include TAFE training programs, as part of the school curricula. This is a very positive step and, as the leader of the Labor Party commented in parliament this week, initiatives like that should be supported by this government, rather than opting for a 1960s white picket fence solution and telling people from working class backgrounds and families that they should just drop out of school when they are 15 years of age and become an apprentice because this government has mismanaged the labour market so badly.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In the few moments remaining, I want to turn to the question of the government’s other passion over the course of the last few weeks—no doubt to be given centre stage later this year—and that is industrial relations. In the process of dealing with the skilled labour work force or the lack thereof, the government have said, ‘We’ve got a problem with the labour market and all we have to do is change labour laws and that will fix the difficulties that we’re having in providing skilled workers.’ The bell was well and truly rung by Ross Gittins in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> a couple of weeks ago under the heading ‘Porkies used to support industrial relations “reform”’. Ross Gittins is not somebody I usually quote, but I have to say this article really did hit the nail on the head. He commented:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">Mr Costello gave a press conference on the day of the release of the Statement on Monetary Policy that was packed with misleading propositions. One of them was that, to ensure we kept inflation and, hence, interest rates down, we needed a lot more industrial relations reform to minimise excessive wage growth.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">That’s a non sequitur. It’s conflating a short-term macro-economic problem with a medium-term micro-economic reform.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">He went on to say:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">This is just Costello the dodgy barrister casting around for a simple, superficially plausible argument to convince the punters his IR changes will deliver instant benefits.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Elsewhere in the same article he said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">It’s possible Mr Costello spouts this economic illiteracy because he knows no better, being a barrister. But it’s hard to believe Treasury would have failed to brief him adequately.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">No, it’s more likely he’s dreamt up his own bit of convenient bulldust in the belief it will make the nasty medicine of labour-market deregulation easier for the mug punters to swallow.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">He did not miss the government, he did not miss the Treasurer and he was absolutely right. Let us have a look at the record of this government in supporting wage and salary earners at one end of the spectrum and then at the other. Average yearly earnings at the end of 1995, when Labor was last in office, were $28,934. The most recent figures for 2004 show that average yearly earnings are now $40,061. Over the period of roughly nine years there has been an increase of $10,314 in the average yearly earnings of Australian workers. Meanwhile, at the top end of town, what are the CEOs pulling in? The CEOs in 1995 had a total average remuneration package of $294,000. In 2004, CEOs were pulling in $475,873. That means CEOs over the term of this government have increased their remuneration package on average by $144,291.</para>

<para>—By $144,291. The average worker in this country gets $40,061. CEOs have had an increase more than three times the total average wage—not three times the increase of the average worker’s wage but three times their total wage. If you look at it by any other measure, you come up with the same disparity. In 1995, a CEO’s total package represented 10.1 times average weekly earnings. Today, it has grown to 11.8 times average weekly earnings. The gap is getting bigger.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para pgwide="yes">But what do the government say in response to that? They say, ‘What we need to do is give people with average working conditions fewer rights. They are obviously getting paid too much, because there is a wage breakout, so we need to control those people on average weekly earnings.’ That is what the Liberal Party say, even though the figures demonstrate that, over the course of the government’s term in office, average weekly incomes have barely kept pace with the cost of living, while at the same time the top end of town have, under this government, done extraordinarily well.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">And they do not do extraordinarily well just when times are good. In February 2003 there was a very good article in <inline font-style="italic">Business Review Weekly</inline>, of all places, which had a look at the performance of some CEOs against their pay. The article was headlined, ‘They receive multimillion dollar packages but some are wrecking shareholder wealth.’ The story detailed how CEOs were receiving not hundreds of thousands but millions of dollars a year in payments at the same time that their companies were going backwards.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There is a massive abuse of the Australian work force in the way in which the government have conducted their economic and industrial relations policies. It is time that the government took stock of that. In a couple of months, they will have the unfettered capacity to put through this parliament whatever they wish, and a range of industrial relations reforms will be top of the pops when it comes to that debate. This is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the information that demonstrates the unfairness of the government’s past practices. I am looking forward to the debates and the campaigns after 1 July in order to expose some of the government’s harsher policies which have operated to the detriment of ordinary Australians.</para>

<para>—Tonight in the debate on the <inline ref="R2279">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2004-2005</inline> and related bills I want to address a number of issues, among which, principally and firstly, is Indigenous education. This is an issue I have raised time and time again in this place, including quite a number of times during the last parliamentary term. I have also raised it since the new parliament was sworn in. The key issues I want to address in relation to it are the changes announced by the federal government in April last year to the Aboriginal Student Support and Parent Awareness program and the Aboriginal Tutorial Assistance Scheme. It was announced that they would be abolished and replaced by new programs.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">As a reminder, ASSPA is a program that funds Indigenous parent committees, which arrange activities to encourage Indigenous students to attend and stay at school. Activities are wide-ranging and include nutrition programs, sports days and excursions, which are particularly important for kids in very remote communities. Funds also go towards classroom resources such as books, videos and computers and towards a whole panoply of educational tools and educational opportunities. But today, some seven weeks into the school term, no schools in my electorate have yet received funding from ASSPA’s replacement, the Parent School Partnerships initiative.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The PSPI funding process has been a complete joke. Very late last year, schools were sent application forms for them to describe how they would use funding. These applications alone include 11 pages of forms, governed by 121 pages of rules. The result of this complex and time-consuming process is that hard-pressed bush schools in my electorate—schools where English is invariably a second, third or even fourth language of many parents—are having trouble even applying for funding. The overworked principals and schoolteachers in these places are doing their best, but the Commonwealth Department of Education, Science and Training is already returning applications to schools all over the Northern Territory with the simple message ‘Rejected’. So these schools can no longer undertake activities they would have previously undertaken under the ASSPA program, because some bureaucrat somewhere who asserts that they know what is best for these school communities is making judgments about what these schools can do in terms of their education programs, and is making those judgments without, in my view, any detailed knowledge or understanding of the circumstances.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">What I find particularly offensive about this process is that somehow the Minister for Education, Science and Training has the gall to say it will benefit bush schools or Aboriginal education generally. When I warned him of these consequences on 16 June last year, this is what he said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">We particularly want to give priority to non-metropolitan Aboriginal students. I do not care what anybody says: that is where the need is greatest.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Why then are the remote bush schools in my electorate—without question the most disadvantaged schools in Australia—being told they will miss out on PSPI funding? These schools are missing out and, no doubt, well-resourced metropolitan schools in some communities will be receiving the money that they are not. The reason, partly, for this is not necessarily a shifting of funds. It is because the bush communities are disadvantaged by their isolation and by the lack of human resources—the human capital—available to them to prepare and submit appropriate documentation to support their requests for resources. This is something which is ignored by the government, and I have warned about it previously. It is true also of schools in towns like Alice Springs. Most schools have lost thousands of dollars in funding following the government’s changes to this program.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">For reasons I cannot understand—the government itself has given no adequate explanation—it has cut tutorial assistance to all students, except those in years 4, 6 and 8 who failed MAP literacy and numeracy tests in the previous year. I have mentioned this before on a number of occasions. We have had the changes to ASSPA and now we have the proposed changes to the Aboriginal Tutorial Assistance program. These changes have wrought havoc on the education system in the Northern Territory. To give you some idea of the impact, 500 tutors at schools in remote communities have been left without work. Last year 3,800 Indigenous students were receiving tutorial assistance. This year, just 1,666 students will be helped.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I have received a flood of correspondence on this, and I have made this point before. The issue here is: what sort of educational expert has come up with a proposition that, somehow or other, an arbitrary MAP testing exercise or literacy testing exercise at specific year levels is going to identify people and then enable you to compensate people who fail that test by giving them tutorial assistance the year after they have failed? What happened to the idea of early intervention? What happened to the idea of school communities being able to develop their own priorities for what is best for students by identifying students’ needs and then establishing—through propositions developed in the school community—the best way to improve the outcomes for students? I can tell you what has happened: a very arbitrary imposition of a set of rules which will not work. As a direct result, literally thousands of students in my electorate and across Northern Australia are being adversely affected by the stupidity of these arrangements. There are any number of examples.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There is one school of which I have a particular understanding and knowledge. I have to declare an interest here in that I have a son who attends this school and my partner is the acting deputy principal. I am speaking of Ross Park Primary School in Alice Springs, where every fourth student is Indigenous. This school wrote to the minister about ATAS on 8 February, stating:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Whereas previously 56 students from years 1 to 6 benefited from ATAS support, only 5 students in years 4 to 6 will now receive tutoring. Many will be left behind as a result of this decision.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The ATAS scheme has proven very successful at our school. Our dedicated ... tutors have not only helped students reach benchmarks over the four years they have been here, but managed to raise individual students levels above benchmarks. They have given students the confidence that they can do just as well as others.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">‘Hear, hear!’ I say to that. That is as it should be—but it will not be as a result of these proposals put by the government. This letter goes on:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">In the early childhood years, literacy/numeracy support has resulted in more students achieving test benchmarks than ever before. Ongoing support is essential in these years to lay the foundations for numeracy and literacy skills, particularly where children come from homes where books, reading and education are not seen as high priorities or are not available at all...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Let me be very clear about this: what they have said about ongoing support being essential to lay the foundation for literacy and numeracy skills is so obvious that it is beyond argument. But somehow or other this government believe that by shifting the finance in the way they are doing—in which they will get savings, of course—students will benefit. Students will not benefit. The community will suffer, the families will suffer and students will suffer.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I will give you another important example. Kalkaringi Community Education Centre has been devastated by these changes. It was here in the year 2003 that three students became the Northern Territory’s first ever year 12 students to gain tertiary entrance from a remote community school. Its principal, George Hewitson, who won a federal government award for leadership, was described by the minister as ‘inspiring’. But, this year, the centre has already lost excellent tutoring staff and $35,000 to $40,000 in federal funding. It could also face the prospect of losing a further $80,000, depending on the outcome of negotiations with DEET, who are going to assess their submissions. What sort of lunacy is this?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Willowra school in the central desert wrote me this note:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">We will only be able to target 12 students instead of the 30 plus students who used to get one-on-one assistance.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">…            …            …</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Our students come to school speaking their first language, they come from houses where books and reading does not happen so the only reading they get is at school. It is well documented that children cannot catch up to their English language peers in one year and need some extra assistance and time. This is further compounded when lack of home resources and regular school attendances are factored in.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Hear, hear! That is fairly obvious, I would have thought. And from Nyirrpi school, also in the western desert, in the Tanami, comes this letter:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">For the first time in many years in 2004 we have had kids reaching and others very close to benchmark standards. This has only been due to additional tutors in school working one-on-one and in a small group situation.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Nyirrpi School, enrolment 25, is always going to struggle with attendance and targets as Warlpiri communities tend to be great ‘long distance travellers’ and take their kids with them when they visit family in other communities for long periods of time. We must have this concentrated tutoring to catch these kids up when they are in the community.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">There are many more examples.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There was a Senate inquiry into this, and the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Reference Committee visited Alice Springs last week. I want to mention something of the behaviour of one of its members—the deputy chair, Senator Tierney. Senator Tierney was the sole government member of the inquiry to take part in its public hearings in the Northern Territory last week. Put simply, certainly at one school, his behaviour was offensive in the extreme and a gross insult to those people who took the time and effort to travel to and address the hearings. I have not read the transcript of the hearings in Alice Springs as it is not yet available, but, from what I have heard from those who took part, he was entirely uninterested in their plight, did not bother to listen and was condescending in the extreme in those rare minutes that he did speak. One participant was so appalled, she got up and told him so. To me, the senator’s attitude pretty much sums up the attitude of the government to Indigenous people and their communities. Thank God, he is leaving parliament in July—good riddance to him when he goes.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There are other issues that I want to address. One of those relates to CDEP, which is another significant issue in Indigenous communities across Australia, but I will come to that if I have time. I want to briefly just address the issue of roads. A month ago to the day I was in the chamber outlining the flaws in the government’s roads funding system that sees unincorporated areas, which make up much of my electorate, miss out. I will briefly run through part of what I said then. I said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">... the Northern Territory has a uniquely different road system. This difference lies in the fact that much of the Territory’s road network cannot be managed by local councils because 40 per cent of the Territory roads lie outside town council boundaries. For years now, as a result of decisions taken by this government, these roads have been ineligible for Roads to Recovery funding which is distributed only to local councils. ... Without federal funding, they have been left to deteriorate, so much so that less than 35 per cent of the NT road network is sealed with bitumen.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I have made these points time and time again in this place and outside. Imagine my surprise, then, to hear on the radio last week that the government failure was—do you believe it?—all my fault. That was the absurd claim by Senator Scullion, CLP representative from the Northern Territory, when he tried to explain his way out of a broken promise he made during the course of the last election campaign to provide an initial $20 million for these roads. On Thursday morning last week, on ABC Top End’s late morning program, the senator was asked why the government was providing just $1 million of the $20 million it had promised. This was his response:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Well, I mean, if you look at history it was actually Warren Snowden when he was the parliamentary secretary that was responsible for roads, as I understand, and he was the one who said, ‘Look, let’s take the money off the Northern Territory Government, give it to local councils, forgetting of course there wasn’t any contiguous line that join the councils.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Hang on? Have I lost something here? All we did at the time was ensure that Indigenous local councils in the Northern Territory got the same rights as other local governing bodies around Australia and were direct funded. That is all we did. We did not shift the bucket of money. We gave it to those communities on the same terms and conditions as every other local governing authority in Australia got it. I remember it vividly because I was insistent that it happen. What he has done is fall on his face. It is true. As I said, I was parliamentary secretary to the minister for transport at that time and had a great deal to do with making sure that this happened. But how does it follow that I am therefore responsible for the Roads to Recovery program, which became law more than eight years later, under a coalition government, on 21 December 2000?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is no wonder that neither Senator Scullion nor his party colleague the member for Solomon have ever mentioned roads in this parliament—not once. What a burning issue it is for them! They think it is okay to blame me for their total failure to represent their constituents. This is the twisted logic that we are getting used to hearing in this place: somehow or other, I am to blame for the failure of the Roads to Recovery program. I know who is to blame; it is those people that sit on the Treasury benches—principally, and significantly, the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the Nationals, who ensured that in the first round of Roads to Recovery his electorate, which is one-tenth the size of the Northern Territory, got in excess of $40 million while the Northern Territory got $20 million.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As I said, this is the twisted logic that we are getting used to in this place. According to this government, the skill shortage is not its fault; it is the fault of those damned kids who want to go to university. Rises in interest rates and the record current account deficit are not the government’s fault; they are the fault of the Keating government. At least the government always harks back to the Labor years when asked why its policies are failing now. But of course it will not claim the merits, the profitable outcomes or the successes that have made this economy competitive as a result of the changes made by the successive Hawke and Keating governments. Now the government’s decision not to fund bush roads is not its fault either; it is someone else’s—mine.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I think it is a bit of a joke; in fact, I think it is beyond absurd. The government simply fails to understand the importance of these bush roads to the largely resourced based Territory economy. Cattle industry live exports are worth $330 million each year to the Territory. They are the third largest private sector industry in the place. The largest industry, which is the other major industry user of bush roads, is the mining industry. That is worth about $1.5 billion each year and employs about 4,000 people directly in the Territory. Then of course there is tourism. While the government does nothing, choosing instead to blame me, these roads—the roads relied on by the tourism industry, the pastoral industry and the mining industry, not to mention the thousands of Territorians who live in small and remote communities in the bush—are getting worse and worse by the minute.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">On Friday of last week the <inline font-style="italic">Centralian Advocate</inline> ran with the following headline: ‘Shocking bush roads cost millions’. The story went on to say:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The shocking state of bush roads is costing the Central Australian pastoral and tourism industry thousands of dollars ... The NT Cattleman’s Association executive director Stuart Kenny said that up to $40 million more was needed to address the problem.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">You do not have to be Einstein to work out where the problem is. In the case of Aboriginal education, the problem rests squarely with the government. In the case of the deficiency in road funding, the responsibility rests squarely with the government. We know this is recognised by the Northern Territory community. We understand that parents in schools understand what the problem is. They know that the decisions to affect in a negative way the educational outcomes for their children are the direct responsibility of the federal government. They know—they have seen the arrogance of Senator Tierney—that this government is not serious. They know that they are getting all sorts of excuses for the failure of the government to come to terms with its responsibilities in relation to Indigenous education—as is the case with CDEP.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Last week we had the government come out with its announced proposals to amend community development employment programs. A discussion paper on the future of the program was written by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations and launched in Alice Springs on the evening of 21 February. Believe it or not, the department gave Central Australia just 12 hours to consider its plan before holding official consultations.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Let me be very clear about it: this is happening across Australia. This government has produced a document which plans to change the way in which CDEP operates across the nation. It has held meetings in Alice Springs, Katherine and Darwin but not in remote communities. The second-largest CDEP project in Australia is at Maningrida. Has the government identified this issue at Maningrida? Has it gone to the people of Maningrida? Has it tried to sit down in the dust and talk to the people who are participating in the CDEP at Maningrida or anywhere else across Northern Australia? Has it talked to people who have English as a second language? Has it talked to them in appropriate terms and put this in their language so that they can understand what the government is about? Has there been any attempt by the government to do any of this? Of course the answer is no.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It has also abolished ATSIC, so any forums that Indigenous people might have had to express their concern about the way in which the government is carrying out its responsibilities in relation to CDEP or any other matter have disappeared off the face of the earth. So we have a centralised system where bureaucrats are dictated to by the minister and the minister’s office. Staff are told to trot around Australia and tell Indigenous people what the government proposes to do and what the government will do. Despite the rhetoric of going through a process of consultation, they know full well what the government’s blueprint is and what the government intends to implement regardless of the feedback it gets. That is the arrogance of this government; that is the stupidity of this government.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">But it is not fooling me, it is not fooling my constituents in the Northern Territory and I believe it is certainly not fooling the Australian population. As time marches on, as it must, towards the next federal election, voters are going to see this writ large time and time and time again. They will inevitably agree with the judgments that parents at Ross Park Primary School, Nyirrpi, Kakaringi and these other schools are making about the way in which this government is dealing with Indigenous education. They will inevitably agree with what the cattlemen’s association is saying about the way in which the government is dealing with roads and the way in which it is dealing with the CDEP. They know that this government cannot be trusted and the quicker it terminates its relationship with the Australian people by being defeated in the next election, the better for all of us.</para>

<para>—I am very happy to follow the member for Lingiari’s contribution. It is fair to say this government has failed in relation to Indigenous policies. I would like to touch upon another area which reflects the contempt and ignorance this government displays when it comes to a large part of this society—that is, the working men and women of Australia. This afternoon we had the Prime Minister attempting to convince those who were listening that this government cares for the men and women who are the backbone of Australia’s economy, but we know this Prime Minister and this government have been antiworker since their election in 1996. We know that from that time on, this government has attempted to diminish and destroy any entitlements afforded to employees in their workplaces and, in some cases, has succeeded. We also know a number of bills went through the House of Representatives last term but failed to find passage through the Senate.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">We are all aware that things will change in July this year when the Senate delivers to the government, by virtue of an election, a majority in both houses. We are well aware this is the first time we have seen a majority in both houses in this country at the federal level since 1981. Along with others in this place and the working men and women of Australia, I will be looking at the way in which this Prime Minister and the government’s minister for workplace relations deals with the IR agenda.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We know what Prime Minister Howard’s agenda for working people has been since he entered this place in the mid-1970s. We are well aware of his views about unions, collective bargaining and unfair termination by employers. His contempt for the Industrial Relations Commission is on the record, as are his views on Medicare and many social institutions. His views about the AIRC and the rights of employee organisations are extreme. Indeed, he is matched by his Treasurer. We are well aware that the Treasurer made his name—cut his teeth—on industrial relations cases in the mid-1980s. In late 1986, Mr Costello, then a barrister representing an employer, argued before the full bench of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission that all employees be paid no more than $171 each, with no other wage increment involved, and that each employee in the land should individually negotiate with their employer anything beyond that point.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It so happens that, at that time, $171 was well below the poverty line, but that did not stop Mr Costello from pursuing that argument on behalf of a pretty phoney employer body with very few affiliates. That was the Treasurer’s view in 1986. Almost 20 years later, if this government allows the extremists in the employer groups to have their way, Mr Costello’s submission to reduce people’s wages down to the poverty line and to have them negotiate individually upwards could come to fruition in the not too distant future. Certainly a system could be put in place to bring about the eradication of awards as we know them and the eradiation of every classification point in any award except for the minimum rate of the country. By virtue of other legislation, the commission could be compelled to prevent safety nets from being applied to that rate, and it could fall below the poverty line. Further to that, Australian workplace agreements—that Orwellian term: neither Australian nor workplace and rarely agreements—will proliferate throughout the country if the government has its way.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We are well aware that the Prime Minister’s ‘challenger to be’—the K-Mart Keating, the one who might challenge if he had the guts but we know he doesn’t—has to keep some of his very few supporters on side. Those two senior members of government, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister, have an enmity towards working people and their capacity to collectively bargain. Their views are extreme compared not just with the Labor Party’s but with the Liberal Party’s position historically.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We are well aware of the Liberal Party’s views for the past almost 100 years. The Liberal Party supported a system of fairness and a fair and reasonable wage. I do not recall Menzies ever attacking Justice Higgins’ decision that there should be a fair and reasonable wage in this country. Justice Higgins, in the Harvester judgment in 1907, laid down the basis for our social wage, which reflected not only a decent outcome but also part of our culture. He was attempting to synthesise what people had come to believe in—a fair go. That ethos developed in the mid-19th century. In 1907 Justice Higgins summed up that matter by saying that working people deserved a fair and reasonable wage. He did so and that view has been held ever since.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We should also remember that Justice Higgins’s decision was based upon a provision of an act of the second parliament of this nation. That act of parliament, the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, established the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, the then title of the federal commission. That act was supported in many instances by people who would see themselves as liberals in the traditional sense. That decision stood us in good stead.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I am a great believer in the fact that we had to change the system. I hold the view that we had to make the system more flexible. I have had arguments at every level—at the workplace and at other forums—about that matter, but I believe that there had to be some change. The Labor Party in the 1980s were right when they said that there had to be some level of devolution—that there had to be a capacity for employers to bargain at the workplace level with their workers. I agree with that. But I also believe that, when you set in train a capacity to devolve the system to allow employees to negotiate at the local level, you must also have some protection for those same employees.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I do not think that is the intention of this government. That is what really worries me. I compare this government’s views not with my own but with former Liberal governments’ views in relation to what is fair and reasonable. The Treasurer already foreshadowed almost 20 years ago his views on creating a minimum wage. An article from the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> in 1986 said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Melbourne barrister Peter Costello presents the AFE submission to the national wage case hearing ... called on the Arbitration Commission ... to cut the minimum wage to $171.30 a week. Mr Costello told the wage case full bench that the commission should allow employers and workers to negotiate directly for increases above the minimum.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Effectively he suggested that we should have one single rate nationally—of $171, which I said earlier was below the poverty line—and everybody had to negotiate individually upwards. That was his dream; that is what he would like to see happen. Indeed, the Prime Minister has a similar view, as we know.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Against that backdrop, it is important for us to understand the extent to which this government will go to wreck a system that we have had in place since the beginning of last century. How far will this government go to strip away from the system what have been fundamental entitlements of workers now for 100 years—to strip away the ethos of the fair and reasonable wage that was enshrined in the 1907 Harvester judgment and to effectively take away the rights to collectively bargain in a fair way?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I am also most concerned by the current minister’s views on that. When we saw Minister Andrews succeed Minister Abbott as the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, I thought, ‘Maybe here is an opportunity for this minister to depart from a very radical position taken by his two predecessors—Minister Abbott and Minister Reith.’ I was hoping that this minister would at least show some temperance, some moderation, some balance and some thought for working people. The most important part of the economy, in the end, of course, is always the working people of this country. Unfortunately I came across this quote. Others, I am sure, have already seen it, where the minister effectively said that we might have to be careful about fairness. He said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">... as the Business Council of Australia recently argued, an emphasis on fairness only leads to regulatory excess ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">He talks about an emphasis on fairness. Minister, we want to know whether there is going to be a presence of fairness and whether there is going to be an existence of fairness—not an emphasis on fairness. Indeed, if the government continues to strip away the entitlements of working people—by making it almost impossible to negotiate properly a collective agreement by allowing the employer to refuse to bargain; by not allowing the umpire—the Australian Industrial Relations Commission—to involve itself in at least assisting the parties to come to terms with an agreement; and by introducing AWAs which are not transparent, which are oversighted by the Employment Advocate and where nobody gets to scrutinise whether in fact the agreements are disadvantageous to the employee—without any balance or protection for working people then I think we are definitely at a tilting point. We are at a point where the Prime Minister and this government have shown an utter disregard and contempt for working people in this country. It is up to this government to see whether it can temper its own excesses—I am not confident that it can do that.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I have talked about some of the broader issues and historical matters that are important in the overall context of this debate, but what gets lost is the issue of what the priority should be when you are looking at regulating. I agree that you do not regulate for the sake of it. I consider that in a capitalist system there is a need to regulate, whether it is about regulating occupational health and safety or the rights of employees, small business, other bodies and citizens. That is the reality. No-one would want to see the outcome of a purely laissez-faire capitalist system because clearly that leads to monopolies and to enormous social and economic disadvantages for the majority of people. We have come to understand that—it is a pretty basic point. My priority in this matter is the millions of people effectively on the poverty line, barely able to afford to put food on the table, to pay for a mortgage or to pay rent to their landlord. That is my concern. I am not worried about union officials. I am not worried about an affiliate union giving money to the ALP. I am worried about those unionised, non-unionised, collective and non-collective arrangements that occur in workplaces which can leave people impoverished and a large proportion of Australian families struggling to make ends meet.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We know there have been some economic indicators that are very positive for this country and I applaud the government in areas where they have succeeded. There is no point disregarding reality when there are positive things to say about matters. I am happy to see the reduction in unemployment—of course we should all be—and it would be churlish to say otherwise. I am happy to see economic growth—the capacity for people’s incomes to grow. Of course those things are important. But there is a large proportion of this society that has missed out, and there is no point putting a post 1996 date on that fact—it has happened in Labor terms as well as, certainly, since this government was elected. When you have been around for almost 10 years you have to start taking some responsibility for what might have happened in the last decade. That is what happens. For the first two terms of this government all we heard about was what happened in the 13 years from 1983 to 1996.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Let us talk about the period from 1996 to 2005. Since 1996, whilst there has been some growth in employment, there has been a significant increase in casualisation of the work force. When you are a casual employee—and I am sure there are some in this chamber who have been casual employees—you do not tend to get a home loan very easily. You do not tend to get too many things that you might want. You may not even be able to get a credit card, not that they are always good for you.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The other problem we have had in relation to employment growth is that there has been a significant increase in part-time employment. That is not necessarily a bad thing. Part-time employment may well be the type of employment that many people want, and that is fine. We know about people wanting to opt for part-time employment. But the government defines part-time employment as someone having one hour a week under the current statistics used by the government. I am well aware of the fact that many part-time employees are desperately seeking further work. We know a large part of the Australian work force are struggling to make ends meet and are effectively on the poverty line while working 38 to 40-plus hours a week to look after their families—and in some cases working 60 or 70 hours a week in the household to pay their mortgages and so on—then we know that things are not that easy for them. We also know that they are not the beneficiaries of the changes that have occurred, when compared to others.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I heard the member for Brisbane talking earlier about the ratio between the CEOs’ wage increases since 1996 and the increases of people on average weekly earnings. There is a vast difference, with those people at the top end receiving greater sums in real terms but not even proportionate to their incomes. When a government considers removing the minimum wage or removing the capacity of the commission to make an order to allow for that minimum wage to increase, and when legislation is being introduced to the House that will compel the commission to not pay that minimum wage increase to certain people on the lowest rates in this country, then you know you have a government that has no regard for the lowest paid people. You know you have a government that has no regard for those working people. The battlers that this Prime Minister has boasted about are not, in the end, people he cares about if he continues with his very pernicious agenda to destroy the IR system and leave these people at such peril.</para>

<para>—According to recent newspaper reports, it appears that the government surplus in its most recent budget might be in the order of some $10 billion, as against an anticipated $2.6 billion. I do not know whether that is in fact going to happen, but it is pretty obvious that the government is rolling in money. Yet, at a time when the government is rolling in money, in effect it wants to go after some of the most vulnerable people in our community.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Today I rise to speak on behalf of the 3,260 recipients of a disability support pension in the seat of Banks. Given the increase in the number of people on disability support pensions visiting my office, I understand that the government is currently considering changes to the payments and conditions of those in receipt of a disability support pension. These people are very worried—and with good reason. An article by Ross Gittins in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of Wednesday, 16 February 2005 has the headline ‘It’s disability pensioners’ turn to oblige’, and an article by Michelle Grattan in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on 28 February 2005 has the headline ‘“Work first” to be welfare aim’. A constituent who is intellectually disabled and who regularly presents to my office has been to my office twice in the last week voicing his concern over media reports. Let me say at the outset that these people are not all those who are stereotyped as having bad backs. In Banks these people include people with schizophrenia, those with serious depression, some with terminal diseases and others with debilitating diseases.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There has been considerable misinformation on the issue of how people actually obtain the disability support pension. From my experience in my electorate it is not as easy as many armchair experts would have us believe. Apart from age and residential requirement, applicants need to show that they have a disability, illness or injury which attracts an impairment rating of at least 20 points on the impairment tables. I have here in the House a copy of the impairment tables, which we pulled off the net. It is in the Social Security Act 1991, schedule 1B, ‘Tables for the assessment of work-related impairment for disability support pension’, by the Department of Social Security of 1997. There is an introduction and then 437 pages. It is not easy to achieve 20 points on the impairment table. This disability, illness or impairment needs to be such that a person must be unable to work full time or be retrained for at least two years. ‘Full time’ is defined as 30 hours a week.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Over a third of all applications are rejected. For example, one of my constituents, Bruce, is aged 47. He is a former labourer who broke both ankles in 1980. In 1990 he broke his back in a motorcycle accident. He also has a dislocated shoulder. Bruce has twice been rejected for a disability support pension. Of those whose applications are medically verified, 33 per cent have musculoskeletal disabilities—which is loss of mobility or limbs—25 per cent have psychiatric illnesses and 11 per cent have intellectual or learning disabilities. A good paper was produced by the Australian Council of Social Service in January 2005 called <inline font-style="italic">Ten myths and facts about the disability support pension</inline>.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">These are the people that are being targeted by this government, not the top end of town, not the rorters who have the accountants, the lawyers, the trusts and the schemes to avoid taxation. It is a government which has, in its nine years of office, stopped looking at that section of the community who are avoiding tax at the rate of knots and which has, instead of tightening that area, gone after the vulnerable in the community.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Many people with illnesses such as multiple sclerosis or recurring mental illnesses are able to work part time but not full time. The fact is that the current system allows these people to work up to 30 hours a week. If they find employment and it does not work out, Centrelink will hold their information for a period of time so that they do not have to reapply. This does provide a safety net for people with disabilities as they engage with the employment market. For many people with psychiatric illness, particularly, there is considerable trauma involved in dealing with the doctors, the paperwork and all the paraphernalia which goes with applying for a disability support pension. There is nothing in the current system that discourages people from working. Yet, like the vast majority of those with disabilities, these people are quite often desperate to work within their capacity. These people are dependent on financial support not through choice but through circumstance.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I think it is important at this stage for me to outline a specific instance. One of my constituents presented at my office in March 2003. After a heart operation he had been made redundant, so he had no job to go back to. He applied for the newstart allowance, and after a number of administrative difficulties, including non-payment, he finally started to receive payments. Over a period of time he sought work until a Job Network provider advised that they could not look for work for him. At that point the possibility of a disability support pension was raised, with a doctor advising that the problem was not so much the heart rather my constituent’s body being unable to repair itself. My constituent started to suffer periodically from depression. In mid-2004 he was diagnosed with lung cancer and his doctor advised that he would be unable to work indefinitely. After some time he was put onto a disability support pension.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In January 2005 my constituent again attended my office in considerable distress that he may be required to work as a result of a communication from Centrelink. At this time my constituent regularly has appointments with a cardiologist, a respiratory specialist and his GP to monitor his blood pressure, cholesterol and overall heart condition. My constituent is simply not in a position to work, and the process of getting the disability pension was extraordinarily time-consuming and stressful. He is now on a disability support pension. The threat that he will have to continue to prove his illness has caused him constant worry and tension, exacerbating his condition. They are the people that this government goes after. Yet when it comes to tax avoidance and the promises the Treasurer has made in the past about tightening the scheme, because it is a vocal group in the community that can lobby successfully, the government has abandoned pursuit of those rorters.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">For many people the lack of resources available to Job Network providers is the critical factor when it comes to assisting people back into work. I also point out at this stage that there are no Job Network providers physically located within the seat of Banks. My constituents are served by providers largely located in Bankstown or Hurstville. People with disabilities who are of work force age need access to appropriate levels of workplace assistance and the training required to help overcome barriers to employment. At the same time, the difficulties faced by those on disability support pensions do not rest solely on the low levels of government job assistance but are extended into the workplace. Many employers are reluctant to employ people with physical or mental disabilities. That is a fact of life. Often they need specialist services to find and maintain employment. There is little assistance available for employers, even if they are positive about employing people with disabilities.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Apart from this assistance, many jobs which were previously available to people with disabilities have been replaced by technology or other changes. For instance, I am aware of a person with intellectual disabilities who was able to regularly work serving petrol and cleaning windscreens at a garage. This option is no longer available. ACOSS, together with a broad alliance of supporting organisations, has recommended the development of a national strategy to encourage employers to remove work practices and other barriers that shut people with disabilities out of employment and to overcome discrimination. The paper is called <inline font-style="italic">Guidelines for disability welfare reform to promote workforce participation among people with disabilities</inline>.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Another of my constituents has experienced this discrimination first-hand. Michael of Padstow is just 60 years old. He is on a disability support pension because he has two damaged vertebrae, the neck and lumbar; osteoarthritis; calcium heel spurs, which prevent him standing for long periods of time; kidney problems and high blood pressure. Michael sent 61 job applications to government departments between 2001 and 2003. He obtained one interview. When he followed up two of the positions he was told that they feared excessive sick leave or aggravation of injury. He also received comments as to why he was applying for low-grade clerical jobs. Michael was trained as a pilot. He reads and writes three languages and speaks a fourth. He has also served in a UN peace-keeping force.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is a great disappointment to me that this government does not set the example to other employers. This government has previously introduced bills that appeared to be aimed at making it more difficult for people to receive a disability support pension—the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Disability Reform) Bill 2002; the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Disability Reform) Bill (No. 2) 2002; and the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Disability Reform) Bill (No. 2) 2002 [No. 2]. I understand these bills were defeated in the Senate, but the government will be in a position from 1 July this year to do its worst. I seriously question whether the government intends to genuinely attempt to assist more people into employment or whether this is simply a cost saving exercise.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">When the Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Disability Reform) Bill was introduced, it was estimated that there would be $420 million in savings over the period 2002-06. Whatever the government is intending, it must consult broadly with those individuals and groups with expertise in the area of employment and support for people with disabilities. A key question is whether any proposed changes will be applied to existing disability support pension recipients.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I accept that there are people who may occasionally slip through the cracks and receive benefits they may not be entitled to. From observation in my own electorate, however, these are few and far between, given the hoops they have to jump through to be entitled to a disability support pension. I have not seen the detail of what the government may be proposing, but I do suggest that a sledgehammer not be used to crack the proverbial walnut. Early in February this year ACOSS, together with many other organisations, formed the Disability Participation Alliance. The media release that accompanied the launch quoted ACROD CEO, Mr Ken Baker, as saying:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">There are no quick fixes to get people with disabilities into the workforce—many want to work but they face employer reluctance, waiting lists for employment assistance and financial disincentives in the social security system. We’re saying the time has come to tackle these issues so more people can get work.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">With my staff, I deal with constituents with disabilities on a day-to-day basis. It is patently obvious that there are no quick fixes to a complex series of issues. Overall, most people are desperately trying to do the right thing, not least for themselves by allowing self-sufficiency and dignity under what are usually trying circumstances. The vast majority do not want to rip off the government; they want to work with the government to obtain appropriate employment and support in order to lead decent lives and to retain some dignity for themselves. This government would be best placed not by introducing legislation designed to penalise but by introducing legislation designed to support and enhance the lives of people who are clearly so disadvantaged in the employment market.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Until July the community have a safety net because the government has not had a majority in both houses of parliament. From July the government will have a majority in both houses of parliament. The pressure will be on those decent members of the coalition in that caucus room who for years have preached the compassion that they supposedly deliver to the community as against the Labor Party—those people who come into the parliament on the coat-tails of their religious credentials. I do not believe it is a government of compassion, yet I believe there are many compassionate people within the government.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I came into parliament not to protect or preserve the rich or those who can look after themselves. I believe that government should provide a safety net for the vulnerable, for the dispossessed in the community, because there is no equality in the marketplace. There are people who do not have the ability to make it by themselves because there is inequality in the community, and that is where government steps in—the hand of a good Samaritan, not the hand of survival of the fittest, where the money goes to the wealthy end of town or to those who are the most vocal. That is going to be the true test. I think we are a compassionate country, but in the past nine years under this Prime Minister compassion has gone out of government. I think we have taken the low road. With the insecurity in the world and the insecurity within, we are turning on ourselves and it is the vulnerable who are suffering. I do not believe that the average member of parliament wants to see that happen. But what it means is standing up in the party room. When you have got a government that is awash with money, it is no good saying at the end of your term, ‘There is nothing I could have done about it.’ There is. And the beauty about this parliament and this place and this country is that one or two voices can make a difference. You can have an impact. But, if you remain silent, it is no good finishing your term in this place and, at the end of it, achieving radicalism and then preaching to those that remain.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I believe that when a government goes after the most vulnerable—and we are getting that on the basis that this government wants to clean up the welfare system—then, frankly, it has to be held to account. If it wants to argue the case for change, it should not get away with glib headlines. It should be held to account. If it wants to make the case for change, it should make the case for change. You do not get impairment tables that go for 437 pages. It is not easy for people to get the disability support pension. It is very traumatic for people to have to come back year in, year out to continue to prove their disability. I say to those members in the coalition: I want to see action, not words. Words are cheap. What I expect is party room revolt and backbench revolt to hold this government to account for its approach. I commend my remarks to the House. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I am happy to follow my colleague the member for Banks. Together we cover 165,000 people in the City of Bankstown and have attempted to put the argument on behalf of our people time and again in this House. Here we are, dealing with <inline ref="R2279">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2004-2005</inline> and cognate bills, in a debate that one could say is, at the very least, extensive rather than intensive. Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, I have had the privilege of sitting in the chair in the House and listening to your contribution to this debate. I marvelled at its extent and variance. When I went back and had a look at it I thought, ‘What is actually in appropriation bills Nos 1 to 4 and do they bear any relationship whatsoever to what the member for Scullin was arguing for and about?’ He quite rightly pointed out to me that you can say almost anything when it comes to appropriation debates. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may indeed at the moment be checking standing orders to work out whether or not I am actually casting aspersions on the Deputy Speaker or indeed on another member. It is a question of disorder under the new rules 89. I could not blame myself or anyone else—</para>

<para>—I shall, with alacrity, look it up as soon as I have finished speaking. Since 1996, what I have found over and over again is this—and it is important: we are elected to speak. We are expected to do research and then to speak to the appropriation bills. I want to thank not only our shadow minister, who has provided background information in relation to these bills, but also the person charged with the carriage of these bills through the House, in this case the Hon. Dr Sharman Stone, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration. In her second reading speech, she told us a little bit about what these bills actually entail.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para pgwide="yes">If you go to the four appropriation bills themselves and the associated statement of savings, as I did just before I began duty, and look at the tables, you will find that you cannot work out anything about what this government is actually saving money on. Also, you cannot work out what the appropriations were before. These are designed to confuse and to provide disinformation rather than information. I have made this comment a number of times over the years during debate on the appropriation bills.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This government introduced the Charter of Budget Honesty. It introduced the notion that people should be able to tell exactly what the government is up to. It is actually not a charter of government honesty; it is effectively a charter of dishonesty. What the government has done—not here with that charter but in terms of changing the way in which the budget papers are presented and the way in which the appropriation bills are presented—is to take a behaviourist approach. It talks about goals, aims and outcomes and, in the most general terms, says that there are inputs to the system and there are outputs—the sort of language which means absolutely nothing. It is entirely drivel. For any single government department, all you get is: ‘Here is a whack of money; it is either being spent or it isn’t.’ The documents no longer tell you what it has been spent on. How could you tell by looking at these papers? Certainly there are moneys to be appropriated for the Department of Defence, the department of housing, the Department of Family and Community Services and so on. But as to what they actually do with that money you simply have to go to the second reading speech and ask, ‘Is there anything here that is real in terms of what is being proposed?’</para>
<para pgwide="yes">What happens if you rely upon the bill itself, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2004-2005? I will give a simple instance, taking a department at random. Let me take the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. We are dealing with ‘Operating outcome 2, Development of a stronger and internationally competitive Australian sports sector and encouragement of greater participation in sport by all Australians’. What a motherhood statement. That is what we are told this is supposed to be about. Under the column on specific payments to the states and territories, we are given a figure. There are no new administered expenses. We go back to the original figure. That is the money the department gets. What is this appropriation for? Who knows? How can you tell? There is nothing specific here. Departments have given up saying exactly what the programs are and how and why this money is being appropriated. That goes back to the old days—the Hawke and Keating government days. When you fronted up there was a cash basis for how the accounts had been prepared and you got a bit of information to say, ‘Here is the money we are spending and—guess what?—this is what we are spending it on.’ The House could make a judgment about whether that spending was real and sensible. Instead of that, when we get the extra bits and pieces of information from the parliamentary secretary, we can start to make a judgment about whether some of these programs are worth while.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There is a whole string of relevant examples. Given the time of year, being the end of the cycle and with the budget coming up in May, this is a tidy-up operation. There is about $299 million worth of savings to be made. What does that mean? It means that the departments did not spend everything they had. They found that they did not want to spend on programs at a particular time. However, there is also an adjustment for about $1,794 million of new moneys to be expended. Some of it they could not really forecast, and some of it covers adjustments for things that have gone wrong. But in some cases there are expansions to programs that are already there, or special provisions that had not been put in the previous budget bills. I commend one of them: $6½ million to the Department of Veterans’ Affairs for additional funding to commemorate significant anniversaries in 2005. What could be more significant than the 90th anniversary of the Gallipoli landings and the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II? That is an appropriate appropriation for this parliament to pass, but we should have been able to find it readily in the papers presented with these appropriations. You can only tell what it is for from the papers provided by the parliamentary secretary.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There is another provision which gives you some window into a fundamental problem that the government have and the steps they are taking towards covering it: Australia’s defence and its air superiority capacity in the region. In the appropriations, there is a net figure of $103.8 million to the Department of Defence, which includes $149.4 million to fund accelerated depreciation for the early withdrawal of F111 fighter planes and two guided missile frigates. This is a fundamental and important issue, because the whole question of air superiority within our region has previously rested on the platform of the F111, a fighter bomber that is capable of extreme range and that has given us the ability to project ourselves and our defensive strength extremely well and extremely capably. There is the question of how well the fighter that is meant to replace the F111 will cover the role that was undertaken by the F111 in the past, but there is also an indication here that there is an acceleration in the provision of this program. You cannot gainsay the appropriation, but it is one of those provisions where the decision was made within less than a year to speed it up.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Likewise there is a proper provision of $24.3 million for the childhood obesity package. Speaking from lifelong experience, I can say that obesity is a significant problem within the Australian community and it is rapidly becoming a much greater problem not only here but in most of the western world; indeed it has even spread beyond that. It is a significant and difficult issue that relates in good part to the way our diet is structured and to the fact that a fundamental part of the best nutritional advice for two or three decades was probably wrong—that is, the food pyramid that most of us have relied upon. There has been a great deal of change in that area, but it is also a case of there being a significant and fundamental problem that has to be attacked on different levels and with a range of different approaches. I commend the appropriation of those moneys on this program. We do not have a full explanation for it here, because the government do not give us full explanations of what the appropriations are about. You get windows into what they are up to and some indications of what those programs are about, but the government are covering up what they do, so we cannot get a proper appreciation of them.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Some of those windows are pretty interesting—for example, the appropriation of $30 million to the Department of Transport and Regional Services for the expansion of the Roads to Recovery program. That appropriation is an indication that that program has been successful, at least for government members. It is the most touted program the government has, apart from AusLink, their new initiative. It is clear they want to pour more money into it so that road provision at the local level is increased. The member for Lingiari quite properly indicated that they have done nothing in the Northern Territory; they have concentrated their efforts in particular places. In the Roads to Recovery program and other specific programs, the government have substituted for state responsibilities and work on state roads because they have not continued the work on national roads that past governments had undertaken. That appropriation also indicates that there is a critical problem for the government in terms of infrastructure and major infrastructure projects.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I have not been able to see from 1996 on, even in the bald statements given within these documents, any commitment by this government to really tackle major infrastructure problems in a series of country electorates where there are fundamental problems with water usage. One that comes to mind that I dealt with a few years ago—and there has been no development in relation to this whatsoever, as far as I know—is what to do in the Lockyer Valley in Queensland, the vegetable-producing heart of Australia, and what to do with the $200 million worth of investment that the city of Brisbane needs to put into new sewerage works. They need new sewerage works. They can spend $200 million and just pour semi-treated material into Moreton Bay or they could spend $200 million and have that put towards a larger program which would provide recycled reticulated water from those sewerage works through to the Lockyer Valley. If more money were put into it, a total originally in the order of $600 million, you could actually take that water from Brisbane and pipe the excess—because the Lockyer Valley could only use about 40 per cent of it—up to the Darling Downs. Farmers in the Darling Downs, who have a lot of infrastructure in the ground that they have paid for that is as dry as a bone, could be using water from Brisbane to make their farms more productive and to renew, increase and extend their productive capacity. But there is nothing in this lot of appropriations about that. There is nothing in past budget measures. I have to say to those people who have been waiting on a promise with regard to that, and also on the Elliott main channel in the electorate of Capricornia: you can just whistle in the wind and hope that this government might actually get the message that fundamental infrastructure projects need to be treated with alacrity and they need to be treated seriously. They simply have not done it.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There is a sensible provision of $11 million—and it is an indication of the nature of the times we live in—for the Australian Customs Service for new biological and chemical mail screening capacities, and another $6.4 million for the Australian Federal Police for specialist counterterrorism equipment. Both of those are, in fact, synergistic. They need to be done. We need to increase our capacity to deal with the threats at our borders and with specific terrorist threats within Australia.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There is another provision in the parliamentary secretary’s speech which tells a bit of a sad story. It is only a slight window into what is happening. There is $84.6 billion to the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources to pay the government’s loan guarantee to the Australian Magnesium Corporation ahead of schedule, extinguishing the $90 billion liability. It is another Australian government input into something we would have hoped would have worked. We have got a series of those, including BHP’s HBI complex in the west. The potential for the Magnesium Corporation project to provide great income for Australia in the future was significant, but to date that has not come to fruition. The government is doing its part. I just hope that somehow that situation can be turned around and it can be made positive. The underlying potential for magnesium produced in Australia to really revolutionise the manufacture of car parts in particular and for Australia to take a leading role in future car production through that is extraordinary. We have three projects on foot here. They are the sorts of projects where you want to do everything you can to try to make them work. It is almost a case of private industry not being capable of doing enough to bash their way through, to get a result that would be good for them and of course good for Australia. So there are some sad things in here as well.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The last one I want to point to is the $65.8 million for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Austrade to enhance security in Australian diplomatic missions, including blast-proofing windows. That is yet another sign of the times. While we are looking at blast-proofing windows in our missions, we are considering moving some missions, particularly the one in Indonesia—where they had in fact blast-proofed the windows—into more secure zones, because the world we face is a much more difficult one than it was 15 years ago.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Having comprehensively looked at elements of what the parliamentary secretary has provided information on, I just want to finish with a broader look, consistent, I suppose, with what many members have done in the debate on these appropriation bills. I want to have a look at the broader question of where we are. Two significant reports have come down recently. The first was the OECD survey of Australia in 2004. I just want to note this: it states, on the Hawke-Keating reform agenda, that ‘Australia’s reform program was remarkable, and is still producing benefits’. But it points out that despite the coalition having enjoyed ‘an extended period of rapid economic growth, Australia’s productivity still lags seriously behind that of many nations’.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Quite effectively, this government, in part, has been asleep at the wheel. The hard, difficult work of dramatically changing Australia’s economy was done from 1986 on, in particular during the Hawke-Keating period. This mob have relatively coasted. The realisation of what should have been done has come very rapidly in the last couple of weeks. Part of the knock on the door came in February 2005 when the Reserve Bank said: ‘Hang on; time’s up. We’ve taken this period of time so far and we haven’t increased rates. We’re not going to do it this month but we’ve got to tell you that we have to increase rates in the future.’ That is largely a response to the fact that this government has not been entirely profligate over the past year. As the Leader of the Opposition and the Shadow Treasurer have said, $66 billion worth of profligate spending has led us to the point where there has been a 0.25 per cent increase in interest rates. We expect there will be at least one more increase, to the detriment of ordinary Australian families. I commend the amendment moved by the shadow Treasurer.</para>

<para>—I welcome this opportunity to speak on the <inline ref="R2279">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2004-2005</inline> and related bills which are a very important part of the government process. As the honourable member for Blaxland has pointed out, these bills come at a time of great interest in the Australian economy and when certain elements of the Australian economy are receiving a great deal of attention in this House and in the wider community generally.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">We saw in question time today the government duck and weave on their promise to keep interest rates low. They now say, ‘All we said was: interest rates will be lower under us than they would be under Labor,’ and, of course, they quite successfully ensured that there would be no way of testing that proposition by ensuring that the Labor Party was not elected to government. They did that at the same time that the Prime Minister, in any speech he made and regardless of what it was about, had on his podium a slogan which said, in very simple language, ‘Keeping interest rates low’—not lower than they would be under the Labor Party, not lower than they might be in other countries but ‘Keeping interest rates low’.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">That is not all they did. They sent out brochures in many seats across the country which had the capacity to check how your mortgage would go up with any increase in interest rates. You could pull out a little slide which said, ‘Interest rates under Whitlam and Hawke’ and ‘Check what your interest rates will be under a Latham Labor government’. They never said, ‘Interest rates would continue to be low but they might be a bit higher under us.’ They never said, ‘They’ll go up a bit but not too much.’ They said, ‘Interest rates will remain low.’</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We saw this government engaging in its favourite tactic of dog whistle politics. It has done this time and time again on many issues and it has done it on interest rates. It blows the dog whistle; it has an alibi so that it can say in future years, ‘We did not really promise that 100 per cent. We promised something similar to that.’ I can confirm to the House from the doorknocking that I did that the message has gone through. Every electorate in Australia is under the firm impression that this government would keep interest rates very low. Members of the community do not appreciate the increase in their mortgages which has come about as a result of interest rate increases. As the honourable member for Blaxland has said, there are more increases on the way.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">That would not be so bad if the economy was in decent shape while we were having these interest rate increases. If the economy was bubbling along, if we were managing from a position of strength and if our current account deficit was strong, then I am sure the Australian people would understand the need to have an interest rate increase. But instead we find the current account deficit hitting seven per cent at a time when our terms of trade are at a record high. If our terms of trade were at the levels when the current account deficit was at six per cent under the Keating government, then I think we would find a current account deficit well over 10 per cent of gross domestic product which, of course, would be not only unsustainable but disastrous. In my capacity as Deputy Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, I asked the Governor of the Reserve Bank when he appeared before us a couple weeks ago if he was worried about a terms of trade collapse which would see the current account deficit blow out to disastrous levels. He said that that was a scenario which he could well foresee happening and that it would be a worry if it happened.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There is a great deal of humbug from the government on the economy and on their economic management. They claim that their economic management is amongst the best in the world but, of course, there are other countries in the world which they do not talk about very much at all. I would like to bring the attention of the House to the Irish economy which went through a very similar reform process to the Australian economy in the 1980s. The Irish reformed their telecommunications industry; struck a social accord with their unions; brought in budget surpluses, just as the Hawke and Keating governments did for the first time; and brought their unemployment rate down from 17 per cent to four per cent. Their current account deficit is effectively in balance and they have continued the reform process by embracing research and development. This government has not only ignored but taken backward steps on research and development. It has abolished the research and development tax concession and has done absolutely nothing to embrace research and development. We are seeing the fruit of that neglect, with manufactured exports going backwards and not improving anywhere near as much as they did under the Hawke and Keating governments and in other nations across the world. In the years 1986 to 1990, 27 categories of manufactured exports increased by more than 10 per cent. We are now finding that the majority of categories of manufactured exports are declining.
