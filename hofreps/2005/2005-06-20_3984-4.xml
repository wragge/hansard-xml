<para>âThis report deals with the Agreement on Bilateral Cooperation between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Kingdom of Thailand; the termination of the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Slovak Republic on Trade and Economic Cooperation; the Joint Agreement on Enhanced Cooperation between Australia and Papua New Guinea; the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air; amendments to the schedule to the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, 1946; the Agreement on Social Security between the Government of Australia and the Government of Malta; the Beijing amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer; and amendments, agreed at Bangkok in October 2004, to appendixes I and II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.</para>

<para>
<inline font-style="italic">Report 65</inline> contains the findings and recommendations of the review conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties into eight treaty actions tabled in the parliament on 7 December 2004 and 8 February 2005. The treaty actions relate to the matters identified in the full title of the report. I will comment on a selection of the treaty actions considered.</para>
<para>Firstly, the committee reviewed the enhanced cooperation agreement with Papua New Guinea. The committee supported the agreement, which would have enabled the deployment of Australian police and other officials to deliver assistance to Papua New Guinea. The committee acknowledged the urgent need for the agreement to be in force prior to the treaty action being tabled in parliament and so supported the national interest exemption being invoked. The committee awaits the outcome of developments, following the decision of the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea that Australian police and personnel withdraw, and the possible renegotiation of the terms of the agreement. The committee has found that there have been a number of treaties relating to the stability of Pacific island countries which have invoked the national interest exemption and entered into force before being tabled in parliament. This report contains some recommendations whereby the committee has recommended that in cases such as these it receives an urgent briefing on the proposed treaty action.</para>
<para>Secondly, the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air updates, and will eventually replace, the current convention and also a number of subsequent conventions and protocols which together form the Warsaw system. The Montreal convention will provide a uniform code that modernises the international air carrier liability framework and will provide measures such as electronic documentation to assist the movement of air passengers, baggage and cargo.</para>
<para>Thirdly, the amendments to the Schedule to the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling concern a multilateral treaty that regulates the conservation and use of whale stocks. The initial focus of the convention was to ensure international control of postwar development of the commercial whaling industry. More recently, the International Whaling Commission, established under the convention, has been a vehicle for conservation measures such as the 1982 decision to implement a moratorium on commercial whaling. The committee found that Australia already prohibits killing, injuring or interfering with whales in Australian waters and that, under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, Australia provides a higher level of protection for whales than provided for under the convention.</para>
<para>Lastly, the amendments to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora concern a multilateral treaty which regulates international trade in specimens of wild fauna and flora. This treaty action recognises that international cooperation will protect and conserve endangered and threatened species of fauna and flora from exploitation through international trade. This treaty provides for differing degrees of regulation of trade, resulting in differing levels of protection for each species.</para>
<para>In conclusion, it is the view of the committee that it is in Australiaâs interest for the treaties considered in <inline font-style="italic">Report 65</inline> to be ratified. The committee has made its recommendations accordingly. I commend the report to the House.</para>

<para>âI rise to speak in support of Report 65 and the recommendations made by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. I support the remarks of the chair, the member for Boothby, and particularly welcome the recommendations supporting ratification of the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air. I want to make some remarks about some of the other treaties mentioned. The review made a number of findings in relation to the benefits for Australia of entering into specific treaties and the issue surrounding each treaty action. The committee supports binding treaty action for the eight treaty actions reviewed. The majority of the proposed treaty actions serve to strengthen political, diplomatic, security and social ties between Australia and treaty parties, as indicated in individual treaty chapters in the report. There are, however, instances where the committee process is negated for national security or interest reasons.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>A recurring issue of reviews is the impact on the process of review by proposed treaties when the national interest exemption is invoked by the government. An example where the national interest exemption was used is the Enhanced Cooperation Agreement with Papua New Guinea. The agreement enabled the deployment of Australian police and other officials to deliver assistance to Papua New Guinea. Subsequently the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea ruled that the agreement was in breach of the Papua New Guinea constitution and subsequently Australian police and other officials were withdrawn from Papua New Guinea. Regardless of the outcome in this case, the committee acknowledged the urgent need for the agreement to be in force prior to the treaty action being tabled in parliament and parliamentary consideration of the agreement. However, this outcome highlights the view that it would be beneficial to the committee, and indeed to the Australian parliament, if in these circumstances an urgent briefing could be provided on such agreements by the minister. The committee has recommended accordingly.</para>
<para>The committee also looked at a number of other treaties which I will speak about. The Agreement on Bilateral Cooperation between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Kingdom of Thailand will strengthen political, diplomatic, security and social ties between Australia and Thailand through cooperation and information exchange. The agreement also establishes a Joint Commission on Bilateral Cooperation, which will meet biannually at the ministerial level to review progress on cooperative activities identified in the agreement. The commission would also continue to strengthen ties between Australia and Thailand by identifying further areas for potential cooperation.</para>
<para>The committee supports the Termination of the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Slovak Republic on Trade and Economic Cooperation. Accession to the EU requires a country to terminate existing bilateral agreements. This treaty action will allow the Slovak Republic to accede to the European Union. The committee also supports the Agreement on Social Security between the Government of Australia and the Government of Malta. The agreement is part of a network of existing social security bilateral agreements and is similar to others that we have with other countries. It will provide access to certain Australian and Maltese social security benefits and limited portability of these benefits between the countries. The Beijing Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer recognises the environmental and human health problems resulting from the damage to the ozone layer. The amendment aims to diminish this damage by committing parties to a reduction of the consumption of substances that harm that ozone layer.</para>
<para>I would like to express my appreciation and gratitude to the committee secretariat, who put in untiring efforts to help get these matters dealt with and brought before the parliament. They make a fantastic contribution, and it should be recognised.</para>

<para>âOn behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Account I present the committeeâs report on the annual reports of the National Native Title Tribunal, the Indigenous Land Corporation and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Account 2003-2004, together with evidence received by the committee.</para>

<para>âOn behalf of the committee, I wish to say a few things. Often when we have reviews in the parliament of annual reports of agencies, I have not been convinced that it has been a productive processâand many committees have chosen not to give it a high priorityâbut in this instance I regard it very highly. It is a very important iterative process where the parliament learns of developments in an area of major social reform with regard to native title and where the agencies involved are kept accountable as the new issues evolve. I welcome the fact that the Chairman of the Native Title Tribunal, Mr Neate, in his evidence to the committee, said how much the tribunal has valued the work of the committee in previous years in reviewing and making suggestions about reporting and other issues.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>This is an important year because the 10th anniversary of the commencement of the Native Title Act and the establishment of the tribunal occurred midway through the year under review. We see here evidence of a major social reform settling down and being embedded in the operations of society and the economy. We see evidence from the tribunal of Indigenous land use agreements being negotiated and registered in a steadily increasing number and that future act consent determinations are becoming an increasingly common means of finalising negotiations. There has been political controversy around issues to do with native title, and it is not appropriate for me to speak on behalf of others about that, but irrespective of that we have had a major change in the Australian economic and social fabric as a result of native title and it is now settling down and working in ways that many people hoped it would.</para>
<para>There emerged in evidence a reiteration of the importance of the provisions in the Native Title Act that refer to negotiation in good faith, which arises in the case of future act negotiations. I think the parliament, in appreciating that this is an important element of the Native Title Act, should in other legislation similarly look at the question of requiring parties to negotiate in good faith. Those are the principal comments I want to make of substance. I do hope that some of the guidelines for which we are waiting from the Commonwealth government with regard to native title matters will be forthcoming in this 12-month period when we review it again. If they are not, I will have something to say at the tabling of that report, but I do not wish to enter into that controversy now.</para>
<para>The committee has in its conclusion commended the Native Title Tribunal on its comprehensive and accessible annual report and made some suggestions for inclusion in future. We have had, in dealings with issues to do with the Indigenous Land Corporation, an analysis of the impact of changes in ATSIC. The committee raised the issue of the effect on the corporation of the abolition of ATSIC and regional councils, and the ILC voiced some concern about the loss of the regional councils and ATSIC as resources for advice and consultation. We will need to turn to the next annual report to see how this issue is evolving, how that major change is being dealt with by the ILC and how the ILC has been able to perform.</para>
<para>There has been concern from the committee in the past about aspects of the reports of the ILC and the related reports of what was called the land fund and what is now called the land account, but the general view is that the corporation has taken note of comments from previous reports and acted on them and we welcome that change. I commend the report to the House and I thank the other members and the staff of the committee for facilitating these important hearings.</para>

<para>âI present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 13th annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum held in Ha Long City, Vietnam, from 10 to 13 January 2005. This delegation included the member for Cowan as deputy leader, the members for Capricornia and Hume, Senator Eggleston and me as leader. The Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum is an organisation with great significance for Australia because it is an assembly of members of national parliaments in the Asia-Pacific region. Since 1993 it has met each January to discuss matters of mutual concernâmainly strategic, economic, social and cultural issues. These meetings provide a valuable opportunity for Australian members of parliament to hold discussions with parliamentarians from the region on matters of common interest.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The focus of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum is on countries that are Australiaâs neighbours and that are therefore of immediate concern to our regional strategic and economic interests. Giving strength to this focus are the formal objectives of the forum. These are, firstly, to deepen our understanding of the interests and policy concerns of countries in the region; secondly, to examine the major political, social and cultural developments arising from economic growth and integration; thirdly, to promote cooperation; and, fourthly, to foster the roles we have as national parliamentarians to build up a sense of regional cohesion and cooperation.</para>
<para>None of us will forget the impact of the tragic earthquake and tsunami on this meeting that was held only two weeks after the event. While it cast a shadow over the meeting and we were deeply conscious of the suffering and loss amongst our colleagues from other parliaments, we were also glad of the opportunity to express our sympathy and friendship to these colleagues. They were keen to inform us of the impact of the disaster on their own countries, but they were equally keen to acknowledge the great assistance they were receiving and the spirit of friendship and cooperation which was behind the generous and immediate response to the disaster.</para>
<para>On behalf of the parliament, I expressed to the meeting our sympathy to all those affected, particularly those who suffered so much in Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia. The tsunami demonstrated to all of us how a single event can affect many countriesâand that among the diverse countries of our region there is cohesion and strong bonds of friendship based on shared humanity, compassion and common interest. I was also able to reiterate Australiaâs strong and continuing support for the aims and objectives of the forum and our commitment to helping to achieve a regional and international environment that is peaceful and secure.</para>
<para>I will turn now to the substantive subject matter of the meeting. As is customary at these meetings, sessions were broken into three main areas: political and security issues, economic and trade issues and cooperation in addressing regional issues of general interest. I spoke to the session on the regional and international political and security situation and, in doing so, I emphasised that, as globalisation increases economic interdependence, this in turn increases countriesâ shared stakes in stability and security. The roles of the ASEAN Regional Forum and APEC in countering threats to stability and security were emphasised, together with Australiaâs support for capacity building in regional states.</para>
<para>The report discusses other resolutions proposed by Australia and the delegationâs contributions to debate and negotiation. The issues addressed included international terrorism, landmines, the world and regional economic situation and the environment. As well as debate in the plenary, the delegation took an active role in all meetings of the drafting committee. In addition, the delegation participated in a number of successful bilateral meetings with other delegations, including the President of the National Assembly of Vietnam, the Speaker of the Indonesian House of Representatives and the leader of the delegation from the Peopleâs Republic of China.</para>
<para>On behalf of the delegation I would like to express our thanks to the Australian Ambassador to Vietnam, Mr Joe Thwaites, Ms Sandra Henderson from the embassy in Hanoi and staff from the National Assembly of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. I also thank the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Parliamentary Library and the Parliamentary Relations Office. I wish to place on record my sincere thanks to my former senior adviser, Peter Gibson, whose depth of understanding of the APPF and analytical and organisational skills provided a very high level of support to our delegation. In conclusion, I would like to thank all members of the delegation for their active support and involvement and also Catherine Cornish, the hardworking secretary to the delegation.</para>

<para>âAs you mentioned, Mr Speaker, the deputy leader of the delegation to Vietnam earlier this year was the member for Cowan. He has been held up this morning, so I am very pleased to have the opportunity to step in and speak to this report of our participation in the meeting of the Asia Pacific Parliamentary Forum in Vietnam in January. As you noted, Mr Speaker, the APPF has great significance for the parliament and for Australia because it is an assembly of members of national parliaments in our own region, Asia-Pacific. In preparing for and attending this meeting, the delegation was conscious of the strong contributions of previous delegations from this parliament and we were determined to continue this tradition.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As you mentioned, Mr Speaker, at the time of the meeting we were all still greatly shocked by the impact of the Indian Ocean tsunami of 26 December 2004. There was unanimous support for commemoration and discussion of the tsunami before any other business was considered. Before the meeting began to discuss the tsunami, we were shown a very powerful video by the delegation from Indonesia. This had graphic footage of the arrival and aftermath of the tsunami. Coming into that meeting we thought we had seen all the horrors that we could possibly see on our own television coverage, but this video brought it home very graphically.</para>
<para>The long silence that followed the end of the broadcast indicated the emotional effect on all of us at the meeting. Members of all delegations were pleased to have the opportunity to show our sympathy and support for those who were affected so deeply by the disaster. Our own delegation was pleased, Mr Speaker, that you were able to outline to the meeting the high level of assistance and sympathy provided by the Australian people, government and opposition. Delegates from the countries affected by the disaster were very quick to express their gratitude for the support and friendship that had already been demonstrated by neighbours in the region, including Australia. There was useful discussion about the long-term technical and financial support that will be needed, especially the need for an early warning system in the region and elsewhere in the world, and I am pleased that practical steps are being taken in this direction.</para>
<para>The meeting discussed a range of subject matters that are relevant to our region. Broadly, these covered political and security issues, economic and trade issues and cooperation to address regional issues of common interest. Mr Speaker, you have referred already to the particular aspects that were covered by our resolutions and debate, and the report discusses them in chapter 2.</para>
<para>For my own part I want to mention briefly the debate on the subject of the environment. I took the lead on our motion on the environment, and the particular emphasis of that motion was on the Barbados program of action for the sustainable development of small island developing states. Around the same time as the APPF meeting in Vietnam in January there was a meeting in Mauritius to review the implementation of the Barbados program of action. The motion that I put to the meeting spelled out the challenges facing small island developing states and called on all parliaments to examine the outcomes from the Mauritius meeting and to redouble their efforts to assist our small island neighbours with the challenges they are facing. I am pleased to say that motion was supported by a number of other countries and was eventually passed as a resolution by the meeting.</para>
<para>Other issues with a particular regional focus were discussed at the meetingâs session on cooperation in addressing common issues in the Asia-Pacific region. These issues included infectious diseases such as bird flu, resources for sustainable development and the role of cultural exchange in promoting dialogue and understanding among nations. The broad nature of this discussion was valuable because it enabled all delegations to raise issues of current concern and interest.</para>
<para>All of us in the Australian delegation participated in the work of the plenary as well as the informal meetings that followed debate of the motions that were proposed. These informal meetings were interesting opportunities to gain an understanding of the perspective of our colleagues from other countries and to offer them a deeper understanding of our Australian perspective. Negotiations were sometimes a bit robust but they were conducted and completed with goodwill.</para>
<para>I too would like to thank the Australian Embassy staff in Vietnam, including Mr Joe Thwaites and Ms Sandra Henderson. Ms Hendersonâs cheerful and sustained efforts were appreciated by all of us. The organising committee and staff from the National Assembly of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam made every effort to ensure that the meeting was successful. The National Assembly appointed Ms Tu Anh to provide direct liaison support between the meetingâs secretariat and our delegation. The people of Ha Long City gave all of us a warm welcome and we noticed that the friendliness extended beyond the public, formal occasions and continued throughout our entire time there. I also want to acknowledge and thank the staff of the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Parliamentary Relations Office who gave us great assistance. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI present the report of the Australian Delegation to the 112th Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly held in Manila and a bilateral visit to the Solomon Islands. I had the very real privilege of leading this delegation and I am pleased to report to the House that it was a hardworking, cohesive and effective delegation. I place on record my thanks to the deputy leader of the delegation, the member for Fowler, who is currently in the House, the member for Mackellar and certainly the member for Fraser. I also thank Senator Grant Chapman and Senator Julian McGauran. All of these people made significant contributions to our work and were a delight to travel with in Manila and the Solomon Islands. I understand the member for Fowler will address that part of the report dealing with the bilateral visit to the Solomon Islands. In addition I would like to thank Mr Neil Bessell and Dr Barbara Cooper for their assistance, which went above and beyond the call of duty at all times in their endeavours to service each and every one of the delegation. We place on record our very sincere thanks to both Mr Bessell and Dr Cooper.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I commend to honourable members the summary of our work that appears at page 3 of the report. It shows that members of this delegation made a real contribution to the IPUâs work in Manila. I think this contribution was all the more significant this time given that for four of us this was our first IPU assembly and a learning curve indeed. I am sure previous delegates will agree that the structure, statutes, rules, practices and procedures of the IPU take some time to absorb and understand. We were absolutely dedicated and 100 per cent in attendance. This delegation took a strategic approach to its work. We agreed on tasks and responsibilities long before going to Manila, and held daily meetings during the assembly to assess situations and determine positions. This enabled delegates to participate fully in agenda items and meetings during the entire assembly.</para>
<para>For example, the assembly has a general debate on the political, economic and social situation in the world under the overall theme of the impact of domestic and international policies on the situation of women. The rules also allowed this debate to include matters relevant to the emergency agenda item, and the member for Mackellar made a wonderful contribution including important comments on Australiaâs response to the Boxing Day 2004 tsunami. The delegation was particularly pleased to get Mrs Bishop elected to the committee that drafted the final resolution on the emergency agenda item on natural disasters and the role of parliaments in prevention, rehabilitation, reconstruction and the protection of vulnerable groups.</para>
<para>The IPU has standing committees like our committee structure and considers issues and formulates recommendations or resolutions. Mrs Irwin, the member for Fowler, addressed the First Committee on Peace and International Security on the role of parliaments in the establishment and functioning of mechanisms to provide for the judgment and sentencing of war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and terrorism, with a view to avoiding impunityâand a very good address it was. Senator McGauran also addressed the first committee with an enormously informative address.</para>
<para>The member for Fraser addressed the Second Committee on Sustainable Development, Finance and Trade on the role of parliaments in establishing innovative international financing and trading mechanisms to address the problem of debt and achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Following this contribution Mr McMullan was invited to participate in the UN-IPU panel on financing for development in New York earlier this month. I addressed the Third Committee on Democracy and Human Rights on the very important issue of the role of parliaments in advocating and enforcing observance of human rights in the strategies for the prevention, management and treatment of the HIV-AIDS pandemic. I was also honoured to be elected to the Coordinating Committee of Women Parliamentarians. This is a short summary of what turned out to be a hectic, exciting and rewarding first IPU Assembly. The delegation performed admirably and with great respect to the Australian parliament. (<inline font-style="italic">Time expired</inline>)</para>

<para>âFirstly, I wish to congratulate the member for Riverina in her outstanding role as leader of the delegation. The second part of the IPU delegation report deals with the bilateral visit to the Solomon Islands. Ethnic tensions resulting in armed action have disrupted the local economy and functions of government in the Solomons. The aim of the visit therefore included a review of progress made by the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands, RAMSI, and a gauge of the local response to the work of RAMSI. The delegation visited the RAMSI base in Honiara and was briefed on the progress of operations by the Special Coordinator, Mr James Bately, and other RAMSI officials, including Ms Sandi Peisley, the commander of the participating police force.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>At a meeting with the Solomons Minister for Police and National Security, the delegation was advised that he regarded the RAMSI operation as a partnership which has had a significant impact on the restoration of law and order on the Solomon Islands. The minister estimated that crime has been reduced by 70 per cent since RAMSI commenced operations. However, at a roundtable meeting with 12 members of the Solomons parliament some reservations about the role of RAMSI were raised. While it was felt that RAMSI was appreciated, it needs to be tidied up. MPs expressed the view that RAMSI was supposed to be a partnership but the sovereignty of the Solomon Islands needed to be respected and the government needed to take a leading role in how RAMSI was operating. This was completely different from the view given at our meeting with the Prime Minister, the Hon. Sir Alan Kemakeza, who advised that RAMSI was going very well. In his view, RAMSI was not undermining the sovereignty of Solomon Islands.</para>
<para>The delegation discussed the Pacific Plan with the foreign minister and government leaders. The plan was described as ambitious and effective, offering security, good governance, growth and sustainable development for the region. The planning minister expressed the need to restore social services to rural areas along with infrastructure and assistance to encourage business development. RAMSI was also praised by the finance minister for, in his words, replacing chaos, vandalism and daylight robbery with law and order. He described RAMSI as a guiding light, a saviour and divine intervention.</para>
<para>He also pointed to the need for regulation to ensure proper reafforestation, adding that it is possible to have a sustainable industry as long as you replant. This view was confirmed when the delegation visited the island of Kolombangara and inspected timber plantations operated by a private company. At a briefing in Gizo, Mr Dan Raymond, the team leader of an AusAID forestry project, gave a presentation on the need for sustainable forest planning and gave examples of local projects where landowners were assisted and encouraged to plant high-value timber on their land.</para>
<para>The delegation also met with opposition MPs and held discussions on aspects of parliamentary ethics and electoral reform. In addition, the delegation met with Ms Sue Ingram, the team leader of the Machinery of Government Program, the Chief Justice, Sir Albert Palmer, and the Speaker of the Solomon Islands parliament, Sir Peter Kenilorea. We also met with womenâs groups, local government representatives and a range of international aid staff. The highlight of the visit was a 40-kilometre trip in an open boat from New Georgia to Gizo. A tropical stormâ</para>

<para>âPeople who lose their jobs when the company they work for goes out of business need all the help they can get. Often these people are older members of the work force and find it difficult to gain new employment. Often they have families and need a flow of income to keep food on the table. The <inline ref="R2375">Employee Protection (Employee Entitlements Guarantee) Bill 2005</inline> does not provide these people with handouts. It does not provide them with welfare. It simply gives them a guarantee of access to what is theirs. It guarantees them access to the leave and redundancy payouts that have accrued to them over the years.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Redundancy provisions are, of course, designed for this very eventuality. They are designed to provide sustenance for people who find themselves in difficult circumstances through no fault of their own. What could be so objectionable about a private memberâs bill which guarantees workers access to the entitlements they have already accrued and which are rightfully theirs? This bill is very similar to those introduced by my predecessor as the member for Prospect, the Hon. Janice Crosio, on an almost annual basis. I pay tribute to Janiceâs efforts to place and keep this issue on the national agenda and I am proud to be continuing the tradition of the member for Prospect standing up for the rights of workers who have been made redundant.</para>
<para>The Employee Protection (Employee Entitlements Guarantee) Bill 2005 provides for the establishment and administration of a scheme to guarantee the payment of wages and other accrued liabilities owed to employees in the event of employer insolvency and for related purposes. The current scheme, put in place by this government, simply does not work. Frankly, the government was dragged kicking and screaming to introduce a scheme to protect employee entitlements. It was against the ideological grain of the government to do so, but it was shamed into action by the collapse of National Textiles.</para>
<para>Documents released under the freedom of information laws last year show what a failure the current scheme is. One in five claimants under the GEER scheme is owed an average of $9,000 in outstanding entitlements. Thirty-eight per cent of claimants have to wait for more than 16 weeks to access their entitlements; some claimants have been made to wait for more than a year. When the scheme was set up, the then Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, the Hon. Tony Abbott, promised that over 90 per cent of employees would receive 100 per cent of their entitlements. The reality falls far short of this. Perhaps it was a rock solid, rolled gold commitment!</para>
<para>This bill involves employers, other than in small business, taking out insurance to ensure that employee entitlements are provided for in the event of the business going into receivership. Employees not only need to be sure that they will receive their entitlements, they also deserve the peace of mind to know that those entitlements are protected in the difficult circumstances when a business is going through tough times. The Prime Minister in the last few days has shown an ability to recognise his governmentâs failings and to take some small steps to remedy those failings. I call on the Prime Minister, other ministers and the government to recognise this governmentâs failings in relation to employee entitlements. The scheme proposed in this bill would remedy the shortfalls inherent in the governmentâs scheme. I commend the bill to the House and I call on the government to allow it to be debated.</para>

<para>âThe Parliamentary Privileges Act was passed in 1987. It represented a turning point in the history of the Australian parliament, because for the first time the parliament codified much of the law relating to parliamentary privilege. Its decision to do so followed a comprehensive joint select committeeâs review of the law relating to privilege and contempt tabled in 1984. Most features of the 1987 act were admirable. It established statutory provisions for the protection of witnesses who gave evidence to parliamentary committees. Doubts about the powers of the houses of parliament to impose fines were removed. A threshold definition of contempt was established to help winnow out some of the more trifling matters which had concerned the houses over the years. A limited right of review was established where a house had committed a person to prison for contempt.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>But the act was deficient in one important respect: section 16(3) provides that witnesses in courts or other tribunals cannot be questioned or examined about evidence they may have given to a house or a committee. That has the effect of preventing the cross-examination of witnesses as to prior inconsistent statements given to a house or a committee. This provision carries the reach of parliamentary privilege too far. None of us doubts that senators, members and others who take part in parliamentary proceedings, such as committee hearings, should be protected. No-one should be exposed to being sued or prosecuted on account of what they say to a parliamentary committee. I also accept that reasonable people can hold differing views as to whether a person who is on trial for an offence should be able to be cross-examined about prior inconsistent statements they have made to a committee. The <inline ref="R2372">Parliamentary Privileges Amendment Bill 2005</inline> I have introduced does not permit that. But it does recognise that the 1987 act goes too far in preventing others from being cross-examined about statements made to a committee, and this amendment bill seeks to alter that position.</para>
<para>Mr Spender QC, then shadow Attorney-General, speaking in the House of Representatives debate on 5 May 1987 on the bill which was passed and enacted as the Parliamentary Privileges Act I have referred to, put the case for change very well. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Let us take a hypothetical case in which a witness comes before a parliamentary committee and gives evidence which is quite untruthful and which amounts to a charge of serious criminal conduct against a third person. That third person is charged. The same witness is called and gives different evidence but the evidence is vital to the case for example, vital to the prosecution. Should it not be open to the accused person to say: âThe evidence he is giving is quite untruthful. What he says now is different from what he said before the parliamentary committeeâ?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Regrettably, preventing such a step would be the effect of the existing legislation. Other honourable members and senators had similar reservations to Mr Spenderâs on this point but they chose not to delay the passage of the bill with its other many worthwhile reforms. Section 16(3) of the Parliamentary Privileges Act on this point therefore carries parliamentary privilege further than is necessary or desirable. It has the potential to prevent the giving of evidence that, in some future case, may be vital to the rights of an innocent person on trial or to a just outcome in civil litigation.</para>
<para>I would like to recognise the scholarship of Sir Clarrie Harders, who devoted a good deal of time to researching this matter and whose comprehensive paper titled <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary privilegeâParliament versus the courts: Cross-examination of committee witnesses</inline>, published by the Information and Research Services of the Parliamentary Library over a decade ago, in October 1991, first prompted me to take up the issue as long ago as 1992. The proposition advanced by Sir Clarrie, and incorporated in my bill, is consistent with the laws we have inherited, but it adjusts them to ensure that the perceived needs of the parliament are not allowed to ride roughshod over other considerations, such as the administration of justice.</para>
<para>I ask honourable members to take the opportunity to study this measure and I will welcome their comments on it. It comes without any partisanship and I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. I would hope that the occasion might occur when the Attorney-General and shadow Attorney-General both support this legislation and that we see its passage in due course. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</para>

<para class="block">The <inline ref="R2276">Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change (Kyoto Protocol Ratification) Bill 2005</inline> should be passed by this parliament and it should be passed today. It should be passed right now because climate change is happening right now. We are at one of the most important crossroads in our history. Climate change is the greatest threat to the health of Australia and our planet. It is the greatest environmental challenge facing the global community.</para>
<para>This bill provides for action by the Australian government. If passed, it will see an end to Australiaâs complacency and isolation from the global effort to avoid dangerous climate change and will require the Australian government to take action. Firstly, it will require the government to ratify the Kyoto protocol within 60 days of the commencement of the act. Secondly, it will require to government to ensure Australia meets its greenhouse emission target set out in the protocolâthis is 108 per cent of 1990 levels. Only Iceland has a higher target. Thirdly, the minister must develop a national climate change action plan setting out our national strategy for meeting our greenhouse emission target. Fourthly, the minister would have to establish an annual greenhouse gas inventory and publish the results. And, fifthly, the minister must also develop a framework for involvement in the international trading of carbon. This would include emissions trading but also clean development mechanism projects in developing countries. If passed, the bill will enable Australia to enjoy the benefits that flow from meeting our international obligations under the Kyoto protocol.</para>
<para>This is not a debate about Right or Left. This is a debate about right and wrong. It is a debate about old ways or new paths. It is not a debate about blame; it is a debate about real solutions to problems that are real now, but potentially catastrophic if not addressed. Average global temperatures have risen by 0.6 degrees over the past century. The 10 hottest years on record have all been in the last 14 years. Glaciers that have not retreated since the last ice age 12,000 years ago are now doing so. Australians can already see the kinds of impacts that will only get worse as warming advances: the four-year drought, the drop in rainfall in Western Australia, Kakadu being flooded by salt water, and coral bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef.</para>
<para>Experts predict that Australia is going to get progressively drier over the coming century. According to the CSIRO, climate change will only worsen drought conditions. What Australia does in the next decade to avoid dangerous climate change will determine the fate of our economy, our environment and our way of life. Ratification of Kyoto is not only good for the environment it is good for the economy. That is why the Prime Minister proclaimed in 1997, when Australia signed the Kyoto protocol, that Kyoto was a win for the environment and a win for Australian jobs. The Prime Minster was right then but he is wrong now.</para>
<para>The potential for innovation and therefore business investment and growth is immense. With the right policy framework, it has the potential to unleash new commercial forces and unforeseen economic opportunities. By not ratifying, Australia is giving the world a jump-start on entry to a dynamic driving force of 21st century economies. Australian companies and our economy will be disadvantaged if we exclude ourselves from carbon markets and the developing renewable energy technology markets. The investment will simply go elsewhere. Pacific Solar has already moved to Germany. Businesses that want to take advantage of the clean development mechanism provisions are already establishing themselves in New Zealand.</para>
<para>Emissions trading is the most efficient way of achieving outcomes because it reduces the cost of reducing emissions and therefore provides the most effective method of encouraging action. That is why state and territory governments have agreed on a framework to introduce a state based scheme. But it requires national leadership. The Howard governmentâs response has been to abolish the Australian Greenhouse Officeâconfirmed in the last budget. Were it not for the decisions of the Beattie and Carr governments to stem land clearing, Australia would not meet our Kyoto target.</para>
<para>Given that Australia will meet our generous target, it is absurd that Australia remains on the outside looking in. Like almost every international agreement Australia is part of, it is not perfect. But it is an important first step, and it is the only game in town. Labor believes that Australia is missing out on significant opportunities by not ratifying the Kyoto protocol. It is in the interests of our economy, our health and the international community for us to sign up and ratify Kyoto immediately. We need to become part of the coalition of the willing when it comes to tackling climate change, and I call for a full debate and a vote on this bill.</para>

<para>âI begin by stating that, in the very title of the <inline ref="R2276">Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change (Kyoto Protocol Ratification) Bill 2005</inline>, the member for Grayndler is seeking to reinvent accepted scientific vernacular to fit his partyâs ideology. The term âdangerous climate changeâ allows an any-way bet and can be used whatever the climatic changes that occur. After all, the only real certainty about climate is that it will change over time. I refer to an article by Andrew Bolt which was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> on 9 February this year. It states that Greenpeace has, in recent years, replaced the term âglobal warmingâ with âclimate changeâ in its press releases. The threat of global warming is not as strong as it once was, so climate change is a more sellable term.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The worldâs glaciers retreat and advance constantly over time. The totemic Upsala Glacier, which Greenpeace uses in its rant about global warming, has actually seen no warming at all since scientists began study. Glaciologists working at this glacier utterly reject global warming as the cause of this glacierâs retreat. In fact, up until the mid-1970s there was a general scientific belief that the world was due for another ice age. A report prepared for the US congress in 1978 agreed with the National Academy of Sciences that âin geological perspective, the case for cooling is strongâwe may reasonably suppose the world is about to slide into the next ice ageâ.</para>
<para>The member for Grayndler and the member for Kingsford Smith think that dangerous climate changeâthis newly invented termâis the greatest threat facing humanity. Yet they reject nuclear energy as part of the solution. The member for Kingsford Smith had a band called Midnight Oil. Given his position on nuclear energy, he should have joined the band whose theme song was <inline font-style="italic">Living in the Seventies</inline>. It is difficult to know, however, who would be the lead singer and who would be on backing vocalsâthe member for Kingsford Smith or the member for Grayndler. The rest of the Labor Party would make up the band, although the resultant sound would more aptly be described as a caterwauling cacophony than something melodious to most Australian ears.</para>
<para>Nuclear energy is a safe solution, especially with the inherently safe generation IV reactors, which make meltdown impossible, and synroc, an Australian invention which mimics rock that has safely stored radioactive waste from a natural nuclear reactor in Africa for two billion years. Synroc can store high-grade radioactive waste for geological periods of time. It is important to note that, after a period of hundreds of yearsâand certainly not the figure of 300,000-odd years that Greenpeace likes to pushâhigh-grade nuclear waste will have radioactivity levels akin to the original yellowcake. Additionally, total radioactivity levels on earth are slightly lower after the nuclear power processâin other words, nuclear power generation does not add to overall radioactivity levels on earth at all.</para>
<para>It would appear that the opposition sees its place as being negative: voicing problemsâas it sees themâbut never actually coming up with any solutions. Instead of the Kyoto rhetoric, the opposition should be embracing solutions, not rejecting them. This government will always put solutions above rhetoricâunlike the opposition, which seems intent on trying to make outdated rhetoric fit into a modern world.</para>
<para>I urge the House to reject this bill, and I urge the opposition to become part of the solution rather than part of the problem.</para>

<para>âI rise to support the <inline ref="R2276">Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change (Kyoto Protocol Ratification) Bill 2005</inline>. I challenge the Prime Minister and senior ministers to support any of the comments we have just heard from the member for Tangney, which was one of the poorest efforts in debate in the House that I have yet witnessed. Since this bill was first read in the House, the wave of reports and increased knowledge in relation to threats posed by climate change just keeps coming. The Australian government has used the reduction in land clearing as a statistical fig leaf, but now it is fully exposed, with significant carbon dioxide increases anticipated over the next 20 years and beyond. To put it plainly, the bell is ringing loudly on climate change and the Howard government remains virtually immobile and mute.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As state governments, individuals, communities, companies and, of course, the international community all commit to responding to the most important environmental challenge we face, we in Australia are stuck like shags on a rockâisolated and ineffective. We are failing the farmers and frustrating the efforts of those who are willing to invest, innovate and employ people in seeking solutions which address climate changeâthose people who want to act now. As the hot weather intensifies and the ice sheets melt and drop into the sea, as the clarion call goes out from the reputable scientific community for continued leadership and action, the Howard government is absent. It is doing nothing of consequence and saying nothing of consequence. It simply lacks the political nous to address immediately this issue. Faced with imminent change on a landscape scale, the government is incapable of facing up to the problems of living in a hothouse and addressing the effects that global warming is already having, and will increasingly have, on our natural plant and animal communities and our ecosystems.</para>
<para>Where is the road map? Where are the plans? Where is the vision? All the government has on offer is a widely discredited white paper on energy, and a few voices who fly the nuclear power flag. Instead of articulating how Australia will address climate change, those on the other side, by embracing the nuclear option, want to replace the problem of the increasing level of carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming, with another problemânamely, the creation of long-life radioactive waste. Judging from the debate in the House, this seems to be the extent of the governmentâs thinking on this issue. What a tragic state of affairsâand the longer the delay, the more difficult addressing this problem becomes.</para>
<para>There are some clear ways forward which have been identified by Labor in this House and in this bill. We could bring Kyoto into law, establish a national emissions-trading scheme and understand the tremendous business opportunities that can be harvested with a national emissions-trading scheme. Recent modelling by Allen Consulting showed that a national emissions-trading scheme could reduce energy sector greenhouse pollution by 25 million tonnes by 2013. That would take five million cars off the road. Yet the government cannot act. We could increase mandatory renewable energy targets to a meaningful level, embrace deep cuts for carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases with legislation and time lines, and provide significant investment in renewable energy and efficiency. These are the solutions; these are the ways forward; these are the plans that the government needs to engage in. But we get nothing.</para>
<para>We need to employ and engage the Australian community in this great task of addressing climate change, but the Howard government is nowhere to be seen. Our CSIRO regularly reports on this issue and on each occasion the message is clear: the scale and rate of climate change is rapidly being judged of an order too great to allow for timely adaptation by the natural world. But in the absence of leadership and thoughtful policy we are stuck, literally playing games with our future on earth as the Howard government, its ministers and its members are mute in the face of this great challenge. I say shame. I commend the Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change (Kyoto Protocol Ratification) Bill 2005 to the House. This is the action that we so desperately need but it is the resolute action this government is unable to provide.</para>

<para>âI rise to oppose the <inline ref="R2276">Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change (Kyoto Protocol Ratification) Bill 2005</inline>. I do so because I would never support a policy that sells out Australian workers and businesses. When I read the text of this bill, I cannot help thinking that Labor have failed to heed the lesson of the last election campaign: that you cannot come in here and pretend to care about working people and then sell them out at the first available opportunity to the green movementâjust as Labor did with Tasmanian forest workers and just as they are doing with this private memberâs bill today. In advocating the ratification of the Kyoto treaty, Labor seem hell-bent on sacrificing Australiaâs national interests and damaging Australiaâs future economic prosperity for a treaty that will have a very limited impact on the fight to restrict the emission of greenhouse gases.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The paradox is that Australiaâs record on this issue is amongst the best in the world. We have met our Kyoto target without sacrificing economic growth. We have met our target without sacrificing Australian jobs. We have met our target without sacrificing Australian industry and without restricting investment. The problem with the Kyoto treaty is that it completely fails to provide a comprehensive or environmentally effective long-term response to this problem. It has no clear pathway for developing countries and as such would deliver only a one per cent reduction in the growth of global greenhouse gas emissions. What a farce! For this meagre reduction it would disadvantage Australia in relation to other nations, many of them our economic competitors. So, by advocating the ratification of the Kyoto treaty, the Labor Party are saying that they want to export Australian jobs and industry to the developing world. Rather than doing this, the coalition will continue to stand up for Australia because when we are making up our mind about policy it is Australian national interests that we prioritise. Labor prioritise an international protocol that will have a minimal effect on greenhouse gas emissions.</para>
<para>Under the coalition, Australia will still play a pivotal role in tackling this issue internationally whilst ensuring our record on environmental issues remains second to none. Indeed, Australia is firmly on track to meet its Kyoto target. The latest projections, released in December 2004, show that Australiaâs greenhouse gas emissions for the period 2008â12 are expected to be 108 per cent of 1990 levels, which is right on the mark. The Australian government has spent in total $1.8 billion on combating climate change. The latest projections show that this investment is delivering real results. Australiaâs economy is continuing to grow strongly but its greenhouse intensity is falling. In fact, under the coalition government our economy is projected to almost double over the 20 years from 1990. During this time our emissions are projected to rise by only eight per cent. Current measures are expected to reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions by 94 million tonnes by 2010, more than the equivalent of eliminating all emissions from the transport sector.</para>
<para>We are now recognised as a world leader in addressing climate change. Our comprehensive climate change strategy delivers a clearly focused and integrated group of measures which covers emissions management, international management, climate change impacts, strategic policy support, science and measurement. The governmentâs strategy encompasses strong, practical, broad based solutions to meet our greenhouse goals. It will deliver a lower greenhouse signature whilst maintaining a strong and growing economy. The Labor Party would have us believe that not ratifying the Kyoto treaty will limit the opportunities available to Australian businesses, but the opposite is in fact true. Ratifying the Kyoto treaty will mean that sensible projects run by Australian businesses that take substantial measures to limit their greenhouse gases will not be able to go ahead while the same projects would be able to go ahead in other nations that are not subject to such strict protocols. This means that companies will be restricted from operating in Australia yet they can go offshore and do whatever they like in certain nations without regard for the environment.</para>
<para>It never ceases to amaze me that Labor, a party that professes to care about working people, is always prepared to sacrifice them to the green movement. Everyone in this chamber knows that once you strip away the rhetoric Labor is far more interested in appeasing people in Balmain than creating jobs in Boulder. It is far more interested in latte drinkers than lathe operators. The Labor alternative put up by the member for Grayndler will cost Australian jobs without addressing the issue of climate change. I, for one, am not prepared to sacrifice Australian workers to a treaty that completely fails to address greenhouse gas emissions. I oppose this ill-considered bill. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI want to begin by expressing my amazement at the contributions of the last two government speakers, the members for Tangney and Stirling, to this debate on the <inline ref="R2276">Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change (Kyoto Protocol Ratification) Bill 2005</inline>. First of all, I find it really remarkable that two members from a state suffering the worst impacts of global warming can come into this House and, as the member for Tangney did, not accept the scientific fact of global warming. Cut to the quick, that is what his argument was about; he just does not accept the scientific fact of global warming. He then went on to trivialise the issue by suggesting that somehow we were obscuring the issue of the crisis of global warming by calling our bill âAvoiding Dangerous Climate Changeâ. But everybody out there in the community understands precisely what those words mean. Avoiding dangerous climate change means doing what we can as a nation in the national interest to avoid the serious impacts of global warming. One way that we propose to do that is the method proposed in the second reading speech on this private memberâs billâthat is, by ratification of the Kyoto protocol.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Obviously, the member for Tangney does not believe in the scientific fact of global warming and, furthermore, believes that Australia should really consider one option alone for the futureâthat is, the nuclear option. That is a debate for another day. I, for one, do not concur with him; but it seems that he has put all his eggs in that basket rather than accepting the realities that there are a lot of actions that can be undertaken to stem the tide of this global crisis.</para>
<para>The member for Stirling then proceeds to suggest that somehow, by the ratification of the Kyoto protocol, this side of the House is selling out Australian workers. That is the most pathetic argument that I have ever heard in opposition to ratificationâas pathetic as the member for Tangney defending his position by trying to rebut the established scientific facts. The real issue about employment opportunities is the fact that the ratification would enhanceâ</para>

<para>âI suggest that the member for Stirling actually have a look at what his own minister has said on this issue. I find your position quite contradictory. The minister himself, in suggesting that Australia will meet the Kyoto targets without ratification, in fact argued that we were achieving this with no deleterious impact on the economy or on employment. You cannot have it both ways. We are strongly arguing that ratification would bring with it enormous employment and economic opportunities that this nation is forsaking by the governmentâs failure to ratify the Kyoto protocol.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The position advanced this morning is untenable, both on scientific grounds and on the grounds that clearly the members do not understand that the Kyoto protocol brings with it a carrot and stick approach. While the minister is, on the one hand, lauding our efforts on meeting the targets, he is forsaking the opportunities that the protocol, through its various mechanisms, brings for investment and employment opportunities.</para>
<para>Even if the two members in this House do not understand the significance of global warming, the Australian community does. It is very interesting that in a recent research finding, which I think was conducted by the Lowy Institute, the issue of global warming was rated by Australians as being more significant to them even than the issue of international terrorism. So it is only the other side of the House that does not understand the importance that the community places on this issue. I am surprised that members from a state like WA, already experiencing very severe impacts, could come into this House and pretend that it is not an issue.</para>
<para>The Kyoto protocol is not the be all and end all of international efforts to deal with this global crisis, but it is a step in the right direction. It is a step in the right direction that, surprisingly, was acknowledged by your own Prime Minister back in 1997 when he said, at the time of signing up to the protocol, that it was a win for the environment and a win for Australian jobs. The Prime Minister was right in 1997, but he is wrong now. The private memberâs bill that has been brought to this House tries to ameliorate the consequences of non-ratification. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talker>
<para>âIn supporting the <inline ref="R2276">Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change (Kyoto Protocol Ratification) Bill 2005</inline>, introduced by the honourable member for Grayndler, I think that we have to go through some of the things that have been said by the other side of the chamber in rebuttal as reasons for not ratifying the Kyoto protocol. If the honourable member for Tangney is suggesting that there are no scientific facts surrounding the basis for the need to look at the problems covered by the Kyoto protocol, he should also understand that there is a great body of scientific evidence to the contrary. As I have said on many occasions in this place, in the scientific world it is not uncommon to have different views about certain facts. But the honourable member for Tangney has to realise that Australia and the international community cannot sit idly by and hear the observations about global wormingâglobal warming!âthat are there and not take any action. Whether it be global worming or global warming, it is still an important phenomenon!</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Kyoto protocol was an attempt by the international community to sit down and to work in a collegiate fashion to make sure that this problem was addressed. It is a simple analysis to look at the reasons for global warming and suggest that the element that prevents Australia from signing up under Kyoto is the loss of jobs. If there is a sector within the Australian community that might be affected by the Kyoto protocol, those issues can be directly dealt with. But the opportunities that exist for employment growth are outstanding. Those are the things that the government should be putting its mind to. Whether they be alternative energies or a whole host of other matters that go to the principles of making sure that global warming is reversed, these are the things that Australia, with the know-how of its research and development, can do and can do well.</para>
<para>We have seen the phenomena addressed elsewhere in the parliament, with the House of Representatives environment committee encouraging the government on a bipartisan basis to go straight into the trading regimes and to increase MRET, because these things can lead to the encouragement of job development in other sectors where we have not had the wit to make sure that they happen. To simply look at industry as the main basis of the phenomenon of global warming and the carbon release is wrong. Letâs look at the facts. Over the decade from the 1990s through to 2003, the transport contribution to the release of gases leading to global warming increased by 28.8 per cent. The stationary energyâthat is, the non-transport energyâis 37 per cent. These are the issues that we have to address.</para>
<para>We cannot just have members like the honourable member for Tangney saying that nuclear power is going to be the be-all and end-all and the saviour. At the end of the day, some of the other interesting facts relate to the oil shortage that we are confronting. The way in which the demand is increasing and access to oil energy is decreasing globally meansâand it has been illustrated to me in a briefing todayâthat by 2030 the shortfall between what is expected to be needed from oil energy and what will be available is the equivalent of thousands and thousands of nuclear power plants. But the point is that that could not be used for the purposes of transport et cetera. As a nation and a global community, the ratification of the Kyoto protocol is a way we can look at this problem positively.</para>

<para>âThe scene in which ordinary people are locked in a house while their every movement and conversation is monitored by television cameras, and even their most private moments are open to the prying eyes of others, might be seen as entertainment by many Australians. But this is the case not just with reality television shows. It is also the case within our immigration detention system, and it is not entertainment by any stretch of the imagination. We have heard about a lack of privacy for women taking showers, even in our newest detention centres.</para>

Travel to school or for shopping or to a birthday party or sport is always under escort. Detainees cannot escape the prying eyes of this governmentâs own Big Brother, or should I say in the case of the minister, âBig Sisterâ. Is this another case of life imitating art?</para>

<para>âOn Saturday morning I had the pleasure of witnessing first-hand the magnificent work of a local environmental group in Montrose, in the Casey electorate. That group is the Thompsonâs Road Area Community Fireguard and Landcare Group. This is a group of dedicated volunteers who work most weekends to repair and restore the local environment in Montrose, in the Dandenong Ranges. They have had the assistance of a $21,000 Envirofund grant, and with that they are replacing many of the invasive weeds in the area with indigenous plants. In fact by the time they finish their work they will have planted 4,000 plants in their own time, and they are doing that very much as a strong community group. I want to particularly pay tribute to Noel Morgan, Ben Clark, who does the newsletter, Ray Malins, George Gredler, Helen Rasmussen, who is the treasurer, and Chris Morgan, who is another hardworking leader of this team which has worked over many months to improve the local environment in Montrose. They show a very strong dedication to their local community and their environment.</para>

<para>âThe Remuneration Tribunalâs decision to increase the communications allowance for members of parliament by 60 per cent is exempt from parliamentary scrutiny by deliberately protective legislation that must be changed. An arcane ruling that was until Friday unknown to the Clerk of the House of Representatives will prevent the parliament from debating an outrageous increase in the communications entitlements covering MPsâ postage and communications needs.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I was advised and assisted by the clerks in drafting a motion to try to stop this increase and anticipated that, under normal procedure, debate would happen early this week. Generally, disallowances must be dealt with by the parliament within 15 days, but this is not so for Remuneration Tribunal determinations. Decisions by the tribunal, which inevitably deal with giving more money to politicians, will only be scrutinised by the parliament if the government sees fit. Essentially, this means wastage of taxpayersâ money if unnecessary increases to the entitlements of office are protected. When these entitlements can be used as election year slush funds, it is further abuse of the so-called democratic process.</para>
<para>The 60 per cent increase in the allowance, complete with roll-over provisions, will enable up to $90,000 for a postal budget, on top of an equally outrageous $125,000 printing allowance, in an election year, all courtesy of the taxpayer. This lack of parliamentary scrutiny is an abuse of all standards of proper accountability.</para>

<para>âThis weekend marked the 20th anniversary of the Central Queensland Filipino Australia Association. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the associationâs members and its supporters on that great achievement. For any voluntary organisation to survive and grow for that length of time is in itself a remarkable achievement and worth celebrating, as the Filipino community and its friends and supporters did in Rockhampton on Saturday night. But the success of the Filipino Australia Association and its value in our community can be measured in many more ways than just time.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>For one thing, the Filipino ethnic group is the most significant ethnic group in Central Queensland in terms of numbers and also in terms of its outreach and integration into the community. It is easy now to take that level of interaction and integration between our community and members of the Filipino community for granted but, looking back, the Filipino Australia Association played a big part in making that possible.</para>
<para>Through its wonderful support for Filipinos and its proud promotion of Filipino culture, the association has created a bridge between members of the Filipino community and the wider community. Sometimes that bridge had to overcome prejudice and discrimination but, for the most part, there was understanding and friendship on each side, and all that was needed was a way to bring people closer together. The association took up that challenge, and we are all the richer for it. I would like to congratulate, in particular, the current president of the association, Remy Conway, and to say to all of the members of the Filipino community and their spouses or partners and friendsâwell done on your contribution to Central Queensland. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI rise today to vent my concern about the reallocation of the Boronia CIU office to Knox police complex. I have a long history with the Boronia CIU. It is one of the busiest divisions in the country, and it is definitely one of the busiest in Victoria. The reason its move is being discussed is centralisation. I am greatly concerned about the relocation of Boronia CIU as it is the busiest area for our detectives in the electorate of La Trobe; in fact, the only detectives in the electorate of La Trobe are at Boronia. Previously, we have seen the Boronia police station relocated, along with Bayswater and Ferntree Gully, to Knox. It did not work, and they were moved back to form the Boronia police station. I was a constable at the time this happened.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We have already had detectives based at Knox CIU, and it was decided that, because of the heavy crime rate in the Boronia area, the detectives should be closest to the serious crime, and they were moved to Boronia. So I am quite amazed that, in this day and age with the busy growth corridor down the south of the electorate, we would be moving one CIU closer to Knox. What the state government needs to do is keep the detectives at Boronia and establish another CIU office at Rowville, thereby servicing the entire electorate of La Trobe and not draining resources. My former colleagues are doing a great job and deserve to be supported.</para>

<para>âUnder standing order 209(b), I present three petitions. The first petition, from 30 citizens of Australia, draws the attention of the House to the fact that the Howard government has consistently refused to guarantee that no individual Australian employee will be worse off as a result of the governmentâs proposed changes to the minimum wage. The second petition, from 22 citizens of Australia, draws the attention of the House to the fact that Australians should have basic rights at work, including decent minimum wages, award conditions, protection from unfair dismissal, the right to reject AWAs or individual contracts and the right to negotiate collectively with their employer.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The third petition, from 90 citizens of Australia, draws the attention of the House to the failure of the government to protect 400 whales slaughtered in Australian waters by Japanese factory ships. It also draws the Houseâs attention to Japanâs intention to seek an expansion of its whaling quota. It asks that the House call upon the Howard government to take all steps to prevent an increase in Japanâs scientific research and to take all necessary legal steps to ensure the creation of an Australian whale sanctuary.</para>
<para>The first two petitions go to industrial relations, which will be a political battleground in Australia over the next few months. The government should not be so sure that the Australian public will not see these issues as being very serious to their livelihood and react to the governmentâs action. The third petition in regard to whaling has indeed excited the passions of the Australian community. The government should be aware of that and should take action to ensure that our legislation is put in place in the global fora available to it so that the whales are protected.</para>

<para>âThe House will have an opportunity this week to have a look at the changes to the Migration Act. Given the interest that the Leader of the Opposition is displaying by asking his first question, I assume that the Labor Party will swiftly give passage to the amendments through the Senate.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Let me go to the substance. The changes will reflect the announcement I made on Fridayâthat is, that children would only be in a detention centre as a last resort. The objective of the changes is, as far as humanly practicable and consistent with that principle, that families with children should be in residence detentionâin other words, in the community, but still legally having the status of detention. It would not be involving 24-hour guard, might I say, but would be involving conditions that would be adjusted according to the circumstances of each case.</para>
<para>Now that I am on my feet, I want to take the opportunity of saying that the changes that the government has outlined are, I believe, valuable improvements, but they do not in any way undermine the framework of the current policy. The current policy retains mandatory detention. It is mandatory detention with a softer edge, but nonetheless mandatory detention.</para>
<para>The other elements of the policyâsuch as the excision of offshore islands, still opposed by the Australian Labor Party, and offshore processing, still opposed by the Australian Labor Partyâremain. What the government has done is recognise the views of many in its own ranks to the effect that, whilst maintenance of the policy of mandatory detention is absolutely fundamental, there is room to provide more flexibility in relation to children. There is also room to provide a non-compellable review mechanism in the hands of the Ombudsman in relation to people who have been in detention for more than two years. There will be a mechanism to accelerate the processing of those currently on temporary protection visas who have applied for permanent protection visas. There are a number of other incidental changes, all designed to accelerate the time taken to process applications, it being a constant in complaints that I have received, particularly from my own colleagues across the whole spectrum of the government parties, that, whatever views people may have on this or that aspect of mandatory detention, it is desirable that decisions be reached as quickly as possible and with a great deal more dispatch.</para>
<para>As I said, those parts of the provisions that are needed to be given effect to in legislation are going to be introduced this week. I welcome the interest of the Leader of the Opposition and I would welcome even more the support of his party so that we do not have a repetition of the nonsense over taxation and we can put the amendments through fairly quickly.</para>

</talker>
<para>âI thank the member for Mackellar for her question and the interest she shows in Iraq. Over the last two years, despite the obvious difficulties there have been for Iraq as a country, it has made considerable progress. The historic elections were held in January and now a broadly representative government in Iraq has been installed. The economy is slowly but surely being revived. Iraqâs relations with neighbouring countries and the international community are being normalised.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Of course, there are many challenges that still remain in Iraq. Australia is prepared to give support. We have forgiven $850 million in debt. In the recent budget we announced a further $45 million in reconstruction, building on the $126 million we have already provided. We will be represented at the international conference on Iraq this Wednesday in Brussels. I will not be going myself, because the House is sitting, but a senior official from my department will be representing Australia there.</para>
<para>It hardly needs to be said that security and public order issues remain a significant challenge in Iraq. We strongly support democracy in Iraq. We support the new democratic movement there. So do the vast majority of the people of Iraq. Of course, there are elements of people who supported and were part of Saddam Husseinâs vicious and inhumane regime who are perpetrating acts of terror and violence, and there are the al-Qaeda and al-Zarqawi terrorists in Iraq, who are doing the same thing. But, as an international community, we need to get behind the bulk of the Iraqi people and make sure that the new Iraqi democracy is able to emerge and to flourish. Part of that is ensuring that the Iraqis are responsible for their own security. For that to happen, we have to train Iraqis.</para>
<para>This is a government that has given a strong commitment to the training of the Iraqi security forces. We will continue to do so for some time into the future. As Douglas Wood said this morning, he is âproof positiveâ that the decision to train Iraqi troops is the right decision. There is simply no question about that.</para>
<para>I do not know if the House needed reminding, but I will remind the House anyway that this government is committed to playing its part in helping the people of Iraq build their security and their democracy. As my Iraqi counterpart, Foreign Minister Sabri, said on the <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> program last week:</para>

<para>âI thank the honourable member for his question. Today, dwelling commencements for the March quarter were released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. They showed that the total number of dwelling unit commencements fell 2.2 per cent in March and is down 14.1 per cent over the year. This is consistent with what I have been informing the House of for some timeâa slowing in the housing market from the unsustainable levels that we saw in the earlier part of this decade. Provided that growth can rebalance out of domestic sources to international sources, that is to be warmly welcomed.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Also released today was ABAREâs publication <inline font-style="italic">Australian Commodities Outlook</inline> for the June quarter, where ABARE forecast that Australiaâs commodity exports would increase 15 per cent, to a record $116 billion, in 2005-06. This is underpinned by a forecast 23 per cent increase in the export of Australiaâs minerals and energy, with both volumes and values up. With values in relation to contracts negotiated in April lasting for 12 months, you would not expect to see any change in those prices into 2006, probably the June quarter. Notwithstanding the increase in minerals and energy exports, ABARE is expecting a fall in farm production of 5.8 per cent in 2005-06. This is principally the result of the drought which is gripping much of Australiaâalthough these forecasts were made before the Bureau of Meteorology, on Friday, upgraded its forecast for rain to a 50 per cent chance of rainfall being averaged in the September quarter. So there might be a bit of upside risk in relation to that.</para>
<para>If the Australian economy can reweight out of domestic sources to international sources, particularly led by those strong export performances, that will provide the basis for ongoing growthâgrowth which has already led to 1.6 million jobs, I believe, being created and the lowest unemployment in Australia for 29 years.</para>

<para>âI thank the honourable member for Barker for his question. I can inform him that, over the weekend, world oil prices hit an all-time record high. Principally, oil prices are high because of demand factors. Of the 9.2 million barrel per day increase in demand between 1997 and 2004, China alone accounted for 25 per cent of that demand. That was not, of course, the cause of the spike over the weekend. The cause of the spike over the weekend, where world prices went to $US58 per barrel, was civil unrest in Nigeria, which is a major oil producer.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It has been estimated by the IMF and the OECD that, for every $10 a barrel increase in the price of oil, OECD growth would reduce by 0.4 of a per cent. So, given the fact that we have had a $US20 per barrel increase over the last year, this modelling suggests that that would knock off three-quarters of a percentage point of growth in the OECD and, of course, would knock growth off Australia. Higher oil prices contribute to higher petrol prices at the pump. Motorists are already feeling the pinch and, if these oil prices remain, may continue to do so for some time.</para>
<para>Can I point out to the House that the Commonwealth government has a fixed excise of 38c a litre which does not increase as the price increases. It is true that GST also applies to petrol, and all GST goes to the eight Labor states and territories. Can I also point out to the honourable member for Barker that this is the government that ensured full diesel rebates for agricultural industry and mining industry, that cut diesel for interstate transport from 44c to 20c and that also announced an extension in relation to its energy white paper for power generation and off-road use as that energy white paper comes into effect. So this is a government which has reduced excises for transport, preserved full rebates for agriculture and fixed petrol excise at 38c a litre without any indexation for inflation. We sympathise with motorists bearing these high world oil prices, but those prices that you now see are not the creation of taxation but of international factors.</para>

<para>âI thank the honourable member for his question and appreciate the interest he shows in this issue. I think all members of the House agree with the Australian governmentâs position that we strongly oppose Japanâs plans to expand its so-called scientific whaling program. Whale stock numbers do remain under threat and it is clear that Japanâs whaling program cannot reasonably be described as just scientific. Scientists from more than half the countries of the International Whaling Commission, including Australia, have refused to review Japanâs new proposals until an independent review of their original scientific whaling program is undertaken, and I think that is entirely reasonable.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Australian diplomatic missions around the world have been coordinating with like-minded countries to make known to the Japanese government our concerns with their proposals. Our ambassador in Japan, Murray McLean, has led two delegations of diplomats to the Japanese foreign ministry and fisheries agency to urge Japan to cease its scientific whaling program, and over 15 countries have now participated in these representations. In the past two weeks Senator Ian Campbell, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, has visited five European and three Pacific island countries to lobby for support for Australiaâs opposition to scientific whaling. The Prime Minister and I have made representations directly to our counterparts in numerous International Whaling Commission member states, seeking their support for our position.</para>
<para>Senator Campbell will be working with antiwhaling nations at this weekâs IWC meeting in Korea to urge Japan to cease its scientific whaling program, and obviously we hope we can be successful. We have not ruled out any legal or diplomatic options to bring further pressure to Japan if that is necessary, but we obviously have to work these things through carefully, step by step, and particularly we are likely to be more effective if we coordinate our efforts with other like-minded countries in the international community and do not behave as a rogue country, doing things on our own and ignoring the cooperation that we otherwise would very naturally get from a large number of other countries.</para>

<para>I make the point that the New South Wales local government minister Tony Kelly announced the dismissal of the Tweed Shire Council in the New South Wales parliament on 25 May 2005.

Isnât it more than passing strange that the New South Wales government allowed that to happen while we have other councilsâLabor councils in the pastâlike Strathfield that have had similar allegations raised against them but have not been dismissed?</para>

</talker>
<para>âI thank the member for Moncrieff for his question. He and Australians will be aware of the governmentâs track record in boosting employmentâsome 1.6 million extra jobs since the Howard government has been in office and an increase in real wages of some 14 per cent. It is against this background that I note that the ACTU launched an advertising campaign over the weekend. Included in that campaign is an advertisement that implies workers with families could be sacked for refusing to work extra hours at short notice. The Workplace Relations Act will continue to provide protection against unlawful termination for discriminatory reasons. Set out in the Workplace Relations Act is a range of reasons which would make conduct unlawful, including religion, gender, union membership, pregnancy and family responsibilitiesâthe very thing this ad was aimed at. The ad is quite wrong. Employers in Australia who terminate an employee for discriminatory reasons, including for family responsibilities, are liable for fines, penalties and compensation under the legislation. That is the first ad that was wrong.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The second ad which is being run by the ACTU is also wrong. It depicts an existing employee who has been employed for 15 years. The ad says of the existing employee that under the new system, âYou can be forced onto an individual contract.â Again this is wrong. It is and will continue to be unlawful under the Workplace Relations Act for an employer to use duress in forcing an existing employee onto an Australian workplace agreement. That is the law now and it will be the law in the future.</para>
<para>Furthermoreâand this is how wrong this ad isâall employees who are offered AWAs have the right to have a bargaining agent appointed to represent them. This bargaining agent can include a representative of a union, and an employer must respect the decision by the employee and is obliged to deal with a bargaining agent under the law. What the ACTU ad failed to point out is that the man in question had the legal right to have a union official sitting next to him. He could have had Greg Combet or Sharan Burrow if they were interested in his situation, if they were interested in actually representing Australian workers rather than scaring them.</para>
<para>This goes to the point of what this campaign is about. It is a political campaign and it is a scare campaign. At a union rally in Sydney Mr Combet said, âWhat is going to be in the back of peopleâs minds when they are offered an AWA is: can I be sacked if I refuse to sign?â In an ACTU press release on 2 June Sharan Burrow said, âWorkers who refuse to sign may fear being sacked.â What is the ACTU doing about this fear? Did it service its members by attempting to educate them about what the law actually says? Did it reassure workers in Australia that it will be unlawful for them to be sacked in such circumstances? Did it provide them with honest and accurate advice? No, no, no. This is simply a dishonest scare campaign from the ACTU. It is also a desperate campaign, given Ms Burrow said she would do whatever it takes. Obviously it involves insulting the intelligence of ordinary workers in Australia with blatantly incorrect information.</para>
<para>It is reported that the ACTU is expending $8 million on this campaign. It is obviously designed to promote as much fear as possible. If there are any further ads along these lines in this campaign then the bottom line is that no Australian worker can trust the word of the ACTU when it comes to explaining this legislation. It is all about scare. It is dishonest and it is wrong.</para>

Australian jobs and growth in living standards have always been directly connected to our ability to export what we manufacture and what we produce and the services we provide out of Australia. The more goods and services that we can sell into the international marketplace obviously the stronger our economic performance will be. As far as employment is concerned it is a well-known fact that one in five Australian jobs rely on an export industry. That becomes even stronger in rural and regional Australia and in electorates like that of the member for Hinkler where one in four jobs relies on our export performance.

It also highlights the importance of maintaining an open and competitive economy. We have endeavoured to do that in our term in office by reforming the Australian economy and undertaking important reforms in the Australian workplace. But it underlines the important fact that we must continue those reforms in the workplace.

<para>âI thank the honourable member for Braddon for the question and acknowledge the role that he has been playing in Northern Tasmania, particularly with the difficulties that potato growers and other fruit and vegetable producers in Northern Tasmania have been facing over recent times. I acknowledge especially his role in negotiating a $200,000 contribution from the federal government under the Industry Partnerships program to help potato growers to find solutions to the problems that they currently face.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I am aware of concerns that have been expressed in some areas of the media that imported foods to Australia are likely to be contaminated with chemicals and pesticides and the like. I want to assure the House that imported foods are required to meet exactly the same food safety standards as food produced in Australia. The Food Standards Code, which was developed by the Australian and New Zealand food standards setting organisation, applies to all foods whether produced in this country or imported. A testing regime is in place to ensure that food coming into this country meets those standards. In some instances there are minimum levels of pesticides permitted in some products, but where residue limits are in place they apply equally for imported foods as they do for Australia foods.</para>
<para>The House may be interested to know that the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service has over the last five years tested 1,254 consignments of fresh fruit and vegetables that have come into Australia, and only three of those consignments have failed the pesticides residue limits tests. Naturally, those products were refused entry, and future imports from those producers were subject to detailed scrutiny. So the law applies to everyone. There are no special concessions or different rules of any kind provided to fruit and vegetables coming from other parts of the world, whether they come under a free trade agreement or any other system.</para>
<para>The other point I would like to make is that I think it is very important for consumers to be aware that they can identify Australian fruit and vegetables because imported fruit and vegetables are required to be labelled with their country of origin. It is the law now. This government supports the law which requires imported fruit and vegetables to be labelled with their country of origin. If there are fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts or seafood that have come from another part of the world, they will be clearly labelled that they come from whatever country they have been produced in. Those laws have been in place for some time. If consumers come across examples where those laws are being flouted then they need to raise those issues with the various state departments which have responsibility for enforcing them. But this government believes that consumers have a right to know where their products come from and it has in place appropriate legislation to ensure that happens. It is really a matter for consumers whether they want imported food, fruit and vegetables to come into this country. They are labelled. If they donât want them, donât buy them.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Boothby, Dr Southcott, for his question and for the interest that he takes in this area of the portfolio. Australia does have a very good record in minimising the spread of HIV-AIDS and treating people who have this terrible disease. In part, this is the work of government. The Australian government, for instance, spends some $24 million a year on prevention and education programs and some $86 million a year on treatment. We also help to fund state government programs through the public health outcome funding agreements. But mostly this is because of the good work of the affected communities, whose leaders have consistently stressed the need to avoid high-risk behaviours.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Last Friday the government announced the fifth National HIV-AIDS Strategy, which builds on the strengths of previous strategies. The government will continue to fund targeted prevention and education programs for people at risk. The government will continue funding for the four HIV-AIDS research centres until the middle of 2008 at the cost of an additional $12 million. And the government has made an in-principle decision to provide diagnostic testing for HIV-AIDS under Medicare. I want to make it very clear that HIV-AIDS is a health issue and not a moral issue. People with HIV-AIDS should be treated not judged. Minimising the spread of HIV-AIDS has been a partnershipâa very successful partnershipâbetween government and the community organisations concerned. I would like to congratulate those community organisations for the responsible attitude they have always adopted.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for OâConnor for his question. He is one of the long-term supporters of people choosing for themselves where they make their investments, and he has been a long-term advocate of superannuation in this country. Most people in this House, and most Australians, in fact, are aware that from 1 July many Australians for the first time will be able to make the choice of where they put their superannuation. They will be able to determine who it is that invests their money for their own retirement.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>From 1 July we are also changing the regulationsâwe put them to the House last Thursdayâto give Australians the opportunity to move their fundâportabilityâwithout having to wait six months from the last employer contribution into their funds. In other words, when an Australian worker decides to move their funds to put that money where they want to see it invested, they will not have to wait for the bureaucracy to catch up. Those regulations will come into effect from 1 July.</para>
<para>What we wait to see now is whether the Labor Party will change its stance from the one it took in September 2003 when it opposed Australians having that right of portability, leaving this long tail, in the same way it has opposed Australians choosing where they put their funds, in the same way it has opposed Australians having $2.5 billion removed from the super surcharge and in the same way it wants to reintroduce the work tests so that particularly women, when leaving the work force to have a family, can continue to contribute to their superannuation funds. Labor says that should not happen. In the same way, the Labor Party says Australians should not get $1.50 for every dollar that they put into superannuation in the form of a super co-contribution. It beggars belief that there is only one side of this House that strongly and consistently supports superannuation for Australian workersâthat is the coalition. And the challenge is for the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party either to get out of the way or to get on board.</para>

<para>âAt least it takes someone on this side of the House to understand absolutely clearly what is going on in the Australian economy today. Not only are we seeing record numbers of people taking up traineeships and apprenticeships in traditional trades but in the important retail sector of Australia, where we have something like 10 per cent of the employment growth over the past five years to February 2004âthat is almost 135,000 additional jobsâwe are seeing a commitment to the training of young people and backing the choices that they make and which their families are proud of, as we have never seen before.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>On Saturday night, the member for Macarthurâthe Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Mr Farmerâand I attended the National Retail Associationâs awards event. We were able to see first-hand the enormous commitment of one of the powerhouses of the Australian economy to the young people they are taking into their industry. They are giving them not just part-time job prospects but long-term career prospects. The retail sector need to be congratulated for that. They are committed to innovation, and they are committed to full-time career potential. In fact, 1.8 million people are expected to be employed in retail by the end of this decade.</para>
<para>We do not have job snobs on this side; we fully support the choices young people make. In fact, 20 per cent of the work force in the retail sector are people we could describe as young. Overall, we have in Australia 382,400 new apprentices in training. That is a 170 per cent increase in the last decade. We are providing almost $800 million for employer incentives and support. We are determined to continue this support, particularly for areas like the retail services sector. We want to make certain that they are not overlooked.</para>

<para class="block">We, the undersigned, are sick to death of the misery and destruction which globalisation has wreaked on this country since it was adopted beginning 1983 by the Hawke/Keating governments, and continued by the Howard government. Except for a handful of the very wealthy, the globalisation policies of free trade, floating exchange rates, privatisation, competition policy, etc. have been a disaster for virtually all Australians, including local government bodies, trade unions, Aborigines, ethnic groups, immigrants, students and teachers, healthcare providers, the rural sector, small business, the poor, the unemployed, the aged and disabled, and many other average, struggling Australians. Outside Australia, globalisation has produced a severe international economic crisis, with potential dire consequences for Australia.</para>
<para class="block">Therefore, we urgently demand that the Parliament begin immediate moves toward the near-term establishment and participation by Australia in a New Bretton Woods international monetary system, as proposed by American statesman and physical economist Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jnr. The New Bretton Woods would revive the best policies of the old Bretton Woods monetary system of 1944-1971, such as fixed exchange rates, tariff protection, great infrastructure projects, and credit directed to agriculture and industry, instead of into speculation. These policies fostered almost three decades of steady, even spectacular world economic growth in the wake of World War II, including in Australia. In this new system, national banks would replace the present privately-owned or controlled âindependentâ central banks, such as Australiaâs Reserve Bank. For Australia, this would mean a new national bank modelled on King OâMalleyâs original conception of the Commonwealth Bank, with wide powers to keep our callous private banks in line. A severe international economic and monetary crisis is already upon us; we must act now!</para>

<para class="block">We the undersigned request that John Simpson Kirkpatrick, of Simpson and donkey fame be awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia.</para>
<para class="block">Under the Imperial Award system, the Victoria Cross was denied to Simpson as a result of some confusion in the original application. In 1915 John Monash (later General) recommended Simpson for the VC. In 1967 Lieutenant Casey who also witnessed Simpsonâs work (later Governor General, Lord Casey) together with Prime Minister Holt and the Chief of the General Staff, Major General Brand (also a witness) recommended him for the VC. This was also denied. The British government claimed that a dangerous precedent would be set. Your petitioners request that the House of Representatives do everything in their power to honour integrity and wishes of these fine Australians and overturn the original decision not to award the VC to Simpson. Simpson is a symbol of the self-sacrifice, mateship and all those values that Anzacs now stand for and Australians treasure. By honouring him, we honour them all.</para>

<para class="block">This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws your attention to the clanger of a major military conflict in 2005 between Iran,. the USA. and Israel, spreading to neighbouring countries. Triggered by the Tehran regimeâs quest to acquire nuclear weapons. This could escalate. into a nuclear with massive global consequences,</para>
<para class="block">The Tehran regime is.in major breach of its obligations to uphold basic human rights, and its obligations to the International Atomic Energy Agency. Like Israel, it has no justification for acquiring nuclear weapons. The world would not know of this nuclear program except for it: exposure by Iranâs main opposition, the National Council of Resistance of Iran.</para>
<para class="block">The people of Iran must play the major role in determining their own future and therefore the democratic opposition in Iran should have global support to do so.</para>
<para class="block">The Tehran regime is notorious for its acts of terrorism in the Middle East and. Latin America, and its long record of assassination of opponents in exile in Europe and elsewhere. Yet Australia and other western countries have engaged with Tehran and even agreed to suppress Iranâs legitimate democratic opposition movement including the National Council of Resistance of Iran and the Peopleâs Mojahedin Organisation of Iran (MEK) by raiding its supporters in exile and classifying their organizations as terrorist groups.</para>
<para class="block">Your petitioners therefore request the House to:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>urgently request the Australian Government to -de-listâ the National Council of Resistance of Iran and the Peopleâs Mojahedin Organisation of Iran (MIEK) from the list of terrorist organisations maintained by the Department of Foreign. Affairs.</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>urgently request the Australian Government to call on the United. Nations Security Council to act to de-escalate this crisis by encouraging the withdrawal of threats of military action by all parties, and instituting-a verifiable program of nuclear disarmament for Iran and Israel, a part of the larger program of nuclear disarmament in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.</para>

<para class="block">In many ways religious tolerance in this country was exemplified by Vernon and Malcolm Wood on the release of their brother Douglas. Vernon said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Iraqis are our brothers and our sisters and we empathise with those who have lost loved ones, lost jobs and lost hope.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">When asked about the people who abducted his brother, he said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It is very hard for us to place ourselves in their context. It is a very troubled country, obviously, and their history is very different. Their heritage is so very different from us it is hard to comprehend what they are thinking, so in a sense it is not possible to hate.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Religious hatred has produced much of the fuel for world conflict. Intolerance, bigotry and reaction to things that are different cause challenges to the search for peace. When we look at Lebanon, Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Serbia andâlooking into the pastâthe Crusades, we can see the toxic mix of religious conflict. Little attention was given politically to the passing in 2001 of the Victorian Racial and Religious Tolerance Act. With the events of 11 September 2001, community resentment at fundamentalist Muslims ran high and the importance of protecting religious minorities undoubtedly meant that legislators in Victoria thought it was appropriate action to take.</para>
<para>No-one in the Christian community would have been aware of the legislation or its potential impact until a complaint arose from a seminar on Islam organised in Melbourne by Catch the Fire Ministries. The seminar was arranged by Pastor Daniel Scot in March 2002. The equal opportunity commission became involved after a complaint made initially by three Muslim converts who attended the seminar and who were then joined by the Islamic Council of Victoria. An attempt to resolve the case through a conciliation session proved unsuccessful and the case went to a hearing in the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal. The result of this case was to find in favour of the appellants. Another case involved a man in prison involved in an Alpha Christian course which included the topic of âevilâ. During the session, the Salvation Army chaplain mentioned witchcraft as being evil. A convicted paedophile in the prison made a complaint to the equal opportunity commission. It is now bringing a case against the Salvation Army, Corrective Services and Alpha Group Service.</para>
<para>Peter Breen, a human rights lawyer and a member of the New South Wales Upper House has introduced the Anti-Discrimination Amendment Bill 2005. The bill deals specifically with religious vilification. The Breen bill parallels Victorian legislation that deals with exceptions but deletes âreligious purposeâ and adds âresearch purposesâ. Arguably, this renders the New South Wales legislation more extreme than its Victorian counterpart.</para>
<para>The shockwaves throughout the Christian community have been significant and the political fallout has already begun. Victorian church leaders have told the Victorian Premier that it is time to change this law. Anglican Archbishop Peter Watson has said that his church had not examined the legislation closely enough in 2001. He has stated that he does not want âthe law of the land intruding into places where it has no proper roleâ. It is also interesting to note that some members of Islamic communities have indicated their concern regarding the impact of the legislation and are finding note takers in their own communities to record what has passed. An indication from an Islamic spokesman was that religion is about the competition of ideas and the search for truth and that there is no role for punitive legislation against it.</para>
<para>The main danger of religious vilification laws has been put by Patrick Parkinson, Professor of Law at the University of Sydney. He said in a paper that they will have a âchilling effectâ on legitimate religious activity even where the outcome of a complaint is to declare the religious expression to have been lawful. The punishment imposed by religious vilification laws does not lie in the penalties imposed by courts or tribunals for breaches of the law but in the necessity to defend oneself from plausible claims that the law has been breached. I therefore call on this parliament to affirm:</para>

<para>âI rise to speak on the motion moved by the member for Cook. The Victorian Racial and Religious Tolerance Act passed through the Victorian parliament following an extensive community consultation process by both the Victorian government and the Victorian parliamentary Liberal Party. The results of that consultation saw both government and Liberal members speak in support of the Victorian Racial and Religious Tolerance Bill and vote for its passage through the parliament. Members from both sides of the parliament saw the significance of the act not in terms of the criminal and civil sanctions contained in the act or as a restriction on free speech, but as a reminder of the freedoms Australians hold dear to their hearts and which underlie the very essence of our society. The former Liberal member for the Victorian seat of Forest Hill, Mr John Richardson, spoke directly to this point in his second reading speech to the bill when he said:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">Among those fundamental beliefs Liberals hold dear is the freedom of speech. We also have a fundamental belief in the need to protect the rights of individuals and minority groups in our society. Both of those beliefs are significant and fundamental to me and to many people who are attracted to the Liberal philosophy ... My view is that, while freedom of speech is important to our society, at times society decides that freedom of speech needs to be curtailed for the benefit of an individual or a minority group. For example, we have decided under the rules of defamation that freedom of speech is to be curtailed to protect the rights of the individual not to be defamed in any way, shape or form. We restrict freedom of speech with regard to offensive and abusive language. We say that people are not free to go out in public and use foul language against others. In the broader sense those are restrictions on freedom of speech. The bill proposes that individuals in Victoria should be protected from vilification on the basis of race and religion.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">During the second reading debate, the Liberal member for Warrandyte, Mr Phillip Honeywood, made the following comments:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">If this legislation serves any purpose at all, I hope it will be an educative one. I hope it will provide for those people who have experienced acts of racism, which I hope are repugnant to all Australians, some sort of safeguard when they leave their front doors in the morning or evening to go for a walk in their local neighbourhood.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I believe the Victorian act provides a proper balance between the rights of free speech and action against those using racial or religious vilification. It does not seek to restrict free speech. Like similar legislation in other states, it seeks to ensure some sections of our society can participate as full members of that society without being faced with the prospect of racial and religious taunts. I acknowledge the Victorian legislation is still relatively new and yet to be fully tested. To the best of my knowledge, there has been only one action brought under the act. I believe it is still subject to judicial review.</para>
<para>Every Australian has the right to free speech, to criticise and comment on the actions of others that you do not agree with. It is not, however, the right of any person to use this right to criticise or comment in a way that would incite religious or racial hatred. The Victorian legislation seeks to cast a net to capture the small minority who seek to incite hatred on the basis of oneâs race and/or religion. As with every piece of legislation, the potential always exists for someone to unintendedly get caught in that net. In the case of the Victorian legislation, it is up to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal and the courts to determine the reason that they did so.</para>
<para>We live in a country that has for many generations become one of the most multicultural countries in the world. We have welcomed people from every nation across the world and offered them here in Australia a place where they can follow their beliefs unhindered and without fear. It is what makes this nation strong. It is what makes Australia attractive to those in other nations that have been driven out through persecution of their race or religion. There is no place in Australia for such persecution and I am sure that every member in this House and a large majority of Australians also agree with this.</para>
<para>There is, however, an unfortunate minority that, for whatever reason, seeks to use a personâs race or religion to vilify them. Every person in Australia has the right of protection under article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as mentioned in the motion. But there is also a view that the Commonwealth Racial Discrimination Act 1975 does not adequately set out the provision for the protection of oneâs religious beliefs. In that act there are no specific provisions that protect a person from religious vilification. This is one of the reasons why state governments have taken action to address the situation. Victoria is not the leader in this area. As the state Liberal member for Caulfield, Mrs Shardey, said in her speech on the Victorian legislation:</para>

<para class="block">I thank the member for Cook for placing his private memberâs motion before the House today and I commend him for doing so. However, I believe that many of the provisions in his motion are unnecessary. As indicated earlier, it is too early to know exactly what the outcome of the Victorian legislation will be. The Victorian act is in its infancy and until we can see the full impact of this legislation any moves to condemn it are, in my opinion, premature.</para>
<para>I am aware that in New South Wales the Hon. Peter Breen MLC has moved a bill to amend the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Act 1977 to promote religious tolerance and for other purposes. As an Independent member, Mr Breen has the right to introduce a private memberâs bill to address what he believes to be a problem with existing legislation. I am sure the debate on his bill will be as extensive as was the debate on the Victorian act. This is a subject on which there is a wide variety of views and, in accord with the principles of freedom of speech I referred to earlier, they should be heard and openly debated. Debate and discussion is what characterises Australian societyâ<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âIn seconding the motion, I agree with it. I think it is time that we looked seriously at the process of how we describe peopleâs actions, whether or not they are hurtful, what offence is taken and what recourse to legal avenues can be taken by those who may be offended. On 13 March 2003, the Islamic Council of Victoria Inc. placed a complaint before the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal around issues that they said arose from a seminar on 9 March 2002 at the Full Gospel Assembly at Surrey Hills. The basis of the complaint was that the discussion at the assembly:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">... implied that through the practice of âsilent jihadâ Muslims plan to impose Islam on Australians ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">andâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... implied that Muslims are motivated by the Qurâan to become violent and intolerant when they are powerful.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">There were also newsletters that the Islamic Council objected to. As remedy they sought that the respondent: acknowledge that certain inaccurate and misleading statements had been made; wholly and without qualification retract the statements made at the seminar and published on the first respondentâs web site; and sincerely apologise for the offence and hurt that was occasioned. The complainant sought from the tribunal: restraining orders for the respondents; that the respondents retrieve any material in the public arena; that an order be issued requiring each of the respondents to pay to the complainant such compensation as the tribunal saw fit; that an order be issued that the respondents pay the complainantâs costs; and such other orders be issued as the tribunal saw fit. That was the basis of the proceedings. The remedies were sought on the basis of the Victorian Racial and Religious Tolerance Act 2001. I will read out section 8 of that act because I think it is informative:</para>

<para class="block">So it is a very wide-reaching provision. The complainant in this case felt that the words used by the respondent âimpliedâ certain thingsâthey did not say they proved certain things; they said they implied certain thingsâso they lodged the complaint within the scope of the act. Judge Michael Higgins found against Pastor Daniel Scot of the Full Gospel Assembly in this instance and thereby in favour of the Islamic Council of Victoria.</para>
<para>In examining the case I went to Pastor Danny Scotâs evidence, the transcript of which was available. I have read carefully through most of it. I note what he says about some practices of Islam, and I see that in conclusion he suggests that, in negotiating or having contact with Islam, the Christian community must show them the love of Jesus; we must not react in the way that some of them react with violence. For the life of me I could not see what the substance of the case was when I looked at the material. I looked at the judgeâs reasoningâhe saw the Islamic Councilâs case as more than fair and justifiedâand I thought he was predisposed to think of Daniel Scot as somebody who was not presenting a fair case. The judge appeared to be mistaken on a number of issues, and hence the appeal. I think this sort of legislation is really without foundation and leads to disruption and disharmony, rather than bringing harmony, as should be the case. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI find myself in agreement with the motion moved today by the member for Cook on the issue of opposing legislation dealing with religious vilification, although my concerns may not be the same as those expressed by earlier speakers in this debate. Yesterday I attended a ceremony at the Chinese Buddhist temple at Bonnyrigg in my electorate to dedicate a statue to Kwan Yin, the goddess of compassion and mercy. The weekend before, I was at the Parkside Baptist Church, also in Bonnyrigg.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In Fowler you will find St Lukeâs, the oldest continuous Anglican Church in Australia. You will find the whole spectrum of Christian churches, from Roman Catholic churches based on Italian and Croatian communities to Serbian, Macedonian, Russian and Greek Orthodox churches, as well as Protestant and Pentecostal churches. In the area you will also find a Turkish, a Pakistani and a Bosnian mosque. There are Vietnamese, Cambodian, Lao and Chinese Buddhist temples. There are Hindu and Taoist centres. Yet, as far as I can recall, in recent memory there have been no serious incidents which could be described as sectarian violence. There have been incidents between groups of different religions, as the recent soccer incidents record. But it is fairer to say that these were based on nationalist rather than on religious differences. That climate of peace and tolerance is a direct result not of laws dealing with religious vilification but of continual messages of tolerance from the leaders of religious bodies.</para>
<para>That brings me to the nature of religious vilification. I have to ask the question: are those who carry out acts of vilification followers of a different religion or do they have no religious beliefs? The answer in almost every case must be that it is the differences between religions that leads to vilification and violence. So when a government intervenes to sanction religious vilification it is itself guilty of challenging the beliefs of a religion. In practice, as occurs in Fowler, it is up to each religion and sect to preach tolerance; it is not for the state to enforce it. The greater danger, however, is for government to proscribe what it sees to be vilification, and that will vary according to the pressures brought to bear on governments. In short, the biggest concern for minority religions is the tyranny of the majority belief, and we have many recent examples of particular religious beliefs being applied to what are presented as moral issues.</para>
<para>When we give stress to religious values as guiding principles for government, we are denying tolerance to those in our society who do not share those values. The greatest vilification occurs when secular democracy is equated with Satanism. But secular democracy is not defended by laws dealing with religious vilification. The danger to democracy is best expressed by one of the founding fathers and the third President of the United States of America, Thomas Jefferson. During the campaign in 1800 in which he became President of the United States, Jefferson wrote:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The delusion ... on the [First Amendment] clause of the Constitution, which, while it secured the freedom of the press, covered also the freedom of religion, had given to the clergy a very favorite hope of obtaining an establishment of a particular form of Christianity ...</para>
<para class="block">â¦Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â¦Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â¦</para>
<para class="block">and they [the preachers] believe that any portion of power confided to me [such as being elected President], will be exerted in opposition to their schemes. And they believe rightly: for I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">And that last sentence is inscribed on the Jefferson Memorial in Washington. Its warning to us, as recently observed by commentator Thom Hartmann, should be that religion is best left to religion, and governance best left to government, answerable to the people. When governments pass laws which limit religious discussion they limit the scope of human inquiry, creativity and invention. As Jefferson said, they are a tyranny over the mind of man.</para>

<para>âNo-one in this place would condone discrimination, harassment or vilification on the basis of race, culture or religion. I am confident that we would all support the right of others to practise their religious beliefs free of hatred or persecution. Yet the Victorian Racial and Religious Tolerance Act paradoxically, in its attempt to promote racial and religious tolerance, is having the opposite effect. Rather than ensuring harmony and tolerance, the evidence to date is that it is fostering suspicion, tension and harmful litigation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This legislation was unnecessary. It is unhelpful and it is inflammatory. Fortunately some other jurisdictions, such as South Australia and Western Australia, which had been pursuing similar legislation, have seen the dangers and have decided not to proceed. According to an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> on 11 April this year, legislation being considered in the United Kingdom was dropped. One reason for that, according to this article, was the experience of what is happening in Victoria. I would also like to urge the New South Wales government to abandon its plans to introduce similar legislation.</para>
<para>We do need to do all we can to promote tolerance and to protect people against vilification. But heavy-handed legislation which curtails the freedom of speech is not the way to achieve this. Freedom of belief and freedom of speech is one of our fundamental rights. Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Likewise, article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. This right shall include freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his choice, and freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or in private, to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The expression of beliefâthat is, the teaching of oneâs views, be they religious, philosophical or politicalânecessarily involves disagreement with contrary views. Freedom of speech must involve the right to criticise alternate views, or else the debate of ideas becomes meaningless and we end up with, effectively, state sponsored censorship. Freedom of speech must involve the right to consider alternate views. There is a vast difference between disagreement on views and vilification of holders of alternate views. Sadly, it seems that the Victorian legislation fails to see this distinction. We do have a right to be protected from harassment and hatred. But we do not have a right not to be offended by the views of others, or indeed their rejection of, or their criticism of, our own views. This is a vital distinction. To do so subjugates the fundamental right of freedom of speech for a much more doubtful objective.</para>
<para>The rigorous debate of ideas is a healthy and essential feature of a free society and the ability to accept criticism without hatred, without vilification, is an essential feature of that. The Victorian legislation is anti tolerance. It discourages intolerance by encouraging litigation against people espousing views different from our own. It encourages a difference in ideas or beliefs to degenerate into litigation against the proponents of those beliefs, as witnessed in the recent case brought by the Islamic Council of Victoria against two Christian pastors.</para>
<para>The Victorian legislation has been particularly problematic because it is especially vague and subjective and it specifically rules out any motive for religious criticism as irrelevant. Rather than working to foster harmony and tolerance, it has pitted representatives of the Islamic and Christian communities against each other, involving substantial costs, and it has aroused tensions and suspicions. It has the potential to be used as a weapon to silence and punish people with different views and, as such, is an undemocratic infringement on the fundamental rights of freedom of belief and speech.</para>
<para>Further, such dangerous legislation is not necessary. The 1995 Commonwealth Racial Hatred Act already outlaws any public act which will humiliate or intimidate others on the basis of race. This provides protection against discrimination and vilification on the basis of race. To take this further into the realm of beliefs or ideas in which people exercise a choice is a very significant and dangerous step. I urge the New South Wales government to look more closely at the damage and division being wrought by the bad legislation in Victoria and to drop their plans to go down the same path. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI appreciate the observations and arguments put forward by members on all sides of the House to the motion on racial and religious tolerance moved by the member for Cook. This is a difficult question but, on balance, I do not believe the motion should be supported by the House. As I understand it, it is aimed at future New South Wales legislation, which has been drafted on the basis of the Victorian Racial and Religious Tolerance Actâan act which has been in effect since 2002 and which aims to restrict public behaviour that incites hatred or serious contempt for a personâs racial or religious background. That seems reasonable enough.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Yes, it is trueâas the member for Macquarie and the member for Banks have pointed outâthat freedom of speech is all important. Yet, a number of exceptions under the act seek to guarantee freedom of speech. The act is looking at those public expressionsâwhether by graffiti, commentary or publicationâthat promote or foment racial and religious vilification. The exceptions under the act are for conduct and discussion entered into reasonably and in good faith in relation to a number of mattersâfor example, genuine debate by a range of means on art or for scientific, academic and religious purposeâthat go to private conduct. Fair and accurate reporting of religious issues are all provided for under this act. So the benchmark for the maintenance of free speech would seem to have been considered by the draftsperson when the act was drawn up.</para>
<para>I appreciate very much that members value freedom of speech in this House, but with freedom of speech comes responsibility. The question is: why is the member for Cook opposing legislation of this kind being implemented in New South Wales? The member offers three reasons. The first is the effect of legislation to limit freedom of speech. I have just addressed, at least to some extent, some of those objections. The second is the creation of religious tension where there was none. The third is that the legislation makes no distinction between religion and race where one is personal or inheritedâand I will return to that later.</para>
<para>The genesis of the memberâs argument lies in concerns that have been raised in the religious community following the âCatch the Firesâ case, which was brought under this legislation. In this case a successful action was brought against defendants who were found to have acted in a way that was likely to incite a feeling of hatred for Muslims. The actions included claims that Muslims had preferred treatment when applying as refugees and that Muslims were, in effect, taking over Australia. In evidence given, one of the defendants claimed that they were an authority on Muslim matters when it was found that they were not. There was more evidence given to that end and the finding was clear and unambiguous. Given the heightened anxiety that surrounds world events, mentioned by members in the House, and with the prospect of possible future terrorism, such a final calming hand by legislation seems all the more desirable, especially as it draws the distinction between civil and criminal acts and has appropriate remedies.</para>
<para>The member for Banks mentioned Archbishop Peter Watson of Melbourne, and I could not agree more with him when he said, âWe should avoid making uninformed and unbalanced characterisations of each otherâs faith.â I acknowledge that a number of initiatives advance this process. They include interfaith dialogue, increased religious education and many others. But, in the event that extreme behaviour and vilification continues in the public domain, which this legislation is intended to redress, legislation of this kind, carefully drafted and reasonably applied, can play an important role as the final barrier to inflamed and ultimately dangerous vilification continuing unabated.</para>
<para>The fact is that religious tension activated the legislation: the legislation has not activated religious tension. Indeed, the problem has been with us for some timeâregrettably, perhaps more so, with the changed conditions following September 11. The act, rather than assuming a parity of culture and religion in the way the motion implies, merely addresses the certain effects actions would have if vilification of religion were to take place. Indeed, my own view is that religious and cultural identities intermingle. Freedom of religious belief and expression is a primary tenet of the democratic system, but such freedom does not forgive incitements and vilifications simply because someone is a Sikh, a Muslim or a Christian. This act makes that necessary balance law and, if prudently drafted, it will do the same in New South Wales.</para>

<para class="block">In South Australia the average waiting time for public dental health care reached 49 months in 2001. People were waiting more than four years on average to get their teeth fixed. That means that there were people who had been waiting even longer than that. That was the effect of the Commonwealth government pulling the plug on the Commonwealth Dental Health Program in 1996. It is almost 10 years since that cruel decision; ridiculously, South Australians are now celebrating a waiting list of just two years following the allocation of approximately $44 million by the state Labor government this year. What an absurd thing to be celebrating, yet in the three years since the Labor government was elected in South Australia waiting times have fallen by 45 per cent, or approximately 43,000 people.</para>
<para>It is an outrage that the Howard government cut the public dental program. I know of people in the electorate of Hindmarsh who died before they got to the top of the dental waiting list. Failing to fund dental health care seriously affects peopleâs quality of life. I cannot believe that in a country such as Australia pensioners are expected to find the funds to pay for private dental care. Maybe they can afford to do that in the suburbs of Bennelong or Wentworth, but I can guarantee that it is not so easy in the western suburbs of Adelaide, where I come from.</para>
<para>Poor oral health is linked to poor nutrition and a range of medical conditions, including diabetes, pneumonia and cardiovascular disease; yet somehow this government thinks it is okay for it to sit there with a $9 billion surplus and no funding for public dental health care. It is estimated that between 30 and 50 per cent of older people who enter hospital are undernourished. Poor dental care is a key reason for this and it is unacceptable for the Howard government and the members on the other side to ignore their responsibility. It is not just the elderly who are affected so badly by this. Childrenâs oral health has deteriorated since 1996. Labor remains committed to reintroducing a federal public dental care program, unlike members on the other side of the chamber.</para>
<para>It is deceitful to suggest that the states alone are responsible for dental services. The Constitution clearly gives the Commonwealth the responsibility. It was a priority for the federal Labor government, but it was one of the first casualties of the Howard government. When the Commonwealth Dental Health Program was scrapped there were 380,000 Australians waiting an average of six months for public dental services; by May 2000 that figure had skyrocketed to 500,000 people waiting between eight months and five years<inline font-style="italic">.</inline> What happens is that people on low incomes stop going to the dentist. They do not get check-ups, they put up with the pain and they struggle on. Many people will stop eating fresh fruit and vegetables because it hurts to chew. I am incredulous that any government could do this to people. These people are not asking for a handout; they are simply struggling to make ends meet.</para>
<para>Maybe people are going through a rough patch and cannot find work; maybe they work two low-paid jobs and still cannot scrape together the money to pay for their kids to go to the dentist; maybe they have worked and paid all of their lives and cannot afford to go to the dentist because the age pension just does not stretch far enough. Whatever the case, these are just regular Australians trying to live their lives the best way that they can. This government does not think it is up to them to fund a Commonwealth dental health program so that, regardless of your income, you can afford to go to the dentist.</para>

<para>âI know that the members opposite argue that this is a state issue or that in 1996 the Commonwealth scheme was only a temporary scheme, but the real issue here is that people who are suffering are not interested in the quarrelling that is taking place in here. They want their teeth fixed. The states have put in money. The real issue is that people who are suffering because of bad dental health care do not care: they are desperately in need of dental attention. The state Labor government in South Australia has put money into dental care and it is about time the Commonwealth did its part instead of just wiping its hands of any responsibility, as this government is currently doing.</para>

<para>This is not a poor country. The Treasurer is not struggling to work out how he is going to pay for the thousands of new computers for government departments that will be bought this year or for the tax breaks he is giving to people earning over $100,000 a year, but he says a public dental health care program is not a priority. The priorities of the Howard government are wrong. I call upon this government to reinstate a Commonwealth dental program, to adopt Laborâs Australian dental care plan, and to work cooperatively with the states and territories to ensure that dental services are delivered to the most vulnerable in our community, including the elderly and the working poor.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Hindmarsh for bringing to the attention of the House the appalling state of this nationâs dental health system and for giving me the opportunity to speak on this issue. In 1993 the Commonwealth Labor government funded a four-year program to help the states to reduce their lengthy waiting list. This was a $245 million package deal over four years. The program was flawed from the beginning. There was a restricted range of services offered under the funding package. One was a low fee paid for referrals to private dentists, resulting in insufficient incentive for private practitioners to participate in the program; the program also excluded full and partial dentures as well as other services such as bridges, orthodontic work and crowns. The desired resultsâthe shortening of the statesâ waiting listsâdid not eventuate. We were led to believe that it did, but it did not.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>For example, in Queensland waiting lists were one month to 12 months at the beginning of 1993; now the waiting time is anything from one year to eight years. Why? Because the states, especially Queensland, saw the program as a cash cow. Their general practice dental careâwhat they were being funded for: tooth extractions and fillingsâtook priority, so any other work was delayed. Why? The states had to continue to fund other dental work, so they slowed the process. They thought that the Commonwealth would extend the funding if the waiting times did not decrease. The waiting time was extended for pensioners needing to have dentures fixed. Why? Because the Commonwealth Labor government excluded them from the service list.</para>
<para>The most vulnerable in our community, the age pensioners, are now suffering. Only recently a pensioner complained to me that so far he has had to wait five years for a set of denturesâand he still has not got his teethâand, naturally, he was concerned for his failing health because of his inability to chew proper food. The amazing thing is that, when he and many other aged constituents before him complained about the lack of dental services offered to them, they were told to go and see their federal member because the Howard government had cut dental funding.</para>
<para>As I said earlier, the 1993 Labor Commonwealth Dental Health Program was flawed because it never included funding for denture treatment. This is another example of the states shirking their responsibilities, blaming the Commonwealth and pushing those who require denture services further down the waiting list. To be forced to wait five years or more for a set of teeth is appalling. In Queensland alone there are 11,000 people on the waiting list for a set of denturesâmostly age pensioners. This is typical of the Beattie government in Queensland and the way they run our health system.</para>
<para>Another problem with Queensland Health is their record keeping. If you want a clear picture of their waiting list, it is not possible. Queensland Health do not have a system that collects data on average waiting times for routine check-ups. Queensland Health do not have a specific waiting list for routine dental check-ups, so how is it possible for Beattie to know or provide figures on the number of people on waiting lists through Queenslandâs oral health program? However, one wonders if these waiting lists are as bad as they are made out, because I notice that the most recent figures released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare showed that the stateâs funding for dental care was $374 million in the year 2000 but that in the last financial year all the state spent was $342 million, a reduction in funding. You would have to question why the states would cut their funding while waiting lists grew. Surely they would not allow the most vulnerable in our society to suffer just to milk the Commonwealth of more funds to service a health system that they are clearly responsible for.</para>
<para>It is about time the states stopped playing games, started showing some responsibility and spent the extra funds they receive under the Commonwealth health agreement, the GST windfall, on dental health care. The Howard government have accepted their role of responsibility by providing approximately $350 million annually under the private health insurance rebate of 30 per cent for ancillary dental services and $75 million on dental health services for our war veterans and providing dental services to members of the armed forces and the Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. The Commonwealth funds university training for dentists and other dental service providers and also subsidises drugs that may be prescribed for oral health under the PBS.</para>
<para>As I have said in this House before, I do not believe that a huge amount of money needs to be thrown into the public dental health system, but rather it needs opening up to a bit of competition. I would suggest that the government introduces a system of vouchers that may be redeemed in either the public clinics or private hospitals. I am also not sure that public clinics should be located in our hospital systems, taking up valuable space. (<inline font-style="italic">Time expired</inline>)</para>

<para>âI rise in support of this motion on dental care. I commend the member for Hindmarsh, Mr Georganas, for moving it because dental care is a major health issue in Australia today. In my electorate of Richmond, where we have many elderly people and many people on low incomes, dental health is an issue that people raise with me on a daily basis. It is disappointing that this government does not take seriously its responsibility for the dental health of its citizens. As I said, every day I hear stories of local people who have been waiting for years often just to have basic dental work done.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>When the Leader of the Opposition was in my electorate recently, I took the opportunity to introduce him to three local people: Norm Masters, Jill Wainwright and Allan Green. Norm Masters has been waiting for around a year to get his dentures refitted. At the moment he is barely able to eat or speak because his dentures simply fall out of his mouth. On the many occasions I have met with him, his dentures have completely fallen out of his mouth. It is an outrageous situation. Jill Wainwright has broken a tooth and has given up on public dental after two years on the waiting list. It will cost her $800 to get her tooth fixed. Allan has spent about $6,000 in dental care costs because he, too, has given up after waiting for two years. These are people who have been forced to pay for dental care, but thousands of others cannot afford to pay for it and are just waiting in pain.</para>
<para>Also, recently in Ballina, which is in the adjoining electorate of Page, a local elderly woman had to wait five years to get her teeth fixed. It is unfortunate that the member for Page does not stand up for her and speak, as I am doing today, about reinstating the federal funding for dental care. Instead, he chose to say in the local newspaper, âOh, it is an issue for the states.â I have news for the member for Page. It is not. It is a federal government responsibility. He should be in here standing up for this woman in Ballina who has been waiting five years. It is an outrageous situation.</para>
<para>This situation of people having to wait for years to get their teeth fixed is clearly unacceptable, and it is impossible for the federal government to justify. I have heard hundreds of these stories. Elderly people and young families who cannot afford to see a private dentist have simply been abandoned by this government. Members of parliament on the other side of the House refuse to take up the fight for their constituents. It seems they are happy for people in their electorates to wait years to get their teeth fixed. It seems they are happy for people in their electorates to be living in pain. Instead of telling the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Ageing that they need to invest in dental care, they spend their time buck passing and carping on about the states. It is just not good enough. Just to enlighten coalition members, I draw their attention to section 51 of the Australian Constitution, which gives the federal government responsibility for dental health. I was very disappointed in the recent budget that there was no provision for dental health. Instead of taking this constitutional responsibility seriously, the government scrapped the $100 million a year Commonwealth Dental Health Scheme in 1997. This was despite the Minister for HealthÂ  and Ageing himself saying:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Keating governmentâs program did reduce waiting times. No doubt about that.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Perhaps he can explain to the 4,000 people in Richmond who have signed a petition calling for the funding to be restored just why he refuses to take responsibility for their dental health. Unfortunately, it is not just the dental health of local people that the health minister is putting at risk. Recent studies have shown that poor dental health can lead to a range of general health problems. Poor dental health can contribute to strokes, heart disease and chronic infections and it can also make diabetes difficult to manage. By not providing adequate public dental heath care, the federal government is putting the health of local seniors and families at risk. I just will not stand for it, particularly in my electorate, where 20 per cent of people are aged over 65. That is why dental health is such a major issue.</para>
<para>The government is simply not providing enough public dentists to cater for the demand. There are only about 240 public dentists to cater for more than 2.5 million health care card holders, children and the elderly. The government needs to train more dentists and to provide them with more incentive to treat public patients. It is time to stop the buck passing. I am happy to work with anyone, including members opposite, to make sure that public dental funding is restored by the federal government. I call on coalition members of parliament to support this motion and stop blaming everybody else but their own government for this problem. Make no mistake: it is the federal government that is obligated to provide dental health care and this government is not meeting its constitutional obligation.</para>

<para>âHonourable members opposite have made a compelling case for more spending to improve dental health care in Australia. They have outlined some situations of people who clearly need additional funding and clearly need access to dental health services. Nobody denies the sincerity of those honourable members opposite who have supported the motion currently before the chamber. However, while they have outlined the need for improved dental health, they have not explained to us why the state and territory governments of Australia refuse to carry out their responsibility to provide dental health care services of an adequate level. Every last cent of the GST money goes to the states and territories of Australia. One of the reasons that all of the GST funds are paid in this way is so that the states and territories would then be able to fund their constitutional responsibilities.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>One of the difficulties we have had in Australia since the Second World War, when most of the taxing powers moved to the Commonwealth, was that the states had a range of constitutional responsibilities but not the financial wherewithal to meet them. The introduction of the new tax system and the GST has meant that unprecedented amounts of money are flowing into the state and territory treasuries. I understand that the windfall to the Queensland state Labor government alone is over half a billion dollars. This has given Mr Bracks, Mr Beattie, Mr Carr and all of the other premiers and chief ministers the ability to fund dental health care services.</para>
<para>Governments have a different and complementary role in assisting Australians with their dental health. Both the Australian government and the state and territory governments must do their fair share for the system to work properly. Everyone knows that the states and territories are responsible for public dental services. As part of the Australian health care agreements, states and territories are required to report on the number of dental services provided. All states and territories have programs of universally available, free or reduced cost school based dental care. They are also allowed to levy a patient charge for dental services.</para>
<para>Nobody denies that there are lengthy waiting lists for some public dental programs. However, this situation could be radically improved if the states and territories used the money that flows to them from the GST to adequately fund these services. So we find these tear-jerking stories introduced to the House by the member for Hindmarsh and others. These stories could easily be fixed. These tragic situations could be dramatically improved if the states and territories of Australia used the GST money they receive to improve funding of health services in the dental area.</para>
<para>Let us look at what the Australian government has been spending during 2004-05 for dental services. This funding consists of money from the private health insurance 30 per cent rebate for ancillary services. The dollar value attributable to dental services in the 12 months to March 2005 was $359 million. The Department of Veteransâ Affairs estimates expenditure on dental care as $75 million per annum. The Department of Defence also provides dental services to members of the armed forces, and these costs are included in the health component of their budgets. There is also the Office for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health.</para>
<para>Much has been made by the member for Hindmarsh and the member for Richmond of the Commonwealth Dental Health Program. Let us look at this program. From 1994 until 1996, the Commonwealth Dental Health Program provided limited funding of $278 million over four years to the states and territories to reduce excessive waiting times and improve access to public services. This meant that the Commonwealth government of the day was assisting the states who were not carrying out their constitutional responsibilities to provide adequate funding for public dental health services. While the program was part of the election campaign of the Australian Labor Party in 1993, it is very important to recognise that the ALP made absolutely no commitment to keeping the program beyond 1996.</para>
<para>With evidence of substantial reductions in waiting times around the country, the Australian government took the decision to abolish the dental program in the 1996-97 budget and funding ceased on 1 January 1997. It was by nature a one-off program. There were problems with it and the states, now that the GST is flowing through to their coffers, do have the financial ability to properly fund public health services in the dental area. The question that honourable members ought to be asking is: why are the Labor governments in the states and territories failing Australians? Why are the state and territory governments preventing adequate public dental health funding? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI rise to support this excellent motion on dental care. In reflecting on this motion, I went to an appropriation bill contribution by my predecessor, Gareth Evans. This was the appropriation bill in 1996-97, and Mr Evans, the former member for Holt, was talking about the abolition of the Commonwealth dental scheme. He said this, rather presciently:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para>There is the abolition of the Commonwealth dental scheme, with stunningly widespread implications for elderly Australians and indeed many other categories of the four million Australians presently in receipt of health care cards and eligible for that assistance. Something over 500,000 Australians accessed that scheme last year. I know, from moving around the country and looking at my own electorate, what the implications of that are. In Tasmania alone, I think 14,000 people are on the waiting list at the moment. All of these people will go back to the bad old days of feeling pain, distress, discomfort, social liability and job liabilityâeventually having their teeth fall out or being extracted as a last resort ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In speaking to that appropriation bill, Gareth Evans made the following second reading amendment:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">â¦ the cruel decision to abolish the Commonwealth Dental Health Programme will cause serious problems for the less well off â¦</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">How prescient that is. At the time of that particular speech, we had a waiting list of 380,000 Australians, I think it was, who were waiting on average about six months. At present, we have some 500,000 Australians waiting up to five years.</para>
<para>It is interesting that there is a dichotomy between state and federal governments and who takes responsibility for this. I have a couple of points. A number of speakers on the other side have already mentioned the fact that the Commonwealth government already funds dental health programs, so it has already put its foot into the water, so to speak. It abolished the Dental Health Program in 1996. However, it continues to play a direct role in the provision of dental care services for veterans, Indigenous persons and the armed services and some in-patient services under Medicare and dental care related to the cleft lip and cleft palate scheme, which is about three per cent of the public dental health budget. So the fact is that the Commonwealth does make a welcome contribution in that area.</para>
<para>These debates are interesting. We have had debates about water in the states and the gun buyback after the 1996 Port Arthur massacre. We talk about the division between the states and the federal government. When the issue is large enough, like water for example, there is a thing called the Council of Australian Governments which, when problems are identified, comes together for a common resolution. If we have something like 500,000 Australians waiting up to five years for dental health services, I think that is a national crisisâcorrect me if I am wrongâparticularly given the health defects that causes. It is incumbent upon the government to provide further funding and have a COAG meeting. As I said, they can fund water incentive programs et cetera.</para>
<para>We cannot continue to tolerate this situation. In my electorate, the three services that actually provide dental health programs are the Casey Community Health Service at its Berwick site, the Casey Community Health Service at its Cranbourne site and the City of Greater Dandenong Community Health Service. It takes 2Â½ years to get an examination, 2Â½ to get an X-ray, 2Â½ years to get a filling, 2Â½ years to get an extraction and up to five years to get dentures repaired. It is incumbent upon a government that spent $66 billion in its election budget and $21 billion in tax cuts to realise that it is not going to take much more money to fix this problem.</para>
<para>An evaluation of the Commonwealth Dental Health Program was conducted by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare in 1996. It found that in the 24 months following the introduction of the CDHP, 200,000 additional persons received publicly funded dental care in one year, there was a greater frequency of visits and waiting times were reducedâthose waiting for less than one month increased from 47.5 per cent to 61.5 per cent. If we have a common commitment rather than blaming the states for not fixing this dental health problemâand I am sure we will hear some point scoring soonâwe can fix this problem. I call upon the government to take this issue seriously. Spend some of the $87 billion on fixing a national crisis in the health of our Australian community.</para>

<para>âIt is a great pleasure to debate in the House this motion, under private membersâ business, on dental health. I see hypocrisy in some of the speakers on the other side of the chamber feigning that the only people interested in their constituentsâ health, including their dental health, are from the opposition side. I ask members like the member for Richmond just exactly how many approaches she has made to the state Labor government about the failing dental system. I ask what the member is doing to ensure that her state Labor government is meeting its obligation rather than reducing its budget on dental health.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is very obvious to me that in every state there is a political tactic being played here. This political tactic is being played with the lives of Australians. What is taking place now is that the states have got togetherâremember, all the states and territories are Laborâand they are saying, âWe will reduce funding, the system will collapse and then we can blame the Commonwealth.â Do you know what I think? I think the federal opposition is aiding and abetting this position and is actually aware of the appalling action being taken by the states.</para>
<para>I say this because, from the information I have, in 2002-03 the total amount of all state funding combined was $342 million. That was down from $374 million in 1999-2000. That is, the combined funding of every state and territory for dental works has fallen. What the member for Forde would have indicated had she been able to finish her speech in the House is exactly right: she believes that a voucher system has merit, that private dental practitioners would be a valuable resource in helping the public system to cope with the apparent overload and that a change in the public system to bring about efficiency should be that dentists working in public practices be paid per service and not salaried. This would make them more accountable and the go-slow process for more funding would not be considered.</para>
<para>The member for Forde has quite rightly validated my point in this debate by saying that in 1994 to 1996, when the Commonwealth Labor government put in place an interim dental health program with a definite sunset for 1996âno funding beyond 1996âthere was a go-slow to ensure that the Commonwealth funding was continued. Waiting lists in many of those areas actually increased rather than decreased. Instead of something taking place and something being done for the people of Australia, there was an organised go-slow in order to retain and continue that Commonwealth funding. What a shame.</para>
<para>I look at this situation and I believe every speaker wants something done about the dental services and about many services across Australia. But the responsibility must lie with the state governments, particularly in this area. Do you pay your neighbourâs mortgage simply because the neighbour is in arrears? It is their responsibility; it is not your responsibility. I am constantly bombarded with calls. It does not matter whether it is a new police stationââThe Commonwealth has a surplus; the states are in deficit so the Commonwealth should pay.â It does not matter whether it is a new hospitalââThe Commonwealth has a surplus, let the Commonwealth build a new hospital because the states are in deficit, so the Commonwealth must pay.â How long do we reward the state Labor governments for mismanagement? How long do we reward them for failure in governance and financial accountability? We cannot continue to carry the can for the state governments. It is probably time and there is opportunity for states to be removed from the equation. Perhaps the Minister for Health and Ageing could withhold funding from the states. The previous speaker, the member for Holt, spoke about COAGâ</para>

<para>âI have been watching the current debate about a debate regarding nuclear power with some interest. For reasons that are unknown, sections of the Australian media, particularly the newspaper the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, have been asking anybody with vague relevance to comment on whether or not we should have a debate. Predictably, nobody is opposed to having a debate, and so even opponents of nuclear power are then able to be portrayed as calling for nuclear power to be re-examined or reconsidered. In fact we have had debate on this issue interminably. Debate has never stopped about nuclear power. What does wax and wane of course is media interest. Now we have a particular media outlet promoting the nuclear cause hard there is inevitably more public focus, but the debate remains essentially the same as it always has.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The crucial point is that the onus is on those who are advocating change to demonstrate why that change should occur. As a member of the Labor Party I know only too well that that onus rests on all of us who advocate change. Advocates of nuclear power have an onus to demonstrate a genuinely commercial market for energy without the huge subsidies that have characterised nuclear power in other markets particularly in Europe and with genuinely accounted for external costs, such as the additional cost required to protect installations from terrorist threats, the cost of waste disposal, decommissioning and other issues, properly factored into the equation. In other words, the proponents of nuclear power have an onus to demonstrate how Australia would benefit economically as a result of a move to nuclear power, taking into account the primary rationale which is currently advanced, which is of course to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. They also have to explain how they would deal with issues such as the location of nuclear power installations in Australia and how waste disposal would be dealt with. And, most importantly of all, they would need to explain how we would continue to export vast amounts of coal at the same time as seeking to reduce Australiaâs own coal consumption. Surely that would be rather hypocritical.</para>
<para>These associated issues are central to the question of nuclear power and whether or not we are to take the question of externalities into account in the equation that governs what energy we use and what we pay for it. We also have to take into account the externalities of other forms of power if we are to properly consider the questions of greenhouse gases and the impact that coal- and gas-fired power has on our greenhouse gas emissions. So clearly, in any examination of nuclear power as an alternative, we need to look at the external implications such as waste disposal, decommissioning costs, security costs and the like as well as the raw economic cost in the same way that we are looking at the external impact of coal and gas producing greenhouse gas emissions in that equation. Similarly, we also need to take into account external factors relating to other forms of power such as wind power and the impact on rural landscapes.</para>
<para>Unfortunately, we do not always get consistency in these debates. New South Wales Premier Bob Carr has recently called for a rethink about nuclear power. But on 7 June he said that he refused to have any nuclear waste dump established in New South Wales. This to me is an amazingly contradictory and confused position. If nuclear waste is so bad that we cannot even contemplate having it stored in our state, how can we advocate introducing the process that creates it? Clearly, this is a perfect illustration of one of the key issues with nuclear power: in order to advocate it you have got to include all of the aspects of the issue within your proposition. You cannot pretend that issues like nuclear waste are going to be somebody elseâs problem.</para>
<para>It is worth scrutinising the broader position of some of those who have been advocating nuclear power, as an inevitable major public relations campaign winds up, and see what their track record is on other issues. Bob Carr certainly does not fit into this category but I have no doubt that others advocating nuclear power have probably also got a bit of a track record at being greenhouse sceptics. I would be interested to see what their view is on the issue of nuclear proliferation and whether or not Iran should be enabled to develop civilian nuclear capability, which of course many feel is linked to a desire to develop nuclear weapons. Advocates of nuclear power have a responsibility to address all of these issues, including the nuclear weapons proliferation issue, which is, I believe, the biggest single security threat to our world.</para>
<para>The fallacy that always permeates these debates is the failure of those involved in them to deal with the consumption question. For years Australians have debated issues like new power stations and alternative energy sourcesâbe it wind or nuclear powerâbut have often overlooked the fundamental question of how we reduce our consumption of energy and how we make our existing consumption more efficient by using new technology. At one level this is understandable, because the simplest way to reduce consumption, of course, is to increase price. It is very clear that substantial increases in price for energy would have an enormously retrograde effect on lower income people. There would be a devastating social impact. That is one of the key issues that the advocates of nuclear power have to deal with because, almost by definition, unless the price of coal- and gas-fired power in Australia is substantially raised to take into account greenhouse, for example, then nuclear could not be competitive. It is almost automatic that anybody advocating nuclear power as a viable power source for Australia is by definition, if they are going to have any kind of working energy market, advocating very substantial increases in the price of electricity for ordinary Australians.</para>
<para>There are other options, though, and I want to raise one of them today. This one is currently being promoted to state governments like New South Wales, and it is designed to eliminate or reduce the need for new power stations through using smart metering based on digital metering technology and modern telecommunications technology, enabling consumers to manage their own use and to choose when they use particular appliances and ensuring that they can manage the costs of their own electricity consumption. California is introducing this system after trials showed drops of between 12 and 35 per cent in peak period consumption of electricity. Bayard Capital and Country Energy are trialling this in 200 households in New South Wales where consumers have variable prices for electricity depending on the time of day and they have the technology to enable them to choose when they should use particular appliances. At a cost of about $4 to $5 per month for the metering technology, consumers are able to substantially diminish their electricity bills.</para>
<para>This presents a potential to reduce the effective gap between base load and peak load power demand. That gap is ultimately a measure of our efficiency in delivering and using electricity, because the bigger that gap the more inefficiently we are investing. We are building power stations that are ultimately there to ensure that we have enough electricity on the half-dozen days of the year when everybody has got their airconditioners on. By making sure that that gap is minimised, we reduce the extent to which we have to invest capital in enormous power stations that are incredibly capital intensive and therefore we reduce costs to consumers by ensuring that the differences, the ebbs and flows of consumption, are smoothed out. By giving consumers the choice through smart metering technology that enables them to do that, we will reduce that gap.</para>
<para>Bayard is proposing something that I describe as a reverse user-pays model where customers will voluntarily agree not to use certain appliances like airconditioners at particular times of the day or on specified days and, as a result, they will get a standard rate reduction in their electricity rate. The same principle applies to congestion charging on roads. These issues matter. New South Wales is currently contemplating investing in a new coal-fired power station, partly the cause of their interest in the nuclear debate, at a cost conservatively estimated at a billion dollars. This is primarily in order to deal with this problem of the gap between base load and peak load power. Smart meters could obviate the need for a new power station and would have a variety of other benefits including information about consumer use, fault detection benefits, automated meter reading and other things.</para>
<para>I do not have airconditioning in my home but, in the current system, if a new power station is to be built in order to ensure that there is enough power when there is a peak use of airconditioning in Melbourne then I will be paying for the power station even though I do not have airconditioning. So this smarter approach that is being put forward by Bayard Capital and being developed in California has got a lot to recommend it. It is important to emphasise that there is no magic bullet, be it nuclear power or smart metering. But it is illustrative of how we can address greenhouse problems by getting a lot smarter about how we do things and using new technology to massively improve our performance of energy use and reduce our consumption by moving forward, rather than by blindly reverting to old solutions that may help solve the greenhouse problem but that bring a lot of other problems with them. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI want to deal with another resource issue and that is water. The capital cities of Australia are facing high and dry times. It seems to me that it does not matter whether it is Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide or Perth, the average water supply available to those cities is at 40 per cent of capacity. Some are below that level; some are slightly above itâon average, they have 40 per cent of their water supply left. The city of Sydney, I understand, has roughly, at current usage rates, two years water supply left. There have been numerous inquiries into the water needs of Sydney and Australia. There was <inline font-style="italic">The value of water: inquiry into Australiaâs urban water management</inline> report from the Senate inquiry in 2002, the Wentworth Group in 2004 and Pratt Water in 2005, just to name three really significant in-depth studies of water needs and pricing structures for water.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Desalination appears to be the answer for New South Wales, according to the Premier as well as the water KGB. Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, I know you have not seen them in Melbourneâthey drive yellow vehicles and they lurk round the suburbs hoping to catch an unsuspecting suburbanite spraying their lawns at the wrong time or washing their car at an hour of the day or in a manner not approved by the Carr government. Those are the two policies. I know the Premier has dismissed the generation of electricity by wind in order to drive a desalination plant because it is a kookaburra-killing exercise. I did not realise, until he made this enlightened statement, that wind power kills kookaburras. Therefore, it is off the agenda for the state of New South Wales and we will be depending on nuclear power linked with a desalination plant. It is just a small budgetary item of $2 billion or $3 billion. That is $2 billion or $3 billion to solve the water problems of Sydney. There will probably be a six- or 10-year delay before we actually get it, but Sydney has water sufficient for two years. I am concerned that the water KGB and the desalination plant are not really going to solve some of the problems for Sydney or for some of the other capital cities around Australia.</para>
<para>Dams have never been lower than they are at the moment and we have, just up the road from Canberra, the tragic circumstances of the city of Goulburn facing the prospect of drinking water only and one shower a week. That is the rationing Goulburn is currently facing. A <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> article said:</para>

<para class="block">found a small increase in population growth could âturn Sydneyâs water surplus into a deficitâ.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is exactly what is happening now. It appears to be a policy in New South Wales, a whole-of-government approach that seems to be: âFingers crossed, letâs hope it rains.â The people of Goulburn do not think that is good policy, I do not think it is a good policy and people in the burgeoning, expanding suburbs of Sydney do not think it is a good policy either.</para>
<para>If we look at the budget and the way in which water resources have been looked at in the Sydney region we will see that in 1960 Warragamba Dam was completed for a population of one million people. In 1998, seven years ago, the dam was at capacity. Now the population is five million people and the storage is 37 per cent full. The major Sydney supply was full six or seven years ago and it is now serving a population of five million people instead of one million people. The state government in 2005-06 is spending $406 million on state-wide water infrastructure. This includes $86 million to access deep water stores in Warragamba, Nepean and Avon dams and the introduction of a fund of $30 million to encourage water saving projects by business.</para>
<para>By the way, you would be shocked to know that the Country Towns Water Supply and Sewerage Program of $85 million, which was promised this year, has a budget allocation of only $32 million. So the budget for country town water supplies has been cut by two-thirds. That alone is a cause of great concern, I would imagine, for my country colleagues. There has been no modelling or preparation. Nothing has been done.</para>
<para>What do the experts say should be done to resolve this issue? There are a number of principles or philosophies that could easily be applied to maximise the existing investment by making sure that the reticulation systems are properly used and properly maintained. There is a redundancy in the current system that can be easily taken up. There must be management of demandâand the state government has done that, but not sufficiently wellâby educating consumers and landowners about how they can make better use of valuable water.</para>
<para>A charging regime should also be used. I noticed today that there has been talk by Frank Sartor, the New South Wales minister, that he is going to have a dual pricing system: one for residents of homes and another one for industry. The people in homes have copped it so far. They have had to put up with the rationing program, and it seems to me they are going to cop another price rise and a regime for industry that will just be a flat rate. There are no programs by which industries can improve their efficiency.</para>
<para>The diversity of supply needs to be looked at. I believe we have to look at how we can recycle all the stormwater that is running out to sea. It is much cheaper to recycle stormwater than to build a desalination plant. A desalination plant has to turn salt water into fresh water whereas stormwater is only slightly polluted and can easily be upgraded for use in gardens, toilets and other uses around the suburbs.</para>
<para>The maximum use of local water harvesting schemes is something that the Commonwealth is going to encourage through its program under the National Water Commission, recently established by the Deputy Prime Minister. There needs to be maximisation of rainwater harvestingâthat is, collecting local rainfall by making sure that there is compulsory collection onsite by tanks and detaining basins or investment in retention, whether it be in the form of underground tanks or larger dam-like structures. And there must be truly cost-effective pricing.</para>
<para>Those are some of the principles. I know that Dr Charles Essery has made presentations here in Parliament House and I have been delighted to see that there is some imagination. Unfortunately he has left the water board. I know that within CSIRO and the Water Commission there are solutions, but there are no solutions in the New South Wales government, apparently. The New South Wales government seems incapable of facing these issues. My colleague Pat Farmer, the member for Macarthur, finds that he is going to have another 100,000 homes built in his area. In the electorate of Mitchell there will be another 60,000 homes.</para>
<para>There have been no plans for water supply, no vision, and no dedication of any type to the way in which those water needs are going to be met. And yet we have experts, up hill and down dale, saying that Sydney is facing a water crisis which needs to be dealt with. Frank Sartor, in his reign, has been a disaster and Bob Carr, in posing around the country side claiming to have solutions, is applying just a piecemeal approach to a sustainable water cycle for Sydney. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI grieve about the culture of favours for mates and special deals which infest the National Party in northern New South Wales. A significant wake-up call has come in the shape of the public inquiry into the Tweed Shire Council, whose first reportlast month led to the dismissal of the Tweed Shire Council. That inquiry outed a massive developer funded campaign to elect sympathetic candidates to the Tweed Shire Councilâcandidates with National Party links who would make decisions on council in the interests of these developers.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The developersâ campaign, called Tweed Directions, raised over $340,000 from donors. It gave $163,000 to nine separate groups of candidates and dummy candidates which it ran during the campaign. It therefore had a further $177,000 available to spend on its own separate campaign in support of these candidates and to denigrate rival candidates. But Tweed Directions has declared that its electoral expenditure, aside from gifts, was $342,000. To the inquiry it changed this amount to $307,000âbut whichever amount is correct, it leaves an amount of between $143,000 and $165,000 unaccounted for. I urge the New South Wales Election Funding Authority to pursue this matter and to ascertain the source of this massive disclosure irregularity. I think the size of this campaign and its potential to buy councillors and improperly influence decisions about planning applications is cause for grave concern.</para>
<para>Not only did the inquiry unmask the developer campaign; it also unearthed decisions made by councillors who were beneficiaries of this campaign which inappropriately benefited these same developers. For example, in June 2003 councillors Warren Polglase, Don Beck, Gavin Lawrie, Wendy Marshall and Phil Youngblutt consented to an application by Resort Corporation, a company headed by the son and son-in-law of one of their colleagues, Councillor Brinsmead, for a large development at Kingscliff. They ignored the council officersâ recommendations on the height of the building. They approved the building in such a way as to save the developers over $33,000 in section 64 and section 94 contributions. Later on, they reduced the contributions payable by even more, approved illegal works and allowed the developer to reduce the width of the driveway from six metres to four metres. Resort Corporation was a major contributor to the campaigns of these councillors.</para>
<para>Then there was Chiltern Hunt, who put forward a 56-lot rural/residential subdivision at Terranora Road, Terranora. Councillors rejected their officersâ recommendation that they express a preference for a revised proposal with two fewer residential lots and more open space. Instead, council approved the development and, for good measure, threw in an additional residential lot, a reduction in pavement widths, removal of the requirement to construct kerbing and guttering along the full frontage of the site and a reduction in the length of the footway/cycleway. These concessions, which came without explanation, gave the developer a windfall in saved costs estimated at a cool $582,000. Little wonder that Chiltern Hunt subsequently donated $10,000 to these councillors through Tweed Directions.</para>
<para>These councillors who were so disgracefully in the developersâ pockets had deep National Party links. Councillor Lynne Beck was the wife of long-time National Party state MP Don Beck. Councillor Warren Polglase was a campaign director for Don Beck and Larry Anthony. Councillors Gavin Lawrie, Phil Youngblutt and Wendy Marshall joined the National Party after they became councillors. These National Party councillors are unfit to be councillors. They have no understanding of the importanceâor, indeed, the meaningâof conflict of interest. National Party Mayor Warren Polglase was asked by the Tweed inquiry:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Having obtained funding from Tweed Directions, knowing that the underlying funding has come from a number of developers, if such an application by one of the people funding Tweed Directions comes before council, does that give rise to a conflict of interest on your part?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Mr Polglase answered:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I believe not.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This complete failure to understand his responsibilities not only renders Mr Polglase unfit to be a councillor but also renders him unfit to be a member of the Northern Rivers Area Consultative Committee. The members of the area consultative committees are the responsibility of the Deputy Prime Minister. I know it may hurt the Deputy Prime Minister to ditch a National Party mate, but it has to be done. Area consultative committees are involved in the allocation of hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayersâ funds via Regional Partnerships and other government programs. They are subject to conflict of interest provisionsâand they need to be, because the risk of insider trading and grants going to the ACCsâ friends and member organisations is all too real.</para>
<para>Someone who does not understand conflict of interest when it is staring him in the faceâsuch as Warren Polglaseâshould not be a member of an area consultative committee. His understanding of conflict of interest reminds me of the late Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen and the separation of powers. And it is not merely the conflict of interest issue and his conduct as a Tweed Councillor that are of concern. In April 2001 Warren Polglase was appointed to the position of Dairy Regional Assistance Program project officer by the Northern Rivers Area Consultative Committee. Just why Mr Polglase was superior to other applicants for the position is unclear. But he certainly had one thing going for him: he had been a member of the area consultative committee and, therefore, had been involved with the appointment of the very people who in turn chose him as project officer.</para>
<para>As Dairy RAP project officer, Warren Polglase got the area consultative committee and Minister Andersonâs department to approve a $273,000 grant to Seawind. In answer to a question from me, the Deputy Prime Minister claimed that this grant was approved following âa rigorous assessment processâ and âexternal financial checksâ. Seawindâs manager, Bob Hinchcliffe, was happy to line up his workers for a government media stunt involving former member Larry Anthony and his campaign director Warren Polglase. But after just 17 months the company shut down, making a laughing stock of the Deputy Prime Ministerâs ârigorous assessment processâ. On the basis of Mr Polglaseâs recommendation, $164,000 of taxpayersâ money has been wasted.</para>
<para>Mr Polglase also recommended an allocation of $88,000 under the Dairy Regional Assistance Program to create farm-stay accommodation on the Forest Glen Organic Farmâwhich is now on the market, for saleâwithout that farm-stay accommodation ever having been established or provided.</para>
<para>And it gets worse. Former councillor and Liberal Party member Bronwynne Luff has stated that, in 1992, Councillor Warren Polglase and other councillors whom she describes as âthe Midas majorityâ voted to rezone riverfront land near Boydâs Bay Bridge from âspecial business waterfrontâ to âurban expansionâ, allowing a development of 10 storeys rather than three. Bronwynne Luff says that, after the then state National Party minister allowed five storeys on the site, Warren Polglase said to her, âHow would you feel about the land becoming a public park?ââsuggesting that the state government would buy it from the owner. She was scandalised and said, âYou mean that, after increasing the value on paper, you would see the public purse buy it back for more than itâs worth?â</para>
<para>It appears that a similar trick was pulled more recently, in 2001, with $268,000 of federal taxpayersâ money, with land known as the Bilambil sports grounds. The land had been bought by Mr Peter Hutton, who told Tweed Council he wanted to sell it to them for $1 million. Councillor Luff supported the council officersâ view that council should pay no more than $900,000 for it. The land in question adjoins Bilambil Creek. It is flood prone and constrained, by zonings, to limited land use such as sports fields, but Councillor Polglase pressed for council to pay the full price asked by Mr Hutton. National Party sympathisers organised local demonstrations in support of the purchase. Then, mysteriously and miraculously, Minister Andersonâs department provided $268,000 under the Regional Solutions Program to assist with the purchase. The council paid $1.1 million for the land. Mr Peter Hutton, a very satisfied customer, then held a fundraising party at his home at The Anchorage at Tweed Heads for the benefit of the former National Party MP for Richmond, Larry Anthony. The circle is complete. Mr Anthony uses taxpayersâ funds to benefit Mr Hutton, who repays the favour with fundraising help. Taxpayersâ dollars are laundered into Larry Anthonyâs campaign funds, with Warren Polglase acting as the middleman.</para>
<para>These practices are not fit for a modern society which seeks to avoid corruption. The National Partyâs use of land rezoning and dodgy planning decisions for its political and financial benefit in the Northern Rivers of New South Wales is deplorable. The Deputy Prime Minister must clean up his party in New South Wales. He should start by removing Mr Polglase from the Northern Rivers Area Consultative Committee. The Deputy Prime Ministerâs statement to me in question time today that he was not aware of Mr Polglaseâs evidence to the Tweed inquiry is not good enough. He ought to be aware of such a serious matter, he ought to be reading that committee of inquiryâs report and he ought to be acting to ensure that members of his area consultative committees understand the concept of conflict of interest.</para>

<para>âThere never was a war on poverty; maybe there was a skirmish on poverty. In the last five years there has been a chance to return to that war, and it is to that grievance that I speak today. The Millennium Summit in September 2000 was followed by the Monterey International Conference on Financing for Development in 2002 and, in that same year, the World Summit on Sustainable Development. Those three key meetings have laid the platform for United Nations member nations, including Australia, to find the resources required to meet the Millennium Development Goals. I am encouraged that will occur not only with the wealthy countries but also the middle-earning countries of the world and that there will be a mobilising of the domestic resources within the poorest countries as well.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The eight goals and their underlying 18 targets bear repeating today. They are: halving hunger by the year 2015; halving extreme poverty by the year 2015; halting and beginning to turn around the scourge of HIV-AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis; dropping by three-quarters maternal mortality; reducing by two-thirds paediatric mortality; bringing at least to 50 per cent of current levels those who do not have access to safe drinking water; ensuring that the principles of sustainable development are enshrined in these goals; achieving significant improvements for 100 million slum dwellers worldwide; making available primary education worldwide by 2015 and removing the disparity of gender biases in primary and secondary education right now and then having them removed from education completely by 2015; and, finally, achieving a global partnership for development. That means fair trade and finance, debt reliefâand we had the welcome news two weeks ago of cancellation of debtâspecial programs for island and land-locked economies, productive work programs for youth, preventative medicines through collaboration with pharmaceutical companies and new technologies being available to the worldâs poor, particularly in communications and IT, which provide struggling economies with a leap-frogging ability.</para>
<para>Australiaâs contribution to the growth and stability of our region is significant. Australiaâs aid program focuses on strengthening governance, maximising the benefits of globalisation to allow investment liberalisation, regional securityâbecause without that the very hard won gains can be lostâand basic health and education. It also focuses onâmost important of allâpromoting sustainable approaches to managing resources. In the face of overfishing and deforestation, where Gandhi referred to âfood becoming Godâ, we see the conversion of capital assets into financial assets. A good example is cutting down a tree and not leaving that for subsequent generations.</para>
<para>Our aid budget is a shade under $2Â½ billion this year. That is the fifth increase in a row. Our overseas development aid to GNI ratio is 0.28 per cent, just higher than the OECD average. Breaking that down, there was a significant contribution to Indonesia for tsunami aid providing $500 million in grant funding, $500 million in highly concessional loans and $302 million this financial year. There is $492 million going to Papua New Guinea, part of the multiyear $1.1 billion enhanced cooperation program that will assist with consolidating the rule of law in that country and enhancing public sector development and access to basic services. To Pacific nations goes $463 millionâto the Solomon Islands goes $247 million of thatâand to East Asia goes $344 million, with current levels retained for East Timor. Aid to Iraq is $45 million over two years. There is $77 million going to Africa, $70 million of which is for HIV-AIDS programs; and there is $170 million in humanitarian relief and emergency aid, which, although not contributing directly to the millennium goals, plays a key role in helping people through the disastrous circumstances often found in Africa and Asia.</para>
<para>The Highly Indebted Poor Countries programâ$34.8 million over three yearsâis really a raft of assistance from the 20 or so wealthy countries whose economies add up to something like $20 trillion a year. With that program we can transition 38 struggling economies. Eighteen of the wealthy countries have already moved from the decision point through to finally being able to look at interim debt relief, reaching eventually a completion point where debts can be forgiven. But how do we actually map our way through what is a series of economiesâthe majority of them in Africaâwith average life expectancies of 42 years of age, with just one doctor for every 30,000 people, where one-third of the population will not live to the age of 35, with rising child mortality up to levels of 20 per cent and with less than $2 a day spent on health services? We know the money is going there and often not achieving the results we would like to see.</para>
<para>What are the reasons for the failure of aid so far? Jeffrey Sachs has described eight of them. These include the poverty trap. Willem de Kooning said the trouble with being poor is that it simply takes up all of your time. Scrounging from dawn to dusk to find a way to survive leaves no way to put away resources for when times are tough, let alone to export for an income. There is the fiscal trap of simply no tax collection with overhanging debt. There is corruption, combined with state failure. The other reasons include geography, geopolitical issues like trade barriers and embargoes, religious and cultural factors that prevent women from engaging in a community or an economy, the complete lack of innovation where poverty rules supreme so that two to three per cent of an economy cannot be dedicated to driving new ideas from patentingâ98 per cent of all patents rest with just a handful of countriesâand demographics where poverty brings up to five or six children per mother, making it extremely difficult to deliver forms of aid where population is expanding rapidly.</para>
<para>What we need to do is stop and thinkânot so much about what we are prepared to give and then be dismayed when it does not work but more about what it will take to begin to address the problem. We need to identify low-cost, proven interventions that can sustainably raise the standard of living and give economic opportunities to the 1.1 billion people who live in abject poverty. Keep in mind that, of the $76 billion of aid given last year, $16 billion went to middle-income countries, $11 billion went in reverse flows paying off debt, $6 billion was actually debt relief, $12 billion was in direct government support to keep the wheels turning and $19 billion was paid to consultants who simply finished their work and returned to their home countries. Of that $76 billion, just 16 per cent actually went to addressing extreme poverty and supporting the basic needs in communities in these countries.</para>
<para>There is a need to raise the aid from 77c a day to around $1.08. It does not seem like much. One benefit of being poor is that sometimes it does not take much to improve your situation substantially. Today let us define a basic packageâas Geoffrey Sax has done in his recent publication. For a population, just $10 a head can allow fields to lie fallow, pay for fertilisers, triple agricultural output and stave off poverty, as we have seen in Asia more successfully than in Africa. For another $10 per person, a medical clinic can be staffed with a doctor, with preventative health and immunisations provided. For another $10 per person, there can be an off-grid generator with batteries in homes and the chance of a cheap light bulb to provide light in households. For another $5 per person there can be sanitation, water, bores and 10 conveniently located taps in communities. For another $5, obviously amortised over some period, there can be a truck for a village, modern fuels for schools, somewhere to store grain and a few mobile phones to connect villages so that they can have access to information like prices for their products. That amounts to around $US70 a day.</para>
<para>Poverty has been likened to a crime you have never committed. That is why it is disappointing that we sometimes hear comments such as âAustralia has fallen tragically short in matching its action to rhetoricâ, because we do know that the overseas aid program has been maintained at a reasonably sustainable level. There were drops during the first two years of the Hawke governmentâover that period it fell by a third. It is now recovering to around 0.28 per cent, but we do know a little about being indebted, because the opposition left this country as a highly indebted rich country. It does not take much to know that $90 billion would go a long way in the developing world. In fact, with the $90 billion of Australian debt we could well have paid for the fertilisers, the medical clinic, the generators, the sanitation, the springs, the bores, the taps, the trucks, the modern fuels and storage and handling for all of those 1.1 billion people living in extreme poverty worldwide and still have change left over for a couple of extra continents. That is the purchasing power of the debt that Australia was left with. It is only through responsible domestic policy that that can be avoided and Australia can become a true friend of the highly indebted economies. That will leave Australia not $90 billion behind but in a position to be able to look after the indebted countries that, today, look to us for support. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âMy grievance concerns the construction and location of telecommunications towers within my electorate of Lowe, but it also has relevance right across Australia. As you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, the Telecommunications (Low-Impact Facilities) Determination was made in 1997 for the purpose of determining whether certain telecommunications facilities fall within the definition of âlow impactâ. The term âlow-impact facilitiesâ defines a range of telecommunications facilities that are likely to have an impact on the amenity of an area. As such, the purpose of the determination is not what one may thinkâthat is, to protect persons from any potential harmful effects of electromagnetic radiation. In short, the determination is an amenity instrument not unlike those environmental factors that are found as prescribed matters for determination for a development application under section 79C of the New South Wales Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I wish to raise the issue of environmental impact and the interphase between the Commonwealth and New South Wales state laws that is directly related to this environmental impact. In particular, I raise an issue that I have raised many times in the House in the past: gap analysis in the Commonwealth-state laws interphase. What is being increasingly observed throughout New South Wales is that there is a gap in the effective protection afforded by the combined effects of environmental instruments when the Commonwealth and state laws are read together. In particular, the determination of whether a facility is low impact or not does not overcome the fact that constitutional law precludes a matter being considered by a state or territory government that falls within the purview of Commonwealth law and vice versa.</para>
<para>In this case, when a facility is determined to be a low-impact facility, the effect of this finding places the construction of a low-impact facility outside the purview of the state or territory planning laws, such as the New South Wales Environmental Planning and Assessment Act. This is a matter that has received considerable attention in the states and territories as well as within the various land and environment courts and related jurisdictions. In particular, the issue of whether state or territory planning and related laws may be nonetheless applicable to a facility that is determined to be of low impact is a considerable issue that has received much commentary. When considering the merits of the dual application of both state and territory planning law as well as Commonwealth telecommunications law, it is salient today to review the policy intent of these laws.</para>
<para>Firstly, members of the House will be aware that the policy intent of the Commonwealth Telecommunications (Low-Impact Facilities) Determination is primarily one of ameliorating amenity impacts. The purpose of this determination is not to prevent the effects of harmful long-term determination as one might expect; it is simply to reduce the visual and other aesthetic impacts of the telecommunication facility. When one reads the telecommunications determination, one gets the distinct impression that the legislatorâs intent is more concerned about the visual impactâthe colour, size and blending in with the surroundingsârather than any potential harmful emissions of radiation or health risks and other related injuries from long-term exposure to radiation.</para>
<para>This in turn raises the broader planning of same and other environmental laws. As members of the House are also aware, environmental laws are largely the purview of the residual constitutional jurisdiction of the states and territories. This residual jurisdiction includes those powers over planning, environment, heritage and other laws directly relevant to the policy objects of the determination. However, to add confusion to this matter, the Howard government has repeatedly made laws which trammel policy areas, which has the effect of making the administration of laws very muddy indeed. In particular, the use of Commonwealth constitutional telecommunications powers for the making of what is ultimately a determination relating to amenity is, I believe, very misplaced legislation.</para>
<para>The issue of amenity is not isolated in the policy bandwidth of environmental law and, for this reason, is better placed in Commonwealth and state environmental and planning laws; so too is the issue of âknocking outâ the application of well-established state and territory planning and environmental laws on a constitutional technicality where a facility is determined to be âlow impactâ. This is equally a negative use of Commonwealth law, deliberately designed by administrative construction to exclude the application of state and territory laws for the purpose of regulating these so-called âlow-impact facilitiesâ which, but for the Commonwealth telecommunications determination, would be âworksâ within the meaning of state planning law and, hence, subject to development approval.</para>
<para>Significantly, this is the very purpose of the New South Wales planning law. A critical part of the New South Wales planning law is the application of the precautionary principle, which I have spoken about a number of times in this place and which is enshrined in New South Wales legislation such as the Protection of the Environment Administration Act at section 6. It is legislation such as this which is excluded by a deliberate act of obfuscation in the making of this determination. The precautionary principle states that, where there is a risk of foreseeable, non-negligible risk of harm, then lack of full scientific certainty ought not be used as a pretext to justify the postponement of ameliorative measures to mitigate that harm.</para>
<para>For this reason, I call upon the Commonwealth government to agree that telecommunications towers construction be subject to full planning and development laws of the states and territories such that telecommunications towers be subject to development assessment. In doing so, the long-suffering people of my electorate, and indeed Sydney and right across Australia and elsewhere, who are driven to despair when they see telecommunications and mobile phone towers being constructed literally over their heads will have some redress to fairer and more equitable assessment of the size and location of these notorious towers.</para>
<para>Millions of Australians rely on their mobile phones and need adequate mobile phone coverage. While Commonwealth communications law has recently forced mobile phone companies to at least inform local councils and nearby residents when they install so-called âlow-impactâ facilities, I believe this does not go far enough. Regardless of assurances from phone companies regarding their safety, local residents and businesses deserve the right to object to the installation of any tower on health or environmental grounds. The government should act to stop mobile phone companies treating local residents with contempt, allow complaints to be heard before these towers appear and force mobile phone companies to co-locate these âlow-impactâ facilities at every opportunity.</para>

</talker>
<para>âIt is my privilege to speak today and to report to the House on some very interesting developments that have been happening in the great ongoing campaign to encourage the recycling of water in the Lockyer Valley and in the area of my electorate in south-east Queensland. This is something that I am very keen on, as I know other members areâI think including you, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams. We have been enthused over the years by the potential of projects for this region to use all or at least a large proportion of that great quantity of water coming out of the area of Brisbane, Ipswich and the Gold Coast for purposes other than just dumping it into the sea, with the opportunity to be able to increase agriculture in our region and to be able to recycle that water for all kinds of purposes.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I am naturally very interested in the potential for agricultural use. But this is not something that is important just from a farmerâs viewpoint; it is something that is absolutely important for everyone who lives in south-east Queensland. One thing that is bleedingly obvious is that the rate of growth in south-east Queensland is phenomenal. If we do not take great steps to preserve the environment of our south-east Queensland region, we run the risk of all the beautiful green belt, particularly through the Lockyer Valley, out west of Ipswich and right the way out to Toowoomba, disappearing under housing in the same way that the Redlands area has disappeared under housing over the years.</para>
<para>We do not want that. There are ample areas of outcropping hills and locations like that where urban development can occur, but we need to keep that beautiful green belt available for farming. In order to make it suitable for farming, we have to making farming in those areas profitable. We are not talking about a margin call here; it has to be very profitable because, if it is not, farmers will not have sufficient incentive to want to continue farming. It will be a much easier option to just subdivide, and there goes the ballgame.</para>
<para>At the weekend I attended a meeting that I thought at last showed that we are starting to make real progress in regard to recycled water. On this occasion I would like to pay credit to the effort now being put in by the state government. A little while ago the state government commented, âIf you want to be an agricultural user in the Lockyer Valley, perhaps we would look at selling you water out of Wivenhoeââthat is, water out of the drinking supply for Brisbane. Obviously, that was never going to happen. The state government appear to have come on board with the idea of recycling. They have got behind a very positive effort put in by the Ipswich City Council to explore options to recycle water out of Ipswich and the Oxley waste treatment centres, to take it to industry and to commercial users and, at the end of it all, to make that water available for agricultural use in our region.</para>
<para>It is important that we get that water to the farmers. They have been living a hand-to-mouth existence. Right now they are celebrating the lovely soaking rain that has fallen in that areaâbut, my God, rain is such a rare occasion that all it does is serve to underline just how tenuous the lifestyle of farmers currently is. To have rain these days is merely a reminder of how often they have not had rain. For that region we need something much better, and that comes in the form of recycled water. If we can get that water to the farmersâwater that is available when they turn on the tap, that goes to their crops, it can guarantee their livelihoodâthey can plan with real certainty to have a crop next time to market. It means that they can be sure about the quality of their crop. This is significant.</para>
<para>This meeting was under the auspices of the Lockyer Water Users Forum, ably headed up by Linton Brimblecombe and held in the Rosewood shire hall. Representatives of Enhance Management and the Moreton Rural Financial Counselling Serviceâwhich included Peter Corey and Rod Menziesâand Jim Kelly from ARRIS Management also attended. Those players are significant. Enhance Management are well known in Queensland because they are good at conducting surveys and at getting community feedback and that kind of thing. They are ideally located to be able to carry the message on recycled water back to the state government.</para>
<para>Jim Kelly is from Adelaide University. He is an expert in recycled water issues and he has been involved in the Virginia water scheme in South Australia for many years. His understanding of recycled water issues across the world is absolutely up to date. He is also an inspirational speaker, and he was very good at this meeting. It was attended by farmers from across the regionâthe people who are the potential users of this water, many of whom had their doubts and concernsâwho were looking to have some of those concerns answered. I think they were answered in spades, not only by the words from Jim Kelly but also by the figures given by Rod Menzies and Peter Corey. They gave an analysis of farming operations that I think just blew the minds of the people there. If you are used to existing on a subsistence levelâthe sort of hand-to-mouth existence of many of these farmers with small holdings who are currently experiencing the vagaries of poor rainfall and increasing salinityâissues such as this and the kinds of figures that came from Rod and from Peter on this occasion were spectacular.</para>
<para>With the support of the state government and the Ipswich City Council, these gentlemen have gone out and spoken to 50 different farming businesses across the Lockyer, Bremer and Warrill valley regions. They have gone to farmers in those areas and they have looked carefully at their farm businesses and at what could happen if those farms were moved from their current tenuous existence onto recycled water. The first thing that people ask is: âHow much have we got to pay for this water? How much is it going to cost us?â That is their overwhelming concern. Many of the people who are directly affected by this problem do not look deeper into the question of what the salinity of this water is compared to the kind of water they are currently surviving on. If you have water with a better salinity, does that mean that you can grow better crops? I can tell you that it certainly does mean that.</para>
<para>The bottom line from the figures given at this meeting was very interesting. Many of the farmers in my region have said: âWe cannot afford to pay more than $150 a megalitre for this water. We absolutely cannot; that is it. That is the bottom line.â The number that they have been talking about again and again is $150 a megalitre. Rod Menzies and Peter Corey are very good gents. These are guys who have for many years spent their time living cheek-by-jowl with local farmers, reviewing their farming operations and trying to offer them pointers on how to improve their operations. These guys are very well respected.</para>
<para>After their study of 50 different farms in this region to determine just what can be done with recycled water, they told the meeting yesterday that, assuming a price of $450 a megalitreâthat is the figure for an average farm in our areaâit was still possible for the gross profit margin to be exactly the same. That is spectacular. That was mind-numbing as far as the local farmers were concerned. It is something that beggars belief for them. The idea that you could afford to pay that much and still have a good level of profitability had not occurred to them in the past, but it shows the reality of the situation. It shows the great potential that lies ahead.</para>
<para>These meetings are occurring, because we are looking at the question of recycled water and we are looking at it seriously, now with the support of the state and with the support of Ipswich City Council. We are looking at it very closely. Throughout this week there will be a series of these shed meetings, where the findings of this research into farming profitability and the findings in relation to the health and safety standards that relate to recycled water will be relayed back to all these farmers, one after the other, throughout our region. At the end of it all we are seeking a commitment from people to take up the cause of recycled water, to look very closely at their operations and to put up their hands and be prepared to support the move to recycled water. It certainly represents the future of farming in our area and, in my view, it represents the future of our region because without it a lot of the very positive things we currently have in south-east Queensland will be lost.</para>

</talker>
<para>âI wish to bring to the attention of the House the plight of a constituent of mine, Mr Barry Tracy of Bouldercombe near Rockhampton. Mr Tracy worked for over 10 years for John Shiemer Earthmoving but during that time his employer did not pay Barryâs superannuation levy. Barry and his wife, Clare, contacted my office back in October 2004 and my staff put the Tracys in contact with the Australian Taxation Office.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As it turned out, the Tracys tax agent had, in fact, already contacted the tax office about the matter back on 8 July 2004 when the agent lodged a complaint regarding John Shiemer Earthmovingâs non-payments of Barryâs entitlements under the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992. Mr Tracy himself had raised the matter of non-payment of superannuation with the ATO as far back as 15 September 2003.</para>
<para>An amount of $12,622.65 owing to Mr Tracy was recovered from the employer in May 2004. At this point in the story, it is three cheers all around for the tax office in achieving that. However, it goes downhill from there for the tax office. This moneyâthe $12,000-oddâhas been held by the tax office since May 2004 and, despite the best efforts of all concerned, the tax office will not forward this money to Mr Tracyâs superannuation fund so that Mr Tracy, who has now retired, can access the money.</para>
<para>The frustration felt by Mr and Mrs Tracy has been exacerbated by the fact that all of their dealings with the ATO have had to be conducted over the telephone. This government closed the ATO office in Rockhampton, so it is no longer possible for the taxpayers of Central Queensland to go to their local tax office and sort their problems out face to face. The question is: where has this money been for the past year? In its media release of 30 July 2004, the ATO advised:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">A new computer system was put in place last Decemberâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">that is, December 2003â</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">to administer the new quarterly Super Guarantee legislation and to make direct payments to super funds of employee entitlements. ... We have had problems with the new system that have caused delays, particularly with cases involving unpaid entitlements from past years. We are working to rectify the systems problems as quickly as possible.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The ATO introduced a new computer system in December 2003 and now in June 2005, nearly two years later, the system is still not working, and it is my constituent who is caught in the middle. The Tracys have spoken to the ATO on a fortnightly basis without any success. My concern is: just how many other people like Barry Tracy are waiting for the ATO to get its system right before they receive the superannuation money that is rightfully theirs? One has to ask: what would happen if a major private institution, like a bank, had a computer system that did not work two years after installation? You just could not imagine it. Meanwhile, Mr Tracy is struggling to survive on a reduced pension. Centrelink have advised that, as Mr Tracy has some unused super, he is not entitled to the full pension. But of course, as I have just spelled out, it is not Mr Tracy but the Australian Taxation Office which is holding his moneyâand has been since May 2004.</para>
<para>Mr and Mrs Tracy have been advised on a number of occasions that the money is on its way, only to be disappointed every time. Mr Tracy was told in May this year that the money would be available to him in June. But Mr and Mrs Tracy have heard it all before so were not too disappointed when they received a call on 15 June, just last week, to be told that the money would not now come through until the end of July. On hearing the story of Mr and Mrs Tracy, how can anyone have confidence in the ATO? It is my intention to continue to pursue this matter until Barry and Clare Tracy receive their money from the tax office with every cent of interest that is owing to them as a result of this debacle.</para>
<para>I would also like to use this time today to raise another issue of concern to the residents in Capricornia. It relates to the possible use of depleted uranium, which has come into sharp focus at this time when 17,000 US and Australian troops are engaged in military exercises on our doorstep at Shoalwater Bay in Central Queensland. There is a broad recognition in this country of the strategic importance of Shoalwater Bay in building Australiaâs defence capability and the goal of interoperability with the United States forces. However, there is another equally important aspect of Shoalwater Bay and one that is particularly close to the heart of those of us fortunate enough to live within its reach. Shoalwater Bay is a natural treasure of immense beauty and environmental significance. For people living in Central Queensland, its protection has to be paramount and no shortcuts or âsheâll be right mateâ assurances can be good enough when questions of possible environmental degradation are raised.</para>
<para>There are a number of areas of concern when it comes to the environmental impact of military exercises on Shoalwater Bay and the land and sea adjacent to it. Concerns raised with me include the effect of marine sonar technology on marine mammals, including whales and dugong, and the general threat of land and water contamination. However, as more and more evidence emerges about the use of depleted uranium by the US military in both the Gulf War and the current Iraq war, and its potentially disastrous effects on Iraqi civilians and Defence Force personnel, alarm bells have been ringing in Central Queensland.</para>
<para>Residents are asking: âDo we really know what weapons have been used at Shoalwater Bay and what steps have been taken to ensure there is no contamination left behind?â The Citizens Against Depleted Uranium Group based on the Capricorn Coast, effectively in Shoalwater Bayâs backyard, has started asking those questions and educating the community about the dangers of depleted uranium. Well might they be concerned. There is a wealth of material about depleted uranium and its effects on humans and the environment. The following quote comes from the International Depleted Uranium Study Team:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Depleted uranium is the radioactive and highly toxic waste product that remains after natural uranium metal has been put through the âenrichmentâ process. The enriched uranium is used by the military and nuclear industries. The material left over is the depleted uranium.</para>
<para class="block">Depleted uranium is most commonly used in the military for armour plating for tanks and also for projectiles designed to penetrate heavy armour. It is also the basis of the bunker buster bombs used in the âShock and Aweâ campaign against Baghdad in 2003.</para>
<para class="block">In addition to its density depleted uranium is a pyrophoric metal. Thus when a projectile made of DU strikes a heavily armoured tank the force of impact causes the DU to ignite and burn at such an intense temperature that the projectile literally melts its way through the armour.</para>
<para class="block">In the process of this disintegration an aerosol of radioactive particles is produced. These can be inhaled and remain in the body for decades. In the same way depleted uranium can contaminate the air, soil and water around the explosion.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In the face of such sobering information coming out about these weapons, I believe it is quite reasonable for my constituents to be asking for more than just the bland assurances they have received so far from the Minister for Defence. As people who live in the shadow of Shoalwater Bay, who want to protect their families and their unique environment, they are asking for proof that they have nothing to fear. Although the Minister for Defence is on record as ruling out the use of depleted uranium in the current joint training exercise, Talisman Sabre 2005, that still leaves open the question of previous use at Shoalwater Bay. Senator Chris Evans asked that question of the minister, Senator Hill, in 2003, and his answers do not contain the kind of proof that my constituents require. Senator Evans asked:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Is the United States military permitted to transport munitions containing depleted uranium on Australian soil or within Australian waters?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The minister answered simply: âYes.â Senator Evans also asked:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Have munitions containing depleted uranium ever been used in exercises within Australia; if so, can a list be provided of the occasions on which such munitions were used, including the nature of the exercises?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The ministerâs answer was:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The ADF and its contractors have reviewed documents and data pertaining to the weapons used on Australian Training Areas and any requests from foreign forces for the use of depleted uranium munitions. No evidence of depleted uranium ammunition being used on Australian Training Areas was found. There are no available records of exact times and locations at which depleted uranium munitions were expended at sea.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">My constituents ask for more than that. I have a great deal of respect for the way this group of community minded people, the Citizens Against Depleted Uranium, have gone about their campaign. They are passionate about their cause but they have not sought to further it by grandstanding or through disruption. Instead, they have thoroughly researched the issue and have put forward five legitimate and reasonable requests to the government. They have put those forward in a letter to Senator Hill and I support them in making those requests. I ask the minister to respond by, among other things, agreeing to the testing of Shoalwater Bay for the use of depleted uranium and by giving a guarantee that weapons containing depleted uranium will not be used in Shoalwater Bay in the future.</para>

<para>âThe Australian governmentâs industrial relations proposals are quite obviously being welcomed by businesses large and small right around Australia. The proposals are welcome because businesses need them. They need them in order to start businesses, to have confidence in putting people on and to spend money on training those people. They are very happy about what this government is going to do for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is the fact that there is going to be a fairer system that will guarantee increased employment around Australia and maintain the rights of workers everywhere.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I can understand that the Labor Party would try to put a negative spin on this. After all, we are talking about their masters, the union leaders. We are talking about what they consider their core constituency, which is threatened with being irrelevant. As a party that is irrelevant of course they would oppose us and support the union leadership, but there is an enormous deception in the message being put out. The campaign being run by both the opposition and the unions is almost totally dishonest. They are trying to create division through fearâby misrepresentation, by making people believe their jobs are under threat and by making people believe that they will have no rights and will not be able to be represented. That is all totally untrue, as any fair-minded person who looks at the proposals would have to agree. But we are not dealing with people who are fair-minded. We are not, in this caseâespecially with what I am going to talk about this afternoonâdealing with people who have any intention of being fair-minded.</para>
<para>It is a factâand this has been consistently pointed out and is there for anybody to readâthat workers will still have the right, should they wish to do so, to be represented by a unionâto be represented by a collective voiceâand to have their conditions represented by a union or by a collective voice. They will have the right to have a unionist sitting down with them at any stage, should they wish to negotiate with their employer. They will also have the right, I am very proud to say, to negotiate on their own behalf or have someone help them do that. A workplace agreement will allow them to do that, be they miners, farm workers or teachers. Along with various other sectors the teachers union, the most vocal of all, are being totally dishonest when they say that certain things are threatened here and that we are not going to have teachers in places like Dubbo and Broken Hill. They are being totally dishonest, because if anybody wishes to take advantage of their own special skills, dedication to their work, honesty and ability to put more in than anybody else, they can take advantage of that under a workplace agreement.</para>
<para>It stuns me that anybodyâthe member for Murray-Darling or any union leaderâwould want to deny anyone who is or is not a member of their organisation the ability to sit down and negotiate one on one with an employer to improve their conditions. I find that incredible. It would, I guess, be amusing were it not for the fact that it is so frightening that people have far more concern about their union power and about having power over others than they are about helping those people help themselves.</para>
<para>As I said, employees can negotiate an Australian workplace agreement on their own, they can have someone do it for them or they can be represented collectively by a union or by somebody else. That is their choice. That is what these new proposals for industrial relations in Australia are about: choice and certainty for business. I know a lot of young people who would love to start their own businesses but who are simply not going to do it under current circumstances.</para>
<para>Leaving aside the fact that there will be recourse to the courts, as there is in any normal situation, why would any employerâand I guess I am referring here to some of the misconceptions and dishonest statements being put out by members of the opposition and union leaders when they talk about how many people are going to be unfairly dismissedâwant to sack someone for no good reason when they have spent the time and money that they must spend in order to train a person for a position today? There are almost no positions that do not have some kind of specialisation and that do not require some kind of training. Why would anybody want to go to the cost that that involves and then sack a person for no good reason? Suggesting that only shows that theyâthe opposition, union leaders and particularly the member for Murray-Darlingâhave absolutely no conception of the costs of running a business and the hassles of changing employees. Why in heavenâs name would anybody have any desire to do that for no good reason?</para>
<para>The member for Murray-Darling in the state government has now decided to enter the industrial relations debate in Broken Hill with a sensational headline predicting devastation for small business. It would be funny if it were not so serious. The Broken Hill Chamber of Commerce has totally rejected the proposition that the governmentâs measures will be devastating for business and it has rejected the state memberâs comments about all the extra work businesses will have to do. In fact, exactly the opposite is the truth. It will be much simpler. One industrial relations system throughout Australia is hardly going to make things more complexâobviously, the reverse will be true.</para>
<para>To try to portray the situation as being that small business in particularâand to some extent large businessâis in trouble with this legislation is laughable in Broken Hill, as it is elsewhere. I think the chamber of commerce has made it plain that the member for Murray-Darling is certainly not speaking for themâcertainly not on this issue anyway. There is no fear about this legislation among Broken Hill businesses. Who would you believe in this debate? The member for Murray-Darling more than anything else is trying to deflect criticism from himself and the state government he is a member of. That government is being criticised because of its withdrawal from drought support; because of the extra tax it is imposing on clubs in New South Wales, a tax the member for Murray-Darling is having trouble explaining; because of the transport troubles it is inânot supporting branch lines, taking money away from roads and from rail and spending it all in Sydney and then going broke, which they obviously are and having a budget deficit, which they obviously have. Why would the member for Murray-Darling be trying to make headlines out of this issue before us tonight? Simply because he and his government are in terrible trouble and have obviously no intention of doing anything for country New South Wales. He is trying, through fear and dishonesty, to pull down a system that business all over Australia wants and that will, in effect, create competition.</para>
<para>We are a government which has brought unemployment to record low levels right around this country. I think it is now about 29 years since we had unemployment at the current low level. The government is dedicated to economic prosperity for this country and to low unemploymentâwhich we have. The opposition, the member for Murray-Darling and the union leaders probably do not understand competition. If they understood competition, they would realise that the more competition there is for jobs the more employers will pay to have the right peopleânaturally, because they have to. That is what competition means. Whether it is employers looking for good employees, employees looking for good employers or simply a matter of reducing prices, competition delivers results to the people of Australia.</para>
<para>If they want to try to make out that this legislation is a problem, let them look to the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, where quite obviously it is the reverse. It is simple: wages are good and conditions are good. Long service leave, minimum wages and superannuation are all being safeguarded by these proposals. For anybody who thinks that this coalition government is not about being there for everybody and especially for the workers of Australia, how is it that under this government real wages have gone up by 14 per cent? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para class="block">The <inline ref="R2299">National Security Information Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline> adds another dimension to the current protections for security-sensitive information. Late last year the parliament passed the National Security Information (Criminal Proceedings) Act to protect information that may affect our national security if disclosed in federal criminal proceedings. That legislation was the subject of review by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. The government adopted several recommendations of that committee and made amendments to the legislation that were supported by the parliament after robust debate. The regime for protecting classified material in criminal proceedings is the product of that extensive scrutiny and debate. It is appropriate therefore that the regime for protecting sensitive information in civil proceedings resembles, as far as possible, the arrangements previously endorsed by the parliament. That is the purpose of this bill, and I am confident that the purpose has been achieved.</para>
<para>The bill was amended in the other chamber to provide criteria for courts to consider when considering whether to exercise the stay provision in the bill. The amendment was an opposition amendment that the government was prepared to consider and promptly accept in the spirit of cooperation and expediency. I encourage the members opposite to continue to work constructively with the government to develop workable solutions to policy challenges rather than referring this responsibility to a Senate committee as a matter of habit.</para>
<para>We will be unable to assess the full impact of the new arrangements for managing national security information in court proceedings until we see them in practice. That is why the government has undertaken to conduct a departmental review of the legislation and to provide a report to each house of parliament on the operation of the act after the end of three years from the date of the legislationâs commencement. The <inline ref="R2299">National Security Information Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline> adds another dimension to the current protections for security-sensitive information. I commend the bill, as amended by the Senate, to the House.</para>

<para>âThe opposition supports the amendment to the <inline ref="R2299">National Security Information Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline>. I think it is fair to say, without claiming credit, it has its genesis in a proposal that we put to the government in a cooperative senseâbut, again, having regard to recommendations from the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. It is almost like clockwork that when we do refer a bill to a committeeâand, in particular, quite complex national security legislationâthe current Attorney-General will say that it is a demonstration that we are prevaricating or weak on national security. That is invariably proved to be a hollow accusation, because invariably the committee comes back with sensible proposals. Some people may say it is wishful thinking on my part and others may say it is arrogance in predicting dangers for the government, but if the government assume that with a Senate majority from 1 July they will be the exclusive holders of wisdom in framing legislation then they will leave themselves open, at the very least, to a charge of arrogance and, at a more severe level, to a fall by way of an error or in not being connected with public opinion.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Our Senate committee system has been particularly effective because of a reasonable balance of membership, but I think the parliamentary committee system as a whole is really an unsung asset of the federal parliament. I know that some of my most fruitful years in the parliament have been spent participating in the committee system. Contrary to popular media, there is a lot of talent in the federal parliament both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. Contrary to public opinion and the popular media there is a lot of goodwill and determination to try to achieve legislation that is in the national interest, as opposed to simply party-political interests. While there was a clear indication from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing that the Attorney-General has been somewhat annoyed when these references to committees have occurred, where we can we have tried to expedite the committee process so that reports could be handed down without unduly delaying the legislative process. But people should not underestimate or devalue the contribution made by the committees.</para>
<para>In particular, in briefly addressing the issues in this case, the primary national security information legislation applying to criminal proceedings was in some ways more significantâwhether or not someone went to jailâbut in other ways it was easier to deal with because ultimately we kept the discretion of the actual trial court to govern the outcome of the proceedings and, in particular, to determine the restriction on the admissibility or form in which national security-sensitive information was to be admitted. Both sides of parliament preserved the full powers of the court, including the ability of the court to stay those proceedings.</para>
<para>As a number of experts who have been referred to in the Senate mentioned in their evidence to the committeeâagain, in the committee processâthat logic is not always convenient or practical in a civil proceeding because you may in fact be staying a proceeding by a citizen against a government and actually depriving a citizen of their rights. This amendment essentially gives some guidance to the court that, before they stay a proceeding, for instance, they should have regard to both the costs incurred by the litigant up to that stage and whether their order would deprive the litigantâand I am not using the precise wordsâof a likely or potential remedy. And there is a catch-all in the amendment of âany other matter the court considers relevantâ. The process was not lacking in merit. A reasonable outcome occurred, and we believe the legislation is better for having gone to the committee. A sensible proposal, ultimately refined with the expertise of the government, has been put forward which we are happy to accept and agree to as members of the opposition.</para>

<para>âThe <inline ref="R2404">Farm Household Support Amendment (Exceptional Circumstances Relief Payment) Bill 2005</inline> amends the Farm Household Support Act 1992 to give effect to some of the measures outlined in the 2005 drought assistance package announced by the Prime Minister. The major elements of the governmentâs package include more generous exceptional circumstances interest rate subsidies, with a revised assets testâand that measure accounts for $196.3 millionâa more generous income test for EC relief payments of $49.3 million; additional counselling and support services, totalling $8.98 million; a second round of Envirofund grants of $10 million, taken from existing appropriations; an extension of the streamlined reassessment process for those EC declared areas nearing the end of their second year of assistance and a review by the National Rural Advisory Council of areas not recommended for EC extension over the past year; and $3 million for the CWA. Most of the changes announced by the government can be made by ministerial direction, but this piece of legislation is necessary to provide for changes to the income test for EC relief payments. It provides an exemption of up to $10,000 from off-farm wages and salaries to a person and their partner as of 1 July 2005, and it also provides that in future a person seeking exceptional circumstances relief payments will make an application directly to Centrelink instead of to a state or territory rural adjustment authority.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Labor welcomes the measures announced by the Prime Minister on 30 May and welcomes the measures that are included in this piece of legislation. However, we are disappointed that it has taken so long for the government to make even this tentative start at reforming and improving drought policy. It is fair to ask why it has taken the government 10 years to come to this position. Many of the criticisms of drought policy have been around for many years, yet it has taken this long into the governmentâs several terms of office for the government to come to grips with some of the more substantial criticisms of its administration of drought policy. I make the point which I have made in previous debates: the government can find $6 million for useless advertising in the lead-up to an electionâindeed, that $6 million in the agriculture sector was part of a $100 million advertising package in place before the electionâand it can find $1 billion for a war in Iraq, yet it cannot get its drought policy right.</para>
<para>This is not the only major area of policy neglect we have seen from this minister and from this government. We can all remember the live exports debacle and the fact that the minister almost single-handedly brought the trade to its knees as a result of his neglect and incompetence. Of course, we have the current shambles in quarantine policyâa similar result of the ministerâs neglect. In that particular instance, we had legal actions by a major producer body, a trading mess and a scathing legal judgment on the administration of Australiaâs quarantine policy. Now we have substantial criticisms of the governmentâs administration of drought policy. The Auditor-General has recently issued a report that contains scathing criticism of the Howard governmentâs performance in relation to drought. I am pleased to see in the chamber the honourable member for Lyons, who will accompany me in this debate, and the honourable member for Ballarat. They have some very important points that they want to make about the administration of drought policy in this country.</para>

<para class="block">I understand that the honourable member for Lyons will be seconding that second reading amendment in the context of this debate. As I pointed out, the Auditor-General has recently issued a report that contains scathing criticism of the Howard governmentâs performance in relation to drought. It is especially critical of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestryâs department in its contingency planning for and response to drought. The Auditor found:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF) did not have a specific preparedness or contingency plan for drought, notwithstanding previous recommendations made by a Taskforce of Australian and State and Territory Government officials to this effect.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I find it incomprehensible and beyond belief that in 2005 the Auditor-General could make this sort of conclusion about the ministerâs department and the administration of drought policy in this country. It is a damning indictment of the ministerâs administration of his portfolio area that in a country as dry as Australia, where droughts are common, he has made no contingency plans for dealing with drought.</para>
<para>The Auditor also found that while the department did identify risks and problems associated with the delivery of EC assistance, there were:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... no specific treatment strategies identified, corresponding to these risks. Nor did risk plans identify the possibility that substantial additional measures might be needed ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So we had 45 per cent of Australia drought declared and 85 per cent of one of Australiaâs most important agriculture producing states, New South Wales, had been drought declared for several years, and the Auditor says, ânor did any plans identify the possibility that substantial additional measures might be needed.â That was reflected in the budget measures that the government brought down. It is no wonder that the minister seriously underestimated the impact of the drought in this yearâs departmental budget. His department had no plans and did not even understand that additional measures might be needed.</para>
<para>The Auditor also found that there was no whole-of-government implementation plan and no integrated communication strategy. It is little wonder that the Auditor came to that conclusion, because the minister has gone out of his way to abuse the state governments who have been involved in the front line in assisting farmers to cope with drought. He also found serious problems in documentation by the department. There were gaps in some documentation on files and the maps used for EC declarations did not line up with the areas described in press releases announcing EC assistance. Can you believe that in 2005, after 10 years of this governmentâs administration of drought policy, the Auditor could come up with these sorts of substantial criticisms? This is a scathing indictment of the Howard governmentâs administration of drought policy in this country.</para>
<para>Despite the bleating by members opposite on how much the government has allocated to drought, allocation is one thing; giving farmers access to the funds is another. We see this in various programs that this government administers in the agriculture sector. From sugar to drought, the government makes great play of the amount of money that it allocates. Some years down the line, when you examine exactly what has been accessed, you will find that it is a different story altogether. No wonder the Auditor found that many farmers find the whole process of applying for drought assistance very confusing. The minister has presided over serious failures in the administration of drought policy by his department. It seems that under the Howard government the delivery of drought assistance has been characterised by poor planning and poor administration. They are not my words but the conclusions of the Auditor-General.</para>
<para>When I view this package, there is one particular area where I am pleased to see a small increase in the funding. It is the funding for the Rural Financial Counselling Service, which was given additional funding as part of this package. The Rural Financial Counselling Service provides a wonderful service on very limited resources in very trying conditions. The additional funding is welcomed, but it does not address the concerns of the service itself or of farmer organisations about the long-term viability of this service. It is time that the government bit the bullet and announced secure, long-term funding for this service at a level that will allow counsellors to get on with the job of helping farm families and communities, without having to worry about the long-term future of the service and going to the government every year with a begging bowl, so that the basic expertise and infrastructure can be kept in place to meet contingencies such as prolonged drought.</para>
<para>I am also concerned that there is nothing in the exceptional circumstances arrangements that would help farm families complete a thorough assessment of the long-term, ongoing viability of the enterprise. I am thinking of the sort of assistance that is currently available under the Farm Help program to access the service of a professional accountant skilled in assessing farm businesses and assisting with forward planning. There would be considerable benefit in allowing farmers to access this sort of assistance at a much earlier stage than is available under current arrangements.</para>
<para>The measures announced by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry on 30 May in the main dealt with making it a bit easier for farmers to access drought relief once an area has been drought declared. It is disappointing to me that the government has not also gone back a step and reviewed the measures in place to help farmers prepare for the eventuality of drought. The government has placed great store in the Farm Management Deposits Scheme as the centrepiece of its efforts to help farmers prepare for drought. In fact, the agriculture minister mentioned the Farm Management Deposits scheme in his press release of 30 May 2005, when he announced the package that we are discussing here today. This is a very important scheme that has proven invaluable for many farm families as they have struggled through the recent dry years.</para>

<para>âCorrect, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services has stated. But it is a bit rich for the parliamentary secretary, the minister and the government to claim credit for the scheme. The scheme is in many important respects the successor to the arrangements that operated under the former Labor government from at least 1992. These arrangements included the Income Equalisation Deposit Scheme and the Farm Management Bond Scheme as well as a provision for tax averaging. The Farm Management Deposits scheme was not a new initiative by the Howard government but basically a rebadging of Labor policy. We need to get that very clear.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The Howard government can rightly claim credit for two actions related to the ability of farmers to prepare for drought. It can claim credit for axing the drought investment allowance. Tax deductibility for investment in increased drought preparedness was introduced by the former Labor government to help farmers and give them more incentive to prepare their enterprises to cope with drought. In a very short-sighted decision in 1997, this important initiative was scrapped by the Howard government. It was none other than the current leader of The Nationals, John Anderson, who was agriculture minister in 1997, who axed this very important allowance.</para>
<para>The government can claim credit for another very short-sighted decision. Just before Christmas last year, the government decided to reject the proposal for a cooperative research centre for climate risk technologies. Such a CRC could have played an important role in helping farmers prepare much better for severe drought events. The primary focus of the proposed CRC was to have been to convert our understanding of Australiaâs complex climatic systems into easy-to-use products for farm businesses and rural communities to integrate into farm business catchment and regional planning. In this very dry continent of ours, this sort of research is absolutely vital if our farmers and rural communities are to prepare adequately for drought. By rejecting the proposal, the Howard government has deprived farmers and communities of the essential tools that they need for their businesses to survive in the long term in Australiaâs harsh climate. In a press release dated 22 December 2004, the National Farmers Federation had this to say about it:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The future ability of Australian farmers to prepare for severe droughts and climatic events suffered a major setback yesterday when the Federal Government yesterday rejected the application to establish a Co-operative Research Centre for Climate Risk Technologies ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Mr Charles Burke of the National Farmers Federation had this to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Farmers can be justifiably disappointed with the short-sighted decision of the CRC Selection Committee to reject the CRC for Climate Risk Technologies bid ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Mr Burke also said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... in reviewing Australiaâs National Drought Policy over the past 18 months, NFF, industry groups and governments had agreed that future policy must focus on improved drought preparedness and on providing farmers with practical tools to better manage severe drought and climate risks.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">There we have it from the National Farmers Federation about one recent decision of the government that has not found favour with the sector and that has certainly done nothing to assist farmers to prepare long term for drought.</para>
<para>It is clear that the Howard government has not done enough to help Australiaâs farmers prepare for drought over the past 10 years. The government has been in power for over a decade, yet there are still yawning gaps in drought policy. That has been acknowledged by the NFF, by farmers themselves and by industry organisations. Farmer organisations, including the National Farmers Federation, have long criticised the current drought assistance arrangements as having restrictive eligibility criteria, an unnecessary and complex declaration system and discriminatory support measures resulting in more dollars finishing up in bureaucracies than in farmersâ pockets.</para>
<para>Labor have long agreed with the NFF that improvements are needed to the way drought relief is structured and the way it is delivered. We are pleased that in some of the measures that the government has included in this package those problems have been addressedâbut not all, and certainly the issue of the long-term drought preparedness of the sector needs more work. We have long agreed with the NFF that there need to be changes to drought policy. The Howard government first promised drought reform more than five years ago. Since then, it has announced breakthroughs in numerous press releases from the agriculture minister. There are titles such as âDrought policy reform breakthroughâ, 13 April 2005; âHeadway made on streamlining ECâ, December 2004; âProgress on drought reformâ, May 2004; âNational drought policy: the way aheadâ, April 2004; âTruss offers way forward on exceptional circumstances policyâ, 5 March 2001; and âFederal government seeks to make EC support fairer and more workableâ, on 1 May 2002. We have had a lexicon of press releases announcing the progress on drought reform, yet we have had substantial criticisms by the National Farmers Federation and we have had the comments that I have just alluded to by the Auditor-General.</para>

<para>âI would certainly be happy to do that in the context of the debate if I get to that area. The parliamentary secretary, the honourable member for Parkes, is really echoing the sort of mantra that his minister has: when you fail in policy you blame the Labor states. That is an old, worn mantra from the conservative side. I challenge you to address the issues in the Auditorâs report. If you want to intervene in this debate, go to the audit report, because after 10 years it tells you exactly where the government has been on drought policy. The honourable member for Parkes was a farm leader before he came into this parliament. He knows the situation from both sides of the fence and I find it quite extraordinary that he would make the comment that he has about state government administrations when in fact he knows, as the NFF knows and as the Auditor-General knows, that this has been a substantial area of policy failure by the government.</para>

<para>Let us go to the 2005 budget. At the time of this budget, the government demonstrated that it had no interest in drought reform and no real understanding of the impact of the current drought on Australian farmers. The 2005-06 budget papers show an estimated expenditure on exceptional circumstances assistance in 2004-05 of $131.9 million and a budget allocation for 2005-06 of only $59.2 millionâa cut of $72.7 million. It is not as though the government was not warned about the seriousness of the situation. Labor understands that on 15 April 2005â3Â½ weeks before the budget was handed downâthe agriculture minister was briefed by the Bureau of Meteorology at a meeting of the Primary Industries Ministerial Council and was told that the first quarter of this year was the second driest on record and that another El Nino event was likely this year. This was almost certainly not the only time in the lead-up to the budget that the government was warned about the increased likelihood that the drought would get worse, but either the government ignored the warnings or the agriculture minister failed to pass them on to his cabinet colleagues. In any case, a number of newspaper articles repeating the same warnings from the bureau appeared at about the same time. For example, a piece by Asa Wahlquist along these lines appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> of 21 April.</para>
<para>One Labor commitment that has been picked up by the Howard government has been to work with the states to remove the requirement that the majority of farmers in an area seeking drought assistance prove a severe downturn in income and to replace it with a new criterion based on the impact of drought on production. Under this option, the assessment of the impact of the drought on farm incomes would be considered on an individual basis after a region was declared to be in drought. The implementation of this national production monitoring system is now being considered. At least on this one issue the minister has been able to work with state governments. Might I say, he has been able to work with them on little else. I encourage the minister to continue to pursue the development of this important Labor policy and I encourage the minister to continue working with the states and territories to develop a real national approach to drought reform.</para>
<para>Despite the recent rains across significant parts of Western Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and parts of South Australia and Queensland, around 45 per cent of Australian farmland is currently drought declared. In New South Wales, the figure is closer to 85 per cent, as I mentioned previously. Some of the most productive areas of Queensland are also in drought, as are parts of Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia. In fact, large parts of New South Wales, southern Queensland and northern Victoria have been in drought since late 2002 or the early part of 2003. A significant number of families in these regions have had little or no income derived from their properties for three years in a row. The recent rains in Western Australia have considerably relieved the situation there and crop forecasts for that state are now positive, and the rains in the Eastern States have allowed some farmers to get a crop in and to at least have a chance of receiving some sort of income this year.</para>
<para>However, for many the outlook still remains bleak. The Bureau of Meteorology has advised that the first quarter of 2005 was the second driest on recordâonly the first quarter of 1965 was drier. In addition, it has been the hottest start to the year, with temperatures right across the continent 1.7 degrees above normal. The second hottest was 1998, when temperatures were only 1.3 degrees above normal. Each year since 2002 has been classed as a dry year, with rainfall below the historical norm. The agencies responsible for long-range climate forecasts in Australiaâthe Bureau of Meteorology, CSIRO and the Queensland climate centreâuse a variety of models to make rainfall projections for the rest of the year. The overwhelming consensus of all these models is that we are in for a hotter and drier than average year over most of the continent, especially in the east and the south-east.</para>
<para>That advice was available to the minister before the preparation of the budget, yet the government cut exceptional circumstances funding in that budget. In recent reviews, the forecasters have stated that they now think that there is a 50 per cent chance of average or slightly better than average rains over winter this year. However, this also means that there is a 50 per cent chance of lower than average rains over winter, and the longer term projections still indicate another dry year. Most of the models used rely to a greater or lesser extent on measurements of the southern oscillation index, a measure of the so-called El Nino effect. There is a strong consensus that the likelihood of a full-blown El Nino is still at least 50 per cent. The situation going into this El Nino event is even more precarious than it was back in 2002, when only two per cent of farmland was actually drought declared compared with 45 per cent across Australia today. Those climate projections are concerning, and the issue of long-term drought preparedness is one which the sector must now face in a very real way.</para>
<para>I have stated before in debate that there are many in this chamber who have experienced first hand the impact of drought on their farm enterprises, their families and their communities. My own family experience with these effects of drought is vivid to me; we went through the drought conditions that occurred in the Western District of Victoria in the late 1960s. In many ways those impacts have not changed, although for some farmers who have been able to plan both financially and resource-wise these effects have to a degree been ameliorated. But for many other farmers, persistent dry periods and lack of rain, which in some areas has run into years, have put intolerable pressure on the viability of their farm enterprises and seriously affected their long-term sustainability.</para>
<para>The social, economic and environmental effects of prolonged drought can be quite profound. At the drought summit I attended in Parkes, which was attended by the honourable parliamentary secretary and other members of this House, I heard first hand the social impacts the drought was having on farm families and relationships within those families and the utter desperation of many farmers who are viewing the rapid erosion of the equity base in their farms as they struggle financially with massive downturns in their farm income. Poverty and stress point to a deep social crisis in rural Australia as a result of the drought. I could go on about the economic impacts of drought on this nationâthey are substantialâbut my time in this debate is running out. I have moved my second reading amendment and I ask the honourable member for Lyons to second that amendment. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI am very pleased to be speaking on the <inline ref="R2404">Farm Household Support Amendment (Exceptional Circumstances Relief Payment) Bill 2005</inline> because it implements the measures contained in the Prime Ministerâs statement of 30 May this year outlining an additional $254 million in assistance to our farmers who are battling in the current drought conditionsâas they have been for several years. The exceptional circumstances scheme does deliver real support to our farming community. The exceptional circumstances assistance is a bit like democracyâit is not perfect but it is the best we have and it is a whole lot better with the changes announced by the Prime Minister in May this year.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Democracy, I suppose, could have perhaps put Mark Latham in the Lodge but that does not mean we have to get rid of the concept. Imagine Mr Latham as Prime Minister during the drought. He is the man who rallied against agriculture and rural life whilst in opposition. Farmers should be thanking their lucky stars that he is not. He said things like:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Agriculture is very good at socialising its losses and privatising its profits.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... if agriculture in this country is so efficient then why does it need such a high level of business welfare?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">These quotes spring to mind immediately for country people because they do not forget a party, an opposition leader and a tradition within the Labor Party of ignoring rural Australia. I was slightly surprised at some of the questioning of the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry at the announcement of the governmentâs assistance package. It seems that some journalists as well as the Labor Party have an obsession with what they termed âmarginal landâ and with the idea that farmers should effectively be taken off it if they cannot make a go of it. They were proposing that this should happen even in times of drought.</para>
<para>This might be trendy, popular thinking in the inner suburbs of capital cities but the reality on land in rural Australia is something markedly different. We need farmers and we certainly need young farmers for our future. For some reason farming has a bad name amongst some city dwellers and they do not realise the importance of farming to the whole community. The Deputy Prime Minister made a good point when he commented on a farmer who left his land vacant for 15 years. Over that time it inevitably became a great haven for wild animals, noxious weeds and other introduced species. This is not news and it is not a surprise to those of us who live in rural Australia.</para>
<para>A very similar situation has occurred in Victorian national parks where there is a process, sadly, under the current state Labor government of locking parks up and leaving them alone. This mentality not only led to the tragic events of providing additional fuel for the fires of 2003, which burnt over 900,000 hectares in my electorate in north-east Victoria, but also reminded people living in country Victoria again of the fact that we are out of sight therefore we are out of mind. We have the greatest environmental problems in rural and regional Australia, certainly in Victoriaâpest animals, wild dogs and noxious weedsâyet very little effective targeting is pursued by the state government, very little funding is providedâin reality reduced fundingâto tackle these serious problems.</para>
<para>God help you if you are a farmer who has land adjoining a national park in Victoria. You may as well lock the farm up and leave it because you deal single-handedly with the problems of the adjoining negligent landowner. Land does need to be managed and our farmers are innovative in doing so. The north-east of Victoria has taken a leading role in farming techniques through many schemes, particularly through our local Landcare groups.</para>
<para>I want to talk briefly about the Victorian governmentâs approach to drought. The measures we debate today are not at all contingent on the Victorian government doing more. Thank goodness, I hear so many farmers across Victoria shout. Only recently we had the spectacle of Premier Bracks and Mr Brumby visiting country Victoria as if drought were some sort of new phenomenon. The Victorian government thought that the drought ended in 2003. That is why they cut the drought assistance package on 7 May 2003, a very dark day for the farming community in Victoria. They went into hiding for two years and perhaps their re-emergence may have something to do with the fact that they know that the charade is up in rural and regional Victoria. Rural and regional Victorians know that the Bracks Labor government abandoned them and punished them, and very soon they will have an opportunity to pass judgment on that particular government.</para>
<para>We also look at New South Wales where the member for Corio decried the criticism of the state Labor government. But let us look at the facts. The New South Wales budget does provide some funding for drought assistance, but the Commonwealth government spends in two weeks what the New South Wales government has allocated for a whole year. That is a fact. It may be unpalatable but that is where it stands. This government, through its actions and financial contribution, its continual reform and innovation and its listening to people who provide financial and welfare services on the ground, is continually making changes and additions to provide support and assistance for drought preparedness and other assistance. This bill contains some of those new, innovative measures.</para>
<para>The member for Corio talks about reform. I hasten to suggest to the member for Corio that perhaps reform should start at home. The greatest reform that the member for Corio can engage in is reform of the Labor Party structure, particularly in Victoria where we all know and we have seen in recent reports that branch stacking is corroding the very core of the party. That is what the Australian people demand when they want an effective opposition.</para>

<para>âI will get back to most poignant parts of the bill. I can understand why the member for Ballarat is particularly upset. It is a touchy subject and, hopefully, the forces of good and light and decent Labor Party members will prevail in the Victorian Labor Party. The main components of the more generous exceptional circumstances interest rate subsidies and a substantial increase in the off-farm assets tests are particularly welcome. There will be a more generous income test as well for exceptional circumstances payments.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Importantly, although not the most expensive part of the package, there will be increased counselling and support services, something that I know a lot of people in my area will have benefited from and will continue to benefit from. There will also be another Enviro Fund round and a reassessment of areas not recommended by the NRAC over the last year, along with increased funding for the Country Womenâs Association to assist them in meeting the needs of local communities, a role they carry out with great dignity and awareness. Their great contribution to supporting farming families, particularly in times of drought, and providing extra support to rural communities at all times is something that may be mocked by the trendies who sit in their inner city cafes in Melbourne, but let me tell you that, as someone who lives in a rural community, I understand the very great contribution that the Country Womenâs Association makes and I applaud their national organisation and my local organisations.</para>
<para>On the weekend north-east Victoria and my electorate received some very good rainfalls. It is early days yet but if the views of a long-range forecaster, Wangarattaâs own John Moore, are correct we are due for some good rain in the futureâand my electorate can certainly do with it. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline> In conclusion, I commend the bill and the reforms it contains and wholeheartedly suggest to the member for Ballarat that she joins her colleague the member for Corio in supporting not only this bill but also his preselection.</para>

<para>âI have already seconded the amendment to the second reading of the <inline ref="R2404">Farm Household Support Amendment (Exceptional Circumstances Relief Payment) Bill 2005</inline> which my colleague the member for Corio has moved. We believe the amendment is needed because the scope of this bill is too little, too late and, of course, not budgeted for. The drought situation in Australia is really bad and likely to get worse. The relief payment is very necessary and probably well overdue for many families. It seems, though, that this government ignored it in the budget and had to be dragged kicking and screaming to allocate funds to suffering farmers.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Why wasnât it considered in the budget? Most people know that around 45 per cent of Australiaâs farmland is currently drought declared and in New South Wales the figure is closer to 80 or 85 per cent. Other regions also have significant drought areas including Victoria, South Australia and WA. Although Tasmania has not got to a drought stage yet, northern and eastern Tasmania are very dry. Some of these areas have been dry since 2002. The Met bureau has advised that the first quarter of 2005 was the second driest on record. Additionally, it was hotter than ever recorded, with temperatures around the continent 1.7 degrees above normal. But we knew this and we can predict through a number of different sorts of modelling that we are going to go on being dry for a lot longer yet. So although the government has provided some bandaid reliefâand I know it is much neededâwhat is going to happen in the future?</para>
<para>As with the water policy, drought was being discussed by this government five or six years agoâand since then there have been lots of conferences, roundtables, papers and discussions, but nothing seems to be happening to develop a proper strategy to deliver a more permanent answer. We have to look at this in a strategic way, taking into account the signals of climate change as they are now. We have to plan a little for the future and understand that perhaps we need to look at farming practices, at how we can start the drought-proofing process and at how to encourage farmers to consider their farm plans in light of changing circumstances.</para>
<para>One who has been following this debate as well as working on water issues is Professor Peter Cullen. His article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on Monday, 30 May is worth considering. He understands the farmersâ ethos; he knows what a desperate time it is when farmers have to watch sheep weaken and die, when they can no longer afford to buy fertiliser or food or when they battle to meet interest payments on borrowed money from banks, as most farmers have to. In the article, Peter said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It is likely that our climate is changing and that many of our agricultural areas are likely to become hotter and drier.</para>
<para class="block">Blanket solutions are not likely to be effective, andâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">he suggestedâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">governments and communities need to start working together to develop solutions for each region.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The other point he made that we really do have to address is:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Some of the marginal low-rainfall areas into which we have pushed farming in the good years will never be viable and we should stop pretending that handouts each year will solve this problem.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">History has told us this. It goes back a long wayâGeorge W. Goyder was the first one to challenge the wisdom of going into marginal lands. He was a well-respected surveyor of South Australia from 1861 to 1893 who spent most of his life wandering around South Australia and the Northern Territory and experienced the shattering disappointment of drought. Goyderâs line of rainfall indicated the limit of the rainfall which coincided with the southern boundary of saltbush country. It separated lands suitable for agriculture from those fit for pastoral use only. It also marked areas of reliable and unreliable annual rainfall. When agricultural land became scarce, combined with good seasons and crops during the early 1870s, the expected income of land sales persuaded the government to disregard the line and allow farmers to buy land north of it. Farming outside Goyderâs line is still very risky, but also inviting, especially after good rains. The main problems of the past were not the land or climate but smallholdings and poor farming techniques. Cullen went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">In each region we should critically examine the wealth that has been created by agriculture each year during the last 20 years, and compare it with the costs, the direct costs of government subsidies, and the indirect costs of land degradation being worn by all of us. In some areas, I suspect it just will not add up.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Cullen pointed to Goyder as an example:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Despite the warnings of 19th century surveyor George Goyder, who said it could not be sustained farming pushed beyond these sustainable limits.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Then there were three or four good years when farmers opened up new lands and governments continued their developments, spreading out into the hinterland of the towns. So what happened when the normal weather patterns returned? As was noted, everyone went broke and they walked away from the land. If we leave it to the market to sort out those farms that are viable and those that are not, there will be a lot of hurt. It is a brutal process.</para>
<para>So what should be done? Peter Cullen thinks that the most unsustainable areas will revert to larger pastoral properties and therefore will not support the number of people trying to make a living from the landscape. But since these areas have been cleared, and fertilisers, weeds and feral animals have been introduced, the land still has to be managed. Governments and farmers cannot just walk away. There should be some method of helping farmers off the most marginal land and putting in place a stewardship program so that land already degraded has a chance of recovery. There needs to be some financial assistance to allow this to happen without breaking the farmers.</para>
<para>We need new ideas and we need government to support innovation. This is where this government and this minister have failed abysmally. They have done nothing about activating recommendations from two recent parliamentary water inquiries. In fact, they have not even bothered to give a response. That is a shameful way to treat the work of a committee and all the people who made submissions to it.</para>
<para>Recently, the Deputy Prime Minister was seen supporting Peter Andrews on <inline font-style="italic">Australian Story</inline>. You might remember that Peter Andrews was a racehorse breeder and farmer credited with remarkable success in converting degraded, salt-ravaged properties into fertile, drought-resistant pastures. His methods are at odds with conventional scientific wisdom, but now many are sitting up and taking notice of his methods, and the process is proving to be a winner. But the poor fellow went broke because, although the Minister for Transport and Regional Services thought his farming process had a lot of a merit, the minister did not pitch in to get some research funds to keep this man goingâand maybe prevent many farmers in New South Wales and Victoria from being quite so affected by drought. The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services has failed againânot a good record! No wonder the he is looking to get out of parliament soon. The ABCâs <inline font-style="italic">Australian Story</inline> brought up many important issues and possible solutions that go far beyond anything the ministerâs department has offered.</para>
<para>By all means, get on with helping families with the exceptional circumstances payment, but for goodness sake, get on with searching for some solutions. Australia is running out of time for messing about with bandaid measures. We must do research and we need to talk to people like Peter Andrews to see whether he is right. Let us get some departmental people out in the field to help him promote his method and test the areas. And pay the poor manâhe cannot go on living on fresh air. It is just not fair of the government to say they support him and then ignore his plight.</para>
<para>Some areas are more able to cope by using this process than others, so we need many other solutions, including letting some of the land revert to natural growth with supported, careful husbandry. So I support the amendments to this bill as they address many of the points I have been making about the failures by this government, which is living on a reputation of splurging money on simplistic things and ignoring the real needs of our communities.</para>

<para>âI was not going to enter into this second reading debate on the <inline ref="R2404">Farm Household Support Amendment (Exceptional Circumstances Relief Payment) Bill 2005</inline> during the short time available but the member for Lyons has spoken a lot about Professor Peter Cullenâs contribution to the debate on this matter. I do not understand how we can take seriously Professor Cullen, who asserted that it takes 22,000 litres of water to grow a kilogram of rice, when he was wrong and has done serious damage to this great industry. In fact, it takes between 1,500 and 1,900 litres to grow a kilogram of rice. If Professor Cullenâs views were correct it would take more than the water that is available in the Murray-Darling Basin just to grow the rice in my electorate. So I do not see that he has an enormous amount of credibility in many of these debates. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline>

<para>I will now move to the more important issues and matters around this incredibly important bill. Todayâs farmer is increasingly, and somewhat unfairly, expected to be a large-scale landscape gardener, a park ranger and a manager of urban water catchments, all for free. These are the words of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestryâand he is right. A recent report commissioned by the Australian Farm Institute found that agricultureâs contribution to our countryâs economy is almost four times as much as is it generally credited with. The agriculture and food sector remains an important driver of Australiaâs economic activity. Primary production especially is the lifeblood of a healthy rural Australia. The national land and water resources audit has revealed that productivity growth has not come at the expense of the national resource base, with the fertility of our land actually increasing. It has been indicated that some of our farmers have move into marginal areas and simply cannot survive there, but many areas have been thriving and prosperous under farming activity.</para>
<para>The initiative and drive of the nationâs farmers has underwritten the sectorâs profitable expansion and continues to reshape the mix of farm goods that we produce, highlighting rural Australiaâs flexibility, resilience and diversity. But, as the minister for agriculture has always recognised, our industries face many traditional challenges. Declining terms of trade; highly competitive and interconnected global markets; changing consumer preferences; protectionist international trading policies; and a natural resource base that imposes land, water and climatic limits on expansion are just a few of the familiar issues. But we must move past the familiar issues to the issue that many are not able to cope withâthat is, this extraordinary drought. I would like to quote a farmer in my electorate. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">1. We are not just farmers. We are family owned businesses. Some of us have survived and prospered for 100 years or more. But after all these years my generation is looking like the one that will fail due to this critical prolonged drought.</para>
<para class="block">2. Family farms are the most efficient. Farmers in Australia are very proud people and in most cases the best managers of our most precious resource our land. Big corporate owned farms cannot farm like us.</para>
<para class="block">3. We have provided for normal drought by storing feed and developing water storage on farms with dams, tanks and pipelines. All at a huge cost, but it goes to make us self-sufficient. We have put aside money where possible to sustain us in normal times of drought. I have worked through two droughts and survived but this one is going to break me.</para>
<para class="block">4. This drought is like no other in historyâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">What we are dealing with is like nothing else in historyâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It has gone on for so long it has wiped out all we have done to prepare. Little feed left, little water left, sold off stock and no money in most cases we are at the limit of our borrowing.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is why, when I and the member for Parkes welcomed the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister to our electorates to look at the farms ravaged by droughtâwhich no amount of management and good planning can compensate forâit was refreshing to see a real-time response which will enable farmers to be as resilient through this year of drought as they have been in the past 100 years. The Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister met with two very good groups in my electorate. They met a group led by Coral Russell; they met Bill Thompson and Tony Paton from the rural counselling service; and they met my other rural counsellor, Peter Gerarde-Smithâall of whom know exactly what it is like to be devastated in this area. To see the response to that meeting was typically gratifying for me. Hopefully, many of my farmers will now be able to go forward and not feelâafter three, four, five or six generations in farmingâthat they are the failures and the ones who will have to walk off properties that are not in marginal areas.</para>
<para>We have problems associated with graphs and statistics which, in my electorate, have shown that 2003 was perhaps a better year than 2001-02 or 2004-05. Those graphs are very deceiving, because two large falls in February and December 2003 contributed 46.5 per cent of our total rain received. However, these falls were outside the growing season for the 2003 cereal crop so, whilst there may have been a small amount of relief in some pasture growth, there was no real benefit from those rains. In fact, that rainfall served to do only one thing: distort annual rainfall activity and graphs. It had no bearing on our cropping or productivity, and therefore no bearing on the economy of the farmers and the communities that rely on them.</para>
<para>As the member for Riverina, I am very thankful for the drought assistance package that is before this House. I am very grateful to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Warren Truss, the Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, and the Prime Minister, John Howard, for at least taking the time to come out to my electorate to listen to people and to look at and discuss the very real issues that these farmers are confronting through absolutely no fault of their own. Nobody has been able to manage for this drought. The government has tried to respond in a very real wayâand it will respond. It certainly will improve the lives of many of my farmers and many of my community members. It is true that our rural economy is declining simply because of the problems associated with this drought but Minister Truss has responded with over and above what was expected.</para>
<para>My farmers were so busy trying to survive with no staff or assistance on their properties, given their very significant plight, that many of them forgot to or did not think to put in for their exceptional circumstances interest rate subsidy by the closing date for applications. The minister responded after my representations so, for those areas where the EC declarations cease prior to 30 May 2005 or expired 28 days prior to the notification to state and territory ministers of revised guidelines, those applicants were able to get a 28-day grace period for them to put in their application. I thanked the minister for this, something that has been well and truly appreciated at this very difficult time. When I put out the press release that welcomed the additional drought support for the farmers, producers and rural communities that I represent, I was overwhelmed. I am very thankful for any help that I can give to the people that I represent because, purely and simply, they deserve it. Nobody deserves help more than the people that I represent and nobody should have to gain their stripes in something as so unrelenting as this drought. I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para>âThe <inline ref="R2404">Farm Household Support Amendment (Exceptional Circumstances Relief Payment) Bill 2005</inline> amends the Farm Household Support Act 1992 to give effect to some of the measures in the 2005 drought assistance package announced on 30 May 2005. You would think by the way the government are talking that the drought has caught them by surpriseâthat suddenly, a scant few weeks after a budget that promised over $22 billion worth of spending, it has suddenly dawned on them that the drought is still actually going on. The governmentâs handling of the worst drought on record has smacked of absolute incompetence. The government have failed to take heed of the warnings of their own experts and to plan for the prolonged nature of the drought. They cut funding in the budget for the exceptional circumstances program and then, some three weeks later, had to put a new relief package in place. The government have failed to manage the exceptional circumstances application process in a timely and transparent way, and farmers continue to be hampered by red tape as they try to access the program. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, the Bureau of Meteorologyâs National Climate Centre and the Queensland Centre for Climate Applications have all been warning that the last five years have been amongst the driest on record and that there is no evidence that the situation is likely to improve in the long term. Drought is not new to this country: it is a problem farmers have had to contend with since the late 1880s. Australia has experienced several severe and prolonged droughts. They include the Federation Drought of 1895-1902; the 1914-15 drought, the World War II droughts between 1937 and 1945, the 1982-83 drought, and the El Nino associated droughts from 1991 to 1995 and again in 1997. However, the present drought has been particularly severe and it has stretched farmersâ resilience, resources and resolve.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The lack of action, vision and leadership is becoming a theme common to this government. While I support this bill, I note there is so much the Howard government could have done over the last five years to reduce the hardship that farmers in drought-affected areas have been experiencing. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has given a whole new meaning to the saying âall talk and no actionâ. The government first promised drought relief reform more than five years ago and since then has announced breakthroughs in numerous press releases from the agriculture minister with titles that have included âDrought policy reform breakthroughâ, 13 April 2005; âHeadway made on streamlining ECâ; âTruss welcomes EC drought reform supportâ; âProgress on drought reformâ, 19 May 2004; âNational drought policy: the way aheadâ; âFederal government seeks to make EC support fairer and more workableâ; and âTruss offers way forward on exceptional circumstances policyâ. If the minister had put less effort into writing media releases and more effort into backing his public comments with policy commitments, rural businesses, families and workers would not be feeling the increased anxiety and depression that they are currently feeling.</para>
<para>The frustration over the Howard governmentâs talk fest on drought assistance has drawn criticism from the National Farmers Federation president, Mr Cornish, who said in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> on 27 May this year:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Let us hope that after five years of discussions the Prime Minister, following his drought tour last week, shows the national leadership required and takes full control of the EC system, paving the way for the long overdue reforms required to establish a fair and equitable EC system in this country ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">However, the list of the governmentâs critics does not stop at the National Farmers Federation and the Australian Labor Party. The Australian National Audit Office report on drought assistance released earlier this month shines a light on the lack of planning, strategy and coordination in this policy area. Some of the reportâs key findings include:</para>

<para class="block">No wonder the Howard governmentâs drought policy is in such a mess. It beggars belief that, with much of the country gripped by prolonged drought over the last decade, the minister did not even have a plan for what to do if the drought got worse. Nothing encapsulates the neglect of planning in this area more than the $72.7 million cut to the estimated expenditure on exceptional circumstances assistance in the 2005-06 budget. It is beyond belief when 45 per cent of Australiaâs farmland is currently drought declared; with states like New South Wales the figure is closer to 85 per cent. But, not wanting to stop there, the Howard government knew an El Nino event was likely. Instead of increasing EC assistance in the budget, what did it do? It actually cut estimated expenditure.</para>
<para>On 15 April 2005âthree and a half weeks before the budget was handed downâthe agriculture minister was briefed by the Bureau of Meteorology at a meeting of the Primary Industries Ministerial Council and told that the first quarter of this year was the second driest on record and that another El Nino event was likely this year. Either the government ignored the warning, the agriculture minister failed to pass it on or they decided that they did not want to talk about the drought in the budget papers because of the impact that would have on the economyâs bottom line. In any case, a number of newspaper articles outlining these warnings appeared at the same time, so it is not as though it was not known in the lead-up to the budget that there was going to be a problem with drought assistance. The drought that started in 2002-03 has been particularly severe by historical standards. The consequences have included a decline in crop production of more than 50 per cent in 2002-03. Flow-on effects have contributed to a downturn for rural businesses and fewer regional employment opportunities.</para>
<para>I want to address the arbitrary nature of how the boundaries of EC are declared and how the assessment process is conducted. The Australian National Audit Office report directed particular attention to the assessment of EC applications. It found:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... lack of a clear standard for information required in an EC application. Stakeholders, such as peak industry bodies and farmer organisations, also commented that the amount of information required for an application was extensive. In some instances, the information was difficult to obtain ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Because of the way EC areas are declared many farmers are suffering arbitrarily. In my electorate, Gordon and Ballan are both considered to be EC drought declared areas, but if you travel just 50 kilometres west to Snake Valley, Beaufort and Learmonth the farmers are not so lucky. They have been unable to get their areas EC declared, despite receiving exactly the same levels of rainfall and having the same pressures as the farmers in Gordon and Ballan. Despite being in the same boat by virtue of being on the wrong side of a line, farmers of equal need will receive varying levels of support. The real concern for farmers is not so much the insufficient financial assistance from EC funding but the eligibility criteria. I know that farmers who are on the other side of that line are still doing it toughâthey still sit around the kitchen table at night wondering how they are going to pay the bills and buy stock for the next season.</para>
<para>In my area the process has been particularly painful. Time after time we have had applications going in and the applicants being told more information was needed. In fact, you actually have to pay to access the informationâand where do you have to go to pay for access to that information? You have to go to the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, a federal government office, so you can submit an application to the federal government. It just seems absolutely ridiculous to me that we are in those circumstances. On each occasion the application for EC assistance for those areas has been rejected. As I said, what that has resulted in is a small proportion of my electorate being drought declared while other parts that are suffering just as badly remain undeclared. Because they have not been able to obtain information or there has been a lack of clarity about the information required, those farmers and businesses in those communities have had to go without.</para>
<para>The arbitrary nature of exceptional circumstances funding was also picked up in the Audit Office report. It noted that there is no standard approach to describing EC areas in the EC applications which were subsequently announced in press releases. As a result, the descriptions of exceptional circumstances declared industries and regions were at times complicated. As well, some maps of the EC declared areas did not accord clearly with descriptions of the areas.</para>
<para>After five years of talk from this government any increase in assistance to farmers is absolutely welcome. However, if the government thinks that it has done nearly enough, it is gravely mistaken. There is still much to be done and improved on. The government has failed to take on board in a timely way the warnings of the CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology and the Queensland Centre for Climate Applications. It has failed to fund the proposed CRC for climate risk technologies, which might have actually helped to address some of these issues in the future. Its decision to scrap the drought investment allowance is a great disappointment to many farmers. Its failure to adequately fund drought relief in this yearâs budget, despite the fact that it had information about it, shows that the government is not serious about drought policy at all. It only moves to deal with the issues when they appear in the media. That is no way to run your public policy program.</para>
<para>I say to the member for Indiâwho in this debate could not even manage to speak for the 10 minutes allocated to her without attempting to take some cheap political shots and who had not even seen a regional or rural area until she tottered down the highway in her Manolo Blahaniks to try and win a seat off the National Partyâthat it takes more to represent a regional or rural area and do something about drought funding than just sticking your name down on a bill that happens to have something about farmers in it.</para>
<para>It is important that the government implements an effective and long-term plan for addressing the problems farmers experience during sustained drought, because the livelihood and prosperity of farms not only impacts on farmers and their families but has a direct link to the vibrancy of regional and rural communities. It has been estimated by the National Farmers Federation that up to 70,000 jobs have been lost because of the current drought. Recent studies by Charles Sturt University of drought-hit towns in New South Wales show jobs losses from drought include teaching, retail, hospitality, apprenticeships and skilled labour, as well as seasonal farm labouring jobs. The farming community in my electorate is in many respects the lifeblood of towns like Ballarat, Ballan and Learmonth. If we do not address the long-term issues that are facing farmers in rural communities, we put at peril the economic as well as the cultural wellbeing of regional Australia.</para>

</talker>
<para>âI am pleased to speak to the <inline ref="R2404">Farm Household Support Amendment (Exceptional Circumstances Relief Payment) Bill 2005</inline>. Many have spoken about the drought. There have been a number of matters of public importance and other debates and there has been much in the press. Like many members in this House I also am pleased to say that large sections of my electorate have received relatively good rain in the last week. But I, and I am sure other members from country areas, would hate urban dwellers to assume that the drought was effectively broken by that rain. Obviously it was not. There are many areasâI think some are within the electorate of the member for Riverinaâthat have not received substantial rain at all. So it has been a patchy start to the winter season.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I would like to raise a number of issues, some directly related to the bill and some indirectly. Firstly, I believe that the National Rural Advisory Council will be travelling to parts of New South Wales over this week to look at areas that were included in the exceptional circumstances arrangements but have been out of that arrangement for some time, varying in months of course. I would encourage the council to have a very close look at those areas they will be considering within the New England electorate. In doing so I encourage them to look closelyâand I think the minister hinted at this the other day, and others have talked about itâat the micro areas that may be impacted far more than the broader areas that the drought policy criteria tends to look at.</para>
<para>That is one of the concerns that many people have, and it is related to the weather stations and to rainfall over a particular period of time. As we know, not everybody gets the same amount of rain within a particular region. There can be other impacting forces on the determination of criteria, and a farmer, even though he may be in the same region as another farmer, could have different criteria related to his drought circumstances. One of the things we have to look at very closely in the future is the way in which we measure rainfall. If rainfall is to be a part determinant of drought policy we have to come up with better ways of recognising the micro differences that occur within a region, rather than trying to blanket a total region as being in drought or out of drought. Obviously there are areas of grey that do need recognition. I think the minister is well aware of that. I hope that in discussions with the states, the NFF and others they will come up with better criteria for the future.</para>
<para>There have been a number of publications, articles and opinion pieces on the drought over the last year or so, particularly in relation to drought policy. I was singled out for some degree of criticism, I think by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, about some of my comments on the announcement by the Prime Minister of another $250 million in expenditure for drought funding. Most people welcomed that funding. I welcomed it, but I did have some critical comments on the way in which the drought funding has been sold. I would like to go back through some of those issues again.</para>
<para>This has been the worst drought in 100 years. One of the things that happens to farmers during a drought is that they run out of cash. Most of them have some sort of debt arrangement to meetâfor instance, they will have interest rates plus the capital to meet. One of the comments I have made from time to time is that the ambition of drought policy, if there is a one in 100-years drought, should be to attempt to freeze the financial position of those farmers involved so that, when this natural disaster ends, the agricultural sector is in a financial position to move forward productively. I do not think the existing drought criteria do that at all. In fact in many senses they do the reverse.</para>
<para>When you analyse the figures, you find that the interest rate subsidy component of exceptional circumstances expenditure over the last three years was $237 million. There has been a lot of talk, over the last two years at least, that the government has expended a billion dollars on drought. That is not the case; in fact the minister has admitted that. What the government has done is assist the financial predicament in relation to the interest rate component of the farm sector with $237 million. That is $79 million a year in the worst drought in recorded history for one of the major industries in Australia. But we hear the cry that this is a major subsidy to agriculture, that this is a major subsidy to the farming sector. We hear some of the economic pundits saying that it should not be occurring and that it is a misuse of public moneys et cetera.</para>
<para>I take you back, Mr Deputy Speaker McMullan, to a period of time in which you would have been very involved, when there was a major change in public policy in this place. The government was looking at introducing the goods and services tax. That was a significant change. It was not a climatically driven change but it was a significant change in public policy, and in fact it was one with which I agreed. I was not a member of this parliament at that time. Part of the political reaction to the goods and services tax was from the building industry, which is another very important industry to Australia. The building industry said, âThe introduction of this new tax will mean that the price of a house, all building construction, will go up by 10 per cent.â</para>
<para>Coming into the 2001 election, the government listened to what those people were saying and put in place an assistance package for the building industry called the First Home Owners Scheme. That provided $14,000 for people attempting to buy or build their first home and was an indirect incentive to the building industry. I am pleased Minister Truss has entered the chamber. The $79 million per year provided over the last three years for what we all agree is the worst drought in living history has been matched by the assistance to the building industry for a year longerâover four yearsâof $5.2 billion by way of the First Home Owners Scheme. I am not whingeing about that, and I do not hear anybody in here whingeing about it either. They see it as a means of not only assisting young people into homes but also assisting the industry to survive the movement towards a goods and service tax arrangement.</para>
<para>I noticed Alan Mitchell in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> on 1 June making a range of comments on the viability of farmers and the dreadful drought package that had been given to them. I remind Alan Mitchell and other commentators that, effectively, $237 million has been spent in three years on government assistance to farmers. Most of the other moneyâand the minister will agree with me: he will get up and say it is $680 million; it is now probably over $720 millionâhas been for household support, which this bill is about. Anybody who is unemployed in Australia is entitled to household support. For the economic commentators and, on some occasions, the minister and the government to construe that as singling out farmers for assistance and including it as assistance is, I think, misrepresenting the facts. The real assistance that has gone to agriculture over the last three years is around $237 million.</para>
<para>Alan Mitchell, the economics editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline>, makes another comment:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The interest rate subsidy is an abomination. It subsidises most generously the farmers who are most heavily in debt.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It does not do that at allâand I hope the minister supports me here because I am supporting him. In fact, the criteria that are established mean that those who are very heavily in debt are non-viable. The minister made mention of this on the day of the announcement of the extra $250 million. Those people are not considered viable. And if you are not viable you are not entitled to exceptional circumstances assistance. If people need proof of that, I refer themâlisteners and membersâto a very interesting article written by Michael Duffy, published in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> last Saturday, 18 June, headed: âFarmers are pushed beyond limitâ.</para>
<para>Michael Duffy quite rightly makes an attack on the New South Wales Carr government for the way in which they have pushed farmers to the wall through environmental policy without compensation. His arguments are very valid. Using Peter Spencerâs situation as an example, Michael Duffy describes how changes in environmental policy have forced Peter Spencerâs property into becoming a non-viable arrangement. When he needed help because of the drought, the Commonwealth government could not or would not assist him because his farm was considered non-viable. So I suggest that Alan Mitchell refer to Michael Duffyâs article and get his facts right before he starts suggesting that the farmers who are the most indebted are the most assisted. The criteria do not work that way.</para>
<para>In conclusion, I want to make a couple of points. As I have said, I am pleased the minister is here. I and others have suggested that, rather than the piecemeal arrangement that we have now with the states and the Commonwealth arguing from time to time about who is right and who is wrong, we should in the future move towards establishing a national natural disaster fund. To show how easy it is to raise large amounts of money and have such a fund in place so that you can remove from the political process access to a disaster fund, it takes only one dollar per week from every Australian to raise a billon dollars in a year. That is oversimplifying itâI am well aware of thatâbut it shows how very few dollars from many people can raise a lot of money.</para>
<para>When you analyse the disasters that have occurred in Australia since 1974, there has been only one natural disaster that has cost over $1 billion in a yearâthat is, the Newcastle earthquake. Natural disasters in Australia are costing the nation about $200 million per annum. Twenty cents a week from every Australian would cover, on average, the disasters that occur within Australia. Wouldnât that be a better way of addressing not only natural disasters such as this one, which is a drought, but also the Wollongong mudslide where the people who were impacted by that mudslide lived in great uncertainty? Arguments went on between the insurance companies, the government and others about who was wrong, who was right and who should pay. A fund should be there for all disasters: cyclones, earthquakes, mudslides, major hail stormsâif they are deemed to be a natural disasterâand a whole range of other events in between.</para>
<para>The point I am making is that this parliament should take the lead and establish a national natural disaster fund and the criteria that determine a natural disasterâand that should not be every dry spell. I am a farmer; we should not be compensated for every dry spell we have. But when we enter a zone such as the one we are in now there should be criteria that are recognised in a special way to preserve the integrity of agriculture so that when the event is over the industry can come out the other end and be productive for the nation.</para>
<para>There are a couple of other points I would like to make. One is in support of the member for Mallee, who has from time to time raised the issue of climate. Drought is about climate. This nation does not do enough work by way of research on the ways and means of improving the climate. I suggest that issues such as drought seeding, which the member for Mallee has looked at very closely and argued for strongly in this place, be reconsidered in any long-term drought assistance package. I note that the New South Wales government is doing some work of this kind in the Kosciusko area at this very moment and, I am told, has had good results so far. A lot of similar work has been done in Tasmania in past years.</para>
<para>In my view, assistance to find ways of managing the microclimate of agriculture has not been pushed hard enough. I am not saying there has not been any assistance; there has been. I have been involved in no-till agricultureâthe minister would know all about thatâwhich some people call zero till and others call conservation tillage. It is a practice where you reduce the cultivation, the active disturbance of the soil which drives soil out, and replace it essentially with chemical farming and that maintains the residues on top of your soil. Both the humus and the infiltration rates are increased so that you get more water into the soil rather than the water running off causing erosion and all those sorts of micro issues. I would possibly be one of the longest serving farmers using that initiative. We have land that has not been cultivated but that has been cropped continuously since 1977. This land has been continuously analysed for the micro flora and fauna, soil structure, soil texture, infiltration rates and those sorts of things. The flora and fauna have essentially been in good soil, I must admit, but there are a lot of good soils particularly in New South Wales and southern Queensland. That in itself is drought control because you are storing moisture in the subsoil for when the crop needs it. I would urge the minister and the parliament to look at it. There are similar measures that can be used to try to encourage farmers to adopt measures that do more for the microclimate in which they are actually farming.</para>
<para>The problems that farmers are facing now are seen by many as drought related, but in a lot of cases it is lack of profitability and the farmersâ incapacity to fund their way through a very difficult time. Australia has to look at what it can do in its domestic agricultural sector to assist those people become more profitable. I know that I am starting to sound like a cracked record in this place, but I cannot understand why, given the price of oilâthe Treasurer was on his feet today talking about the price of oilâand given the circumstances of greenhouse gases with the Kyoto arrangements where we as a nation and as a globe have to move to more renewable energies, we are not encouraging our farm sector to move into some of these renewable energy areas such as ethanol. I have a bill before the house at the moment to mandate 10 per cent ethanol use. That in one fell swoop could save the sugar industry and could utilise many millions of tonnes of grain that we currently export to corrupt markets, only to go and buy oil with the money from another corrupt market. Our governments should be looking at real policy such as that to increase the price of the products they sell so that, once a dry spell or a drought comes along, the farm sector is in a more profitable position to face that adversity. I do not see any of those sorts of things that I, and others, have mentioned in drought policy as it is at the moment.</para>
<para>All I seeâand I was involved with farm organisations before coming into the New South Wales parliamentâis a continuation of the same old argument by misguided commentators in an economic sense who are trying to create the old country-urban division over subsidy to agriculture. Australia has to make some decisions: do we need agriculture in this land; do we need an inland Australia? This Australian parliament has to start putting in place policy that actually drives that, rather than the reverse that has occurred through some aspects of competition policy and economic rationalist thought.</para>

</talker>
<para>âAt the outset I thank all those members who have contributed to this debate on the <inline ref="R2404">Farm Household Support Amendment (Exceptional Circumstances Relief Payment) Bill 2005</inline>, most of whom having made some comments about drought and its impact on Australia. While the honourable member for New England is still in the chamber, I will respond to a couple of the issues that he raised. I share his concern about some of the comments on drought policy made in the capital city media over recent times and I have said that publicly. One of my pet hates is when university academics living on a 100 per cent government funded salary criticise assistance to farmers in their times of need. They are living in ivory towers when they expect massive funding for their university or for their academic institution but then criticise any government funding that might be provided to other groups. IÂ think there does need to be a balance in this debate, and some of the newspaper commentary has left a lot to be desired.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I guess I can understand the frustration that city people feel about this drought having gone on and on, but their frustration pales into insignificance compared with the pain suffered by those who have to live with the drought and seek to manage it. In those circumstances there is a need for some degree of sympathy and understanding and an acknowledgment that, when the good times return seasonally on the land, farmers will once again contribute mightily to the national economy and ensure that the kinds of services and facilities that people in the city enjoy can be funded from a national perspective. I accept that there is a need for us to look constructively and in the long term at the way in which we manage our rural lands and how effectively we are able to work towards ensuring that people are able to endure droughts as painlessly as possible.</para>
<para>It needs to be said that the reforms that have occurred in agriculture other the years have made an enormous difference to the way in which we have been able to see our way through this drought. The honourable member for New England referred to no-till farming, which has meant that crops have been harvested in some places where in a previous generation, in a previous drought, that could never have happened. The way in which we manage our irrigation water now and the supplies of our impoundment are so much more professional that we are able to see through circumstances which in the past could never have been possible. I wonder what catastrophe there would have been had this particular drought occurred in 1900, when most of these capacities to adjust were not in place.</para>
<para>I have no doubt that the governmentâs Farm Management Deposits Scheme, the FarmBis training program and a range of other initiatives that we have taken under the AAA package have also helped farmers to prepare for the drought and enabled them to see through some circumstances in a way that otherwise may not have been possible.</para>
<para>The member for New England said a couple of things that it may not surprise him to hear I do not agree with. On a number of occasions he has sought to discount the amount of Commonwealth contribution that has been going to drought affected farmersâI think unfairly. The reality is that the payments that have been made to farmers in direct cash payments amount to about $680 million. There is about another $80 million that has been provided by way of concessions in access to the Youth Allowance and also the cost of providing health care cards to affected farmers. I do not think it is fair to say that a big proportion of this $680 million would be available to farmers just because all people are entitled to unemployment benefits when they are unemployed. The reality is that most farmers would not qualify for Newstart allowance because they cannot meet one of the fundamental tests: they cannot abandon their property and go and search for full-time work. So concessions are put in place to enable farmers to access these welfare payments, which I acknowledge are paid at the same rate as payments to recipients of Newstart allowance. This bill will make the tests associated with access to these relief payments even more generous and therefore again underpins the fact that this is a genuine contribution and can reasonably be counted as a part of the exceptional circumstances assistance available to farmers.</para>
<para>I note the opposition is prepared to support the bill but has put forward an amendment containing a series of criticisms. For me, the sadness in looking at the opposition amendment is the clear indication that the amendment gives about the Labor Partyâs lack of understanding about drought and drought policy issues. Almost every single one of the Labor Partyâs proposals is flawed and inaccurate; they are simply factually wrong. In those circumstances, it is disappointing that the alternative government has so little understanding of the issues associated with drought. It is simply not true to say, for instance, that there was inadequate funding for drought relief in this yearâs budget. The funding provided was in keeping with what was expected would be required to meet the needs of farmers in the already declared areas. When new areas are declared, as has been happening ever since the drought began, new estimates are provided through the additional estimates process. In addition to that, extra money will now be required and provided because of the new measures announced by the Prime Minister on 30 May. It is essentially an entitlements based system, and whatever money is required to meet those entitlements will be provided.</para>
<para>I am surprised at the suggestion that, to use the oppositionâs words, there is âfailure to provide long term financial certainty for the Rural Financial Counselling Serviceâ. There is four-year funding in the budget. The funding is secure. It is true that the government has undertaken a reviewâand we have obtained cooperation from the states in thisâof how we can deliver the Rural Financial Counselling Service more effectively in the future, but the funding is clearly in place. There is no suggestion of cutting funding. Indeed, the announcement of 30 May referred to increased funding and the provision of 10 additional counsellors.</para>
<para>There is a suggestion that we have failed to take notice of warnings that there might be a drought. I would be interested in challenging the opposition to produce those warnings. I am sure I could find quotations from each of the instrumentalities that have been mentioned saying that they expected seasonal conditions to be average or above average. One of the things that I have well and truly learned as a farmer over the years is to treat all of these forecasts with a fair degree of scepticism. When you have SOI figures moving from the lowest level ever recorded to a plus figure in one month, it makes you really wonder how reliable these scientific assessments areâor, for that matter, the El Nino effect. I think we understand the implications less now than when the words were first invented.</para>
<para>I do not think it is reasonable to ask a farmer to plan their drought preparedness measures on the basis of what might happen to be predicted by the centre for climate research, a climate warning centre, a Queensland climate centre, the CSIRO or, for that matter, anybody else. You have to make your decisions on the basis of the best available information, but those who do not plant their crop can be absolutely certain that they are not going to harvest any. Farmers will take the riskâand it is a risk based on sound judgmentâto plant their crop if they believe there is a reasonable prospect of achieving success.</para>
<para>Even in a drought, even in a year that is predicted to be a drought, we sometimes have areas that fortuitously miss out on the drought, that get rainfall coming through; people are therefore able to succeed in a year like that. It even happened this year. After we have had a couple of good falls of rain in some places, who would be brave enough to stand in this House and say that we are not going to get a wheat crop this year? It is still quite possible. Yet a fortnight ago most people were prepared to discard that possibility almost altogether.</para>
<para>It is true that we have been struggling to reform the drought assistance arrangements for some time, but the oppositionâs amendment suggests that somehow or other it is the Commonwealthâs fault that it has not been possible to achieve reforms. The amendment refers to proposals in May 2002 to introduce a range of reforms. It is true: the states were happy to agree to a range of reforms so long as the Commonwealth paid 100 per cent of the cost. Whenever it comes to any kind of reforms that the states should bear a share ofâeven a traditional shareâthey run miles away. It is simply nonsense to suggest that there was any agreement in May 2002. We certainly agreed on some desirable changes that could be made to the system, but none of the statesâwith the possible exception of Western Australiaâhas ever been prepared to make any compromises at all towards a proper and fair sharing arrangement for the cost of exceptional circumstances arrangements.</para>
<para>There are a number of quite significant issues that have been raised by members. I just refer to one other, and that is the reference by a couple of members of the opposition to the ANAO report into drought assistance. Once again, they seriously misrepresented the tone and the content of that report. The report made it very clear that Australiaâs drought assistance measures have been responsive and effective. It made it clear that the agencies concerned had worked very hard to ensure that assistance reached farmers and their families in a timely and user-friendly manner. The overall conclusion of the ANAO report was that the agencies had made considerable efforts to deliver drought assistance measures to affected communities and that the delivery of that assistance, on the whole, was accurate and timely. The ANAO did make seven recommendations, all of which were readily accepted by my department, but they would all fall into the category of finetuning the way in which the EC assistance could be provided more effectively.</para>
<para>There was some comment about the time taken to deal with applications. We have had an unprecedented number of applicationsâmore than in the entire history of our nation: 84. Of those, 66 per cent were assessed in eight weeks or less. The ANAO report confirmed that the delays in the others were almost always associated with inadequate information being provided in the application that was prepared by the states. We are looking at ways to try and improve that, particularly through the potential development of a new national monitoring system which might enable us to deal with applications in a semiautomatic fashion where information is readily available and would underpin the deliberations of the National Rural Advisory Council in assessing an area for declaration. So the ANAO report was constructive and helpful, but it was certainly also very supportive of the benefits of the drought assistance and the way in which it was delivered.</para>
<para>This particular legislation does make some significant improvements to the delivery of assistance to farmers. The Australian government remains committed to providing assistance directly to drought affected farmers and rural communities during these difficult times. Large areas of eastern Australia have been experiencing severe drought conditions since 2002 and, to further compound the situation, the first five months of 2005 in Australia have been the hottest and the second driest start to a year on record. As a result, farmers in 45 per cent of Australiaâs agricultural land are currently EC declared and eligible to apply for EC assistance.</para>
<para>As I mentioned earlier, the Prime Minister announced on 30 May another $254 million in a package of drought assistance measures, and that is a clear demonstration of this governmentâs proactive approach to assisting rural and regional Australians impacted by the drought. The existing measures, together with the enhancements announced by the Prime Minister, bring the Australian governmentâs expected commitment on drought assistance to over $1.25 billion. In total, under the EC arrangements and the additional drought assistance package announced on 9 December 2002, the government has approved more than 33,900 applications for income support and nearly 16,700 applications for interest rate relief for drought affected farmers. The enhancements in the package of measures announced on 30 May will mean more farmers will get increased assistance through more generous means tests for EC assistance, a continuation of the streamlined extension assessment process and a review by the National Rural Advisory Council of the 22 areas not extended in the past year.</para>
<para>Of course, rural communities impacted by this drought have not been forgotten. Drought affected communities will benefit from the package announced on 30 May 2005 and also through nearly $9 million in additional counselling and support services. I was happy to ceremonially hand over the $3 million cheque to the CWA with the Prime Minister today to assist with their emergency aid grants program. There will also be a $10 million Envirofund grants round to focus particularly on dealing with biodiversity in a drought and the sorts of issues which can perhaps be assisted during this period of time to make sure that the environment is also in a sound state to recover once the rains return.</para>
<para>The purpose of this bill is to implement the more generous means test for the exceptional circumstances relief payment that was announced on 30 May 2005. Because the government is providing a $10,000 exemption for off-farm income for ECRP, farmers who have been forced to obtain off-farm employment to supplement their farm income during this severe drought will not be disadvantaged over those who have not when it comes to accessing ECRP. The bill also streamlines the process for farmers obtaining EC certificates. The NFF has been advocating streamlined EC arrangements, and the need to have a more efficient and effective EC certificate process has been highlighted through the EC reform activities undertaken over the last two years. It was also one of the issues mentioned in the ANAO report.</para>
<para>In a whole-of-government approach, Centrelink taking over the responsibility for EC certificates from 1 October 2005 will mean that farmers will be automatically assessed for an EC certificate when they apply for the ECRP. The effect of this change will be a more consistent and accurate process for farmers obtaining EC certificates and, of course, it eliminates one of the pieces of paperwork that was associated with receiving EC assistance.</para>
<para>I thank honourable members for their support for the <inline ref="R2404">Farm Household Support Amendment (Exceptional Circumstances Relief Payment) Bill 2005</inline>. The passage of this bill will ensure Australiaâs farmers are supported through this severe drought. Importantly, it will ensure that farmers are positioned to make a strong recovery when the drought breaks and to return Australian agriculture to being a valuable contributor to the Australian economy. I thank honourable members of the government in particular who have lobbied for these kinds of reforms. Some of the members have already spoken, such as the honourable member for Riverina, but unfortunately time precluded a number of other members from the government side who wished to speak on this legislation, including the honourable member for Paterson, who has just taken the chair.</para>
<para>Recognising how important drought reform has been, it has been an issue that has seriously dulled the spirits of people right throughout rural and regional Australia. They have been encouraged by the announcement by the Prime Minister of more assistance, and this legislation will help ensure that more Australian farmers in drought areas will be eligible for help and, when they get the help, it will be more generous. I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para>âTo continue my speech on the <inline ref="R2330">Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australiaâs Skills Needs) Bill 2005</inline>: principals of colleges will have the autonomy to make key staffing and financial decisions relating to the functioning of their college. This level of authority will promote ownership of the college and real responsibility for the modelâs success. La Trobe is one of the fastest growing electorates in the country, with up to 50 families moving into the area each week. The increase in the number of families in our local community has ensured that there are demands for all levels of education, including secondary.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Will technical colleges compete with the TAFE system? The system devised for technical schools is to complement the TAFE system, not compete with it. Currently in La Trobe there is only one TAFE in the area, located in Berwick, which is at the heart of the population growth area. Berwick TAFE is a great learning institution within the electorate and forms part of the Chisholm Institute, which offers tertiary education to the people of the south-east suburbs of outer Melbourne.</para>
<para>This local campus does not cover all areas offered by TAFE, though. It offers courses covering business; HR and marketing; working with the community, including aged care services; IT; engineering; beauty therapy; and sport and recreation. These courses are mainly professional courses, but not trades. There is a distinct lack of tertiary education in trades and therefore a skills shortage in our local community. Berwick campus does not offer the VCE; therefore, our young people miss out on the opportunity to do the VCE through TAFE. Also located in Berwick is a campus of Monash University. This is a new campus of Monash University which my predecessor, Bob Charles, was instrumental in bringing to La Trobe.</para>
<para>For young people who want to study locally beyond VCE we have Berwick TAFE and Monash University. For young people who do not want to go on to further study, there is a distinct lack of opportunity. Statistics show that not all young people aspire to complete university or TAFE studies. According to the 2001 census, the breakdown of academic qualifications for La Trobe is: tertiary education, 17.6 per cent; trade qualification, 19.2 per cent; and no qualification, 52.9 per cent. These figures show that not all young people want to go to university or TAFE. More of my young constituents have gone and developed a trade.</para>
<para>I believe we can get more of our youth to take up a trade and to begin to address our skills shortage. By building technical colleges, we can help young people develop these skills while they are pursing their academic studies, and finish high school with an academic qualification in addition to an employable trade. This concept is well received in the La Trobe area by schools and by the business community. I have met with several groups within my electorate about the possibility of developing technical schools in the electorate.</para>
<para>I met with Vin Feeney, who is an excellent ambassador and Principal of St Josephâs College in Ferntree Gully, to discuss the possibility of a technical school within the college. The Shire of Cardinia is interested in a college for their local community. I met with Mayor Gary Runge and Paul Dimasi, CEO of South East Learning Network, to discuss this proposal. Haileybury College in the city of Casey is also keen to develop the idea of a technical college. I have also had discussions with Principal Greg Holman from Upwey High School, who is a fantastic principal. He is offering year 11 and 12 students school based apprenticeship programs through the TAFE network. The school currently has 120 students undertaking vocational education training at Box Hill TAFE, outside the electorate, in areas such as hospitality, electronics, electrical, multimedia, sport and fitness.</para>
<para>Students at Upwey High School would love to undertake courses in trades such as building and plumbing through the school based apprenticeship program in conjunction with the TAFE system. However, the current program in these trades is only offered at the certificate III level. To offer these trades at the certificate III level is problematic. Wage structure and the range of entitlements that must be offered to these students, including holiday pay, overtime and payment to attend TAFE, to name only a few, make it very expensive for employers to take on students through this program and therefore there is not a lot of interest from employers to be involved.</para>
<para>If this program was able to run at the certificate II level, which does not incur the same level of entitlements, Upwey High School students would be eager to undertake courses in trades such as building and plumbing. As the current school based apprenticeship program is limited to courses that are offered through TAFE, there is a demand for technical colleges designed to provide our young people with trade skills. The lack of public transport makes it difficult for students to undertake these courses in places such as Box Hill, which is why we need colleges designed to teach technical skills in our local area.</para>
<para>This has been a popular program, indicating a need to take the next stepâto build specifically designed colleges to cater to these needs for skilled education. To cater for people from all areas of my electorate we would need to build a technical college in the Berwick-Beaconsfield area as well as in the north of the electorate in or around the Boronia-Ferntree Gully area. There is a distinct lack of public transport from the north of the electorate to the south so we would need a technical college in each of these areas to cater for all students</para>
<para>I speak from experience with my technical school background. I attended Ferntree Gully Technical School from year 7 to year 11. This school offered great opportunities for many former students in college at that time. It offered a great deal of diversity whether it be carpentry or plumbing. Unfortunately, the school closed on 31 December 1996 along with around 400 other schools, which were closed to save money.</para>
<para>I can also go back to my experience as a police officer. I was interested to hear the member for Lyons raising some objections. But one thing as a police officer that I have noticed is that some people do not ordinarily fit into the education system and they have great learning difficulties. If they can be catered for in a technical college they will not fall through the gaps in the education system. They will not leave school early. They will not get involved in crime and subsequently in drug abuse. These are the students we need to capture. These are the ones I strongly support. In closing, I support this bill. It is a great step forward to address the skills shortage. More importantly, as I have stated, it will capture those who are falling through the gaps in the education system and give them a trade and a future.</para>

<para>âApprenticeship training and technical and further education are extremely important aspects of the fabric of Australian society. They are important for the individuals who participate in them. They can very well determine life expectancy outcomes and career outcomes and of course they are important nationally because without the skills that are provided through those important training and education programs our national economic growth would be impeded. They are far too important to become victims of the political games that this government has actually turned them into.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The bill that is before us at the moment arises from a policy statement made by the Liberal Party in the lead-up to the election, that for the first time the national government would establish its own technical colleges. Twenty-four are to be established as a result of this bill, providing for up to 7,200 students in years 11 and 12 equivalents. In the typical Orwellian fashion that we have become used to with this government, the bill is also cutely titled, as much of their less friendly legislation is. So this bill is officially titled: <inline ref="R2330">Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australiaâs Skills Needs) Bill 2005</inline>. Anybody who thinks this is about achieving our skills needs needs only to look at the governmentâs actual record in dealing with this problem.</para>
<para>There is an acute shortage in skills in a number of key sectors, particularly in a number of the traditional trades, that is impeding the opportunities of business in Australia. It is impeding the opportunities we have for production and export. That skill shortage is in no small measure an outcome of the failure of this government to invest in the skills training opportunities that governments in the past have accepted their responsibilities to support. In the period between 1995 and 2001 the public investment in higher education in Australia actually fell by over eight per cent. That beggars belief. There are few countries in the OECD for whom that is the case. Most countries in the OECD during that period from 1995 through to the start of this decade increased their commitment to higher education because they understood the importance of investment in peopleâs skills to provide for national growth and, of course, the greater opportunities it presents for individuals to enjoy a higher standard of living and a more fulfilling career whilst they are at work. But, nearly uniquely in the OECD, the Howard government has the record of reducing public investment in higher education. Little wonder that we now have a skills crisis on our hands, a skills crisis that is now recognised across the community, by employers, by unions and by all sides of politics. It is a skills crisis that in no small measure has been produced by the Howard governmentâs own ineptitude in dealing with higher education.</para>
<para>It is, I think, no accident that this bill mirrors a document produced by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry that was published earlier this year. When you have a look at the migration of former Howard government staffers into the senior positions within ACCI it is no surprise that ACCI would produce a document that the Liberal government would pick up virtually unaltered. The bill we have before us fits into that category.</para>
<para>The bill proposes not to support those training institutions that are in desperate need of financial support to meet this skills shortage. It proposes instead to spend money establishing a parallel system. This is not a complementary system; this is a parallel system that in one sense duplicates what is done in many secondary schools. I know in the state of Queensland students are able to undertake trade qualification courses at the same time as they do the normal year 12 leaving certificate. It duplicates that and it duplicates some of the activities that are presently undertaken in TAFE colleges. Why does it do that? Not because it is the most effective and efficient way to deal with our skills shortage but because this government has developed a fixation on trying to ride the states, on trying to ensure that its dogmatic doctrinaire policies are able to be forced upon the states and, indeed, upon companies whether they like it or not.</para>
<para>One of the things that concerns me about this whole process is that the year 12 certificate that students will get on completion of their studies at these new Australian technical colleges will not necessarily provide them with any opportunity to go to university. That concerns me for this reason: we are effectively streaming our children at age 15. We are saying to a 15-year-old person: âYou must, at the age of 15, make a decision that has the potential to impact upon your life for decades to come.â As a parent and a former teacher, I take the view that that is not the best course of action for young people. Many of us in this place have been teachers; many more of us have children. Most of us know that your average 15-year-old is probably not best placed to make those decisionsâbut, in practice, that is what this legislation will make many of them do. At the ripe old age of 15 they will opt for a program that will cut off options for them into the future unless they undertake significant studies later in life, usually on a part-time basis. People can do that but, frankly, that is a more difficult road for people to take. I think it is an error to stream our young people, to typecast them in this way at such a young age. I have serious concerns about that.</para>
<para>I also have concerns about this governmentâs approach to these Australian technical colleges which mirrors their approach generally to education, in that the government intend to provide more funding for those institutions that are run by non-government organisations. We do not yet know where these Australian technical colleges will be or indeed who will be operating them, whether they will be new buildings and new institutions or whether they will simply be additions to and expansions of existing training facilities. What we do know is that the government have committed to provide more funds for those that are run by non-government organisations.</para>
<para>Why is that the case? I look forward to the minister in reply explaining to the Australian people why it is that their tax dollars in establishing these ATCs should go in greater largesse to the non-government sector than to the government sector. That raises an interesting point. In operating these Australian technical colleges is the non-government sector going do that as a benevolent activity or as a profit-generating venture? The shadow minister, the member for Jagajaga, Jenny Macklin, quite correctly pointed out the attitude of the private providers. She referred to the comments of the Australian Council for Private Education and Training, who said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It would need to be a commercial arrangement ... where there needs to be the opportunity to cover costs and have a return for the operator ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In other words, run them at a profit. So this bill will establish Australian technical colleges in competition with and duplication of existing TAFE colleges and services provided through TAFE courses run in secondary schools around the country. At least in part, it will do it on the basis of providing more money to the private sector to run these ATCs and on the basis that those private sector operators will seek to get a return on their investment, as they would for any other private venture. I do not think that is the best way to deliver outcomes in education and training. But that is the approach that the government has opted to take.</para>
<para>Of course, one the great failings of this governmentâs approach to dealing with the skills shortage is that this bill, heralded by government members in this debate and outside the parliament during the election campaign, will not produce a single tradesperson until 2010ânot one. We have a crisis today because of the governmentâs neglect over the course of the last 10 yearsâand this bill, which the government herald as addressing that, in fact does nothing to address the skills shortage until 2010. There are things that they could be doing without spending this amount of money. For example, there is a crisis with noncompletion. Between 25 and 30 per cent of all people who start apprenticeships do not complete them. That is a wasted skill that this nation is missing out on. Labor has announced its policy to provide completion bonuses to students undertaking those courses to encourage them to stay on and complete their studies. That is a real dollar incentive, so that those people who start out on this opportunity to create a career for themselves in a trade and complete it will get a financial reward from the government when they do. That would actually provide additional tradespeople next year and the year after, but under the governmentâs approach we will wait until 2010 before there is one additional tradesperson as a result of this legislation.</para>
<para>If that is not bad enough, the governmentâs approach to our skills shortage has been not only to ignore the Australians in this situation but to try to plug the hole through a massive increase in skilled migration. Since 1998 there has been an increase in skilled migration of a whopping 178,000 people.</para>

<para>âI happen to be a supporter of an increased migration policy not a decreased migration policy. I am happy to stand here on the record and say I would rather see more people coming to our shores. What is wrong with it, Minister, is that at the same time as the government did that they turned away about 270,000 Australians from TAFE colleges as unmet demand. There was a demand in TAFE colleges throughout this country over the same period of time of a quarter of a million plus Australians who could not get in to do a TAFE course because the system was not properly funded and resourced. At the same time, we import 178,000 people to do those tasks. That is fundamentally flawed. I do not think most people in Australia believe that is the way that this should be done.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>But the Howard governmentâs real intent with this legislation is exposed by their desire to micromanage the entire thing. Nowhere is that more evident than in their requirements to have their industrial relations policies included as part of the conditions of funding for these new institutions. The Liberal Party in government are using their fundsâtheir grants to the states, their contracts with private companiesâto force people onto individual contracts whether or not they want it or whether or not their employer wants to offer it.</para>
<para>We have seen already on a number of occasions that the government have attempted to do that with universities. Basically, they have required universities to offer employment arrangements that the universities do not think are appropriate to them and that they do not wish to offer. The government have required them to do that for fear of loss of funds.</para>
<para>But it is not just in connection to funding that the government has done that. I can well recall Ian McLachlan, when he was Minister for Defence, requiring a contract of the Australian Navy to be renegotiating just after it was signed because the contract provided for the employees to be engaged under a collective agreement. The department, under instructions from the minister, renegotiated that contract, requiring people to be employed on individual contracts. The Commonwealth actually had to pay penalties for breaching the contract and having it rewritten. The government went out of its way, and the taxpayers paid more money, to force workers onto a contract system that they did not want to be on, and to force employers to offer it when it was not their wish.</para>
<para>We are seeing the same thing happening in these new technical colleges. In the end, these new technical colleges are going to provide a take-it-or-leave-it offer: if you want the job you must sign the AWA. Of course, one of the great jokes about AWAs is that they are not individual contracts. You find that all AWAs are the same. They come off the word processor and the personâs name is inserted. One of the more memorable examples that came to light was an AWA that included maternity leave which was offered to a male person. When the individual said that he did not think that was appropriate he was told that if he wanted the job he would sign the contract and shut up. That is how individual they are! These are conditions that are across the board but when the negotiations occur all the power is on one side of the table.</para>
<para>This is the governmentâs effort to force their industrial relations policy into a sector of education that they have previously been unable to crack. I take my hat off to the government for their willingness to manipulate all of the powers at their disposal to force their industrial relations policy on workers and on companies. When I look back I think that the Labor government was far too timid in our pursuit of some of these things! Having been in a couple of positions in relation to this over the years, the one piece of advice I would give the government is that the further you push the pendulum in one direction the greater is the pressure to push it back further the other wayâand quicker.</para>
<para>I actually look forward to the opportunity to pick up the processes that this government have put in place. I look forward to the opportunity, as part of a Labor government, to use precisely the same mechanisms that this government have employed to ensure that Laborâs platform of reform is implemented by contractors, companies and governments, whether they happen to think it is right or not, because that is the approach that this government have adopted. What is good for the goose is good for the gander.</para>
<para>There is a message here for those people in ACCI and elsewhere in the chorus of support that this government have around them when these issues come outâthe people, like ACCI, who have in the past put out their press releases before the documents were published. That message is that when there is a change of government, as there inevitably will beâwe live in a democracy; there will be a change of governmentâthe new government will find that this Howard government have set new benchmarks for the way in which the federal government can tie the hands of contractors, people wanting to do business with government and the states. I think that is a very dangerous road that the government have decided to go down, but it is obvious from recent statementsâand it will become more obvious to all of us after 1 Julyâthat that is exactly the approach that they intend to take. On that point I take my hat off to the government for their willingness to use all of the levers at their disposal to ensure that their policies, however doctrinaire, are imposed on the community at large. It may well be that the community at large do not appreciate that and there may be a backlash against the government for doing it.</para>
<para>I noticed in the bill one interesting provision which provides extraordinary power to the minister. In paragraph 6(2) the legislation talks about agreements with the states for these Australian technical colleges. It says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">An agreement may also specify other conditions, and that the payments under this Act are made on those conditions.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is a section of the act that talks about the conditions under which payments can be made. So after reciting the things that you would expect would be in a bill like this, it then basically says that whatever the minister wants to set as a condition can be set. I will read it again. It says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">An agreement may also specify other conditions, and that the payments under this Act are made on those conditions.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I thought, âThatâs an interesting provision in the bill; Iâll have a look at what the government memorandum says.â People listening are probably not familiar with the process. When bills are introduced the government also publishes an explanatory memorandum which is supposed to explain the details of what is in the legislation. The relative part of the explanatory memorandum says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Subclause 6(2) provides that an agreement may also specify other conditions and that the payments under the Act are made on those conditions.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">If that sounds familiar it is because it is an identical reprint of what is in the act. So the explanation of the act, that the government have provided, is the words of the act. Why are they being coy about this? They are being coy because that is the catch-all. That is the provision in this bill that will enable the minister to force whatever conditions the government want onto the institutions that will be running these ATCs. That clause gives the government of the day the power to impose whatever condition they want, without limit. That is an extraordinary provision to put into a funding arrangement with the states or with private education providers, but that is the process that the government have put in place.</para>
<para>The final thing of concern that I want to mention is that, when the government announced they were going to go down this path, they told the Australian electorate that there would be an open tender process. There has not been an open tender process. Instead of that there has been a request for proposals evaluated behind closed doors and with no public scrutiny. No-one in this parliament at this pointâother than, I guess, a few in the cabinetâknow where the colleges are going to go. I listened to the member for La Trobe, in the second reading debate, rattle off half a dozen places in his electorate that wanted to have one of these colleges. I hope he has gone to tell them that they will get one, because he will end up eating crow in a hurry.</para>
<para>There is no open process for this. This is a con. Technical and further education apprenticeship training is vitally important to this nation. We should not be using it as a political football or as some lever for doctrinaire ideological pursuits the way this government is by setting up these ATCs and forcing its industrial relations policies on people in the education sector through the colleges. To invest in education is a good thing. It is not possible, in my view, to spend too much money on education and training. You can spend a little bit and waste all of it, but if you spend it properly there is no such thing as a population too well educated and too well trained.</para>

<para>âI rise today in support of the <inline ref="R2330">Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australiaâs Skills Needs) Bill 2005</inline>. This bill will deliver on the Howard governmentâs election promise to provide 24 Australian technical colleges throughout the nation and is part of the governmentâs overall attempt to address skills shortages across the nation. These technical colleges will provide to young people who wish to gain a trade the option to gear their year 11 and year 12 studies towards obtaining formal qualifications in that trade.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>There can be no greater testament to my support of this bill and this Howard government initiative than my support for a local consortium in my electorate of Kingston which has applied to have a technical college located in the southern suburbs of Adelaide. In the last two years the southern suburbs of Adelaide have seen the shutdown of a Mobil oil refinery and a local Mitsubishi plant. Since the closure of these two massive contributors to the southern economyâand the loss of over 800 jobs from these two closures aloneâfederal, state and local governments, along with private industry and the wider community, have developed a blueprint to grow and develop our local economy.</para>
<para>One of the central points of that blueprint is the need for a strong skills and technology base. The southern region of Adelaide has 15,883 businesses, of which 1,222 specialise in manufacturing. That is two per cent higher than the state average. Despite the massive job losses that we as a region have suffered in recent times, local business associations, individual employers and job brokers continually report a critical level of skills shortages throughout the area. These shortages are particularly evident in the metal trades, automotive, electrical and construction sectors, all of which are being targeted by this bill.</para>
<para>Young people across my electorate of Kingston are screaming out to access this type of training. In the southern suburbs of Adelaide there are around 50,000 young people aged between 15 and 24. This bill targets up to 7,200 students a year, with 24 colleges proposed nationally. If a technical college were located in my electorate, it would provide places for 300 students a year. This is something that Kingston, in the southern suburbs of Adelaide, with such a large youth population, is screaming out for.</para>
<para>The technical colleges proposed in this bill will provide a huge boost for communities in my electorate. Technical colleges provide hope not only to the young people who desperately wish to pursue a trade and who are struggling with the challenges of academic study but also to their families. They provide hope to local businesses who, if they increase production and create a successful business, will be able to source enough skilled labour and they provide hope to the community as a whole. Communities which have suffered massive job losses and plant closures, such as those of Mobil and Mitsubishi in Kingston, suffer a massive slump in morale and community spirit. Locating a technical college in my electorate and in others like it could provide a massive boost for communities nationwide.</para>
<para>This initiative is aimed at training young men and women for the careers they want and getting them into jobs. These colleges will establish links with local industry to provide a pathway from training to work for these young people. I can assure you that local industry in my electorate is exceptionally supportive of this proposal, with many local companies and businesses providing letters of support for the organisations which have applied to establish a technical college. I have no doubt that the businesses in my electorate are typical of most businesses across the nation and are exceptionally supportive of this proposal.</para>
<para>If this bill is passed, the first Australian technical colleges funded under this program will open their doors in 2006, with all 24 being operational by 2008. This is an immediate solution to some very immediate problems across the nation, including the skills shortage. There is no downside to this proposal. It allows young men and women, many of whom are frustrated by a structured academic learning environment and at risk of leaving school, to obtain their formal year 12 qualification while also obtaining skills which will qualify them for a trade. This proposal takes young people from a learning environment which does not suit them, and puts them in one which does. It enables young people to train for a trade and gives them links to local business so that they have direct access to jobs. It provides businesses with trained young people who are ready and willing to work, and it helps to address the skills shortage which is being faced across the nation. There is no downside to this bill. It is a great initiative by the Howard government, and it has my full support.</para>
<para>For the benefit of electorates such as mine, for the benefit of every young person who wants to learn a trade, for the benefit of businesses who need trained young people and for the benefit of this nation, I commend this very important bill to the House.</para>

<para>âThe purpose of the <inline ref="R2330">Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australiaâs Skills Needs) Bill 2005</inline> is to implement the governmentâs election commitment to establish Australian technical colleges for years 11 and 12 students in 24 regions throughout Australia. These colleges are supposed to offer high-quality training and facilities that will further strengthen Australiaâs vocational education and training system and promote pride and excellence in acquiring trade skills. The government says the establishment of these colleges is a step in addressing the skill needs that Australia is experiencing in a number of traditional trades throughout the country.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The bill provides for funding agreements between the Australian government and the colleges that can be tailored to the needs and challenges of each region. While some governance and administrative requirements will be set as standard conditions in each funding agreement, the bill apparently does not prescribe any particular model to operate in any region. There are some hidden problems in all of this. I gather there are changes that would reduce the learning environment for trade qualifications, which means that courses that normally take, say, four years with appropriate on job training and work site experience will now possibly take only threeâand who knows what it will be in a few years; it may be two. I think we will be de-skilling the work force of Australia, particularly our young people, by casualising their training so they do not have the rigour of courses that are currently given in the TAFE system right around Australia.</para>
<para>Additional funding is being found for the Australian technical colleges initiative. Appropriations totalling $343.6 million over five years will provide for the allocation of funds to the colleges to support infrastructure development as well as meet the additional costs associated with the delivery of the specialised services that the colleges will provide. Presumably, that money will be taken away from the TAFE training area and from the growth that TAFE should have been experiencing in recent times. That is the reason we have a shortage of skilled people in Australia.</para>
<para>The bill is complementary to the Schools Assistance (Learning TogetherâAchievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Act 2004, through which the colleges may receive general recurrent grant funding in addition to supplementary funding. The supplementary funding is predicated on staff having to sign Australian workplace agreements which leave unions out of negotiations. For the people that will be working in the colleges there will be no tenure and no job security. Staff will be able to be picked up and thrown away at willâhardly good for stable workplace relations and also hardly good for an environment that good teachers and people can warm to.</para>
<para>The colleges are to have a governing body chaired by a local business person and consisting of local industry and community representatives that will ensure that the skills taught to students will be directly relevant to the needs of local industry, yet the unions that cover the trade skills and know the needs of industry inside out will be totally left out, being excluded from any input whatsoever. Each college which is a non-government school is supposed to be registered as a school in the state or territory in which it operates and accredited to deliver curriculum leading to achievement of the senior secondary certificate of education. But the state and territory governments are not convinced that they need these extra training facilities. It would be far better to expand the role of TAFE colleges and use their excellent resources, equipment and history to bridge this school to work gap, and it is a shame that we have not been able to get governments to talk together to make these things happen. I believe that even at this late stage talks should be going on. These features are supposed to allow the colleges to establish themselves as centres of excellence and to raise the profile and status of vocational pathways in schools, but the colleges are likely to be out on a limb and not part of the mainstream education system. This can only be seen as being exactly the same situation as that of the Australian School of Fine Furniture, which was established in Launceston by the Liberal Party, during one of its election spend-ups, to try to outdo a school run by the University of Tasmania in the south. The school in Launceston has now run out of money and has been bleating for more, and a bit has been supplied by the member for Bass. This school was established on an old model of one craftsman to one student. Although it is a useful way of teaching manual crafts, it is not practical or economic, given the sorts of costs involved in running it.</para>
<para>As with other school based programs, the legislative base for the Australian technical colleges will be underpinned by funding agreements with either state or territory governments or with the Australian Technical College Authority. The funding agreements will contain certain conditions under which funding will be allocated to colleges and will include a schedule of the payments to be made to each college over the term of the agreement. These conditions include forcing staff onto AWAs, which include taking away skills progression and pathway elements for teachers and will also probably include taking away the right to be a member of a union. Ongoing funding may also be contingent on colleges meeting specific eligibility criteriaâso if you are not following the criteria on staff recruitment then the staff are the ones likely to cop the displeasure and be removed.</para>
<para>This bill includes, as a condition of funding, a requirement for all colleges to provide reports covering financial expenditure and performance outcomes. This information, to be specified in the funding agreement, will include such information as the vocational education and training options being offered, academic outcomes, school leaver destinations and retention rates. The bill provides for an appropriation of $343.6 million over the period 2005 to 2009 to support the establishment and operation of the colleges. That is not a great deal over four years, especially if they are having to start from scratch, so I think it will be a long time before we see very much of these colleges and I believe this program is likely to be of little use in improving the training and skilling of Australia.</para>
<para>I have some real concerns about the direction of these proposalsâand I was also going to speak on the skills bill which was recently guillotined. I will mention some of the points I was going to make on that bill. I believe it is part of a very unpalatable package that is being forced onto Australia by this government. It seems to be giving the Commonwealth the power of veto over state and territory governments in VET planning. In the past this approval process was conducted by the Australian National Training Authority. There were also some severe conditions placed on funding decisions.</para>
<para>The question of choice of source of training could well be difficult for my state of Tasmania. Although the bill tries to provide more flexibility and competition for the providers of training, our stateâs small population would make it very difficult for providers to be able to keep standards up and provide the sort of training that suits the employer, as well as being affordable to both employer and apprentice. Centralised standards are okay in bigger states, but, of course, ANTA used to provide that flexibility to the smaller states by sharing training resources. I cannot see how a provider could survive if they had to play the market in Tasmania.</para>
<para>The introduction of workplace reforms poses a similar problem. Because of other legislation, TAFE would be excluded, and there may be a problem in even allowing TAFE to be involved. TAFE has provided an excellent structure to deliver apprenticeships and training places for a very broad range of skills. This proposal is more likely to limit what training can be given in the state if everyone is competing for the basic competencies, because these are the basis of funding and pay for trainers.</para>
<para>To have to adhere to complete implementation of competency based training rather than time based training requires the amendment of state legislation and awards to move to a completely competency based approach to VET, rather than a time based model. This would have a dramatic impact on the structure of the traditional apprenticeship system. Full competency based apprenticeships are strongly supported by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and opposed by the trade union movement. Increased flexibility and reduction in time, without a full competency based model, have been advocated by some states and have found some support within sections of the trade union movement, while being opposed by others.</para>
<para>Another aspect is the fact that opening up the TAFE facilities to private VET providers could, once again, limit the sort of training given. There will be no ability to anticipate trade shortages in an overall package; it will be kept to immediate short-term needs as the market of the day requires. Planning future directions for TAFE will be left to no-one in particularâand I doubt whether Tasmanian TAFEs or any other training organisation with some credibility will survive. It will open everything up to real mickey mouse courses that we are now finding exist around the place. They cannot provide a career path by incrementally increasing skills, as on-the-job experience can mix with skill development and also income. Some of the other conditions pose difficulties for everyone, not just Tasmanians. These new funding arrangements have not been discussed with the states, so there has not been any opportunity to consider the full impact of many of the proposed conditions on the delivery of vocational education and training around the country.</para>
<para>I am disappointed that ANTA is being abolished, because under ANTA there have been many programs that assist in the funding of adult literacyâprograms that I, like many other people who missed whole chunks of schooling for many reasons, relied on to gain the skills that I lacked. I am not sure that these programs will be considered as part of the new training schemes, as they are not directly requested by employers much of the time. It will again be left to the volunteers, who struggle to get resources for these programs, to organise who is going to do what and attract students who normally avoid any sort of learning like the plague because they are frightened to be a part of it. We are going to return to a society where those who had difficulties at school will be left at the bottom of the pile because, as hard as they try, there are no programs that cope with their particular problems.</para>
<para>I do not mind any school or training institution being more open to the private sector, and I am sure there are ways and means to help boost the bottom dollar of those institutions, but if we do it at the expense of quality training then we should really think again. Many training areas are reliant on the community anyway to bring in realistic training modules and work very well in conjunction with local business or industry. Why do we want to upset this so much by introducing these measures?</para>
<para>I have been looking at some of the training colleges that provide a haven for those who have dropped through the cracks of the ordinary training systems. Places such as Studentworks, in Launceston, and The Island, in Melbourne, have been highly successful and rely very much on good relations with all groupsâfederal, state and local governments, as well as unions, small business and industry. What is the future of these colleges under these new funding arrangements? This is not clear.</para>
<para>I do not think individual work contracts for TAFE or technical training staff will have a bearing on the quality of the teaching, and it will only bring standards down to the lowest common denominator. People will be appointed on what they are prepared to work for, not what they have the best skills for. We really need to make some amendments to this bill if it is to work and provide proper access to training for all people. I believe we should delete any reference to AWAs and individual contracts as part of the funding agreement. These contracts should not be related to good trainers, who would be put off by having to bargain for their jobs each year.</para>
<para>I certainly cannot agree with government funding being reduced as a consequence of more developed entrepreneurial business planning, because I think the smaller states would lose out considerably and would probably close down many of the programs already operating quite successfully in their communities. I am still not happy with ANTA being disbanded, without knowing what is to be put in its place and whether it will have some overall standard and ability to coordinate a lot of courses in the country and to look at the overall training that takes place.</para>
<para>TAFE has been an important part of tertiary training, and I am worried that it will lose its connection with other tertiary training institutions where students can access lines between the two. It is unfortunate that we have not built more links between TAFE and universities in Australia. I am unconvinced that any new colleges along the lines proposed by this bill are going to be more than just an expensive sideline to vocational education; the minister is trying to put a foot in the door to privatise college education. I do not believe that will work, Minister. The Labor Party have seen through that and it will be fought very strongly. We want a better deal for our kids, not one that is reliant on part-time teachers and casualised teachers and students who do not feel they have ownership of their jobs or a career path in their workplaces. I oppose the bill.</para>

<para>âI am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the <inline ref="R2330">Australian Technical Colleges (Flexibility in Achieving Australiaâs Skills Needs) Bill 2005</inline> this evening. Much has been said about Australian workplace agreements being part of the Australian technical colleges bill before the parliament tonight. I would like to inform the parliament that, two weeks ago, I was in the Pilbara at the West Angeles iron ore mine, which is a very large operation. There was not a single unionist in sight. The staff are all on AWAs. I have to say that it is an extraordinarily happy workplace. The No. 1 priority in that workplace is safety. It is the mantra of everybody on site, from the lowest paid to the highest paid employee. People there take safety seriously. The employees are happy with their jobs. The truck drivers on the site are being paid $120,000 a year to drive trucks at the mine. Yet the opposition continually paints AWAs as being somehow evil, that workers are disadvantaged and that things are not right in the workplace. But things are right. My experience at this iron ore mine brought home to me just how well AWAs can operate in all sorts of workplaces, and they can operate in that way in the proposed Australian technical colleges.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In his contribution a moment ago, the member for Lyons said that people have to be on guard for their jobs because they may lose them under an AWA. I would point out a couple of things to the member for Lyons. The first thing is that employers do not lightly, if ever, try to terminate employees who are good workers. Particularly in an environment of very low unemployment, an employer cannot afford to terminate an employee for no good reason. So there is an inbuilt protection in relation to that. Certainly as a past employer of many years I always understood that staff were your best asset and that you did not just lightly terminate a staff member.</para>
<para>The skills shortages that we see around the country exist just as much in Townsville and Thuringowa as they do anywhere else in the land. The emergence of skills shortages are a result of a complex set of factors and circumstances, including sustained economic growth under the Howard government, the globalisation of the economy, an ageing work force, a decline in fertility rates, a shift in labour market patterns, a poor image of the traditional trades and the low uptake of traditional trades by people historically not interested in the trades.</para>
<para>Traditionally, a business cycle goes through a period of growth of approximately eight years, with a subsequent period of contraction, followed by another wave of growth. However, since the early 1990s, Australiaâs economy has experienced continued growth. Under the Howard government, that growth has built up pressure on the demand for skilled labour. Whilst Australia has been experiencing a continuing period of growth, the globalisation of economies has also occurred. This has resulted in global competition for professional, paraprofessional and skilled trades employees. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reports that some one million Australians now work overseas, which represents a significant net loss of skilled and professional workers for the Australian economy.</para>
<para>In addition, during the 1990s, more than 250,000 young people were leaving school annually to join the work force or to undertake further education. It is expected that this will decline to 150,000 by 2010. Since the 1960s, fertility rates have also declined from average fertility rates of 3.5 babies per woman in 1961 to less than 1.9 in 1985 and to 1.7 in 2004.</para>
<para>The contemporary trends embraced by government agencies and large businesses to maximise short-term returns with a focus on downsizing, outsourcing and corporatisation has led to a significant decline in investment in training by those agencies and businesses. Consequently, there has been a dramatic reduction in the number of apprenticeships being sponsored by these organisations. As Toner in 2003 suggested, the public sector accounts for around one-third of the decline in the intake of apprentices over the past 10 years. Similarly, the rapid growth of labour hire firms in response to these measures has resulted in Australia having the highest percentage of casualised workers in the industrialised world.</para>
<para>It has long been acknowledged that the New Apprenticeships program has been successful in increasing participation in structured training and in opening up new and more flexible opportunities across occupations and industries that have not had a history of structured training. However, the recent evaluation of the New Apprenticeships scheme by the Department of Education, Science and Training, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Skills at work</inline>, recommended that further examination be undertaken on how growth in apprenticeships has related to the demand for skills in the economy.</para>
<para>While there has been a recent increase in the uptake of trades by older workers, employers have tended to focus on young people, particularly school leavers, as their primary source of potential apprenticeship trainees. With the declining number of young people and the complexity of career pathways available, I believe that insufficient attention has been paid to attracting women, people with a disability, and Indigenous and older workers to the trades.</para>
<para>All these are reasons why the Australian technical colleges will help fix the skills shortage in the economy, as I have outlined today. I certainly welcome a technical college in Townsville. I want to pay tribute to the Townsville Australian technical college consortium, who have put in a very good bid in the request for tender. This group was originally under the leadership of the Thuringowa City Council. I also pay tribute to Mayor Les Tyrrell and CEO Lyn Russell for their vision in strongly backing this opportunity provided by the government to have an Australian technical college in Australiaâs largest tropical city.</para>
<para>A very keen and hardworking executive group, chaired by Philip Begley, was formed as an interim steering committee to direct the participation of the request for proposal and tender and the business plan for the college. The Townsville Chamber of Commerce, engineering clusters, Catholic education, the Yalga-binbiâthe Indigenous group for community developmentâthe Housing Industry Association, the North Queensland region of councils and commerce, which is a very powerful group representing the sectors of the economy that the government was interested in attracting, all want to be part of this. There is now a nominated consortium membership, which includes FINPAC financial advisers, United Goninan, SunMetals, TAFE, Angus Knight, Queensland Nickel, James Cook University, Girvan Engineering and the Townsville Regional Group Apprentices Scheme.</para>
<para>I am very pleased as the local member that such a powerful group has been assembled and has worked so very hard in putting forward to the government an outstanding bid. In the days and months ahead, all of those bids from around the Commonwealth will be assessed by Minister Gary Hardgrave, who has also done an outstanding job in steering this new proposal through the parliament to fruition. I know that Minister Hardgrave will be very proud when we see the first Australian technical college open early next year.</para>
<para>The colleges will further strengthen Australiaâs vocational and technical education system and provide pride and excellence in the acquisition of trade skills. They will become centres of excellence in trade training, attracting capable and competent students who want to begin training for a career in the trades and who will also be completing their senior secondary education. In that sense, I report to the parliament that a number of state high schools in my electorate in Townsville very keenly embraced this concept. They want to be part of it. They want to see their students participating. They want them to get through years 11 and 12, but at the same time they want them to establish the fundamentals for a trade that they will be going into when they finish high school. I thank all school principals in Townsville and Thuringowa who have warmly welcomed and participated in the establishment of an Australian technical college in Townsville. I have been constrained by others in terms of how long I might speak. As there is another speaker, I will end my comments there. I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para class="block">This bill provides for the establishment and operation of Australian technical colleges, ATCs, which is one of the governmentâs election commitmentsâa commitment that was made in the heat and rush of an election campaign. While the result of that election campaign may well be known today, as in all election campaigns governments get very jittery about how they will fare and you could see them developing this policy on the run. The evidence of that was in the lack of detail and thought that went into the policy. And now, as the government is developing this policy, we see the lack of connectivity within that which they are trying to achieve as well as the cut in the funding that was promised originally in the election campaign.</para>
<para>The government has proposed just 24 colleges to be in operation by 2008. The government intends each college will accommodate up to 300 years 11 and 12 students, a total of 7,200 when fully operational, and implementation will be phased in from 2006. The Minister for Vocational and Technical Education has indicated that announcements on successful proposals to open colleges in 2006 will be made by the end of this month, with announcements regarding colleges to open in 2007 and 2008 to be made by the end of the year.</para>
<para>The bill provides for funding agreements between government and the colleges. Funding will be dependent on a set of conditions, many of which are not detailed in this legislation. Colleges must be registered as schools under state and territory legislation and accredited to deliver the relevant senior school certificate, and as such you would have thought that government would have consulted and worked with the states and territories much closer to ensure that the delivery of the senior school certificates is in line with educational principles right across the board and not just those of the federal government. The explanatory memorandumâbut not the legislationâstates that colleges must also be registered training organisations, RTOs, or must have formal links with an RTO to deliver the accredited training under a national training package qualification. It might be appropriate at this point to note that, while the government is putting forward money for national training packages, it is the same government that strips money out of training and has also shut down the Australian National Training Authority. On the one hand, it reassumes responsibility and redistributes funds in the view of providing training, but in coming to that position it shuts down fine and worthy training organisations that have delivered many trained people to our economy.</para>
<para>The bill appropriates $343.6Â million over five years in supplementary funding for colleges over and above general recurrent schools and training funding. Other general recurrent funding will be payable to the ATCs by the Commonwealth under the Schools Assistance (Learning TogetherâAchievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Act 2004 and by the states and territories through their relevant schools funding mechanisms and training funding under the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992. Although not mentioned in the bill, the government has indicated in both the second reading speech and the explanatory memorandum that the conditions of funding will include industrial flexibilityâI will come back to that in a minuteâspecifically provision for Australian workplace agreements and performance pay, and college principals will have responsibility for the employment of staff overseen by an industry led governing authority.</para>
<para>Whatever we might think of government, I am sure there are many fine peopleâin fact, at the end of my contribution I will make mention of a specific consortium in my electorate, the Springfield Education Cityâwho would be able to pull all this together and do something fair and equitable and be worthy of providing the sort of training that is required. But I am very concerned, as are many Labor members, about industrial flexibility. What this means, and what we see again from the government, is that it is prepared to go to any length to achieve its ideological goals, even if it is at the expense of training, of skills, of investment in infrastructure and of developing the economy, developing peopleâs lives, because without this so-called âindustrial flexibilityâ that the government talks about and without its being in control of the industrial agenda the Australian technical colleges will simply not go ahead.</para>
<para>We have seen this in other areas of infrastructure provision where the government puts a caveat that it will provide the money for schools or money for roadsâdesperately needed Commonwealth responsibility linked fundsânot on the basis of need, because the need exists, but on the basis that ideology is followed through. I find that offensive and I find that not in the spirit or principle in which you would put together an Australian technical college of any description or any other package. If you are committed to the colleges, if you are committed to the training and if you are committed to dealing with the skills crisis, then deal with it on its own merits. Do not wrap it up in something else; do not wrap it up in industrial relations conditions. Keep to the principle that you are trying to achieve. That is what the government should be doing, but that is not what the government is doing.</para>
<para>There is a range of problems with this bill, and there are several contentious issues which Labor believes highlight the governmentâs failure to address the nationâs skills crisis. The government is investing $343.6 million over five years in Australian technical colleges at a time when it is offering no significant new funding for the Commonwealth-State Training Funding Agreement covering TAFE.</para>
<para>You would have thought that any government seriously wanting to address a skills crisis sooner rather than laterânow rather than laterâwould look at the existing structure and mechanism and say, âHow can we the federal government actually participate and support the current system and even improve the current system?â What the government has done is a clever little act of deciding that, if it cannot have TAFE, if it cannot be TAFE, it will just create its own TAFE. We are going to have two parallel systems side by side, one which has been established for many decades and which is very successful but which is struggling in some areas and which could do with a healthy injection of funds and another, the Australian technical colleges, which are basically just a rebranding, a renaming, a rebadging.</para>
<para>If people do not believe me on this and if they think that I am going a bit too far, all they have to do is look at the application forms, the supporting documentation for ATCs. The form says very specifically that the government is not looking for new infrastructure. It is not looking for new facilities or new buildings. It is not necessarily interested in building new things; it is interested in rebadging in its own image. The evidence of that is in the documentation, the application form. In the very first line, it says that an ATC will be formed by a consortium of key educational providers âsuch asââand the very first one it lists is TAFE. It is looking to TAFE to come in and be the provider. If it is good enough for TAFE to be a provider and part of a consortium, with schools, industry and so forth, it can do that. The Commonwealth can do that by negotiating with the states and with TAFE and delivering the same quality, resources and services to students as it otherwise would through its ATCs.</para>
<para>I understand why the government would not want to do this: it does not have the Commonwealth moniker stamped on it. The government has stripped funding for roads away from local authorities as untied fundingâripped it outâand given it back through black spot and other funding. As long as it has a Commonwealth tag and you can put up a nice neat road sign that says âMoney provided by the Commonwealthâ or âFunded by the Commonwealthâ, it is okay. The intent is not to provide the skills, the training and the jobs; it is just to rebadge something in the Commonwealthâs own image. It is a very frightening concept when you start to think that through.</para>
<para>The documentation specifies 24 areas. It is important to look at where those areas are. They are a key indicator of the commitment of the government to training all Australiansâits commitment to young people. In New South Wales, the ATCs will be in the Hunter, the Illawarra, Queanbeyan, Port Macquarie, Lismore, Ballina, Dubbo, Gosford and Western Sydney. It does not take a political genius to work out that they are in either marginal Labor seats that were targeted during the campaign or straight-out National Party or Liberal Party seats.</para>
<para>In Victoria, there is Geelong, Warrnambool, Bendigo, Sunshine, Bairnsdale, Sale and eastern Melbourneâagain in either, in the case of one or two, marginal Labor seats which were targeted by the coalition during the election or, in the case of the rest, Liberal or National Party seats. Again, you do not have to be a political genius to work out the point of these in these particular areas. Fair dinkum: if you want to provide something for young people and deal with the skills crisis, do it on a needs basis, do it on a skills crisis basis, not on a political seat basis.</para>
<para>In Queensland it is even worse. There is Townsville, in a marginal Liberal seat. There is Gladstoneâand we have the member for Hinkler with us in the chamber tonight.</para>

<para>âAbsolutely, a fine member. I am sure he is very happy to get an Australian technical college, as I would be in my electorateâas any of us would be, because we have been starved of Commonwealth funding for so long. Just a mere few crumbs would be enough to satisfy us. Just give us a little bit for our electorates. But of course there will be nothing in Oxley. We have Townsville, Gladstone, north Brisbaneâagain marginal Liberal territoryâand the Gold Coast. They are all in Liberal or National Party seats. Fair go! It is 100 per cent. Give us one. Donât our young people deserve skills? Donât our young people deserve to get a job? What is the go here? It is hard for the government. I ask them to explain this and give us some rationale as to why only people in Liberal and National Party seats deserve to have skills training and extra funding to try to deal with the skills crisis. I think not.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>In Western Australia it is even more dire. There are only twoâPerth South, one of the most marginal seats in Australia, an ALP seat. I am sure the Liberal candidate at the time would have made hay as much as he could in trying to plug an ATC. It did not help him, though. And there is the Pilbara. Again it is 100 per cent. You are really going for the full gong. You expected to pick up the seat of Swan, but you did not. In Tasmania the coalition had to pick up some area. They had to look at one area, so they went for Northern Tasmania. Again, I do not have to go too far to explain this. And, in the Northern Territory, there is one in Darwin, another target area for the coalition. Fair enough. If you want to do something for skills and the skills crisis, do it but do it properly. Do it so that there is actually some benefit for young people. Do not do something that is based on the voting patterns of other people within those electorates. The government has failed in trying to deliver something wider and broader in this program.</para>
<para>Government members made quite a bit of how workers are pretty safeâtalking about the industrial relations connectionâbecause we have low unemployment. But government members forget this: if you have a specific skill, yes, it is easy enough to get a job, but many workers out there are under a great deal of threat. If they work in a factory, as unskilled labour or in an area where there are many hundreds or thousands of employees, they do not weigh too much in the sort of power that bosses have over them. I would caution government members about the way they speak about workers, because they really do undermine their own position as well as that of workers in the way they fare in the power imbalance, as it were, between them and their employers.</para>
<para>Other documentationâagain, not in the billâsignals that infrastructure funding made available be subject to the Commonwealthâs national code of practice for the construction industry. Again, the government is wrapping up ideology in trying to provide funding for skills. We are led to understand by this that, if it does not meet the Commonwealthâs national code of practice for the construction industry because of a different state system, we simply do not get one. This is a real risk and a real problem for all those industry and education people who, in good faith, are putting forward consortium proposals that could be let down.</para>
<para>We keep talking about the skills crisis and how long it takes to train people upâan apprentice takes four years and people in the health professions can take up to 10 years. It takes up to 10 years for a specialist and five or seven years for a doctor and so forth. That is a long time, so you really have to plan ahead. But you have now been in government for nearly a decade. When did government wake up to this? We have been beating the door of infrastructure and beating the door of the skills crisis, but it has been falling on deaf ears and now the government says, âItâs going to take many years to do something.â What do you wantâanother 10? Do you want 20 years before you get something done? Is that how long it is going to take?</para>
<para>I think the government ought to look back at its own record. Apart from an economy which was better in parts than most, as John Howard said when he came into office in 1996 and inherited the good economic reforms that the Hawke and Keating governments put in place, the government could have used that economic windfall to do something more than just give some money out to people close to election time. It could have done something strategic and given a bit of national leadershipânot for today, because it is always easy to look good on the day. I am talking about five, 10 or 15 years down the track when people will look way back. They will look at the legacy and say, âWhy didnât government make those tough decisions then about economic reform, about the skills crisis, about training needs and about what we needed to do to make sure that we had year after year, 14 years, of economic growth?â</para>
<para>Reform was not delivered by this governmentâwell acknowledgedâbut by the Hawke and Keating governments during the eighties and the nineties. Where will you guys be in 10 years time? Will people look back and make those same comments? Will they see that the legacy you left to young Australians was that you trained them, you skilled them up and you made them a high-paid, high-skilled, efficient work force able to deal with their place on a global scale? I do not think that is going to be the story, and the evidence is right here in this bill.</para>
<para>I will end by saying a couple of things about the Springfield education park. In my view, this is by any measure probably the most significant consortium put together for an Australian technical college. I have looked at its proposal. It would be one of the strongest and most robust proposals, would present exceptional value for money for the government and would provide one of the best education and training facilities in a high-need area through the western corridor. We have the young people who are looking for the skills and work, we have the land, we have the industry and we have the cooperationâwe have everything it takes. The application process should be simply based on merit. We hear Brendan Nelson talk about merit in education and proper testing and assessment. Minister, here is a chance for you to put it into practice. If you really based it on proper criteria and assessment, you would go out there and have a look at the Springfield education park in my electorate and you would see that it is probably one of the top facilities in Australia. But we are not going to get one, not because we do not have the best proposal; we are just not going to get one because the government is not interested in the western corridor. That is where the high needs are; that is not where it is interested. It is interested in keeping itself busy in National and Liberal Party seats.</para>
<para>My message to the government is: have a good close look and a good cold hard think about what you are trying to achieve with this. You have already won the election, so move beyond that and start thinking of the Australian economy, start thinking of young people, start thinking of the skills crisis we have in this country and start doing something about it today.</para>

<para>âOn Saturday, 4 June I met with members of the Gravity Community Park Youth CommitteeâJordan Purcell, Kayla Iby, Chanetane Gudgeon, Kimberley Bargache, Rebecca Dunleavy and Nissa Harveyâat the Gravity youth centre in Lake Haven in the electorate of Shortland. They are a very impressive group of young people who are committed to bringing the dream of the Gravity community youth park to a reality. Gravity youth park is located within Lake Haven. It is in an area of Wyong Shire that has a high level of youth unemployment, with the 2001 census showing that the unemployment rate for 15- to 24-year-olds was around 20 per cent. It is an area that has a low socioeconomic background and the median wage is around $600 to $799 per week. Gravity youth centre has had an attendance of some 15,690 young people since September 2003 and has an average monthly attendance of 1,045. Two hundred and sixty local people have signed up and become formal members and regularly attend the centre.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Gravity Community Park is an exciting project and it came directly from the inspiration of the young people. Within Lake Haven and Gorokan young people came together and decided that they wanted to change the negative perception of the area. They decided that they could do this by working together and consulting with the community. It is not an area that has been without problems. The centre has had its problems in the past, not from the young people who use it but from some of the other young peopleâand some older too, I might addâaround the area.</para>
<para>These young people are inspirational and this project is something that would inspire any member in this House. They want to come together and transform vacant land into a family friendly picnic area with a barbecue area, plant trees and gardens, build new pathways, community sculptures, mosaics and public seating and set up an amphitheatre where they can have community performances. It is really including the community in the youth centre, making it a living area and creating an environment where everyone will feel welcome.</para>
<para>To date the project has passed through a number of phases. It has been through the consultation process. Wyong council has gone through the draft project briefing. Between March and June this year they have undertaken the construction of the youth mosaics. Between February and April they commenced a WorkWise landscaping course and between now and November they need to bring about the final stages of the project. I have to acknowledge that both the Wyong Shire Council and Elcom have donated money towards this the project. I thank them for their support.</para>
<para>I would like to share some of the thoughts of the young people I met with on that day. I have a letter from Jordan Purcell in which he pointed out that the project was:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Â ... initiated by young locals using the youth centre with aims to improve local recreational facilities, allow young people the opportunity to contribute to the planning of their community and help reform current attitudes towards youth.</para>

<para>Chanetane said:</para>

<para>Kimberley asked for my support and the support of the community. Rebecca said that they really needed support for their project. Nissa said that there are so many good things about this place. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talker>
<para>âI rise tonight to compliment Professor Patrick Parkinson and his task force on their final report on child support which was handed down last week. The report is balanced and it is in the best interests of the child. More importantly, the recommendations will provide additional fairness and equity for both parents. However, the problem is that, all good intentions aside, the report is only a worthless document until such time as the government commits to introducing the changes.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I am particularly pleased with the central recommendation that the child support formula be changed to more accurately reflect the costs of raising a child and that both parentsâ self-support amount will be made the same. Allowing the cost of providing a home for children even if that is only for one day a week was also a key breakthrough for non-residential parents. The task force consideration of matters relating to paternity was also a step forward and would provide men incorrectly caught up in the child support system with greater opportunity for recourse. Those who were forced to pay large sums for travel to exert their contract rights would have that take into account during the assessment process.</para>
<para>The task force recommendation regarding additional income earned through a second job or overtime during the first five years after separation would be well received and struck a good balance for parents trying to re-establish themselves following family breakdown. I remain concerned, however, about the Child Support Agencyâs powers with regard to capacity to earn, but the task force has at least made it clear that a personâs state of health and other caring responsibilities should be taken into account. I raise this particular point because a number of my constituents, because of the financial pressures put on them, have taken their own lives.</para>
<para>I wanted to raise this issue and stress to Pru Goward, the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, the inequities in the Child Support Agency and the way it operates. I sent her a letter covering six very detailed submissions and I have to say that the Sex Discrimination Commissioner has shown significant commonsense on the subject and has been very fair on the emotive issue of child support. She has discussed at length with Professor Patrick Parkinson the issues raised within the case examples in my submission to her. In her response to my submission Commissioner Goward had this to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It may be that, given the limits of the terms of reference of Professor Parkinsonâs review further investigation will be needed into the processes of the agency and its use of discretionary powers.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">She has obviously picked up the very real concerns within the submissions that I gave her about the draconian and intrusive powers of the Child Support Agency that Professor Parkinson unfortunately could not address in his terms of reference when he put together his report.</para>
<para>Given the Child Support Agencyâs disgraceful record with regard to decision making and its treatment of child support clients, I believe it is vital that the Child Support Agencyâs punitive powers be held up to scrutiny. In fact, now that Professor Parkinsonâs task force has done its job, the government should not only implement these changes but clean up the whole system by way of an independent inquiry into the Child Support Agency and how it operates with the draconian powers that I have described. When you read, as I have, the thousands of cases that I have received and which I am compiling in a database, you can understand why there needs to be an independent inquiry into the Child Support Agency and the way it operates to ascertain whether what it is doing is within the law and appropriate in this day and age in terms of accessing, as an example, the joint banking accounts of payers who have gone into a second relationship and who have had their bank accounts raided. It needs to be looked at. My view on this issue has been very public. I believe that the government should undertake an independent inquiry as quickly as it can to ensure that these unrealistic powers that the Child Support Agency has are looked into and removed as quickly as possible.</para>

<para>âI rise tonight to pay respect to the life of Frederick Douglas Quinane. Fred passed away in his 84th year on 8 June 2005 and is survived by his wife, Mary, his four children, Anne, Jack, Cate and Terry, and his grandchildren, Luke, Mary, Kiera, Annie, Paul, Corey, Patrick, Rhiannon and Michael, and his extended family. Fredâs life was celebrated last Tuesday at a Mass in the Sacred Heart Church in Pearce in Canberra. His daughter Anne and son Jack both spoke beautifully about their father and it was clear to all present that Fred Quinane was blessed by a very loving family. Anne and Jack spoke of Fredâs conviction, his high standards and strong character, his deep Christian faith and his abiding commitment to community service and to the disadvantaged. His fatherâs war service at Gallipoli had a lasting effect on Fred and his family.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Fred left school at the age of 14 and worked at Murdochâs Menswear until his 18th birthday when he was sacked because his employer did not want to pay him adult wages. The lessons learnt at that early age stayed with Fred throughout his life and gave him a strong sense of duty and an enduring concern for others. When World War II broke out in 1939 Fred was prevented from enlisting because the factory he was working in was declared a protected defence industry. He kept trying and eventually succeeded in 1943. In 1946 Fred met his future wife, Mary. They were married in 1947 and moved to Canberra in 1948. Over the next 59 years they raised a family and from all accounts were blessed by many years of happiness. As with the story of any family, there were also sad times with the death of their second child, Kathleen, at age six months, and their fifth child, Paul, at age 27.</para>
<para>Fred had been a member of the ALP since the age of 14 in the St George area of Sydney and transferred his membership to the Canberra branch upon his arrival in 1948. In 1951 he was selected to lead the Labor team in the ACT Advisory Council elections and when the office of council chairman became an elected position in 1955 Fred won it unopposed. That Advisory Council later evolved into the ACT Legislative Assembly.</para>
<para>In 1959 Fred stepped back from political life but remained a dedicated public servant and continued to serve the community through his involvement with local charities, the Public Service and community projects. In the late 1950s Fred coordinated volunteers to build the OâDonnell Youth Centre in Braddon with their own hands. He then moved this volunteer work force on to build St Brigidâs Church in Dickson. In the late 1960s he was one of the leaders in the push for a Catholic club in Canberra. In 1971 he turned the first sod on the future site of the Canberra Southern Cross Club with club patron Bishop Morgan and he became the clubâs foundation president. Fred served as a member of the Southern Cross Club board for several terms and served one term as the national president of the Licensed Clubs Association.</para>
<para>He served on organising committees for charitable organisations like St Vincent de Paul and the Snow Foundation. He is remembered as a great leader and organiser who could elevate the performance and standing of any team. Fred worked tirelessly in several roles within the Public Service, including as the Senior Trade Commissioner in San Francisco. The trade commissioner service gave Fred the affectionate and unofficial title of âFather of the Trade Commissioner Serviceâ. For his professional achievements, Fred was awarded a Centenary of Federation Australian Public Service medal in 2001.</para>
<para>After retiring in 1981 Fred became the first executive director of the Canberra Association for Regional Development, the forerunner to the Canberra Business Council. He later became a member of the National Capital Planning Authority. There is a plaque on the corner of Northbourne Avenue and Alinga Street in Canberra city recognising his contribution as Chairman of the Advisory Council.</para>
<para>Fred Quinane will long be remembered as a loving father, grandfather, husband, co-worker, committed public servant, politician, charity worker, community leader and friend. I place on the record my appreciation and that of our community in Canberra to Fred for his commitment to public service, his love for friends and family and, most of all, for providing such a wonderful example, to all who met him, of a life well lived. Our sympathies, condolences and very warmest of wishes go to Mary and Fredâs family.</para>

<para>âHe is a good man. Unfortunately, Archbishop Aspinall has withdrawn the licence of Bishop Chislett because of Bishop Chislettâs support of Catholic orthodoxy in the Anglican Church.

In the minutes available to me, I want to state extracts from the farewell sermon by Bishop Chislett at the pontifical high mass.</para>

In other words, together we have brought men and women to know the Lord Jesus Christ as their Saviour. We have become âEvangelical Catholics.â Our hearts truly âburn within usâ as we allow Jesus to speak to us through the Scriptures, and we continually recognise him in the âBreaking of the Breadâ (Luke 24). I am reminded of some words of Pope Benedict when he was still just dear old âCardinal Ratzingerâ in May 2004:</para>
<para>âMany people perceive Christianity as something institutional rather than as an encounter with Christ, which explains why they donât see it as a source of joy. If we stay with this impression, we do not live the essence of Christianity, which is an ever new encounter, an event thanks to which we can encounter the God who speaks to us, who approaches us, who befriends us. It is critical to come to this fundamental point of a personal encounter with God, who also today makes himself present, and who is contemporary. If one finds this essential centre, one also understands all the other things. But if this encounter is not realized, which touches the heart, all the rest remains like a weight, almost like something absurd. We need to understand Christianity in a personal way, from the point of view of an encounter with Christ.â</para>

<para class="block">Following my consecration, and then my suspension, I received so many personal letters of encouragement from Anglican, Continuing Anglican, Roman Catholic, Russian, Greek and Antiochan Orthodox leaders, indicating that they understand full well just how difficult it now is for those Anglicans who really believe the Catholic Faith. For example, a well-known Roman Catholic Monsignor (not from Brisbane Archdiocese), the author of a number of significant books, began his letter thus:</para>
<para>âDear Bishop David,</para>
<para>âPardon my tardiness, but please accept my belated congratulations on the great step taken. It had to be done, otherwise the decay and deceit would just roll on and on, as the good people drift and wander.</para>
<para>â... I have followed some of the responses, positive, vague, silly and downright nasty, and that confused range of reactions should assure you that taking a stand for Faith and Order is always costly.â</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I return to what Bishop Chislett said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">For most of its history, All Saintsâ has stood firm for the undiluted Catholic Faith. Its people have always been taught that they are Catholics first and Anglicans second (the order we claim is required of us by our historic Anglican formularies). In fact, that is a summary! As I said in my Annual Meeting Address back in February, we are first of all CHRISTIANS; then we are CATHOLICS; then we are EVANGELICALS; and then, I guess, if after all that thereâs still some time left over, we are ANGLICANS! Thatâs our priority order. In that respect we are different to those parishes that merely have a âhigh churchâ flavour and believe in a separate religion called âAnglicanism.â In fact, Anglicans like us have been left between THE Rock and a Hard Place by the relentless departure of liberal Anglicanism from the Faith once delivered to the Saints in all sorts of different areas, but objectively and sacramentally in the ordination of women which, as so many women and men around here will tell you, destroys not just the iconic value of the nuptial imagery at the heart of the Scriptures, the Gospel and the Faith, but also our confidence in the sacramental life of dioceses like this one that have embraced the changes.</para>

<para>âI wish to bring to the attention of the House tonight an excellent program initiated in and near my electorate of Prospect called the Vietnam Vision Project. The Vietnam Vision Project involves 36 medical practitioners and support staff travelling to Vietnam to operate on people suffering from cataracts. This is the third year that this initiative has taken place. From 29 May 2005, for two weeks, six ophthalmologists, eight general practitioners, seven optometrists, two dentists, two pharmacists and support staff travelled to four provinces in the Mekong Delta and central Vietnam. Over 1,000 people received a vital cataract operation from this group. By way of interest, I note that the dentists play a particularly interesting role in this delegation to Vietnam. They actually play the role of the anaesthetist. Because the group was not able to find any anaesthetists to do the work required for a cataract operation, the dentists did the work of the anaesthetist.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>A report from the health ministry of Vietnam revealed that in 2003, over 460,000 people were suffering from bilateral blindness and 890,000 people were blind in one eye. Cataracts are the major cause of blindness for people over 50. I congratulate Vietnam Vision for the wonderful initiative of dealing with this health problem. The project was initiated, and is led, by Dr Phuoc Vo, a medical practitioner who is extremely active in many community organisations in my electorate and surrounding electorates.</para>
<para>Fundraising has been arranged by the United Vietnamese Buddhist Congregation in Australia and New Zealand and the Vietnamese-Australian Buddhist Assistance Trust. Funding support has also been given by the Rotary clubs of Cabramatta and Liverpool West, and the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists. I congratulate each of these organisations. Each cataract operation costs around $A100. This program is for poor rural dwellers who have not received any help for cataracts in the past. These people are in great need of assistance and I congratulate everyone involved.</para>

<para>âI rise to speak this evening on a matter of great concern in my electorate. The north-west coast of Tasmania is known as one of Australiaâs greatest farming regions. Our red soils, clean air and abundant rainfall are the envyof farmers across the countryâmany of whom, as we know, are unfortunately struggling with the effects of a prolonged drought. With our natural advantages, Tasmaniaâs north-west coast grows some of the highest quality produce that you will find anywhere in the world, but this industry, the backbone of my electorateâs economy, is at risk due to an attitude of some corporate giants which can only be described as un-Australian.</para>

<para>Companies such as McDonaldâs, Coles and Woolworths like to promote their fresh vegetables but what they do not tell you is how they continually demand that farmers accept ever lower prices for that produce. And, at the same time, the supermarket duopoly seems to give no second thought to importing produce from overseas and slapping on a common label. Increasingly, we are finding that âHomebrandâ does not mean âhome-grownâ, and justifiably the issue of country of origin food labelling has come to the fore.</para>
<para>I am proud that this government has made its position clear on mandatory food labelling and that it will in no way countenance the watering down of existing laws. For north-west Tasmanian farmers, however, the recent decision by McDonaldâs to end an exclusive deal for the supply of only Australian potatoes has dealt a savage blow. McDonaldâs decision led directly to Simplot Australia cutting potato contracts in the north-west coast of Tasmania by some 15 per centâa massive cut for an industry already struggling with low prices.</para>
<para>On Wednesday, thousands of people are expected to attend a rally across the road from the local McDonaldâs store in Devonport, to protest against this un-Australian decision, and I plan to be by their side. I stand 100 per cent behind farmers in my electorateâand those farmers throughout our nationâwho are demanding that companies such as McDonaldâs, Woolworths and Coles stop turning their backs on regional and rural Australia in the name of profits.</para>
<para>I would like to congratulate one north-west Tasmanian McDonaldâs franchisee for committing to use only locally grown potatoes. But this only raises the question of why McDonaldâs refuses to take the same stance at a national level. If the company can allow one of its franchisees to say that he will only stock French fries made from locally grown potatoes, why will it not direct that all its restaurants do likewise?</para>
<para>We know McDonaldâs does not like to be seen as a greedy, profit-driven multinational, and so it was no surprise to discover that it responded to the criticism. You can tell McDonaldâs is more than a little embarrassed, however, when you read the question-and-answer media statement it issued earlier this month, in which it is obvious the company failed to answer its own questions. For instance, McDonaldâs poses the question:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Is it true that McDonaldâs doesnât treat its suppliers fairly?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">But instead of a straight no or yes, the answer was a hollow comment about long-term relationships with suppliers. And, of course, McDonaldâs does not even bother asking itself the question about whether it treats farmers fairly, because no amount of spin can explain the growersâ miserly share of every serve of fries sold. I wonder what consumers would think if they knew that farmers receive a miserly $225 a tonne for potatoes and McDonaldâs sells that same tonne for $18,200 as French fries.</para>
<para>This is also an issue about social conscience. Where does the drive for company profit end? The drive to profit at the expense of all else has no bounds as far as these companies are concerned. It is time that they realised their social responsibilities to our society and played fair with our producers. All producers are asking for is a fair price and a fair go. I appreciate that companies such as McDonaldâs, Woolworths and Coles employ a great many Australians, but in their pursuit of even greater profits they are putting at risk the viability of Australiaâs primary industries. I will be at the rally on Wednesday because I believe a message must be sent to companies such as McDonaldâs to show social responsibility. Importing potatoes when we grow the worldâs best, and at a competitive price, is simply un-Australian.</para>

The highlight of the visit was a 40-kilometre trip in an open boat from New Georgia Island to Gizo. A tropical storm during the trip left everyone drenched despite the fact that we were wearing wet-weather gear.

I thank the government and the people of the Solomon Islands for their hospitality. I also give a very big thank you to Neil Bessell, the delegation secretary, for assistance above and beyond the call of duty. And I should not forget to thank the boat driver, who brought us all safely through the stormâthere was no preselection needed in any of those electorates!</para>

<para>âIt gives me great pleasure to report on the success of a pilot training program in my electorate of Franklin. I am referring to the certificate II course in community work recently completed in Clarendon Vale and Bridgewater-Gagebrook. Access to training is a huge barrier to overcome for people in disadvantaged suburbs. Neighbourhood houses and family support in my electorate provide a facility for women, single-parent and two-parent familiesâamongst othersâto gather and learn in an informal environment. These people, who traditional schooling failed, now wish to re-enter the work force and need to access formal training and education. They need skill development and, more importantly, workplace opportunities.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">APW Training, which is part of the Anglicare organisation, obtained funding from the VET priority placements programâor PPPâto run a program for people returning to the work force, people with disabilities and mature age people on a benefit. Training took place in the local environmentâin this case neighbourhood houses in Gagebrook and Clarendon Vale. This was a brave move and a welcome initiative from APW. Enrolments exceeded expectationsâthere were 12 at Clarendon Vale and 14 at Gagebrook. Participants on the course had to overcome many problems, but lateral thinking and committed resources produced solutions that enabled all participants to continue. At graduation ceremonies last week, graduates told of their pride, increased confidence and higher self-esteem not to mention the camaraderie with fellow students that will develop into long-lasting friendships. Out of 26 enrolments, 24 students graduated last week. TAFE and other education and training providers would kill for that kind of retention rate. Medical reasons accounted for the two who did not finish.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Hard on the heels of this success, celebrations are a touch guarded because, in spite of the employersâ rave reviews of students during their work placements, certificate II graduates need to go on and complete certificate III to be employed in the field. There are employers waiting for this group to attain their level III certification. Funding is desperately needed to enable the next step of this training program to commence. In the interests of the participants, potential employers and the community, the certificate III course should start as soon as possible. VET PPP funding is now somewhere between the Australian government and the states. Talks continue between federal and state bodies, but unfortunately government departments move slowly. I have had discussions with the relevant ministers in this place to find the money to ensure this pilot program delivers the certificate III in community work to these 24 participants. The vibes are positive.</para>

<para>âLet me say that I am no prude. What adults want to watch in the privacy of their homes is largely up to them. Some material which is broadcast on the <inline font-style="italic">Big Brother</inline> program at times when children could be watching leaves a lot to be desired. There is nothing wrong with nudity in context. There is nothing wrong with adult themes in context as part of cinema or television programs. But this form of light entertainment has no artistic merit whatsoever and no justification for the gratuitous sex that it offers. We have a reasonably good censorship regime in this country. We have general exhibition, parental guidance, two levels of M certificationâone requiring the accompaniment of adultsâand the R classification category. Everyone knows what they are watching. We understand that X classification films are not generally available for exhibition in cinemas. They are made and distributed in the ACT and the Northern Territory.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The government did not approve the move towards non-violent erotica, which would have mollified Australians into believing that they were watching something a bit naughty but not too harmful. If this is the standard we set for the exhibition of films in cinemas, where people choose to pay their money, or for their sale as videos then are we not entitled to expect that free-to-air television maintains the same if not a higher standard? Why? Because by their very definition free-to-air films are available to all Australians and hold a privileged place in Australian households. We are therefore entitled to believe that classification is more important in this context.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">People do not deserve to be affronted by material that would otherwise be excluded under normal censorship provisions. For that reason, I understand the anger of people who have been affronted by <inline font-style="italic">Big Brother</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Big Brother Uncut</inline>. Surely we have not stooped to such a level in Australia in free-to-air television that community debate centres around whether Michelle and Glenn had real sex or not. Quite apart from the mind-numbing banality of most of this reality television, do we really need to further degrade the standards of Australian television production and presentation to such a pathetic level? The program, to which so many people have objected, cannot be justified on the grounds of artistic merit. Let us hope it is not a genuine reflection of Australian society, the other classic justification. Let us be frank: some episodes are nothing more than gratuitous sex and innuendo, and I seriously question whether our censorship authorities, particularly Channel 10 internally and the ABA, are doing their job.

Whaling in Australian waters is indeed unacceptableâit is as simple as that, and the government should be taking greater action in relation to it.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I note also that the member for Moncrieff has sent a petition to the Gold Coast council calling upon them to take action in relation to their sister city in Japan and the issue of whaling. I would like to say to the member for Moncrieff that he should be speaking to his fellow coalition MPs and the Prime Minister about taking action, not sending a petition to the Gold Coast council. He should be speaking to the Prime Minister and getting him to take some action. My community feels very strongly about this; there were at least 100 people at the community gathering on Sunday, mostly children, who presented these drawings and who feel strongly about this. I will be forwarding them to the Prime Minister and urging him to take action on this very important issue. We have to protect the whales and we have to do it now.</para>

<para>âVolunteers in our country are a very important part of our social fabric and I want to pay tribute to them in the parliament today. It is estimated that if a cash value were put on the hours that volunteers spend in this country it would amount to some $50 billion. That is why I think it is important that all members of the federal parliament pay tribute to the volunteers in their respective electorates.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I want to commend the federal government very strongly today because it has allocated some $11,400 to the Ryan electorate, which I of course have the great privilege of representing here in the parliament. It has permitted 10 local community organisations to benefit from this, and I want to pay tribute to and acknowledge them here in the parliament today. The Gap Pioneer and History Group, under the stewardship of Mr Jeff Hilder, has received almost $2,000; his organisation will benefit tremendously from this. The Kenmore branch of Little Athletics, under the guidance of Mrs Diane Thornton, is going to receive some $1,600, which will go towards a marquee. The Moggill Cricket Association, under the guidance of Mr Ian Bartholomew, is going to receive some $2,281, which will go towards putting up a quickshade.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Also, very importantly, the Moggill branch of the Queensland Country Womenâs Association, under the guidance of Mrs Robyn Brand, will receive $1,400-plus towards a roving microphone, a microwave, a benchtop food warmer and some portable tables. The branch does a wonderful job in the Ryan electorate. The Centenary Meals on Wheels, under the guidance of Miss Sandra Goode, who lives in Jindalee, will receive over $600 towards mobile phone handsets and some eskies. These are examples of the wonderful organisations throughout the country, and it is very important that we pay tribute to them. The Queensland branch of the Scout Association of Australia, under the guidance of Mr Ken Whyte, who lives at Mount Ommaney, will receive over $600 towards a colour printer. This is an example of how good local membership can help local community organisations.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Accordingly, $11,000 has been provided to the Ryan electorate and 10 organisations will benefit. These funds will make an important contribution to the viability of these organisations, for which people give up their time to contribute to the local community. I want to mention one more: the Moggill Scout Group, under the guidance of Mr Norm Holliman, who lives in Bellbowrie, will receive almost $900 to go towards coolers and an outboard motor, which will make an important difference to the activities of the young people in the Moggill community. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI know you are. The Brazilian government first mandated a five per cent addition of ethanol to gasoline in 1931. Following the international oil crises of 1973 and 1979, Brazil rapidly increased its production of sugarcane to the point where, today, it is the leading sugarcane and ethanol producer in the world. By adding ethanol to gasoline, Brazil has secured its energy needs and created many job opportunities as well as a reduction in pollution and the lowering of greenhouse gas emissions.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para pgwide="yes">It is well known that sugarcane producers in Australia are struggling. My concern is that the government continues to subsidise an inefficient industry without helping it to go in different directionsâfor example, by providing further financial assistance to the sugarcane producers to encourage them to make ethanol. It is also well known that the oil industry is a very powerful lobby. It is disgraceful that many petrol stations in Sydney put out messages guaranteeing that no ethanol is mixed in the gasoline. This perpetuates the myth to Sydney motorists that ethanol is harmful to the motors of ordinary cars. Nothing could be further from the truth. A mix of 10 per cent ethanol with gasoline is a very safe and environmentally friendly measure.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In Brazil today, all cars run on a minimum of 25 per cent ethanol. Brazil has shown the world that the use of ethanol to power motor vehicles is the way to go, both environmentally and economically. I can report first hand that the Brazilians are laughing at the almost daily price hikes in the cost of a barrel of oil. Oil is a finite resource and it is not environmentally friendly, so today I call on the Howard government to follow Brazilâs example and to do everything to assist and encourage the production of ethanol in Australia. I am sure that one day, once Australians discover for themselves that the mix of 10 per cent ethanol with gasoline is not dangerous to their motor vehicles, Australia, like Brazil, will produce cars that run on 25 per cent to 100 per cent ethanol. That would be good for our environment and for the economy.</para>

<para>âThere has been an ongoing debate over the issue of unexploded ordnance in Australia. For those who might not be aware of what this is, unexploded ordnance includes bombs, artillery shells and similar munitions that lie idle and unexploded, a potential hazard, in hundreds of locations right around our nation. There are currently 1,196 identified UXO sites around Australia, and one of those sites is in my electorate of Fisher on the Sunshine Coast.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I have been fighting to make sure that we achieve an appropriate outcome and an equitable solution with respect to the issue of UXOs. On the Sunshine Coast I believe that all levels of government bear some responsibility for the current situation. Obviously the Australian government was defending Australia and these particular items were fired as part of our defence preparations. However, the principal problem locally has been caused by the fact that the government of Queensland permitted the freeholding of the land and its use for subdivisional purposes and the City of Caloundra approved subdivisional plans without requiring in each case that the land be cleared of UXOs. So we have a situation where UXOs are partly on private property and also on public land. What we want is an outcome that will ensure that they are cleared from those areas where they pose a danger to the public. As a parent, I, of course, experience concerns when I look at the dangers to young children when they locate these UXOs. Happily, no lives have been lost, and let us hope that that remains the situation.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The issue of UXOs locally was recently ignited when a team from the Caloundra City Council, using a mini excavator, came across what they suspected was a UXO. They were doing water mains work on a road owned by the Queensland state government. Naturally, the work was brought to a standstill as their Caloundra Council superiors were notified and they in turn notified the police and the military authorities. As it turned out what they had found was not a UXO at all; it was something else. However, the local state member, Chris Cummins, jumped on the bandwagon and claimed that the Australian government should bear the full cost of clearing these items.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Caloundra City Council and I have had discussions and they are coming forward with a plan of what they suggest should be done, but, as I said earlier, all levels of government bear some responsibility hereâparticularly the state government and the local authority, because we would not have the present situation had the state government not approved the freeholding and had Caloundra City Council not permitted the plans for the subdivision to proceed. What we need to do is look at those areas of public land that are used by the public, work out a map and work out costings. In my view, there then has to be an appropriate compromise arrangement whereby the federal government, the state government and the local council work together to remove this potential menace. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âIt was an outstanding result and it gives me great pleasure to talk about it, especially as some of my conservative colleagues are here in the chamber. What we have seen is an absolute routing of the CLPâthe Country Liberal Partyâin the Northern Territory. It has been such a routing that we have seen a swing to Clare Martin and her governmentâthe Labor Partyâof 20.3 percent. A swing like that to a government is unprecedented. As a result, we have seen the leader of the opposition, Denis Burke, have a swing of 22 per cent against him and he has lost his seat.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para pgwide="yes">I might point out that in the last election Matthew Bonson, an Aboriginal bloke, stood for the seat of Millner. He won that seat with a margin of 80 votes. I am happy to announce that he won this time with a 22 per cent swing and now sits on 73.2 per cent, a margin all of us in this place would like to have. I would also point out that two other Indigenous candidates were elected to the Territoryâs assemblyâas new members. Alison Anderson, a former ATSIC commissioner, won the seat of MacDonnell, with a swing ofâwait for itâ30.5 per cent. Barbara McCarthy won the seat of Arnhem with a slightly lower swingâonly 15.2 per centâbecause she was taking it over from a former Labor member. She got a massive swing on the top of taking over the seat from Jack Ah Kit, a previous Labor minister. Labor also won the seat of Daly from the CLP. In that seat Bob Knight got a reasonable swingâ30.4 per cent. He now sits on a margin of 70.8 percent. These are historically unprecedented results.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Another candidate, and the person who has beaten the Territory Leader of the Opposition, is James Burke. As it happens, his father stood for the Labor Party in the 1983 election when the Labor Party only won six seatsâsomething like the CLP is going to win this time. His father stood for the seat of Wanguri but lost. James Burke now has the pleasure of saying, although his father stood for the Labor Party in 1983, that he stood this yearâin 2005âand he defeated the Leader of the Opposition. That is not a bad result.</para>

<para>âIt was 1938 when Qantas Airways Ltd first came to Townsville. They came in flying boats. They were running flights from Sydneyâs Rose Bay through to Brisbane which then stopped at Gladstone in the member for Hinklerâs electorate before landing in Townsville en route to Singapore and London. These days we have something a little more significant than a flying boat service from Qantas. I am pleased to advise the parliament that on Friday, Jetstar, which is part of the Qantas group, announced that it will be servicing Townsville with some very significant new services. I am very pleased to see that Jetstar will run a service which I believe is a firstâthat is, Melbourne-Townsville direct. That is a great result, particularly for our commercial and our military people in Townsville because many of them have families and friends in the southern part of the state.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">We will now see Qantas running 38 services a week to Townsville. Jetstar will run 14 services a week to Townsville and QantasLink, the other member of the Qantas stable, will run 49 services to Townsville. This gives a total of 101 services every week from the Qantas group. I really appreciate the support that Qantas has shown to our city, Australiaâs largest tropical city. I know that it will continue to operate and to offer appropriate services for our region. Townsville also has Virgin services. Another airline, which is known as Alliance Airlines, provides jet services from Townsville. So we are well serviced as the regional communications and business centre of the north.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I also note that Qantas has a national partnership with Tourism Australia in relation to a major marketing thrust over the next three years to promote Australia and to promote inbound tourism. Qantas has once again demonstrated through this partnership that it does call Australia home. It is committed to working with Tourism Australia globally and it is committed to growing Australiaâs tourism industry from all major regions. That is why I would like to strongly support Qantas in its position as flagship carrier for Australia and to support anything that we can do as a government that will help it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI have received petitions from Our Lady of the Annunciation Primary School, Pagewood, and St Aidanâs Primary School, Maroubra. These petitions call on the federal government to respect the wishes of their teachers to maintain current awards registered by consent with the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission between non-government school employers and the Independent Education Union. They very reasonably ask that basic rights at work guaranteed under New South Wales industrial relations are also enshrined in federal industrial legislation. I will table these petitions in the House of Representatives during this sitting week. As the member for Kingsford Smith I support the teachers at these schools and their call for the maintenance of their current hard-won rights.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">These petitions are more evidence of the degree of concern the community of Kingsford Smith has about the Howard governmentâs approach to and performance in educationâfrom primary schools to universities and on a number of fronts. The Senate committeeâs student income support report will be tabled shortly. Alarmingly, its findings reveal that over one-third of students are living below the poverty line. The report finds that, on average, students must work at least 20 hours per week simply to survive. This means that they are either skipping lectures and only attending tutorials or attending tutorials and getting their lecture notes from the internet. This practice, I can verify from students at the University of New South Wales, is increasing.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Students therefore are not able to achieve their best results and they end up simply doing the bare minimum to scrape by. I think members would agree that that is a completely unacceptable situation for our future teachers, future doctors, future health technicians, future lawyers, future surveyors and so on to find themselves in. Their capacity to act as competent professionals once they graduate is very much determined by their ability to focus properly on their studies during the term of their education, and if most of themâor many of themâfind themselves on the poverty line, this capacity is greatly impaired.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The ongoing and, it must be said, destructive pattern of reduced funding in higher education means for instance that students of few means have less access to scholarships as universities such as University of New South Wales struggle to provide services previously supplied through federal government funding. Already facing strained and difficult circumstances, these students are now faced with a mounting attack on student unionsâthe so-called voluntary student unionism attack. It is against the wishes of the majority of students and universities. We should oppose government policy that jeopardises the capacity of students to study, as they scrabble to make ends meetâeven to the extent of offering themselves for medical experiments, as we read in the newspapers last week. At the same time these students now face removal of services that are so significant to them: counselling, legal advice, sports facilities and the like. The education of Australian students deserves better.</para>

<para>âAs a former business owner I know first-hand the value of these new industrial relations reforms. My brother and I ran three restaurants and, combining full-time, part-time permanent and casual employees, we had around 60 employees on our books at any given time. The scare campaign by the unions would have you believe that employers will now be able to fire people just for the sake of it. This notion is ridiculous to anyone who has owned or has been associated with small business. The old mentality of labour just being one component in the manufacturing process along with other raw materials and other inputs is thinking of an age gone by. I can tell you, as other small business people can, that your staffâor team, as the current mentality would have itâare the most important component in any business and that you must treat them very well. These people are essential to the smooth running of the organisation and to exploit them or to terminate them only hurts you and your business. In most organisations the owner of the business and his or her team form great friendships, long-lasting even well after the business is sold or the employee leaves. I still keep in contact with many former employees and I am willing to assistâas I haveâwith references or advice.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">However, I have also been the victim of employees who have had personal problems, where the stealing of money, goods and time have occurred; where they have openly defied responsibility by hiding behind unfair dismissal laws and the so-called âthree written warningsâ before termination can occur otherwise industrial action will occurâthat is, through the courts. I know many other employers who would take on extra staff if the unfair dismissal laws were removed today. The law must protect employees, I agree. However, the survival of small business is precarious at best and I see the future industrial relations laws as a much-needed shot in the arm for the backbone of this country.</para>

<para>âAn issue was raised with me in my electorate last week that I think is worth bringing before the House. It relates to continuing referrals to specialists. It is possible for our constituents to obtain a continuing referral from their general practitioner that enables them to see a specialist without being required to go back and get a new referral. Unfortunately, this is not widely known and therefore very few specialists accept this. Only if our constituents ask their general practitioner can they get a continuing referral, but even when they have one sometimes specialists are quite reticent in taking up the referrals. I would like this parliament to put in place proper procedures whereby specialists are made aware of the importance of these referrals and of the fact that they are acceptable, and to undertake an information campaign to advise general practitioners that continuing referrals are available so patients can benefit from them.</para>

<para>âThis is a critical week for Migaloo, the white humpback whale, and for all the humpback and other whales that are regularly sighted off Australiaâs coasts. As we speak, in South Korea there is a meeting of the International Whaling Commission, and we will see whether Japan has been successful in its attempts to stack that commission.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The apparent success of Japan in bringing this issue to the point where they are actually arguing to hunt humpback whales and other species and to expand their quota of whales slaughtered for so-called scientific purposes raises a number of issues. One issue, which is agreed by everyone in this parliament, is that whaling is an activity which should be consigned to the dustbin of history; that it is inappropriate to hunt and slaughter whales in the cruel way in which it is currently being done by a small number of countries. It is also true to say that there is a consensus across this parliament that diplomatic means are always the first stepâthat is the preferred measure; Australia should be doing all that it can to lobby on the diplomatic front. But I must say that there is considerable concern that inaction has brought us to this point.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It appears, from Senate estimates last month, that the foreign minister did not make any representations to Japan on this issue between 1996 and 2004. We have also seen the environment minister undertake a last-ditch attempt to travel around the world in the couple of weeks leading up to the IWC. This suggests that the government has been asleep at the wheel while Japan has been busy recruiting countries who would vote for its pro-whaling position. It is also the case, I believe, that mixed messages have been sent. In particular, I refer to the Humane Society International case, in which the Attorney-General, Philip Ruddock, intervened and made a submission stating that the case should not be allowed because it would âlead to an international disagreement with Japanâ. We do have an international disagreement with Japan when it comes to the issue of whaling. The legal intervention on whaling stands in very stark contrast to the action in 1999 where the government took Japanâthe same countryâto the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea over southern bluefin tuna and was, in fact, represented in that case by the then Attorney-General, Daryl Williams.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It seems to the Labor Party that it is entirely appropriate that diplomatic measures not only take place but be backed up by legal measures. In particular, the government should take action in the International Court of Justice to stop whaling. At the IWC meeting held in Adelaide there was a legal opinion given to suggest that the actions of Japan and other whaling nations were a clear breach of the provisions in the IWC which outlawed whaling and that so-called scientific whaling was clearly not occurring and was an abuse. Given that the government made much of the changes to the EPBC Act 1999, which the Prime Minister was prepared to quote in the 2001 election policy of the coalition, saying that the slaughter of whales and dolphins in Australiaâs territory should be stopped, why hasnât the government been prepared to take legal action to stop the illegal slaughter of whales in Australian waters? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âIn response to our amiable friend from the opposition, the member for Grayndler, I have three points about the governmentâs position on whaling. First, the governmentâs position on whaling is absolutely clear: we stand utterly opposed to whaling in any form. Our friend from the other side raises the point that in 1999 the Australian government, through the form of the then Attorney-General, were willing to take the Japanese to court in relation to the bluefin case. What that demonstrates is that there is no fear of taking action. What we do is take steps as and when appropriate and necessary. I would note particularly the words of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who has very specificallyâand I quote the words preciselyâsaid:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">We have not ruled out any legal or diplomatic options to bring further pressure to Japan if that is necessary, but we obviously have to work these things through carefully, step by step ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">So the position and the possibility there is clear and open, but the first task is to fight within the context of the International Whaling Commission. The Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell, has spared absolutely no effort in that process. His life, the governmentâs efforts and the full efforts of our diplomatic service over a long period have been dedicated to precisely the care and protection of whales. So that is the first point.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The second point is: what is the governmentâs formal position on scientific and commercial whaling? We are dead against both. We are absolutely, fundamentally, categorically against scientific whaling and commercial whaling. My definition of âscientific whalingâ is a photograph, a tracking device and a hug to send them on their way. That is about as far as it gets from our perspective. But we stand completely, resolutely, absolutely against them.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The third thing is: what about the International Whaling Commission? We have heard from the member for Grayndler that it will be a catastrophe. I am delighted to report to the House a small, early, preliminary victory which has become known only in the last couple of hours. I hope the member for Grayndler hears this. I quote from a newswire report just received:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">Japan failed today to passâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">and I hope that the member for Grayndler pays attentionâ</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">an early procedural vote at the International Whaling Commission, suggesting the body would remain dominated by the anti-whaling lobby, as it has been for 23 years.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">So that is an initial step.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The points in relation to our friend from the opposition are very simple. Firstly, we have been strong in relation to the protection of our waters, and we will continue to be so. Secondly, we utterly reject scientific and commercial whaling as unacceptable practices in the 21st century. Thirdly, we have had a very clear result just in the last couple of hours which is promising, which is preliminary. There is a lot more to do. We are against strong forces. But we will be absolutely clear in fighting to prevent whaling.</para>

<para>âI would like to raise a matter with the parliamentary secretary. He was a member of a House of Representatives committee which produced a report on employment in the environment sector which was tabled in November 2003. To date, neither the department nor the government appear to have responded to many of the very important recommendations in that report. They are asleep at the wheel on a number of issues to do with the environment, this being another one of them. In particular tonight I want to raise the fact that in Australia we lack a comprehensive national data collection on the scope of the environment industry in this country. We might have differences about and debate what exactly we mean by the environment industry, but state by state there has been progress made in trying to identify the scope of green jobs and the environment industry. However nothing has happened at the national level.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">This is a great tragedy because back in 2001 one of the recommendations made in the Environment Industry Action Agenda was that the ABS, together with the department, ought to get a move on and ensure that comprehensive information was available. From what I understand, the Australian Bureau of Statistics were quite open to the proposal because they had had a number of requests from industry members, from overseas and from international bodies in other countries asking for comparable data on the scope of the environment industry in Australia. In 2001 the ABS actually released a paper, the ABS <inline font-style="italic">Prospectus on a national survey of the environment industry</inline>. The ABS indicated that they were quite capable of carrying out such analysis and that they believed the cost of doing so would be in the order of $1.54 million for the initial survey. They estimated it would take about $1 million annually to keep that data up to date. They indicated then that they were not in a position to finance the work.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The matter has been raised on numerous occasions and was again raised in the report from the committee of which the parliamentary secretary was a member. Interestingly enough, the first significant recommendation was as follows:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">The Committee recommends that the Australian Government provide the additional funding required to enable the Australian Bureau of Statistics to collect and make available ongoing and trend data on the environment industry in Australia.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The committee went on to say:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">... failure to do so may impede the development of the industry and hence result in greater long term national costs to Australia.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">So I am quite amazed that, year after year, attention is drawn to the obvious inadequacies in terms of having a national response to issues to do with green jobs, employment opportunities, the scope of the domestic market, the rate at which that market is growing and the export potential for green technologies. Despite many references to the need to have such data on a national basis, here we are today with no comprehensive figures that can be verified by the ABS. It appears from the budget papersâI certainly cannot find a line item on thisâthat the government is not responding in a serious way to this glaring omission.</para>

<para>âI wish to make two points in response to the member for Throsbyâs contribution. The first is in relation to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage report on employment in the environment sector. It was a pleasure and a honour to share membership of that committee with the member for Throsby. In relation to that specific report, we are very close to a final presentation. One of the reasons for that delay is precisely because of the fact that we have taken this seriously. We have looked at all of the points. It is very close to a final position. I do take a personal responsibility for seeing something like that through. I have had a role in both helping to prepare the report and helping to respond to it. They are personal responsibilities and I accept the need to undertake them. We are actually in a very good position. My second comment is in relation to jobs and the environment. I note simply that the Australian government recently established the Australian water fund, which is about $2 billion for one sector of the environment. That will have a profound effect both on employment, on efficiency and on environmental care and protection.</para>

<para>âI wish to raise the issue of heritage and the appalling performance of the government when it comes to protecting Australiaâs heritage. We have seen only nine sites listed on the National Heritage List.

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">With regard to Anzac Cove, we saw an absolute farcical situation whereby damage was done to one of World War Iâs best-preserved battlefields. During last Fridayâs Senate inquiry, it became clear that the Department of Environment and Heritage was not even made aware of the Howard governmentâs August 2004 request for roadworks. Perhaps what is even worse is that departmental officers were not aware of the damage caused until they read about it in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraphâ</inline>this is according to their own evidence at that hearing. Heritage considerations were not borne in mind at allâwhich is extraordinary.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I think it is up to the parliamentary secretary here, because he has been given the berth on this issue and Minister Truss has been exiled. It is extraordinary that the Minister for the Environment and Heritage was silent when it came to the issue of Anzac Cove and the destruction that was caused at that site. Why has the Howard government failed so appallingly when it comes to heritage protection, when it comes to the listing of sites and when it comes to meetings of the National Cultural Heritage Forum? The only time that the minister has intervened and shown some leadership was the reactionary move to intervene against the Victorian governmentâs decision on alpine grazing. I would be interested in the parliamentary secretaryâs view of that issue and how that reflected this governmentâs attitude towards our heritage.</para>

<para>âI want to draw attention to the end of a practice which had bipartisan support, at least for a number of years, in this parliament, and that was the giving of grants to conservation organisations at a national and state level and which by the action of the environment minister has now been reduced to virtually nil. I want to put on record my great appreciation of the work that voluntary conservation organisations at a state and national level have done in this country prior to the existence of the current act. In fact, I think that probably since the time of the Fraser government voluntary conservation organisations have been in receipt of modest amounts of funds which have enabled them to educate the community, to campaign in their local areas and to achieve some very significant environmental outcomes.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">What has happened today is that environment groups have had $250,000 cut from them from most state conservation councils, and they find themselves losing out. Unfortunately, this is a trend that has been under way during the term of the Howard government and it reflects one of the most insidious trends that arise when ministers are making grants of this kind and deciding whether or not they will be maintainedâthat is, those who speak out are penalised. If you speak out now in Australia on conservation issues and you have an advocacy role, you can surely expect to find that this Howard government will reduce your funding and, by reducing the funding, hope to silence the voices of those in ordinary communities who seek to campaign on environment issues. I really deplore this trend, and I think it is not at all to the credit of the minister that, in this case, he has chosen to take such an action. It really renders this grants program pretty insignificant. It is really just a political program now; it does not have any aspects of the bipartisan structure that it has had in the past.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Alarmingly, the cuts came one day before the end of the financial year. I just ask people to contemplate for a moment what it is like to run a state conservation council, particularly in the more remote states of South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. These state conservation councils work cooperatively at the local level with local councilsâthey work with people of all political persuasionsâand they work very effectively with the community; they are made up significantly of volunteers. The amount of money that gets provided for them generally to pay a coordinator or someone of that sort keeps them going. As a result of the ministerâs decision, their future prospects are significantly impaired and their capacity to continue to do that work and even to organise the volunteers so the volunteers can continue to make their contribution is greatly reduced. I think it is a very sad day when that happens.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is worth while, while I am speaking to the House, to affirm the campaign outcomes that conservation councils, local organisations and national conservation organisations have achieved. We can go back as far as the Great Barrier Reef outcome and identify most of Australiaâs major national icons that have endured and taken protection from actions taken by the Commonwealth and state governments to ensure their protection because of the campaigning that these community groups were involved in. I do not think I need to labour the point, but our national income is in part provided for us by sharing these places of great natural beauty with visitors both from within Australia and from other parts of the world. The campaigns that existed from the Great Barrier Reef right through to Ningaloo Reef, for the most part, have been opposed by those interests that would see it within their realm to take some income from abusing or exploiting the natural conservation area in question. But it is the conservation councils and their wider membership from local and community groups cast around the states which provide the community interest in ensuring that someone stands up for these natural areas. It is a matter of great regret that under this environment minister these tremendous contributors to protection of the environment in Australia have had their funding so significantly reduced. I can only condemn the action of the minister in the House.</para>

<para>âIn responding very briefly to the member for Kingsford Smith, I have three brief points to make. The first is that in relation to the grants to voluntary environment and heritage organisations, the number of groups that received grants this year has increased by 62, up to 128. I significantly note that the two largest recipients are conservation councils. For, I believe, the first time, 28 groups are receiving multiyear funding. The two largest grants were for three years of $60,000 each for the South Australian Conservation Council and for Environment Victoria. So the first point is that it is an increase in the number of groups; it includes multiyear funding and, significantlyâand I will come to this in a minuteâsmall groups, in many cases, have received grants for the first time.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The second point is this notion that it is about people being closed down. Environment Victoria, as I have mentioned, was the group which did best. Only today, the Executive Director of Environment Victoria put an extremely critical argument about the government in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline>. That is his right. Marcus Godinho is, in fact, somebody I know and respect but with whom on many issues I disagree. But today, with the benefit of three-year funding, it is quite interesting that he gave one of his strongest arguments ever against the Commonwealth government. I think that is precisely the opposite of what the member for Kingsford Smith put forward.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The third point is that it is my understanding that 91 new small organisations who have never received GVEHOs before have been given such grants for practical purposes around Australia. Those are groups such as the Dolphin Research Institute and the Clean Ocean Foundation. The head of the Dolphin Research Institute said to me: âFor us, this money is gold. This is worth twice the value of any other grant because of the way in which it can be applied.â So it does have a practical impact. I respect the views presented but I respectfully disagree.</para>

<para>âBecause of time constraints I am not able to raise all the issues I would like to raise. Certainly, I want to associate myself with the comments of the member for Kingsford Smith when it comes to the GVEHO program. It is symptomatic of a government that is prepared to silence civil society when the funds to voluntary environmental organisations that have served this nation so well are cut off.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">In particular, I do not want to miss the opportunity to raise the most important issue when it comes to the environmentâthat is, climate change. The parliamentary secretary would be aware that today my private memberâs bill, the <inline ref="R2276">Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change (Kyoto Protocol Ratification) Bill 2005</inline>, had its second reading. Would the parliamentary secretary and the government agree to have a full debate and a vote on that bill in the parliament, now that it has had its second reading? It should be up to the parliament to vote on it. I noticed the parliamentary secretary did not participate in the debate today, because he knows the right thing to do is to join with other countries to be part of the international effort.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The member for Stirling and, most extraordinarily, the member for Tangney spoke today in the second reading debate on my private memberâs bill, and the parliament should be aware of their comments. The member for Tangney said essentially that climate change was not occurring. He said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Glaciologists working at this glacier utterly reject global warming as the causes of this glacierâs retreat.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">He joined with the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, who also said that climate change is not occurring. But the member for Tangney has gone one step further, because he is calling for nuclear energy. Today, he said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Total radioactivity levels on earth are slightly less after the nuclear power process.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">That is an extraordinary proposition from the member for Tangney, but not quite as extraordinary as last week, when in a doorstop the member for Tangney dismissed the after-effects of Chernobyl as a minor issue and said that the impact of Chernobyl was no greater than the impact of Three Mile Island.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Is it the governmentâs position that Chernobyl was a minor hiccup that should not be held against those who have concerns about nuclear energy? Where is the government going on this issue, given the Prime Minister and others have been openly calling for a debate on this issue and expressing support for nuclear energy? We want to hold the government accountable. If it is the case that the government wants nuclear energy, we want to know which member opposite will put up their hand and say, âI want a nuclear reactor in my electorateââwhether it is the member for Tangney, the member for Flinders or other members.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This is an important issue, because it is a distraction from the fact that the government is not prepared to take the issue of climate change seriously and take action. If you look at the massive increases in greenhouse gas emissions in every sector of the economyâexcept in land clearing, which, due to the decisions of the Beattie and Carr governments, is why Australia will meet its target of 108 per cent on 1990 levelsâit is of great concern that current projections by the Australian Greenhouse Office show emissions of 123 per cent by the year 2020 on 1990 levels.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The final question which I would like addressed by the parliamentary secretary is: in an era of climate change, where such change is a dominant political and environmental issue, why was it confirmed that the Australian Greenhouse Office was abolished in the budget, following the announcement in October last year, and why is it that the National Oceans Office has also been abolished and taken back into the department? Isnât it the case that, by doing that to the Australian Greenhouse Office and the National Oceans Office, their independence and ability to put forward positions will be stifled by a government which, when you go back to its attitude towards community organisations, is very clearly determined to stifle any dissent?</para>

<para>âI am delighted to present the Environment and Heritage portfolio appropriation for 2005-06, and I thank all members who have spoken. I have endeavoured to respond to them, and I will address one or two of the questions they have raised. Overall, I wish to address three things during the course of this response: firstly, some of the major items which are part of the governmentâs package; secondly, some of the specific initiatives; and, thirdly, the question of water and also climate change.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">In looking at the major items, it is important to note that the whole-of-government allocation in the current budget for expenditure on Environment and Heritage functions for the coming year is $3.2 billion. In particular, $923.7 million is within the Environment and Heritage portfolio itself. The major items can be categorised as follows. Firstly, there is $337 million for the Australian water fundâa fund which, I think it would be agreed by members of both sides, is an outstanding step forward in dealing with Australiaâs water issues and water challenges. That is made up of $253 million for Water Smart Australia and $30 million for national water standards, both of which are administered by the National Water Commission, and a further $54 million for the Australian governmentâs community water grants, which will be administered jointly by the Department of the Environment and Heritage and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. I think that is a tremendous initiative. A second core initiative in the coming year is the $310 million for the Natural Heritage Trust. This is administered, again, by the two departments. A third element is $168 million for the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality. Those three elements togetherâthe Australian water fund, the Natural Heritage Trust and the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Qualityâare absolutely fundamental, along with the greenhouse work we are doing, in providing the pillars of major practical work for the environment.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The second element that I want to talk about is the set of specific new initiatives which are highlighted within the appropriations bill. Firstly, there is $100 million over five years for the Commonwealth environment research facilities, the CERFs. This includes $40 million to create a marine and tropical research facility, and $60 million more generally for environmental research. These are very important steps forward. There is an amount of $46.3 million over four years for the Australia-Antarctic air linkâagain, a very important step forward and a particular initiative proposed and driven by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In terms of national and regional security, there is $40.5 million over four years for the Australian tsunami warning system for the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean coastlines. Something which I am very pleased to support is a contribution of $19.8 million additional fundingâwhich, rounded up, makes about $30 million all upâover six years to replace 12 of the Bureau of Meteorologyâs oldest field meteorological offices around Australia. I was recently able to see the capacity that exists within a new field office and the way in which that gives us better forecasting capability.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There are other significant initiatives that we take forward. They include $10.5 million for the National Heritage Investment Initiative, which in part answers some of the criticisms made by the member for Grayndler in relation to heritage. The focus is on practical heritage application and protection. There is $11.4 million for the Photovoltaic Rebate Program, $9Â½ million for regional marine planning, another $5.2 million over four years for the National Pollutant Inventory and, very importantly, $2 million for used oil recycling. So there is a series of initiatives.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I also note the National Water Initiative going forward, specifically the investment of $1.8 billion in greenhouse and climate change responses. That is a very significant process and represents the total package that the Australian government announced over a year ago in relation to energy, greenhouse emissions and climate change. It is all of those things taken together. For those reasons, I commend the appropriation to the House. I believe it represents an important investment in the Australian environment and heritage sector.</para>

<para>âIt is no surprise that today started with newspapers with banner headlines about the Howard government trashing democracy, because this evening the Howard government is trashing the opportunity to question the Minister for Health and Ageing on matters in the budget. We were advised that the minister for health would personally attend this consideration in detail, only to find that he is now not in attendance. Clearly that decision has been taken because the Medicare safety net cover-up has to continue. The minister would have been aware that many of our questions to him would have been about his personal state of knowledge about the likelihoodâor, should I say, lack of likelihoodâof the Howard government keeping its âiron-clad, rock solid guaranteeâ on the Medicare safety net on the day it was given.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Of course, the Howard government has pulled the old trick of sending along a different minister who cannot possibly know about someone elseâs state of knowledge. However, what I will do is indicate the key areas in the Medicare safety net that require answers. These relate to the budget measure titled âMedicareâincrease in thresholds for the Medicare safety netâ. That measure stripped some $499 million from the Medicare safety net. I am in a position to supply those questions in writing to the Minister for Ageing, who is at the table. I note that one of Minister Abbottâs key political advisers is present in the gallery, so it ought to be a simple matter for the minister at the table to turn to Minister Abbottâs key political adviser and get a guarantee that these questions, which are in writing, will be answered in writing before the parliament rises todayâgiven that Minister Abbott indicated he was going to be here and at the last minute is not here.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The questions that I am seeking answers to on this appropriation are as follows. The recent Senate estimates process revealed that the ministerâs department was well equipped with information about the escalating cost of the Medicare safety net. The Health Insurance Commission was providing weekly and monthly reports on the Medicare safety net. This included weekly data reports to the department which provided information such as actual Medicare safety net benefits paid. These weekly reports came on top of existing daily reports on Medicare being delivered by the HIC to the department. This weekly information was revealing to the department variations between the estimates in the cost of the safety net compared with the actual cost of 72 per cent in August, 60 per cent in July and 43 per cent in June.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Against that backdrop where we know for sure that the department of health was getting weekly data about the cost blow-outs in the Medicare safety net, the questions the minister for health needs to answerâand the minister at the table needs to give an undertaking that he will answerâare these. On what date was the minister first briefed about the blow-out in costs? On how many occasions was he briefed? What actions did he take following these briefings? Is the ministerâthat is, the Minister for Health and Ageingâaware that an officer in the department of finance was concerned enough about the blow-out to contact the finance ministerâs office on more than one occasion? When was the minister first made aware that an officer in the department of finance was so concerned he contacted the finance ministerâs office? Given that the finance minister was orally briefed on this issue, does the minister for health maintain that he was not briefed or contacted by the finance minister or his office about the matter? Specifically, did the minister or his staff discuss the blow-out with the Prime Minister, the minister for finance, the Treasurer or their staff? If so, when and what were the contents of these discussions? Is the minister aware of a graph detailing the safety net blow-out consistently referred to by his departmental secretary at Senate estimates? Is the minister aware that his departmental secretary refused to table the graph despite repeated requests to do so? Will the minister now table that graph?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It ought to be a simple matter for the Minister for Ageing, now at the table, to ascertain from Mr Barnes in the gallery that she is in a position to offer a ministerial undertaking that these questions will be answered in writing, given the ministerâs nonattendance at this consideration in detail debate, before the House rises this evening?</para>

<para>âI understand that the Minister for Ageing would be attending in her capacity to answer questions in the consideration in detail debate insofar as they relate to allocations for ageing in the budget. The problem here is, of course, that she is the only person who has attended who could deal with the consideration in detail on health, given the nonattendance of the Minister for Health and Ageing.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I am also in a position to supply questions to the minister at the tableâand would seek an undertaking in respect of these as wellârelating to the electorate by electorate data about the Medicare safety net. As I think anybody who participated in the last federal election campaign would be aware, the Minister for Health and Ageing released during the campaign electorate by electorate breakdowns of expenditure on the safety net. That was done during the campaignâprobably one of the greatest own goals in Australian politics, but I will not let that delay me.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">What we know from Senate estimates is that the minister is regularly briefed on electorate by electorate breakdowns on Medicare safety net expenditure and that electorate by electorate expenditure can be ascertained from the regular report provided by the Health Insurance Commission to the department. So if the minister is not releasing this information publicly, that is not a cost matter; that is simply a public accountability matterâthat is, he has data of relevance to the Australian community and he chooses to cover it up. On that basis I would ask for an undertaking from the minister at the table that the Minister for Health and Ageing will answer the following questions in writing before the close of parliament today. Firstly, why wonât the minister release information about the safety net by electorate, as he did during the last election, which revealed that those with the highest incomes and capacity to spend more are getting the most benefit from the safety net? Is the ministerâthat is, the Minister for Health and Ageingâaware that this information can be ascertained from the regular report provided from the HIC to the department? Given that his own department admitted to briefing the minister regularly on this data, why wonât the minister release it? I will now take steps to supply these questions in writing to the Minister for Ageing and I will seek her undertaking on them before the close of this consideration in detail debate.</para>

<para>âThere are four issues that I wish to raise. I trust that the Minister for Ageing will pass them on to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Whilst there are a number of issues on ageing that I feel are quite importantâI will be watching very carefully to see what happens over the next 12 months with the trials that are taking placeâtonight I would like to raise issues relating to health.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The first is the issue of the Belmont Medicare office. One of the first acts of the Howard government was to close the Belmont Medicare office. It was closed not because it was not processing a high number of claims but for some perverse reason that I have yet to have explained to me. It supported a very elderly population. Old people in the electorate who did not have cars had to travel about 20 kilometres, to either Charlestown or Lake Haven, to access a Medicare office. Belmont is in a central position for the people of Swansea, an area that maintains a very elderly population. The Shortland electorate is the 10th oldest electorate in Australia, as I am sure the Minister for Ageing is aware. This is quite a big issue. The previous member for Shortland and I have submitted in excess of 20,000 signatures to this House from people within the electorate who really need the Medicare office reopened. I ask the minister to consider that request.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Medicare office at Toukley is, once again, an area with an elderly population. I have submitted petitions to this House of around 1,000 signatures from people within that area. There is poor transport provided in that areaâit is private as opposed to public transportâand it takes people an hour to two hours to travel some eight kilometres to the nearest Medicare office.</para>

<para>âI look forward to working with you to see if we can solve the problem. I have worked with a number of organisations, including the Hunter Urban Division of GPs and the local council. I have called before for the member for Dobell to work with me on this issue to no avail. I think it is an absolute disgrace when elderly people have to wait for up to two or three weeks to get an appointment with a doctor. There is an absolute crisis on the Central Coast. If something does not happen now, I think the government will be culpable because people will lose their lives simply because they cannot get an appointment with their doctor.</para>

<para pgwide="yes">Unfortunately, the doctor shortage is increasing and is now finding its way into the Lake Macquarie area of the Shortland electorate. Once again, the extremities of the electorateâthe people in the far north of the Central Coastâare experiencing the greatest doctor shortage. Within Lake Macquarie, the people on the southern end are experiencing the greatest shortage. Unless something happens soon, there is going to be a real crisis in this area.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The final point that I want to raise is that, at the New South Wales ALP conference the weekend before last, Bob Carr announced that there would be an after-hours GP service set up in Wyong Hospital. What I am asking for tonight is an undertakingâ</para>

<para>âNo. The member for Dobell does not seem to support the after-hours service at Wyong Hospital. But, believe me, the people of Wyong shire, the people that live in that area, do. (<inline font-style="italic">Extension of time granted</inline>) What I am doing tonight is calling on the government to support that after-hours clinic at Wyong Hospital, to work with the state government to ensure that the people of the Central Coast get the absolute best service that they can. They need that after-hours service. I would like the minister to come back to me with answers to those four questions.</para>

<para>âI, too, am very disappointed that the Minister for Health and Ageing is not here this evening to address these issues, because some of the ones that I am bringing up are vitally important, particularly dental care. This is a huge issue within my electorate, particularly considering that 20 per cent of the population are aged over 65. Health matters, and particularly dental health matters, are ones that I hear about every single day. So many people are having to wait, sometimes over two years, to get their teeth fixed or to get their dentures repaired. I often hear terrible stories of people in pain who are unable to eat and of people whose ill-fitting dentures have fallen out. The situations that some people are in because of the fact that the federal funding was removed from this program in 1997 are just horrendous across the board.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">In fact it is a constitutional responsibility for the federal government to provide for dental health care. I had hoped to ask the minister directly why that federal funding is not being put into this very important area, because it is not just your teeth that are affectedâdental care can affect your overall health as well. It can have impacts upon people in terms of strokes and heart disease, and also for people suffering from diabetes. This really is a major health concern across the nation but particularly in my electorate, as I say, because of the large number of elderly people. I would like to hear from the minister as to when he intends adhering to the federal government responsibility, as contained in the Constitution, to ensure that there is funding for dental health care.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The other major health issue that I want to raise with him is the absolute desperate need for a Medicare office in the southern section of my electorate. Presently people can only travel to Tweed or Lismore to access a Medicare office, and it is often very difficultâagain, particularly for elderly people or for those on low incomesâfor them to get transport to those areas. During the election campaign when Labor announced the policy of having a Medicare office in Mullumbimby, this was received so well by so many people who so desperately needed to have a Medicare office close by. I was hoping to ask the minister first-hand as to when there would be a Medicare office in the southern section of the Richmond electorate.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The other matter that I want to raise is specifically in relation to ageing and the provision of home care. As I said, 20 per cent of the Richmond electorate are aged over 65. This is one of the highest proportions in the country. Current estimates are saying that in 2040 that is what Australiaâs population will be like. That is many years away. Right here and now on the ground that is what we have got in Richmond. So we are seeing first-hand the needs of an ageing population and indeed how desperate those needs have become.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In April I held an aged care summit, for the very reason that people were approaching me daily about their concerns, particularly in relation to the lack of home care within the Richmond electorate. People were saying that they would be assessed for home care and would have to wait sometimes eight, nine or 10 months. Let us just take a moment to look at these people. They have moved to this area and they have retired there. They often tend to not have a lot of family or community networks. One of the partners gets sick, they get assessed for home care and they have to sit at home waiting for those eight, nine or 10 months. In fact, most people are often told: âLook, there is just no federal funding, so youâll just have to wait.â What do these people do? What ends up happening, often, if they are lucky, is that a volunteer organisation is able to provide some sort of limited care. But at the end of the day you have many hundreds of elderly people sitting in their homes deteriorating day by day. I think, in this day and age, that is absolutely horrendous. As I say, this is what Australiaâs population is going to be like in 35 years. We have got to get it rightâon the ground, here and now, in Richmondâwith our ageing population.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I notice that 2,000 new dementia packages were announced in the budget, but that is nationally. It hardly touches the surface of what is desperately needed in this area. I want to comment on the 75 packages that were released not too long ago from Grafton to the border. We are talking about a huge area: the electorate of Richmond goes from Skennars Head to Tweed Heads and we have the highest proportion of elderly people, and they are not getting the packages they so desperately need. As I say, they wait eight, nine and 10 months. What sort of respect is that for elderly people who have worked all their lives, who have now retired, who have been assessed for this home care and who then have to wait this long period of time? Sometimes they are even waiting longer than this. I think our elderly deserve better and I would like to know from the Minister for Ageing why there was not more provision for home care from the federal government in areas like Richmond where we have the highest proportion of elderly people and where the need is so desperate. We have to make sure that we are providing for the elderly people in our society.</para>

<para>âI have a couple of quick questions for the Minister for Ageing. I would like to join with the member for Richmond on the issue that she raised about the lack of HACC services for people living in the community of Lake Macquarie on the Central Coast. I ask the minister to consider extending those services so that there are more available. I note that more packages have been released, as the member for Richmond said, but I think that the minister needs to look at a strategy to encourage the service providers to deliver those packages to more outlying areas. Within the electorate of Shortland many of the providers are in the inner Newcastle areaâthis is in the Lake Macquarie partâand it is very difficult to find any providers at all in the outlying regions like Catherine Hill Bay and Nords Wharf. Similarly people living in the more outlying and difficult areas on the Central Coast are not serviced in the same way.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The other issue I raise is respite. I note that the government has increased the time available for respite for people but I am not sure whether the minister is aware that in many areas throughout Australia, particularly in my electorate, it is very difficult to access respite beds. Therefore there needs to be a strategy put in place, not only extending the time but ensuring that people can access respite beds when they need them.</para>

<para>âIt would be a breathtaking act of arrogance if the Howard government did not supply answers to these questions because they are of vital interest to Australians with lung cancer, epilepsy and depression and to those at risk of osteoporosis. One of the measures in the budget was the implementation of the Howard governmentâs election savings measure which was the 12.5 per cent benchmark pricing measure in respect of the PBS. My questions are these: will the Minister for Health and Ageing or the Minister for Ageing, who is at the table on his behalfâand if the Minister for Ageing is unable to do so will she procure an undertaking that the Minister for Health and Ageing will answer these questionsâconfirm that the Department of Health and Ageing did not have anything to do with costing the 12.5 per cent benchmark price changes under the PBS? Will the minister guarantee that no drugs other than the ones announced last Wednesday will be subject to a special patient contributionâthat is, drugs beyond the four comprehended in last Wednesdayâs press release? I refer to that press release, which announced the special patient contributions, in which the minister said that he had received expert advice that other PBS-listed drugs can be used in place of the four drugs that now have special patient contributions. Who provided this advice? When was it provided and will the minister release it?</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para pgwide="yes">As patented drugs move to generics, there is a question about the way in which savings are catered for on the PBS. We have been advisedâand this was a badge of honour worn by the ministerâs department at Senate estimatesâthat the department have been in consultation with the drug industry about when branded drugs are going to move to generics in respect of the 12Â½ per cent pricing measure. Yet we had been told by them before the last election that they could not quantify such savings for the general costs of the PBS.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">My question is: why arenât the savings from the statins, which everybody knows are coming off patent, and from the SSRI group of drugs, which everybody knows are coming off patent, factored into the expenditure forecasts of the PBS? Why is the department of health capable of forecasting and costing these savings for one budget purposeâthat is, to support the Howard governmentâs election promise about 12Â½ per cent benchmark pricingâbut not for the general purpose of accurately forecasting PBS spending and the potential for savings?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Briefly, on the decision to take calcium tablets off the PBS, has any modelling been done on the impact of the removal of calcium tablets from the PBS on calcium tablet usage by people at risk of osteoporosis? Finally, will the minister guarantee that no other medicine will be delisted from the PBS without a recommendation of the PBAC? I am in a position to supply those questions to the minister at the table, the Minister for Ageing, in writing.</para>

<para>âThe member for Lalor has produced a series of questions in writing. She has offered to produce more questions in writing. The undertaking I give to her is that I will pass the questions on to the Minister for Health and Ageing. I turn to the matters that the member for Shortland raised. In relation to after-hours GP services, we are working with New South Wales to establish after-hours GP clinics at the hospitals in Liverpool, Nepean and Lismore, and Wyong could be eligible for support from the Round the Clock Medicare election commitment. The minister would certainly be happy to have discussions with the New South Wales government in that regard.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Both the member for Shortland and the member for Richmond raised Medicare offices. The Minister for Human Services, Minister Joe Hockey, is responsible for the Health Insurance Commission. The issue of when Medicare offices open and close obviously depends on local demand, as that changes. I am happy to pass these issues on to Minister Hockey, as the minister responsible for the Health Insurance Commission.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The member for Shortland also raised the issue of respite care. The Australian government introduced the National Respite for Carers Program. It currently has funding of about $130 million. In the last budget we announced further funding of $208 million specifically for respite care, directed to areas of need, including further respite for working carers. In other words, this is to give them more flexibility by having respite centres open before and after working hours. There are increased incentives for residential aged care providers to have respite places available and to increase the uptake of respite, because we find that not all providers are fully utilising the allocated respite. That is why the extra funding has been allocated in this budget. We have also increased the funding for overnight and cottage style respite, which will be welcome in all areasâmetropolitan, outer metropolitan, rural and regionalâand there is more funding for respite in rural and regional Australia through the multipurpose services.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The issue of dental care was raised by the member for Richmond. Dental care is a matter for state and territory governments. It is not a matter for the Commonwealth. The Commonwealthâs role has been in supporting dental services through the private health insurance rebate, and that is also focusing on the needs of older Australians with the increasing private health rebate for people over the ages of 65 and 70.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The member for Richmond also complained of the lack of aged care funding in her electorate. I thought that when I visited her electorate over the weekend for the very pleasant opening of an aged care home in Byron Bay I was able to outline to her and to the community representatives present that, in fact, the Australian government has committed a great deal of funding to the Far North Coast region in which the electorate of Richmond lies. There has been a 50 per cent increase in the allocation of aged care places in the Far North Coast region. The national increase has been 33 per cent but in the Far North Coast, in response to the increasing numbers of people over the age of 70, there has been a 50 per cent increase even though the age cohort over 70 has increased by some 29 per cent.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The member for Richmond must be aware that aged care planning allocations are made via an independent, objective arms-length process that involves local planning advisory committees who advise on special needs. It is done through the Department of Health and Ageing. In terms of the allocation of places, this governmentâs record is exemplary. From the period of 1996 to 2007, over 95,200 aged care places will have been allocated across Australia.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The member for Richmond obviously was not in parliament in 1996. She would have been mightily embarrassed by the report of the Auditor-General that when Labor left office in 1996 there was a 10,000 place deficit. So I do not think Labor members can come into this House with any integrity and complain about the allocation of aged care places when this government rectified the deficit and has now allocated some 95,200 places across Australia for the period 1996 to 2007. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âMembers may be aware that on 2 June 2005 a pod of 60 whales beached themselves near Busselton in Western Australia. This incident prompted an extraordinary reaction from Australians from every walk of life. Over 1,500 locals donned their wetsuits and waded into the shallows to help rescue these stranded whales. Their efforts were rewarded with the successful return of the bulk of that pod to the open sea.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">This incident demonstrates the deep respect and affection which the Australian people have for these giants of the deep. Furthermore, it demonstrates the strong public interest in Australia in the conservation of the species. So it is worth taking this opportunity to reflect on what steps our fearless foreign minister has taken to protect these creatures. It is particularly timely to do so today, the first day of the 2005 annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission in Ulsan in South Korea.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Regrettably, our foreign minister has been missing in action on this issue. We have seen a flurry of activity from the environment minister, Senator Campbell, over the last six weeks or so, largely I suspect in response to prompting from those of us on this side of the House and from those in the media. But we fear that this may prove to be an inadequate response if what we are concerned about is the ending of Japanâs abuse of the practice of so-called whaling for scientific purposes.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Japan of course has made no secret of its whaling ambitions. Since the commercial whaling ban was first introduced in 1986, Japan has been building up its support base within the International Whaling Commission, and its efforts have hardly gone unnoticed. At every IWC meeting since 1986 Japan has proposed a motion to allow it to hunt whales commercially in the Pacific. Over the years the balance of support on this matter within the IWC has gradually changed from a majority in favour of keeping the ban to an approximate fifty-fifty split.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Today, on this first day of the 2005 IWC meeting, we will see whether Japan has finally been able to stack out this meeting. Voting on procedural motions today should begin to reveal the final balance between the pro- and anti-whaling lobbies of the IWC. Japan may be getting very close to achieving a majority vote in support of a resumption of commercial whaling. But our concern, whether or not that occurs, is with what happens about Japanâs continued abuse of so-called scientific whaling in general.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Under the IWC rules, a change to the moratorium on commercial whaling requires a 75 per cent majority of the meeting. The political reality is that a simple majority vote in favour of commercial whaling would be a serious setback for those wanting to bring an end to the slaughter of these magnificent beasts. Japanese whaling ambitions and its efforts to increase its influence on the IWC are of course not new. These have been looming for years. This is therefore a matter on which the government should have been working for years, just as the government of Japan has been working for years on this matterânot just for the past six weeks, when it became a public item of media attention.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">So today, on the day when the balance at the IWC is at risk of tipping in favour of the pro-whaling lobby for the first time or at least getting close to that, the question must be asked: what has the government done to counteract the influence of Japan and other pro-whaling countries on the IWC over the past few years? We are in the ridiculous situation where neighbours and good friends of Australia such as Kiribati, the Solomons, Tuvalu and now, as we discovered over the weekend, Nauru may well have joined Japan in the IWC to support the lifting of the commercial whaling ban. If that occursâand it is still a big âifâ, because we do not know the outcome of the voteâit would be a most disturbing development in terms of the effectiveness of Australian diplomacy in the south-west Pacific. With Nauruâs overnight announcement that it would be joining the IWC as part of the pro-whaling lobby, questions must be asked about the effectiveness of, in particular, Australiaâs diplomatic efforts with that country.

<para>âThe member for Griffithâand I think the entire nationâis aware that Australia is strongly opposed to Japanâs plans to increase its scientific whaling effort. In fact, Australia is one of the leading organisations in advocating for the interests of this remarkable mammal. This includes our actions in our own immediate neighbourhood but also more broadly in our work through the International Whaling Commission. More than half of the IWC, including Australia, have refused to review the Japanese arrangements until an independent review of the original scientific whaling program of Japan has been undertaken. We have not ruled in or out any particular action, because at this stage the crucial thing, to which I think the member for Griffith was alluding, is diplomacy. Diplomacy is at this stage our most direct pathway for securing the best prospect for success.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Our nation has been working with other like-minded countries to put pressure on the Japanese not only directly through their Ministry of Foreign Affairs but also through their fishing agenciesâso at a diplomatic level and at a scientific level. Australia has also been urging other members of the IWC to cease this so-called scientific whaling. As you would know, Senator Campbell has done a remarkable job in directly approaching a number of Pacific island countries and European countries to lobby in support of our position. The Prime Minister and the foreign minister have directly written to their counterparts in the governments of a number of IWC member states, seeking support for our position on whaling. That work continues, including most recent representations in light of Nauruâs decision to join the IWC.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">So I think it is a little unfair and disingenuous to say that nothing has been happening. There has been extensive effort going forward. We understand the diplomatic pressures that are being brought to bear on countries through Japan using levers such as aid projects and the like. We are mindful of that. Ordinarily we are partners with Japan on good governance, aid harmonisation and the like, but here we are on different sides of the argument. But absolutely no suggestion can be sustained that anything other than complete vigour is going into the Australian effort to support our position at the IWC.</para>

<para>âWhen did the government first become aware that Nauru was considering joining the International Whaling Commission? Did Senator Campbell visit Nauru? Has the Australian foreign minister raised these matters with his counterpart in Nauru? What action was taken to influence and persuade Nauru to support Australiaâs strong antiwhaling position? What representations has the government, at its broadest level, made to the government of Nauru? There is a larger question about Foreign Minister Downerâs role in the conduct of Australiaâs diplomatic efforts in the IWC. What action has the foreign minister personally taken in support of Australiaâs antiwhaling stance? Under questioning in Senate estimates two weeks ago, officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade illuminated us. When asked, the department was unable to point to any representations made by the foreign minister since the IWC meeting in 2004ânot one. Senator Faulkner said:</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">So there we have the minister, on this matter of deep concern to the Australian people, simply asleep at the wheel. The bottom line is that he was in Japan, in Tokyo. He was meeting with the Japanese government. He is the foreign minister of Australia. His departmental annual report says he has co-responsibility with the Minister for the Environment and Heritage for discharging Australiaâs policy obligations in whaling policy around the world. And what does our fearless foreign minister do in Japan? I presume he had a great game of tennisâa bit of golf maybe, I am not quite sureâbut did he actually engage in the whaling policy issue? I do not think so. In fact, Senate estimates confirms through departmental officials that he did no such thing. Let us go again to Senate estimates, where we have further interesting revelations on the governmentâs energetic efforts in defence of the worldâs whaling population.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">It seems that, despite the fact that this matter involved a major international meeting and the lobbying of foreign governmentsâall matters that clearly fall within the job description of the Minister for Foreign AffairsâMr Downer has seen fit to outsource his responsibility on this to a junior minister in another portfolio. Bruce, you could have done a lot better than this. In fact, I would have been much happier had you taken up the cudgels on this matter instead of throwing it to the C teamânamely, the minister for environment.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Having made only half-hearted, last-minute efforts to save whales on the international stageâand then, largely in response to political pressure from the opposition and the mediaâwhat has the Howard governmentâs record been much closer to home? Let us look at the whole question of whaling in the Australian Whale Sanctuary. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> With great fanfare, the Howard government proposed the establishment of an Australian whale protection zone in the Australian Antarctic waters. It established that under an act of the Australian parliament, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Section 229 of that act makes it a criminal offence to take any action which leads to the death or injury of a whale within the Australian Whale Sanctuary. The offence is punishable by imprisonment of up to two years or a $110,000 fine. These are serious laws.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The government has obviously seen fit to legislate in this parliament to protect Australiaâs whale population. But what has happened since? When it became known that since 1999, Japanese whalers have taken out hundreds of whales in those waters and the matter was then brought to the Federal Court, what did the Australian government do through the Attorney-General? One answer is that it did nothing; another answer is that it did a lot. What it did was effectively harpoon the case being brought by the Humane Society International to try and protect Australian whales in the self-proclaimed Australian Whale Sanctuary.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Humane Society International, HSI, launched proceedings in the Federal Court against the Japanese company Kyodo Senpaku Kaisha Ltd. It has asked the Federal Court of Australia for a ruling that the companyâs actions are illegal. It has also asked the court for an injunction which would prohibit the further killing of whales in Australian waters. The bulk of HSIâs evidence against the company comes from the Japanese governmentâs own reports to the IWC on its scientific research program. HSI claims that the cruise reports of the Japanese Whale Research Program under Special Permit in the Antarctic, JARPA, indicate that, since 2000, the Japanese company the subject of the legal challenge has illegally killed over 400 whales within the Australian Whale Sanctuary.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">What was the Howard governmentâs response to this move by the humane society to enforce its own laws? Not only has the government refused to do its own job of enforcing Australian law; it has actually moved to block the Humane Society Internationalâs attempts to do so. The Attorney-General, on behalf of the Howard government and presumably Foreign Minister Downer and Environment Minister Senator Campbell, made a submission to the Federal Court in which he argued: (1) that Australiaâs sovereignty over the Australian Antarctic Territory and the adjacent maritime zones are not recognised by Japan; and (2) that Japan would consider any attempt by Australia to enforce Australian law in the Australian Antarctic Territory as a breach of international law. The Attorney-General admitted in his submission that, firstly, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act has force in the Australian Antarctic Territory, including against foreigners; and, secondly, the fact that foreign states do not recognise the law does not preclude the application of the law to nationals of that state.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Nevertheless, the Attorney-General said that the government considers it âmore appropriate to pursue diplomatic solutions in relation to the activities by foreign vesselsâ off the Australian Antarctic Territory. In other words, the government says: âYes, the Japanese are breaking Australian laws, and the fact that Japan does not recognise our sovereignty does not preclude us from taking action to enforce our laws, but we would prefer not to enforce our laws. We would rather use diplomacy instead.â That diplomacy appears to be demonstrably failing. In other wordsââOops! Sorry, we donât want to offend the Japanese. We donât want to create a diplomatic incident. Weâre not about to enforce our own laws.â</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This is a Howard government law to protect a Howard government proclaimed Australian Whale Sanctuary, established under a Howard government act of parliament. Their response to the Australian people has been that they are too weak to do anything about it. Frankly, it is pathetic. It is more than pathetic; it involves a level of deception as well. On 27 May, the Federal Court in Sydney confirmed what we would argue as being the Howard governmentâs hypocritical response to the slaughter of whales in the Australian Whale Sanctuary adjacent to Antarctica. The Howard governmentâs intervention in the case caused the court to refuse permission to the Humane Society International to proceed against Japanese whaling companies. Specifically, the Federal Court cited the intervention of the Attorney-General, Mr Ruddock, who argued that to enforce Australian law against the Japanese company âwould be likely to give rise to international disagreement with Japanâ.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Laborâs calls for the government to take action against Japan in the International Court of Justice have only been reinforced by the decision of the Federal Court. Our view now is that, because of the difficulties this case has run into, we need to take the legal challenge to Japan to a new level. We say that, given what has occurred in the Federal Court, the only available jurisdiction to bring about the proper protection for whales world wide is for an appropriate action to be taken in the International Court of Justice.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Â (<inline font-style="italic">Extension of time granted</inline>) You see, what happened with the Federal Court matter was this: we had an Australian government proclaimed law concerning the Australian Antarctic Territory waters, within which was proclaimed an Australian Whale Sanctuary, and the government said, âWell, we canât really enforce that law because thereâs not sufficient international legal recognition of Australiaâs sovereignty claim in that area.â Isnât that a problem at the very time you proclaim the Australian Whale Sanctuary in the first place? If you thought in 1999 it was a bogus proposition, why did you do it? Why did you put out the press releases? Why did you try and claim the political credit? If you thought back then it was unenforceable, why go through the great political song-and-dance routine of pretending that it is real? This is an extraordinary matter. The argument, however, that the government put in submissions was that Australian law does apply in these areas, including in relation to foreign vesselsâand it is time the government got serious about this. That is why we think the only course of action available is an appropriate action before the ICJ.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The scientific research exemption on the international whaling convention provides an opportunity for Japanese whalers to flout the ban on commercial whaling. We believe that there may well be a strong case under international law that Japan is not acting in good faith or in accordance with its treaty obligations under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, 1946. In support of this proposition we would point to an article by professor of international law Gillian Triggs. The article was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Asia Pacific Journal of International Law</inline> 2000 and explored the possibility of taking Japan to the ICJ on the basis that its hunting of whales for scientific purposes constitutes an abuse of rights.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In summary, the basis of a possible claim would be that Japan is abusing its permit to kill whales for scientific purposes and that this is not in accordance with the intention of the IWC treaty. The doctrine of the abuse of rights is essentially an extension of the principle that rights must be exercised in good faithâin other words, that a right must be exercised for the purpose for which it exists, not to undermine that purpose. In other words, a right granted under a treaty must not be used for the purpose of evading an obligation under that treaty. The doctrine of the abuse of rights has recently been recognised in the shrimp-turtle case, in which the WTO appellate body found that a state must exercise its treaty rights reasonably and in a bona fide matter and that, while the state may invoke an exception allowed in a treaty, a balance must be achieved between the exercise of that exceptional right and the treaty rights of other parties.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Professor Triggs in her article sets out the possible case against Japan. As a member of the IWC, Japan has voluntarily agreed to be bound by the international convention on whaling, which prohibits the killing of whales for commercial use. Japanâs hunting of whales is conducted under an exemption to that treaty which allows for special permits to be granted for the killing of whales for scientific purposes. It is argued that Japan, through its use of this exemption, is not acting for scientific purposes as required but instead using the exemption to procure whales for commercial sale, which is prohibited under the convention. It is therefore argued that Japan is not acting in good faith and is in fact abusing this right in order to evade its treaty obligations under the convention to observe the moratorium on commercial whaling. It is further argued that Japanâs evasion of its treaty obligations undermines the legitimate interests of other states party to the IWC which have a legitimate interest in the moratorium on commercial whaling being honoured. It is basically a matter of degrees.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">To make out the case, Australia would need to demonstrate that the primary purpose of the permit was other than for scientific research. While Japan would be able to show that the permits are used for scientific research, Australia could call its bona fides into doubt if it could demonstrate, for example, that the research (1) has little scientific value, (2) could be conducted without actually killing whales, (3) could be conducted by the killing of a smaller number of whales or (4) is insignificant when compared with the commercial uses to which whale meat is put.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This particular legal opinion has in fact been made available during a year 2000 IWC meeting in Adelaide by a DFAT legal officer. I quote the verbatim transcript of the IWC meeting, where the Australian legal representative supplied by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">... Mr Chairman, I would now like to bring to the attention of the Commission some recent developments in international legal practice and precedent which for many international lawyers raise the possibility that Japan might not be acting properly within its legal rights when it issues scientific permits.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">That is the department of foreign affairs legal representative at an International Whaling Commission meeting in Adelaide in the year 2000. That is not the Australian Labor Party speaking. That is not the international antiwhaling movement speaking. That is DFATâs own legal officer sending a shot across the bow, so to speak, of Japanâs whaling interest. (<inline font-style="italic">Extension of time granted.)</inline> The department admitted that it had taken legal advice on whaling issues and refused to confirm or deny whether an action in the ICJ was being considered, saying no option had been ruled out, whether diplomatic or legal.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In summary, looking at the whaling issue as a whole, what we have seen is a range of failures on the part of the government to properly protect whales. Firstly, we have seen what appears to be a very laggardly approach by the government in the prosecution of its diplomatic relationships in the South Pacific and elsewhere in the world in the lead-up to this meeting of the IWC in South Korea. Secondly, we have seen the whole question of the governmentâs intervention in the court case in the Federal Court brought by Humane Society International. Thirdly, we have seen a government so timorous in its approach to this question that it has refused so far to countenance taking this matter to the International Court of Justice, despite having flagged the possibility of such an action in a legal opinion that was presented to the IWC meeting in Adelaide in 2000.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">When it comes to the proper protection of whales our challenge to the Howard government is very simple. In plain spoken English, it is simply this: get real, cut to the chase, do something that will actually cause the end of this abuse of so-called scientific whaling by Japan around the worldânot just in Australian Antarctic Territory waters, not just in our own part of the world, but worldwide. The best way to do that is through a focused legal action before the ICJ in order to bring this unacceptable slaughter of the worldâs whale population to a close.</para>

<para>âI am aware that time is very limited so I will be very brief. I would appreciate some advice on one issue from the parliamentary secretary. That issue is the ECP, which is regarded by both sides of the parliament as a key program in Australiaâs involvement with and relationship to Papua New Guinea. As you would be aware just recently the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea ruled key elements of the programâor the legislation in relation to the police component of the programâunconstitutional. It would be helpful to get advice from the parliamentary secretary about what steps are now being taken to get the key elements and the core goals of the program back on track. It would also be helpful to get some explanation from the parliamentary secretary about what contributed to the failures of the arrangements to date.</para>

<para>âI will go first to the member for Griffithâs comments. As I made clear in an earlier contribution, the government have not ruled out any legal or diplomatic avenues to bring pressure to bear on Japan. I thought we had made that point quite clear. In relation to the court action he was referring to, the Attorney-Generalâs submission did what you would hope all lawyers would do and that was point out frankly and clearly the practical difficulties associated with enforcing Australian law against foreign nationals in the EEZ off the Australian Antarctic Territoryâa point that the Federal Court recognised.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">In relation to other avenues, as I have mentioned we have not ruled out any legal or diplomatic options, and I have characterised the spread of diplomatic overtures. But even on the doctrine of abuse of rights, where one may argue that scientific whaling permits are in breach of rights, you need a scientific basis to argue that case. As I mentioned earlier, that is why Australia, together with about half the other countries that send delegates to the IWC, is arguing for an independent review of Japanâs original scientific whaling program. One needs evidence in order to support any argument one may mount if it is to work going forward.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The foreign minister has also written to the President of Nauru, Ludwig Scotty, and Foreign Affairs Minister, David Adeang. At this stage it is unclear whether the delegation would attend the IWC meeting, but it appears as though they will and that is another avenue for advocacy.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I turn quickly to the member for Maribyrnong. He and I share a concern that the setback regarding the Wenge decision in Papua New Guinea has taken some momentum out of the program, out of the ECP. The foreign minister met with the PNG Foreign Minister and the Minister for Internal Security on 26 May, and I think there was a shared commitment to finding a way forward. Senior officials also met in Port Moresby on 9 and 10 June to examine possible solutions. The discussions have been constructive. A range of possible avenues are being canvassed, given the complexity of the court ruling. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> Given the strong commitment on both sides to finding a way forward, a range of avenues are being canvassed. One is how to find a solution that will maintain the ECP in its current form and protect it from future legal challenges.

<para>âIt has not been ruled out comprehensively. It has been, I think, identified as not the preferred pathway. But the Wenge decision gives rise to diplomatic immunity available to all foreign nationals. Through you, Mr Chairman, to the member for Maribyrnong, I think that is resonating with some of the people in Port Moresbyâthat it is one thing to deal with the ECP; it is another thing, in light of that court decision, to provide for appropriate immunities for foreign government representation in that country. That is not a dead duck, if I can put it that way, but it is certainly not straightforward either. The other avenue being canvassed is whether some amendment to the PNG legislation is another pathway, but that may still leave some residual issues to be resolved.</para>

<para pgwide="yes">The last point related to the Australian governmentâs awareness of the PNG legislation. In June 2004, officials provided some suggested text to assist the PNG draft the legislation. PNG took responsibility for its own legislation but took on board those drafting suggestions. I am aware of some concerns that some PNG officials had about constitutional inconsistencies. That has obviously given rise to the outcome through the Wenge case, and that is why everybody is beavering away trying to find a way forward, because that is in everyoneâs interest and we are encouraged by the shared commitment to find a constructive pathway forward.</para>

<para>âIt is a hope. Details have been provided of a review of aviation policy. It was first mentioned in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> under the title âHoward protects Qantasâ on 11 June this year, following the government deferring its decision to liberalise airline access on routes to the United States. I am talking about the Qantas-Singapore Airlines wrangling. I have a number of questions, which I will list, and hopefully the parliamentary secretary can make note and give the parliament some answers. Firstly, how will this review differ from the aviation industry outlook put to cabinet last month? Secondly, which department will conduct that review? What will be the terms of reference for that review? Will these include an assessment of potential industry consolidationâand I refer back to an article entitled âVaile backs Qantas mergerâ, which appeared in the media just recently? Further, what is the time frame for the completion of the review? Will industry public submissions be called for and, if so, how and when? Will there be public hearings on this matter?

<para> relate to the administration of the Regional Partnerships program; I know the parliamentary secretary is involved in the administration of that program. Given the lavish advertising budgets of the Howard government, particularly in election years, it could be remarked on as a rather surprising fact that no advertising campaigns have been conducted to promote or encourage funding applications for the Regional Partnerships program. Since the increased budget allocations in 2005-06, this program is a half a billion dollar program. It has been about bolstering the government in target electorates. It has become rather better known, as a result of the oppositionâs scrutiny of the governmentâs pork-barrelling, than it was before.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">When the program was launched, there were no ads on TV, no ads on radio and no ads in the newspapers. The government did not write to Labor or other non-government MPs telling us about the program and how constituents of non-government electorates could make funding applications. So my question to the parliamentary secretary is: can he advise whether the department prepared a communications strategy for the Regional Partnerships program, including things like letters to MPs to explain the purpose of the program and to provide information for the Australian community? Indeed, was the department only tasked to prepare letters to government members of parliament, providing information about the program? Has it become standard practice under the Howard government to differentiate between government MPs and non-government MPs in providing advice on programs distributing taxpayersâ funds?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It has also emerged from scrutiny of the governmentâs regional programs in the House and from the Senate inquiry into the Regional Partnerships program that there was a set of guidelines which applied to some but not all grantsâthe so-called Strategic Opportunities Notional Allocation or SONA guidelines. I have a number of questions concerning these guidelines. Is it correct that these guidelines were kept secret from the public? Is it correct that chairs of area consultative committees were not advised of their existence? Is it also correct that spending on projects under these secret guidelines blew out from an expected $3 million last financial year to $21 million? Is it correct that projects that fell outside the public Regional Partnerships guidelines could be approved under SONA guidelines but that prospective applicants were never made aware of this and so may have been deterred from lodging applications?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Deputy Prime Minister, under the heat of the oppositionâs scrutiny, has refused reasonable information requests from the Senate inquiry. This does not bode particularly well for the transparency and accountability of this government post July 1. In particular, the government has refused to release all area consultative committee advice on Regional Partnerships applications across the board. Yet it selectively releases area consultative committee advice to back up some of its funding decisions that have been queriedâfor example, the Deputy Prime Minister tabled on 2 December last year the RM Williams centre funding application. How does the government justify this lack of transparency? Has the department been directed to withhold this information by the minister? I think the processes of the department require further scrutiny. We see that some applications lodged by area consultative committees under the Regional Partnerships program were not processed for up to nine months while 12 projects were approved within 24 hours of the applications being made.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I also refer the parliamentary secretary to the departmentâs evidence to the Senate inquiry that in a number of applications, including the $4.95 million grant to the University of New England, the minister explicitly asked the department to bring the application forward as quickly as possible. On how many occasions did this happen and why did the minister ask for some projects to be brought forward and not others? Another point about the evidence to the Senate inquiry into Regional Partnerships is that the department advised that the decision-making ministerâin most cases parliamentary secretary Mrs Kellyâon 11 occasions approved grants that the department recommended be rejected, on three occasions approved full funding for projects the department proposed should receive a lesser amount and in three cases rejected a project the department recommended be approved. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> Will details of those projects and the reason that the minister ignored the departmental recommendations in each of those cases be provided to the parliament? In my book they certainly should be. I would appreciate responses from the parliamentary secretary on these issues.</para>

<para>âI regret that the minister is not here this evening to answer the questions I will ask on behalf of my electorate of Lowe in relation to aircraft noise. I want to inform the parliamentary secretary, that I was elected to this place on this very issue. My predecessor was a member of the Howard government and in January 1998 resigned in disgust because the Prime Minister was not prepared to back his local member in relation to the excessive amounts of aircraft noise over the electorate of Lowe and indeed the inner west of Sydney. I have spoken on this issue more often than any other during my 6Â½ years in this House. It is a very important issue for my electorate.</para>

<para pgwide="yes">But I am very concerned that the Deputy Prime Minister is behaving very arrogantly in response to the innumerable questions that I have placed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> and the speeches that I have made in this House.

<para>âIn the year 2000, the Howard government said that it would review Sydneyâs airport needs in 2005. The time has come. However, thanks to the member for Batmanâs question on notice, it has been revealed that the government has breached its commitment to review Sydneyâs airport needs in 2005. Indeed, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services continues to cling to his flawed master plan as an explanation for the governmentâs inaction on Sydney airport. The minister for transport approved the Sydney airport master plan on 22 March 2004. The plan claims that Kingsford Smith is able to cope with increased traffic over the next 20 years, yet the plan projects a 180 per cent increase in the number of aircraft movements at Sydney airportâfrom 225,200 movements per year in 2001-02 to 412,000 movements per year by 2023-24. Further, the next 20 years will see a tripling of passengers, from 23 million to 68 million.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The plan denies that this dramatic increase in traffic will result in an eventual removal of the curfew and movement cap. The reality is that already movements are seriously encroaching on these curfew periods. A recent Airservices Australia report indicated that the number of aircraft movements increased by nine per cent between January 2002 and January 2005. Residents in and around my electorate are suffering the bulk of this increase, along with those in the member for Loweâs electorate. As the number of movements increase at the airport, the concentration is increased to the north. This is the most densely populated area of Sydney. The residents of Sydenham, St Peters and Marrickville are being subjected to between 13 and 18 more flights per day that exceed the 70 decibel levelâthat is, the level at which conversations are interrupted and watching television or listening to the radio becomes impossible.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Such a significant increase over the past three years alone highlights the undeniable falsehoods of the master plan. Claims that Sydney airport can cope alone are dishonest and misleading. I draw the Houseâs attention once again to the issue of Fort Street High School. The fact that kids have their education disrupted up to every three minutes by low-flying aircraft is an outrage. It should be addressed, and that school should be insulated. You do not have different hearing according to your wealth. The fact is that some schools have been insulated around the site. Taverners Hill Infants School, 200 metres down the road, has been insulated but Fort Street missed out. The government should fix it. It is playing politics with peopleâs futures, and young people deserve better. There must be a mandatory enforcement of the curfew and the movement cap.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">International flights at KSA continue to be scheduled to land outside of the 6 am and 11 pm curfew period. These are scheduled flights. This morning a British Airways flight, BA15 from London, landed at 5.05 am. In all, 10 international flights landed this morning before 6 am. Seven flights are scheduled to breach the curfew tomorrow morning between 5 am and 6 am. Freight flights also continue to be granted dispensations to land outside of the curfew period. The use and abuse of the so-called shoulder period continues to inflict aircraft noise on communities that already suffer considerably during the non-curfew periods. Just last month I informed the House about a low-flying jet which created a vortex that lifted 100 tiles from the roof of a residence in my electorateâthis is the kind of impact aircraft are having on residents in my electorate. This is a practical reality of living in Sydenham in 2005.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Instead of reviewing and addressing these issues, as previously committed, the government has instead approved an outrageous expansion of Sydney airportâs commercial facilities with no regard for the fact that $1.8 billion of extra infrastructure will be required. Twelve-storey car parks and tower blocks of shops, hotels and offices are instead the ministerâs plans for the airport. The minister is ignoring the ever-increasing crisis of aircraft noise in Sydneyâs inner west and is instead creating one of increased traffic and congestion on the ground. The minister has not paid a single visit to a school, a nursing home, a church or a community organisation around the airport. He has shown contempt since he became the ministerâunlike, I might say, Mark Vaile and John Sharp, his predecessors, who both came to the electorate and had a look first-hand. This is a minister who has shown contempt. Whatever Max Moore-Wilton wants simply goes at Sydney airport. It is unacceptable. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI want to add to a question I asked earlier and seek confirmation of the governmentâs intention with regard to the Ipswich Motorway northern option. I now have a comparison, and I want to put on the record that comparison between the two options. The full upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway would provide a full upgrade along the entire 19 kilometres of the motorway. It would cost $1.1 billion, which includes $160 million for the Logan interchange upgrade. This equates to around $57 million per kilometre. In terms of timing, the planning has been finalised, and, if construction were started today, the full upgrade could be completed by the end of 2009. In terms of construction, it can be done in stages to minimise traffic disruption. The Goodna-Gailes section could be completed by 2008 and only five per cent of construction would be done under traffic, with some sections of the motorway realigned completely. With regard to the long-term benefits of upgrading the Ipswich Motorway, it is designed to cater for traffic flow for more than 20 years and would deliver six lanes for through traffic along an entire route, as well as a series of local and service roads to cater for local traffic. That means a network of between 10 and 17 lanes.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Compare that, Parliamentary Secretary, with the half-bypass option. It is only eight kilometres of road. It would cost about the same sort of moneyâ$1.1 billionâbut would exclude the $160 million for the Logan interchange upgrade. That equates to around $142 million per kilometre. In terms of timing, a minimum of another three years of planning would be required before design and construction could begin, in mid-2009, and the project would not be completed before 2012.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Given that the Ipswich Motorway is part of the national highway network, funding for any maintenance and construction activity rests with the federal government. When will the minister announce that the project will go ahead, and provide the money that everyone from the PM down during the last federal election campaign promised was on the table? Do we now, after all, find that that was not the truthâthat there is no money allocated for this project? Can the minister either confirm or deny that? When will the minister stop misleading the people of south-east Queensland and actually get on with the job of fixing the road?</para>

<para>âI am disappointed that the minister is not here. Perhaps the parliamentary secretary would attempt to answer a couple of questions. Firstly, in relation to the Namoi structural adjustment fund criteria, could the parliamentary secretary outline the processes involved in obtaining funding from the Namoi structural adjustment fund, with particular reference to the two zeolite mines which are within that catchment area within the Gwydir electorate. Could he explain why one zeolite mine has been funded to the competitive disadvantage of another zeolite mine; and how that fits with the processes of application for funding that have come out of the Namoi structural adjustment package?</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The other question I will ask the parliamentary secretary relates to a story in the <inline font-style="italic">Northern Daily Leader</inline> of 21 September 2004. I understand that the parliamentary secretary will probably be unable to answer this, but I think the minister in question really should answer it. In a story on 21 September 2004 in the <inline font-style="italic">Northern Daily Leader</inline> the Mayor of Tamworth, Councillor James Treloar, was quoted as saying:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The $6 millionâ</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">which was for the equine centre, which the parliamentary secretary is well aware ofâ</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">is coming from the Federal Governmentâs Regional Partnerships Program and even if the Labor Party won next monthâs Federal election, the money would still be there.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The story went on to say:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">... the announcement about the funding had been made possible before the October 9 election because the application, plans and financial details had been submitted by the Australian Equine and Livestock Centre about a month ago â¦</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">So that was just prior to the calling of the election. According to the Mayor of Tamworth:</para>

If it was not the case that everything had been received, why didnât the Deputy Prime Minister or the department correct the inaccuracy in the <inline font-style="italic">Northern Daily Leader</inline> story? In addition, why has the Deputy Prime Minister asserted that funding for the equine centre, particularly given this preamble, was held up by the Senate inquiry into the Regional Partnerships Program?</para>

<para>âIf I could take two minutes of the chamberâs time, I would like to make a very short contribution to this debate and take the opportunity to put some very specific questions to the parliamentary secretary. I would invite him to answer them tonight if he can, but if he cannot do so I would certainly request that he take them on notice and get back to me at a later date.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">My questions involve three road projects in my electorate. The first is the proposed link between the F3 freeway and the New England Highway north of Branxton, sometimes colloquially known as the Kurri corridor; the second is the Weekleyâs Drive intersection; and the third is the Muswellbrook bypass. All of those three projects were part of what was known, I suppose, as the national highway project, and all are projects that have been on the drawing board for some time. Indeed, all three projects had financial commitments from the Commonwealth prior to the 1996 election.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I have to say I find the budget documents increasingly difficult to read. I say that with no embarrassment whatsoever, because I think making them increasingly difficult to read is a deliberate ploy on the part of the government. I know with respect to the Kurri corridor that there was a $250 million commitment in the AusLink program, but my understanding is that there is no commitment to the Kurri corridorâor the F3 linkâin the forward estimates, and I specifically ask the minister to clarify whether that is the case. If there is no commitment in the forward estimates, where does the $250-odd million now stand; is it entirely dependent on an agreement yet to be reached with the New South Wales government; and when does the parliamentary secretary expect any such agreement to be met?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The second project I wish to find out about is the Weekleyâs Drive intersection. It is a project whose cost ranges between some $25 million and $35 million, depending on what treatment is embraced eventually by the Commonwealth, in consultation with the state. Again, this is a project which is now 10 years overdue. The Commonwealth seems to be blaming the state for holding up design on the project. The state advises me that that is not true and that in fact the Commonwealth has been seeking to embrace a cheaper design, which the RTA in New South Wales says is not up to speed for the proper treatment of that intersection in safety terms. So I invite the parliamentary secretary to make some comment on that.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The third project is the Muswellbrook bypass, a much needed bypass for that particular town. Again, that is a project that has been on the drawing board and has been much discussed since prior to the 1996 election. It seems to now be in limbo. I welcome any response that the parliamentary secretary can give me on that particular project.</para>

<para pgwide="yes">With regard to the member for Oxley, the only thing I will mention specifically is the Ipswich Motorway. I think he mentioned a figure of $650 million and indicated that it was all available straightaway. That is actually not so. Under the AusLink package, $627 million was available over the first five-year investment for improvements to that roadâs infrastructure and the urban Brisbane corridor. A significant amount out of those funds has already been committed to upgrading works along the Ipswich Motorway. That includes the preconstruction and design of a new $160 million interchange at the junction of the Ipswich and Logan motorways, which is also the highest priority work in Queenslandâs six-lane proposal, and the implementation of a range of safety works and further planning along the Ipswich Motorway, valued at around $66 million.</para>

<para pgwide="yes">The member for Wills wanted to talk about Regional Partnerships and he raised the question of due process. There is only one process for Regional Partnerships. He also asked if we advertise. The area consultative committees around Australia, all 50 of them, have budgets. They make provision in their budgets to publicise what they do and how they do it. They get the information out to community organisations, to local government councils, to small business and to anyone who might have an opportunity to make use of Regional Partnerships. It is their job, not the governmentâs, to make known around Australia what is available in that sense and how it is done. At various times we put out certain press releases on the program, but we do not advertise as a government about Regional Partnerships. As a matter of fact, the opposition has probably done a better job of advertising how much good Regional Partnerships does; we have not needed to do it. I can assure the honourable member that all the area consultative committees right around Australia get a budget commensurate with the size of their region and commensurate with the number of employees they need. It is their job to publicise the benefits of the program to people, to organisations, to local government, to state government and to individual businesses. The government do not do that; they do.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The member for Wills also mentioned the SONA program. It is not a secret program. There are no secret instructions given to ACCs, the department or anyone else. In that context, he brought up the national centre for maths, science and information technology at the University of New England and the status of that project. It established a national centre for mathematics, science and information technology for rural and regional education. The project he referred to involves a hub at UNE and training applications around Australia.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Nobody can apply for a Regional Partnerships grant under the SONA procedures. It is a strategic element of Regional Partnerships. It is used to fund projects of high national significance that may fall outside the administrative constraints of Regional Partnerships. The member for Wills seemed to be indicating that something secret goes on. It does not. There is no black-and-white set of guidelines with Regional Partnerships. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> How can you possibly treat a community as isolated as the town of Tibooburra, in the far north-west corner of New South Wales, in the same way as you would treat one in outer metropolitan Sydney or Melbourne?

<para>âThe member for Wills also brought up the issue of the election commitment to the Reginald Murray Williams Australian Bush Centre icon project. Regional Partnerships will provide the mechanism to deliver this election commitment. Obviously it is far more efficient than creating a new program. It is one of the six icon projects around Australia, totalling $27Â½ million, two of which are actually in non-government electorates. I am not quite sure where the member for Wills is going with this one, but all I can tell him is that this is a $4 million icon project that is centred on a great Australian. The member for Wills may wish to put down RM Williams, but the centre aims to have wide appeal and to link well with other tourist venues in the Wide Bay region. It should also attract related agriforestry industry to the region.</para>

<para pgwide="yes">All these projects centre around creating employment and helping a region. Whether they are an icon project, a normal Regional Partnerships program project or a SONA project, they are designed to help regional centres in outer metropolitan areas or wherever they might be. Some projects have been almost in a centre: I have been involved in launching projects which were almost in Brisbane, and the same goes for Sydney. They are not discriminatory programs; they are designed to help people. If there are those who do not want those people helped then that is their business.</para>

<para>âAn additional question that I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services relates to the University of New England maths and science centre that he mentioned a moment ago. Given the role of the area consultative committees in some of the funding arrangements that the government has put in place, the parliamentary secretary may like to report back to the parliament to explain why the New England North West Area Consultative Committeeâs web site in November of 2004 highlighted as its No. 1 project achievement the University of New England maths and science centre whereas, if one looks at that web site today, there is no mention of the University of New England maths and science centre. Could the parliamentary secretary clarify the role, if any, that the area consultative committee had in relation to the funding program and explain why it has airbrushed its web site? During the latter months of 2004, prior to the formation of the Regional Partnerships inquiry, the centre was a project achievement that the area consultative committee was very keen to claim, whereas nowadaysâas I understand it from the situation there a couple of weeks agoâthe No. 1 achievement on its web site has something to do with the CWA hall in Gunnedah.</para>

<para>âI might go back to where I was when I was interrupted. The member for New England brought up what he felt were questions to be answered about the equine centre. Basically, this government had two different proposals, both were about an equine centre and both were to be sited at Tamworth. The original proposal put up in 2001 wanted $3Â½ million towards a proposed $21 million to $24 million project. That was provided to Professor John Chudleigh for an independent reviewâas to whether it was a goer, in effect. Advice to government was that it was not. Further work was done on this proposal, taking into account Professor Chudleighâs findings, and a second proposal was provided to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Minister Anderson, in 2004.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The second proposal had very serious key changes that did address all the concerns raised by Professor Chudleigh. There was a review of the scale of the original proposal and a minor relocation to take into account an existing exhibition facility, saving an estimated $10 million. The original proposal in 2001 and the one announced by the minister were like chalk and cheese. The first was pie in the sky; the second was a serious proposal with management costs and the whole lot done. So, despite what the member for New England may wish to find on this one, he will not find anything. It was subject to total due process and was seen to be a manageable, sustainable project, whereas the original one certainly was not. Therefore, one was knocked back and the other one was approved.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">On the issue of the national centre for maths, science and information at the University of New England, despite what the opposition, the member for New England or anyone else want to believe about the project being approved overnight or in three daysâor 24 hours, as I think the member for Wills tried to sayâthis project was funded for just under $5 million, GST inclusive, under Regional Partnerships in June 2004. It is subject to stringent conditions to ensure its long-term viability. The project is currently on target to meet the contracted milestones, with a full progress report and drafts of the business plans received in January this year. The state based hubs have been contracted, and it is great to note that a hub will be established this year in each state and territory. Minister Andersonâs colleague, the Minister for Education, Science and Training, has also approved additional funding for the centre to undertake research in relation to attracting and retaining teachers in rural and regional schools. I apologise to those members whose questions I am unable to answer. I will endeavour to get them information on those as soon as possible.</para>

<para>âI rise as the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister just to say very briefly that the 2005-06 appropriation has increased by nearly $26 million to $84.515 million in round figures, so we have some $30 million within this appropriation for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference, the APEC conference, in 2007. There were some minor offsets to deal with the Office for the Status of Women being transferred to Family and Community Services; the finalisation of task forces from 2004-05; and some other minor increases. But essentially the increase that you see before you in the consideration of this bill in detail has come from the governmentâs commitment to what we will be working very hard to achieveâthat is, a very successful APEC in 2007.</para>

<para>âI rise if it is appropriateâand please inform me if it is notâto congratulate the Prime Minister and the state premiers on a recent initiative. At a recent Council of Australian Governments meeting, significant priority was given for the first time to the issue of young people with disabilities who are currently âinappropriatelyâ housed. I would like to place on record my congratulations to all of those involvedâto the Prime Minister, who led the delegation, and to the statesâfor recognising those who need a little more help than they have perhaps been getting in the past. I do not mean that that is the fault of anybody, but I think there is growing recognition that people with disabilities are going to grow older than they used to, in the majority of cases, and that in many cases they are inappropriately housed and require other services so that they can be more appropriately cared for.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I would urge the minister in the chair to convey my thanks to the Prime Minister but also to encourage the Prime Minister and those in the appropriate portfolios to really take this issue forward and address it. It is not one that will be terribly expensive to address in terms of the budgetary processes in total, but in my view, and I think in the view of many, it is an issue that really passes judgment on us as a parliament and on Australians as a society, as to how we care for people who have disabilities.</para>

<para>âI assure the member for New England and indeed this chamber that I certainly will make known to the Prime Minister his comments and his encouragement. There is no doubt that the edge of disagreement between the states and the Commonwealth on matters to do with disability causes an enormous amount of hurt and frustration to individual people. We find it awfully frustrating to see the states always retreating from the ground that we try to move onto, leaving further ground for us to have to accommodate certain aspects. Along the way, it is often the case that individual people are the ones who miss out. I have plenty in my electorate, and I have had to say to previous state disabilities ministers, âThese people are your constituents as well as mine.â I remember that then Minister Spence had no idea about the sort of suffering and indignity that certain families were facing because of the Commonwealth-state squabble over these matters. I thank the member for New England for his very timely reminder on this matter.</para>

<para>âI seek some information from the parliamentary secretary about the attitude the Australian government has taken and is proposing to take with regard to the great international debate, led by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the United Kingdom, about the establishment of an international finance facility. There is a proposal that is going before the G8 this week and it is being debated at the IMF and the World Bank and other such fora. This proposal is related to the need to mobilise funds to meet the millennium development goals, which Australia signed on to when they were dealt with at the Millennium Summit in 2000 and about which there has subsequently been a lot of international debate. The general acceptance is that there is a need to mobilise substantially more resources from the international community to meet these goals which, broadly put, are about fighting global poverty.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Some part of the responsibility for this lies in the foreign affairs department and relates to ODA matters, but I am not going there. I want to go to those matters that relate to the Treasurerâs responsibility and to the Treasury portfolio. It is very difficult to find what, if anything, Australia has said about this important debate, although we have been at a large number of meetings where communiques have been issued. I assume that means we have agreed, but we have not heard anything about it back home. It is hard to find in the budget, or in any other set of statements made by the Australian government, where any resources might be to meet in future years the implications of any support Australia might give to this propositionâand I think we should support it.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As I understand it, the proposal for an international finance facility has been considered at, amongst other meetings, the G20, the Commonwealth Finance Ministers Meetingâor perhaps it was the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, but I think it was Commonwealth Finance Ministers Meetingâthe IMF and the World Bank, at all of which the Australian government is represented by the Treasurer. Also, there has been some consideration of it, as I understand it, at the OECD. In any event, I will come back to some OECD comments about this.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I understand that in September 2003 there was an IMF communique from the Dubai annual meeting calling for examination of the merits of the international finance facility. I want to know what Australia said in its ministerial contribution on that occasion. I want to know what view Australia took and what advocacy it made. I am advised that there was a Commonwealth ministerial statement made in March 2004 reiterating support for the proposed new international finance facility designed to double ODA to $100 billion. I want to know what Australia said at that meeting, what attitude it has taken and how that has been reflected in any subsequent policies of the Australian government.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There were subsequent meetings in April and September 2004 for further consideration of this matter. I assume, although I have seen no written report of it, that that was also the case in the April 2005 considerations of the IMF and the World Bank. There is a general proposal about the international finance facility and a proposal for a trial based on an international finance facility for immunisation, bringing forward commitments to meet global objectives with regard to the global initiative for immunisation.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">So I am seeking some information from the Treasurer, through the parliamentary secretary, about what Australia has said with regard to these proposalsâwhether, as is usually the case, the fact that a communique has gone out from these various meetings indicates that Australia agrees with it. If Australia does agree, I would like information about how we are going to meet our obligations. The OECD review of the Australian aid budget makes it clear that Australia is one of the few countriesâone of only two, if I am correctly advised, although the OECD report says, âOne of the fewââat the Monterey summit about international finance for development that did not make any commitment to increased ODA. If we have not made any commitment of that sort, how will we fund the obligations that an international finance facility will impose upon Australia in future years? <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline>
</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In conclusion, if we did not make any commitmentâand I am advised we did notâat Monterey before the international community and we supported the international finance facility, what arrangements do we have in mind to generate the finances to meet the obligation that that will impose upon us? If it turns out that we did not make a commitment to the international finance facility, firstly, I will be very surprised, secondly, I will be very disappointed and, thirdly, I would like to get some indication of why we do not support it and what attitude we have expressed about it at these various international meetings at which we have been represented, often by the Treasurer himself, where resolutions have been made indicating ongoing support for a proposition such as this or similar propositions.</para>

<para>âOver recent months the Treasurer has had a lot to say about the so-called infrastructure crisis in this country and in more recent weeks there has been an indication from the government that the Commonwealth might move towards a greater responsibility for the nationâs infrastructure, in particular as it relates to our export performance. On a number of occasions, the Treasurer has referred to the difficulties being experienced at Dalrymple Bay, the coal loading port in Queensland. In particular, he has suggested that the Commonwealth might take control of the regulation of that facility. In broader terms, he has suggested that the Commonwealth might take control of export facilities generally.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I would assume that that would involve some review of clause 6 of the original Competition Principles Agreement between the Commonwealth and the states. To take that further, I would assume that the government is contemplating revisiting the Competition Principles Agreement and suggesting that clause 6 may no longer provide an opportunity for the state governments to have their particular state based regimes certified under part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act; rather, the Commonwealth might seek to insist that all these industry based schemes come under the Commonwealth umbrella. This would have ramifications for Commonwealth allocation of funds, I would assume, because I would expect that the Commonwealth, if it were contemplating a renegotiation of clause 6, in particular, of the Competition Principles Agreement, would be thinking about compensating the states, as it did under the original agreement. So, if the Commonwealth has such a move in mind, I wonder whether there might be some allocation hidden away in the budget somewhere for those purposes. I invite the parliamentary secretary to respond, if he can.</para>

<para>âI have to put on record, as previous speakers have tonight, my disappointment that the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer is not present. The issue I want to raise relates to the human services portfolioâmore particularly, to the Belmont Medicare office. I have made numerous representations in this parliament and to ministers over a long period of time about the need for the Belmont Medicare office to be reopened. In the lead-up to the last election, we on this side of the parliament promised to reopen the Medicare office, and that was based on a very sound principle. The office was closed in 1996, which was a very unfortunate action by the government. It was closed and offices that had a much lighter workload were left open. That office had a very high utilisation rate but it was closed and a Medibank Private office was opened at Charlestown, an adjoining suburb.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I think that the decision was made because the minister of the time did not really understand the area. It is a very old area. Shortland electorate is the 10th oldest electorate in Australia. Belmont, whilst only some 10 kilometres from Charlestown, was a central point for this elderly population. People who lived in the Swansea part of Shortland electorate, even when they were on restricted licences, could drive to Belmont. The public transport to Belmont was a lot easier. Accessing the Medicare office was a lot easier than having to travel to Charlestown or, alternatively, hopping in their car and driving to Lake Haven on the Central Coast. It had a very wide drawing area. The previous member for Shortland has also been involved in the campaign to have the office reopened and between the two of us we have submitted to the parliament over 20,000 signatures from people asking to have this office reopened.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There is a demonstrated need for the Belmont Medicare office. One factor in this is the age of the population and another is the fact that very few doctors in the area bulk-bill. Elderly people go and see their doctors and then have to somehow travel quite a distance to claim their Medicare benefits. It is not a wealthy area, and the people need to get their money back, sometimes even to buy their medications. I implore the government to revisit the issue of Belmont Medicare office, because it has been identified by the staff that worked in the office and by the people of the area as one of the single most important issues in the area.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Whilst I am on the subject of Medicare offices, there has also been an identified need for a Medicare office at Toukley. I believe some time agoâand it was not an act of this governmentâthere was a Medicare office at Toukley that was moved to the shopping centre at Lake Haven. Since then the population has aged considerably, and there is a real problem with transport. The area is only serviced by a private bus company. It is something like six or eight kilometres to this Medicare office, but if you catch a bus it takes you an hour and a half to two hours to get there. Once again, there is a low level of doctors that bulk-billâpossibly the level is even lower in that area. I have also submitted petitions to the parliament on that issue, with some thousands of signatures on them.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I ask that the government seriously look at both those offices, particularly Belmont, because of the enormous community support and the enormous community demand for that office to be made operational again. If you go back and look at the records from before its closure, you will find that it was better than, I believe, Erina and a couple of other offices in that area.</para>

<para>âI will respond to the member for Shortlandâs concern now before I sum up after the next speaker. In the first instance let me say that the minister for the portfolio area, the Minister for Finance and Administration, is, of course, a senator, so he does not appear in Main Committee.

<para>âThe reopening of the Belmont Medicare office, let me assure you that the HIC does assess demand for all these types of offices on an ongoing basis. They are opened if there is sufficient counter trade and if it is obviously a considerable distance to another office. So the demographics of the area and its geographic locality are under consideration.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para pgwide="yes">At the moment, Belmont does not meet the criteria for opening a new Medicare office but I can assure the member for Shortland that, if the demographics change or some other significant circumstances change, this will be noted. I am sure you will bring to the attention of the minister any of those changes so they can be taken into the assessment process. Likewise, I am assured by the officials who are here tonight that, at the moment, customer traffic would not support an office at Toukley. Offices are generally not located less than 12 kilometres from another, but I again invite the member for Shortland to keep the minister closely informed of her particular concerns. The aim of this government is to make sure the population is properly serviced, and that is why our business cases are developed in the way they are: to make sure the population is properly served.</para>

<para>âI note the comments of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration. I was referring to the Minister for Human Services, who I believe is a member of the House of Representatives. I am quite aware that the overarching minister is a senator and of course I would not expect him to be present in the Main Committee tonight.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I accept the comments that the parliamentary secretary has made about Toukley, the distance and the possibility that there would be a great deal of difficulty in sustaining that office, but I cannot accept her comments about the Belmont office and I question the advice that she has received. If you made a comparison of the trade in other offices in the area with the trade that was conducted across the counter at Belmont, you would find that not only did it compare favourably but its performance was at a higher level than offices that were left open. I also inform the parliamentary secretary of a staff survey conducted at the Charlestown Medicare office one, two or three years agoâI cannot quite remember when. I was reliably advised that staff identified the single most important issue for that office was the reopening of the Belmont Medicare office. So it was a need identified not only by the community but also by the staff.</para>

<para>âI would like to raise with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration my interest in the proposals by the Department of Finance and Administration to computerise the submission of pay claims by electorate staff. I commend that. I preface my question by saying that I have been particularly frustrated with the process of reimbursing relief staff in particular. As many of us would know, the operations of our offices are very important in the servicing of our local communities. When relief staff are called in because someone is sick, for instance, they incur costs in child care, travel and so forth. Unfortunately it is not uncommon for it to take four to six weeks for them to get paid for providing that work. That is entirely unacceptable. It has been explained to me that that is the result of the process by which new contracts have to be submittedâthey are several pages long, and the member has to sign them to verify them.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">On my reckoning, posting from Wollongong to getting to the actual processing at DOFA is regularly one week, which is problematic in itself. If the department is looking to move to an electronic lodgment, there are ways of doing it securely these days. In the interests of the very good people that we all utilise in our communities to do relief work for us, it is incumbent on us to pay them the money they earn from that work as soon as possible. I would like to know whether there is a commitment to finance the move to an electronic system. I would also like an assurance that it will extend beyond permanent and permanent part-time staff and will cover people who come in on short-term relief.</para>

<para>âI begin by thanking the member for Cunningham for her question on electronic payroll systems and, in particular, on relief electorate staff. I share with her a concern that electorate staff are paid quickly. With her, I think it is an excellent idea that the Department of Finance and Administration is now exploring a computerised or electronic system. I am not personally aware of all of the details of when and how it is to be rolled out, but I can give her the details if she wishes to have them.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I turn now to the consideration in detail of the Department of Finance and Administrationâs component of the budget. In 2005-06, the Department of Finance and Administration will be appropriated $423.5 million from <inline ref="R2335">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2005-2006</inline> and $249.4 million from <inline ref="R2336">Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2005-2006</inline>. I would like to talk about some of the new measures that were announced in the budget.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">One new measure of enormous significance is the Future Fund Management Agency. In-principle agreement has been provided to establish such an agency for the purpose of accumulating financial assets to offset the Australian governmentâs unfunded superannuation liability. The fund will be managed by an independent board, which will make investments in accordance with a broad investment mandate issued by the government. The government will provide $31.2 million to Finance over four yearsâ$7.3 million in 2005-06âto establish and administer what I will call the Future Fund Management Agency, the FFMA. This agency will provide executive support and advice to the Future Fund Management Board. The cost of contracting out investment activities to fund managers and the remuneration of board members will be met from the Future Fund. The government will provide $16,137,000,000 to the FFMA for investment in 2005-06. Investment earnings are anticipated to be in the order of $538.6 million.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There is also the enhanced budget information system. We believe a capital saving of $4 million in 2004-05 and reduced depreciation savings of $0.8 million per year from 2005-06 will be achieved as a result of successful negotiations with the preferred supplier for the provision of system development, implementation and support services for the enhanced budget information system. Depreciation savings do not have an impact on fiscal balance.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We are also helping to provide for Australiaâs security through funding the Australian Security Intelligence Organisationâs central office building. Without appropriate infrastructure, we cannot expect our agencies like ASIO to be world best. The government will provide $63.2 million over four yearsâ$3.6 million in 2005-06âto Finance for project management and construction of an extension to the ASIO central office building to accommodate the expanded and co-located ASIO and Office of National Assessments.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The government will also provide $25.1 million to Finance over three yearsâ$4 million in 2005-06âto refurbish the historic Royal Australian Mint buildings. The buildings have not had a major upgrade work done since their construction. The refurbishment will address occupational health and safety requirements, improve the buildingâs energy efficiency and enable the Mint to meet its functional requirements more effectively. Additional rent revenue of $0.9 million will have a positive impact on the budget in 2008-09.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">A centralised claims record management unit will be established within the Employment and Workplace Relations portfolio from 1 July 2005 to manage all asbestos related disease claims against the Commonwealth, with the exception of those claims against the Department of Defence or those made by former Australian Defence Force members and their dependants under the Military Compensation and Rehabilitation Scheme and the Veteransâ Entitlements Act. Consequently, from 1 July 2005, the Australian governmentâs estimated potential liability for ARDâwhich stands for asbestos related diseaseâclaims will be recorded in the DEWR administered accounts. Accordingly, Finance will return a total of $3.9 million to the budget in 2004-05 and transfer liabilities currently valued at $158.3 million to the EWR portfolio on 1 July 2005. Financeâs budget and forward estimates have been reduced by a total of $1.6 million to reflect the associated decrease in expense. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline>
</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In 2005-06 the government will provide an additional $1 million in funding to enable the continuation of the program of asset sales activities and in 2005-06 the government will provide additional funding of $2.2 million to conduct a scoping study into the sale of the Australian Submarine Corporation Pty Ltd. The scoping study will assess the likely sale environment and seek to ascertain the optimal timing and method of sale.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Australian Government Information Management Office is now incorporated into the Department of Finance and Administration. Ongoing efficiency savings of $1.2 million per year from 2005-06 will be achieved as a result of the incorporation of the Australian Government Information Management Office into Finance.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In relation to the efficiency dividend, the increase in the rate from one per cent to 1.25 per cent, a 0.25 per cent additional efficiency dividend, has been applied to agency estimates from 2005-06 to 2007-08.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The 2005-06 administered expenses have increased by $9.8 million from the 2004-05 additional expenditures to $218.1 million, mainly due to additional funding for the administering of the electorate offices of all parliamentariansâ, and ministersâ offices. The funding for this increase was provided for in prior year measures.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In relation to a new part of the Finance and Administration portfolio, the Department of Human Services, this comprises the core department of the Child Support Agency, the CSA, and the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service, CRS Australia. In addition, Centrelink, the Health Insurance Commission, Health Services Australia and Australian Hearing report to the Minister for Human Services through the secretary.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Department of Human Services was established in October 2004 by the Australian government to improve the development and delivery of government services to all Australian people. The core department and the CSA receive appropriation funding while CRS is fully funded via purchase-provider arrangements with government and non-government entities. The department will receive $466.004 million in revenue in 2005-06.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This comprises appropriation funding of $298.277 million, the core department being appropriated $11.883 million and the CSA $286.394 million. CRS will receive revenue from the sale of goods and services of $167.727 million. The departmentâs administering funding is comprised of annual appropriations, special appropriations and revenues from other sources. We are very pleased about the development of the new Department of Human Services being able to better service the needs of all Australians. The appropriations that have been made to this department reflect its significance and importance for the Australian people.</para>
