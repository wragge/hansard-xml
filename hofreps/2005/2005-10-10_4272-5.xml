<para>âI make this explanation on behalf of myself, on behalf of many of my parliamentary colleagues, on behalf of the ALP and on behalf of a number of people not in this parliament. All of these, including me, have been grievously misrepresented by Mr Mark Latham, both in his published diaries and in various interviews. Many people have been dreadfully hurt and offended by the many sad, harmful and untruthful statements Mr Latham has made. My parliamentary colleagues, like those on the other side, are decent, hardworking Australians who have dedicated their lives to fighting to make Australia a better place. My party, through all its members, has for over 100 years been devoted to the singular pursuit of working to improve the lives of working men and women and their families and, indeed, of all Australians. We do not deserve to be falsely condemned by Mr Latham. We deserve better. All people dedicated to public service deserve better. The Australian public deserves better.</para>

<para>âWithout delaying the House, I indicate that I strongly support the action of the Chair of the Selection Committee. I commend him for the flexibility he has shown in this situation and it is, I might say, not for the first time in his capacity as Chair of the Selection Committee. I also acknowledge Peter Mason. It would be fair to point out that the motion relating to the order of presentation of committee reports and private membersâ business has become necessary because the government cancelled one week of sitting. In terms of the records available to the Houseâwe can only go back as far as the electronic recordsâthere is no precedent for a cancellation of a weekâs sitting. This has been one of the unintended consequences of that. Again, I place on record my thanks to the Chair of the Selection Committee for the action he has taken. The motion is supported by me and by the opposition.</para>

<para>âThe publication of the report into the conduct of the 2004 federal election comes one year and one day after the election. Over the course of the year since polling day, the committee has held public hearings in rural and regional areas of both Queensland and New South Wales and throughout metropolitan Australia. This report confirms that Australia has a very good electoral system, but one which can, and should, be improved further. The 56 recommendations in this report outline issues that the committee believes should be dealt with immediately as well as longer term reform issues for consideration.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>There are a number of issues that require immediate attention. The committee examined problems with postal voting at the election, problems which should not have occurred. The committee makes a series of recommendations to ensure those problems are not repeated in future elections. Present requirements for electoral enrolment result in an unacceptable level of inaccuracy in our electoral roll. The committee recommends the adoption of two significant enrolment reforms designed to improve integrity and to prevent electoral fraud occurring. The first reform is the requirement for proof of identification and address to be provided at the time of enrolment. This move is consistent with existing contemporary identification practices, already widely accepted and adopted by the community for everyday activities such as joining a video library or obtaining a pre-paid mobile telephone.</para>
<para>The second reform is closing the electoral roll at 8 pm on the day that the writs are issued for an election. The committee received compelling evidence indicating that the current seven-day close of roll period actually encourages electors not to enrol at the time when their enrolment entitlements change. On the one hand, we have laws which compel electors to enrol at the time that they gain or change their enrolment entitlement but, on the other hand, we have laws which allow for a seven-day period that provides an escape for those who do not follow the first law. This is clearly contradictory. It promotes the view that enrolment is neither necessary nor important. This ongoing situation creates an unrealistic volume of enrolment in the close of roll period and makes the roll more vulnerable to electoral fraud and manipulation.</para>
<para>The committee recommends that the government make these changes as soon as possible. This will allow time for the government and the Australian Electoral Commission to communicate the changes and give them wide publicity, and therefore ensure that electors are aware and able to update their enrolment well in advance of the next election.</para>
<para>The committee is also concerned about the current processes regarding provisional voting. Under existing arrangements, electors may apply for and cast provisional votes on election day without any identification or proof of address. The committee therefore recommends that all electors who cast provisional votes must provide proof of identification and address before these votes are accepted into the count. The committee is not recommending that all electors provide proof of identity at polling places at the time of voting, although it believes that those electors who wish to do so should be able to. This may assist in the finding of names on the electoral roll and thus speed up the voting process.</para>
<para>The committee also received convincing evidence that necessitated recommendations to overhaul party registration. These are aimed at preventing political parties from deliberately and deceptively misleading voters into unintentionally voting for them on the basis of their having a similar or like name to an existing party. In this regard the actions of the liberals for forests during the last election campaign and, in particular, their actions on election day have galvanised the committee to urge parliament to act decisively. The committee is most concerned to ensure that voters are not misled in the same way in the future.</para>
<para>The community has a right to expect a reasonable degree of transparency and accountability in the way that political parties are structured and managed, both administratively and financially. The committee has made a number of recommendations aimed at ensuring this transparency. Australiaâs public funding and disclosure laws were found to work well. However, the thresholds over which donations must be disclosed and tax deductibility ceased are considered far too low. Both have not altered in more than a decade. Both require an overhaul to reflect contemporary standards and community expectations. Increases would see the donation threshold moved in line with that existing in New Zealand and the United Kingdom.</para>
<para>Over 88 per cent of the total value of disclosed donations received by the major political parties in the last financial year were in amounts in excess of $10,000. Lifting the threshold over which donations must be disclosed to $10,000 would still see those $10,000 donations disclosed. Accordingly, the committee recommends lifting the amount over which donations must be disclosed to $10,000 and lifting the amount at which tax deductibility ceases to $2,000. In addition, the committee specifically recommends that the new tax deductibility threshold be inflation indexed each year, to maintain its value on an annual basis. The committee also recommends that the new $10,000 donation threshold be indexed to the consumer price index but in this case specifically leaves open how often the future adjustments in increments should occur.</para>
<para>The committee also canvassed a number of longer term reform issues which have been the subject of longstanding public debate. The issue of four-year terms for the House of Representatives has received a great deal of attention by the committee. Previous reports of the committee in 1996, 1998 and 2001 advocated four-year terms for the House of Representatives. This report deals comprehensively with the history, issues and options for reform, and recommends that a referendum be held at the next election to alter the Constitution to extend the parliamentary term for the House of Representatives to four years, with a view to implementing new parliamentary terms following the federal election due in 2010. The parliament elected at the next election would therefore continue under the current system.</para>
<para>In the context of this debate, the committee also highlights the need for consideration to be given to the application of consequential changes to the length of Senate terms. The committee believes that for any change to federal parliamentary terms to be implemented there must be cooperation and a broad willingness to change from the major political parties. The committee considers it is unreasonable for the government to proceed with reforming parliamentary terms without clear support from the opposition.</para>
<para>The committee also revisited the longstanding debate about voluntary and compulsory voting, covering arguments both for and against a possible change. The committee recommends that compulsory voting be retained for the next election. However, it believes it worth while to encourage and foster further public debate and for this issue to be examined through a future inquiry of the committee.</para>
<para>The committee also examined voting systems, particularly for the Senate; the use of technology in the electoral process; and the need for education to be recognised as a key to a healthier democracy. The committee believes that technological advances should now enable the vision impaired and blind to cast a secret and independently verifiable vote through electronic voting. The committee recommends that the AEC undertake a trial of electronic voting at one location in each electorate at the next federal election. This should ideally be a central and accessible location and not necessarily an AEC office or a pre-poll centre. This measure would, for the first time, allow those voters who currently require assistance when casting their vote to exercise their franchise independently whilst ensuring that their vote remained secret. The committee does not view this measure as the precursor to a general move to electronic voting. It will, however, provide the opportunity to gradually integrate suitable technologies into an already stable electoral system, while making that system responsive to the needs of the blind and visually impaired.</para>
<para>The work of the committee on this report would not have been possible without the dedication, effort and professional conduct of the secretariat staff. I thank Dr Stephen Dyer, Mr Andrew McGowan and Mr Terry Rushton, who travelled to the public hearings, and all of the other staff who worked on the report over the course of the year. I also express my thanks to the Electoral Commissioner, Mr Ian Campbell, and the staff of the Australian Electoral Commission, who met the committeeâs requests for information in a professional and timely manner. Finally, I would like to thank the members and senators on the committee for their work and contribution to the reportâin particular, the Deputy Chair and member for Melbourne Ports and Senator Andrew Murray, both of whom attended hearings and actively shared their experience and wisdom through all aspects of the committeeâs activities, examinations and considerations.</para>
<para>The committee received 221 submissions from members of the public and organisations, and heard from 84 witnesses at 11 public hearings, gathering 798 pages of evidence. The evidence and submissions have provided valuable contributions to the committeeâs consideration of the last election and Australiaâs electoral system now and for the future. The committee has completed its investigations and consideration so that the government has sufficient time to make the necessary changes to electoral legislation and, importantly, to communicate those changes to the community in a timely manner before the next federal election.</para>

<para>âToday is an important day for Australian democracy because it is the day when the government has finally put its cards on the table about its plans to make radical changes to Australiaâs electoral laws. After weeks of speculation and hints, and what I regard as an elaborate smokescreen about voluntary voting, we finally know what the government is planning. From that point of view it is a sad day for Australian democracy because some of the changes that government members have put forward in this report are retrograde. For 150 years Australia has been an innovator, indeed a world leader, in progressive reform and democratic processes. From the introduction of secret ballots in Victoria in 1856, the vote for women in 1894 in South Australia and in 1902 federally, preferential voting in 1918, compulsory voting in 1924 and proportional representation in the Senate in 1949 to votes for 18-year-olds in 1973, Australia has always been to the fore.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Governments of all parties share the credit for these reforms, which in Australia have usually enjoyed bipartisan support. As a result Australia has one of the most open electoral systems in the world, which has the highest reputation for integrity and transparency. Now, for the first time in memory, an Australian government is going to wind back some of these features of our electoral system, for no good reason other than what appears to me and to the opposition to be short-term partisan advantage. It is going to make it more difficult for Australians to enrol to vote. It is going to make changes to Senate voting which it knows will increase the rate of informality. As a result, Senator Abetz, the minister responsible, may, if these recommendations are put into practice, have the unenviable title of being the first Australian minister to preside over an election at which more than a million people will vote informal for the Senate. The government is going to do these things on the basis of preventing electoral fraud when the inquiry that we have just concluded found no evidence whatever that electoral fraud is a problem in Australia.</para>
<para>The opposition acknowledge that there are many useful recommendations in this report. We welcome the proposals to fix the postal voting system, which failed badly in 2004, to improve assistance to visually impaired voters and to tighten the law on party registration. The benefits of these recommendations are, however, outweighed by the damage to our democracy that will be done if the recommendations in other areas of this report are put into effect. The most radical changes the government is planning are: to close the electoral rolls at 8 pm on the day the writs for an election are issued rather than after five working days, as has been the law since 1984; to require all applicants for enrolment, re-enrolment or change of enrolment to verify their identity with photographic or documentary identification; to require those wishing to cast a provisional vote to produce photographic identification; to introduce compulsory preferential above-the-line voting for Senate elections; and to reduce the level of transparency of donations to political parties by raising the disclosure threshold to $10,000.</para>
<para>The first of these measures would have the effect of disenfranchising anyone who has not enrolled by the time the writs are issued and potentially disenfranchising voters who are not enrolled at their correct address. The second and third recommendations would make it more difficult for many people to enrol, to change their enrolments or to cast a provisional vote. Those particularly affected would be people whose first language is not English, seniors, Aboriginal Australians and first-time voters. Perhaps the government calculates that these people are more likely to be Labor voters.</para>
<para>At the 2004 election, 284,000 people enrolled or changed their enrolment in the five working days between the issue of the writs and the closure of the roll. This total included nearly 80,000 Australians enrolling for the first timeâyoung people. At the same election 180,000 people cast provisional votes. Over the three-year election cycle, over two million Australians enrol, re-enrol or change their enrolment. All of these people will be disadvantaged by the changes proposed in the majority report, and a certain proportion of them will be disenfranchised. Maybe it will be only a small proportion, but in very close seats and Senate races that small proportion may be decisive.</para>
<para>The pretext for these proposals is that enrolments during the five working days increase electoral fraud because the AEC does not have time to verify the information given by enrolees. No evidence in support of this contention was presented to the inquiry; in fact no evidence of fraud of any kind in federal elections was produced. The report itself concedes in chapter 5, paragraph 142, that âto date the committee has no evidence to indicate there has been widespread electoral fraudâ. Similarly, there was an AEC backgrounder that said there had been no electoral fraud at previous elections in the last two decades. Since many of the reportâs recommendations are predicated on this assumption of electoral fraud, it is striking that government members were unable to come up with some evidence to support it.</para>
<para>Of course, everyone should enrol as soon as they are eligible and everyone should keep their enrolment up to date. But it will not come as a shock to some members, although it may to others, that many Australians do not spend every waking hour thinking about politics and that they only start paying attention when an election is announced. We might wish they were more engaged with the political process, but I do not think they should be disenfranchised because they think of things other than politics.</para>
<para>The main positive recommendation in this report is the recommendation for four-year terms for the House of Representatives, but we note that government members have not been able to make a firm recommendation about the consequences of that for Senate terms. This is a matter that will have to be negotiated within and between political parties and in the community. There will not be four-year terms unless there is a proposal that has bipartisan support at a referendum. In recent statements by the Leader of the Opposition, the opposition have shown that we are willing to be flexible on this issue. I hope we will see similar flexibility on the government side.</para>
<para>I would like to thank the chair of the committee, the member for Casey, for his leadership of this inquiry, which, as he pointed out, travelled all round Australia, considered a vast amount of evidence and had many witnesses. We had many engaging public hearings. He ensured that, for the most part, it was conducted in a cooperative and harmonious way. I did enjoy the member for Indi asking one of our witnesses in Melbourne whether he was now or had ever been a member of a political party. I thought that had a lot of historical resonance and was quite amusing. I also thank other members of the committee on the government side and Senator Murray, from the Democrats, for their contributions. From my own side, I particularly thank the member for Bruce, who is now the shadow special minister of state, who joined the committee as the inquiry was concluding, as well as Senators Carr and Forshaw for their contributions. The member for Banks was a member of the committee during the earlier part of the inquiry, and I thank him also.</para>
<para>I thank all the members of the committee secretariat, led by Dr Dyer, for their dedication and work for the committee. I would particularly like to thank Caroline Morris, who helped the opposition minority with our final report at the conclusion. I also thank the officers of the Australian Electoral Commission. They come in for some criticism in this report, but I think we all acknowledge their dedication across Australia. A lot of us know them quite well through the divisional returning officers.</para>
<para>To conclude, the essence of making democracy work is maximising participation. For 150 years Australian parliaments have worked to expand the franchise, removing barriers of class, race, gender and age. Some of the proposals this government is making will make the franchise more restrictive. This is particularly foolish at a time when we are concerned about growing disengagement, apathy and cynicism about politics, particularly among younger people. What kind of signal will be sent with this recommendation to close the rolls and disenfranchise people who use the five days before the closure of the roll? What kind of message will it send to those 80,000 young people? I believe it will send a signal that this government does not care whether they are able to vote, and it will be very harmful to our democracy. That is the regrettable conclusion I think some of the voters will come to as a result of these recommendations, if they are indeed put into effect by this government.</para>

<para>âI present the Procedure Committeeâs final report on media coverage of House proceedings, which was released out of session on 6 October. The report covers access by the parliamentary press gallery to proceedings in the House, the Main Committee and committees of the House. It addresses both television images and still photography and makes six recommendations. The inquiry was commenced in the previous parliament and an interim report was presented in August 2004. The committee decided to continue its predecessorâs work in this current parliament, to seek feedback on the interim report and to submit a final report.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The committee in this parliament has benefited from discussion with you, Mr Speaker, and with the newly elected Press Gallery Committee. A further discussion with the broadcasting section of the Department of Parliamentary Services was also undertaken. After reviewing the interim report, the committee has not found it necessary to make many substantive changes to the interim report. However, it has expanded the section on television coverage and has made an additional recommendation in response to press gallery views in that area.</para>
<para>The current Procedure Committee agrees with its predecessor that the central issue of media coverage of House proceedings is getting the balance right between protecting the interests of the House on the one hand and providing images that will capture the interests of viewers on the other. As stated in the report, a dignified House does not necessarily provide riveting viewing but dull images will not inform the public because they will be ignored. The committee is very keen for the public to be informed of House proceedings. All committee members are supportive of encouraging the public to take an interest in viewing the parliament at work and enhancing public knowledge of parliamentary proceedings. Notwithstanding these goals, it is also important that the dignity of the House be maintained. It was, as I have said, a balancing act.</para>
<para>The committee has recommended that the House resolutions of 16 October 1991 and 1 May 1996 relating to televising and broadcasting of proceedings respectively be replaced by an updated resolution which reflects current arrangements. In particular, the new resolution should acknowledge the fact that the Speaker acts on behalf of the House in administering and implementing all guidelines relating to media access to proceedings, including television broadcasting.</para>
<para>In relation to still photography, the committee has recommended a widening of the opportunities for photographers from the press gallery to have automatic permission to take photographs of House proceedings. In the interim report, automatic permission was recommended to be extended to include discussions of matters of public importance, divisions and adjournment debates. This report has added ministerial statements to that list. The recommendation is for the new arrangements to operate for a trial period of 10 sitting weeks. I should point out that the committee supports limits on the number of press gallery photographers permitted to take photographs of proceedings and does not propose any changes in this area.</para>
<para>Turning to television coverage, the committee gave further consideration to the Press Gallery Committeeâs preferred option for the media to use two pool television cameras to take their own footage of proceedings. Whilst the committee does not recommend this option at this stage, it has, I believe, been responsive to press gallery views. The committee has made an additional recommendation that the Press Gallery Committee consult with the broadcasting section of DPS in relation to improving the content of the existing feed for television excerpt purposes and to explore the possibility of additional feeds focusing on the speakers at the dispatch boxes. The committee has proposed that it evaluate any such new arrangements after a trial period of six sitting weeks.</para>
<para>In reporting on the issue of regulation of media coverage of proceedings, the committee has seen its role as one of advising the Speaker. I thank my fellow committee members and all who have contributed to the committeeâs deliberations. The committee welcomed the opportunity to meet with members of the press gallery, the media managers and others who helped us to understand the issues. To my fellow committee members and in particular the Deputy Chair of the Procedure Committee, the member for Banks, who is in the chamber today, my thanks for the spirited and cooperative way in which we undertook the inquiry. To members of the secretariatâJudy Middlebrook, Peter Fowler, Penny Branson and, joining us recently, Robyn McClelland, who is here in the chamber today, and Leanne LongâI thank you all for your input, your advice and your wisdom. I commend the report to you, Mr Speaker, and to the House.</para>

<para>âThe Chair of the Standing Committee on Procedure, the member for McPherson, has outlined some of the main recommendations of the report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Media coverage of House proceedings: including the chamber, Main Committee and committees</inline>. I will address the background to the committeeâs inquiry and recommendations relating to still photography and television broadcasting. As the chair has said, the inquiry commenced in the previous parliament and an interim report was presented towards the end of the parliament. The inquiry was, in part, a response to issues that arose in the previous parliament when photographs of a protester in the House were published. The photographs breached the guidelines for still photography in the House and penalties were imposed by the then Speaker, the Hon. Neil Andrew. On 16 February 2004, Speaker Andrew made a statement to the House explaining his decision. In response, the Manager of Opposition Business, Ms Gillard, asked whether the guidelines covering still photography could be reviewed to assess whether they have the balance right between not giving undue publicity to interruptions to the proceedings of the parliament and giving appropriate access for newspaper photographers to these proceedings so that they can be properly reported. Ms Gillard suggested the Procedure Committee consider the issue.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Procedure Committee decided to inquire into the issue of media access to parliamentary proceedings as part of a wider inquiry into enhancing public knowledge about the business of the chamber, the Main Committee and parliamentary committees. The committee has had an interest in this wider issue since it commenced its inquiry into community involvement in the procedures and practices of the House in 1998. It is important in terms of public participation and trust in the institution of the parliament that the House communicate its activity to the world outside the parliament, and the media is an essential partner in that process. In the event, however, the committee has focused its inquiry and report on the issue of media access.</para>
<para>In relation to still photography, the committee has not proposed any changes to the arrangements and conditions applying, except for recommending an extension of the opportunities for authorised photographers to have automatic permission to take photographs as the chair has outlined. The committee recognises that getting the balance of access right in the guidelines is difficult. It has found that the arrangements for still photography are already more liberal than those applying in comparable parliaments internationally.</para>
<para>In relation to television coverage, some members of the committee found persuasive the arguments put by the press gallery for the media to be able to take its own footage of proceedings, rather than relying on footage received from the parliamentary photographers. However, the committee has not so recommended at this stage. Instead, it has recommended that arrangements to improve the content of the feed for television excerpt purposes be pursued and that the committee evaluate the success of these arrangements after a trial period of six sitting weeks.</para>
<para>The committee heard evidence from Sky News and applauds its coverage of chamber proceedings and some committees. The committee supports increased television coverage of the Main Committee and parliamentary committees. It recommends that the Department of Parliamentary Services install television cameras in more committee rooms in Parliament House to facilitate more extended coverage of committees. We thank the Deputy Speaker and the Second Deputy Speaker for meeting with the committee. As the chair has stated, in reporting on the issue of regulation of media coverage of proceedings, the committee has seen its role as one of advising the Speaker. Thank you also to the members of the press gallery, the media managers and others who supported the committeeâs inquiry. I commend the report to the House.</para>

<para>âI rise to present the review by the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade into the Defence annual report 2003-04. During the period July 2003 to June 2004, Defence has been subject to a range of external and internal challenges. The <inline font-style="italic">Defence update 2003</inline> highlighted the changed strategic environment in which the Australian Defence Force, ADF, operates. In particular, the rise of global terrorism and the threat of non-state actors are causing Defence to reassess its capabilities. The new Defence Capability Plan provides detailed information on the capabilities that Defence will acquire during the next 10 years.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Defence has embarked on an ambitious program of reform to its procurement arising from the Kinnaird report. These reforms culminated when the Defence Materiel Organisation, the DMO, became a separate prescribed authority on 1 July 2005, headed by Dr Stephen Gumley. In addition, a Capability Development Group, headed by Lieutenant General David Hurley, has been formed within Defence for the purpose of better defining capability requirements and advising the DMO of specific capability needs. This procurement reform is the first of four topics explored by the committee as part of the review of the Defence annual report 2003-04. The committee found mixed progress on major procurement projects but overall noted significant improvement to the process by which capability requirements are identified and briefed to government.</para>
<para>The committee next reviewed decisions relating to the selection of Australiaâs future amphibious capability. This critical capability will serve Australia to the middle of this century and is regarded by Defence as a capability of first resort for contingencies from disaster relief to mid-intensity war fighting. The current Defence Capability Plan states that two large amphibious ships will be purchased to replace Australiaâs current amphibious capability. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute, ASPI, has argued that it may be more effective to purchase four smaller amphibious vessels rather than two large ships. The committee notes ASPIâs arguments that a larger number of smaller ships may be more effective in some circumstances but accepts the comprehensive nature of the Navy and Defence analysis, which shows the acquisition of two larger ships to be more efficient in both operational capability and cost-effectiveness over the life of the project. In addition, Defenceâs decision to procure two large ships was based on their capacity to embark an Army combined arms battle group and deliver this force ashore more rapidly and effectively than would be possible from smaller platforms.</para>
<para>The management of Defenceâs budget continues to be problematical. In part, difficulties stem from the transition to accrual accounting standards, but other procedural and cultural difficulties remain. The Department of Defence is a complex organisation, designed in the first instance to support operational activities such as the deployment of the Al Muthanna Task Group to southern Iraq. However, like other government agencies, Defence must comply with Australian accounting standards and demonstrate transparency and accountability to the parliament. Defenceâs budget remains qualified and, while a significant amount of work is being done to rectify these concerns, much room for improvement remains.</para>
<para>Defenceâs qualified financial statement and the steps the department is taking to remedy this situation are the third topic examined by the committee report. In its review, the committee notes that the Defence leadership have been particularly frank about the nature and extent of the problems they face and that significant progress has been made on reforms. The committee makes some recommendations in this section intended to assist Defence in prioritising resources while seeking to meet the requirements of the Financial Management Act. These recommendations are based on the need to stratify the data held by Defence to ensure money is not wasted in seeking old audit data that has not been retained.</para>
<para>The final topic examined by the committee was a review of Defenceâs capability in humanitarian relief operations. The most recent example of the ADF capacity for relief operations came during the exemplary response to the tsunami on Boxing Day 2004. During the hearing, Defence detailed the extent of its humanitarian relief capabilities and their relationship to Defenceâs key war-fighting objectives.</para>
<para>Finally, the committee offers its sympathy to the families and friends of the crew of Sea King Helicopter <inline font-style="italic">Shark 02</inline> for the tragic loss of their loved ones in Aceh. The loss of this fine group of service men and women during this period of committee consideration highlights the dangers faced by all ADF personnel and confirms the need to ensure the ADF receives the best equipment and support our nation can afford. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI join the member for Maranoa, the Chair of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, in welcoming the tabling of this report into the review of the Defence annual report 2003-04. In doing so, I indicate just how proud I am to be assisting that committee, along with the member for Cowan and other Labor members, and to have the great honour of being the deputy chair of the committee. For me it is an opportunity to see Defence close at hand. In questioning the former Chief of the Australia Defence Force, General Cosgrove, other members of the defence forces and the auxiliary staff who assist them about their activities over 2003-04, what was fundamentally apparent was their dedication to Australiaâs protection and safety. Also apparent was the great dedication to doing what was required of Defence in the most correct way possible and also to delivering outcomes which were cost effective for the Commonwealth but were directed towards the safety and defence of the Commonwealth in as significant a way as possible.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The member for Cowan, other members of the committee and I understand that one of the key things we were looking at, as mentioned by the member for Maranoa, was the imposition of a different set of accounting methods on the Department of Defenceâour biggest industry but in fact a government department, not a private consortium or industry. What was absolutely apparent was that there is a clash not just of cultures but in the way you go about accrual accounting and cash accounting. We found and have recommended that the government should take very close note of the fact that enormous hours and a great deal of effort are being expanded to no proper end in trying to satisfy all of the demands for accrual accounting of munitions from the 1980s and 1990s.</para>
<para>It is evident that Defence finds it impossible to actually assign a dollar value to some of those items. To continue to search through its warehouses to try to match up all of that materiel in order to bring it under the banner of accrual accounting is not sensible, smart or clever and does nothing to advance the safety and protection of the Australian community. So we urge the government to get real about this problem and draw effective lines across what is being demanded in the name of accrual accounting.</para>
<para>The other key area that I, the member for Cowan and others looked at very closely was the whole question of Australiaâs advanced warfare destroyerâwhether and in what way it would be appropriate to advance the assessment of that vessel and the nature of the proposals being put to us, as well as how Defence was handling that procedure, what types of capacities should be available to Australia and how they should meet that. Defence argued that they were fundamentally trying to create a more flexible force which could respond more appropriately to the ever-present and speedy changes that they are faced with in theatres not only close to home but also far afield.</para>
<para>The question of whether or not we should have two amphibious vessels or four was a key matter that the committee gave very close consideration to. We took account of the advice given by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, ASPI. In doing so, as the chair indicated, there is a question of balance when you make decisions about which materiel you will go with and how that will serve your purposesâincreased flexibility versus a capacity to do a bigger job, hopefully in a way that will deliver Australian forces overseas effectively and protect them whilst they are being delivered.</para>
<para>We found a defence force that was ready to answer our questions as capably and as honestly as it could, a defence force that was grappling with the problems of accrual accounting and a defence force that was seeking to redesign the way it responded to the pressures on it. We have recommended strongly that the government unshackle it from some of those inappropriate demands of accrual accounting, since from now on it will be under that aegis. We need to appropriately deal with the historical materiel they are still fighting with. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para class="block">In July this year I visited Israel for the first time. I was impressed by the development of the country, the lushness of its valleys around the Sea of Galilee, the deserts leading to the Dead Sea and the indescribable beauty of this ancient land. I was also impressed by its democracy in an area where Israel is surrounded by non-democratic countries. At the time of our visit, across Israel cars and buses displayed flags and people wore either blue or orange T-shirts to indicate their support for, or opposition to, the withdrawal from Gazaâorange if you were in opposition or blue if you were in favour.</para>
<para>Within the Knesset, where we met with various politicians, there was much debate. Within the Likud, the governing party, there were a variety of opinions. In former years, Sharon, their leader and Prime Minister, had encouraged the Israeli settlements in Gaza. Now he was asking them to withdraw. He knew how painful this was to the settlers and he publicly expressed his sorrow at the heartbreak of those involved, but still he pressed on. Despite fiery opposition from within his own party and major protest rallies, he never wavered and the withdrawal was achieved. This is why today we honour Sharonâs commitment to this important step.</para>
<para>Israelâs disengagement from Gaza, a key element of the peace process, was completed successfully by 23 August. While there was extensive media coverage given to settler protests against the withdrawal, there was no major incidence of violence or disruption by the Palestinians. There was an outbreak of violence on 24 September, including rocket attacks by Palestinian militants into Israel and reprisals by Israel against militants and their infrastructure in Gaza and the West Bank, but Hamas has since vowed to halt attacks against Israel ahead of its participation in Palestinian legislative elections, scheduled for January 2006âand we certainly hope that that eventuates.</para>
<para>A confidence vote by the Likud central committee in favour of Prime Minister Sharon on 26 September has bolstered, for the time being, his leadership of the party and has quashed, for now, former finance minister Benjamin Netanyahuâs challenge to oust Sharon from the premiership and the Likud leadership. Netanyahu has accused the Prime Minister of caving in to terrorism by relinquishing the Gaza Strip without getting anything in return. But we believe that it was a significant step forward in the process to achieving peace. The withdrawal of 7,000 Israelis in an area surrounded by 1.5 million Palestinians is important in the road map to peace and, despite the incursions into the territory by the militant Hamas, the Israelis recognise the significance of this move.</para>
<para>One of the places I visited in Jerusalem was the Holocaust museum. It was a very challenging visit. I saw the graphic record of the Jewish people who were so oppressed by Nazi Germany during World War II, which resulted in the horrendous loss of six million innocent Jewish lives. As the Jews returned to Israel to reclaim their landâa land free of the oppression they had experienced in Europeâthey have had ongoing challenges as they have fought to establish an independent nation, a democratic nation, in a country where they could pursue their way of life without fear.</para>
<para>The Australian government considers Israelâs withdrawal from Gaza as a positive step toward the goals of the peace map. The passing of responsibility for the Egypt-Gaza border to Egyptian security forces is also important. We urge both sides to use disengagement as an opportunity to carry the peace process forward. We hope the eruption of violence in Gaza and the West Bank which started on 24-25 September will not derail the progress that has been made. The commitment of President Abbas to stop terrorism and the incitement to further bloodshed will be pivotal to maintaining the momentum of the peace process.</para>
<para>Conflict in the region will continue. The Australian governmentâs commitment to the disengagement process has been evident with the secondment of an Australian Defence Force officer to the International Security Sector Working Group, which includes US, British and Canadian personnel. It is also important that, with our $16 million aid commitment in the 2005 budget to the Palestinian Authority, we urge the authority to make moves against terror groups such as Hamas and disarm them. We also urge the United Nations to continue to assist in the humanitarian and security situation.</para>
<para>No doubt the best prospect for peace remains a two-state solution that will ensure the security of Israel and provide for a viable and stable Palestinian state. It is important that the United Nations is called upon to assist immediately with the humanitarian crisis and in working towards a secure solution for both parties involved. Once again, I congratulate the Sharon government on the successful withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and pray that this will form a vital building block in the road map to peace in the Middle East. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âSome years ago, I had the opportunity to visit Israel and neighbouring countries. I spent time in Tel Aviv and Eilat. I also visited Bethlehem, the old part of Jerusalem and the area known as the Wailing Wall. During that visit, I was struck by the number of young people in uniform and by the number of young people in civilian dressâbut armed. Young people in Israel learn early that precious territory hard-earned is just as easily lost and that peace hard-won is easily shattered.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Israel is a friendly, democratic state that was established by way of a United Nations resolution. Although âcreated on paperâ might be an accurate description of the establishment of the state of Israel, its establishment has really been through the blood, sweat, tears, sacrifice and ongoing and utter determination of the people of Israel to ensure the survival of their state and themselves. Israel has had to defend itself and its citizens from countless terrorist attacks, launched in the deadliest and most cowardly of ways. Indeed, Israel has had to defend itself against a promise of extermination by terrorist groups and others dedicated to the obliteration of the Israeli state.</para>
<para>In the face of this, we recently witnessed what I believe was an extremely courageous political decision and a course of action by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, which was to quit the Gaza and to disengage. This was a decision taken against the very strong wishes of many Israelis, particularly those who had spent generations on the land and others who saw the decision to be strategically stupid, ill-considered and showing extreme weakness in the face of the suicide bombings. Many of the former residents had of course to be forcibly removed. It was not an easy decision to take nor was it an easy decision to implement, but it is a decision which can bring new hope and new promise to that region.</para>
<para>I take this opportunity in the House to reject the views recently offered in this place by the member for Fowler concerning the Gaza Strip. I have already written to Joe Berinsonâa person for whom I have the utmost respectâand the Jewish community in Perth rejecting the memberâs views and saying that those views have no part in the policy or practice of this party nor do they have any credibility as far as I am concerned.</para>
<para>Israel has acted to provide new hope and new promise. The question now remains as to what will occur in the Palestinian territory. Will we see the same level of politically courageous leadership from Abu Mazen? Surely the onus is now on him to commit himself and those people in the Palestinian territories to a process of peace and a process of cleaning out those terrorist cells that exist. He must also commit himself to a role of leadership with other Arab states and determine that the way ahead is on the pathway to peace in the Middle East and a rejection of the threat of continued violence against Israel. He must also commit himself, along with others, to the rejection of the extreme wing of Hamas, its disarming and its disbandment.</para>
<para>Members of Hamas recently staged an armed rally in Gaza. Hamas is an organisation that has in the past been responsible for the deaths of hundreds of civilian Jewish people. Hamas has not been an instrument of peace nor has it reflected the aims and aspirations of many Palestinians who want a peaceful process and who want peaceful solutions. Worse, Hamas has been an ongoing instrument of terror resulting in the death of innocent people. We hope that the recent declaration by Hamas towards a peaceful solution is a declaration that it will meet.</para>
<para>I mentioned at the start of my speech that I had spoken to young people who were in uniform who were armed. Without exception, all of those young people I spoke to looked forward to the time when they could get rid of the arms, get rid of the military paraphernalia and go back to being students or citizens who could make a peaceful contribution to a peaceful future in what, hopefully, will be a peaceful land.</para>

<para>âI commend the member for Cook on moving this very important motion, and I thank the member for Cowan for his disavowal of the disgraceful remarks made by the member for Fowler about the Gaza disengagement, which shocked and appalled so many of us in this House and people throughout Australia.</para>

<para>It is most appropriate that this private memberâs motion is being debated today. We are in the period of the Jewish calendar known as the Yamim Noraim, the days of awe, between Rosh Hashanahâthe Jewish new year of 5766âand Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, the holiest of all days. Perhaps as a sign of better days to come, this holy month coincides with the Muslim holy month of fasting, Ramadan. Rosh Hashanah, which was celebrated last week at the many synagogues in my electorate of Wentworth, is a time of prayerful hope for a peaceful and prosperous new year, symbolised at Jewish dinner tables with food sweetened with honey, apples and carrots. The traditional greeting of âShanah Tova uMetukaââa sweet and happy new yearâshould be more relevant to Israelis than ever before following Ariel Sharonâs bold move to disengage from Gaza and parts of the West Bank.</para>
<para>Already there have been some diplomatic dividends for Israel. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Silvan Shalomâwhom I met at his office in Jerusalem in April this yearâhas just had an article published in the <inline font-style="italic">Jakarta Post</inline>, the leading English newspaper in Islamâs most populous country. Mr Shalom recently met with the foreign ministers of Qatar and Tunisia. Ariel Sharon held a meeting with the President of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf, at the United Nations Summit last month. In August, the foreign ministers of Israel and Pakistan met in Istanbul. Kuwait has always been a leading centre of hostility towards Israel, yet late last month two of its leading newspapers published editorials calling for a normalisation of ties with Israel. In the Kuwaiti daily, <inline font-style="italic">Al Seyassa</inline>, leader writer Yusuf Nasir al-Suwaydan wrote perceptively:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Israeli withdrawal and a positive Arab response at this particular time would provide a peaceful political process with major momentum that could lead to a historic normalisation in the Middle East.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Against these positives, risks abound. As I said in a speech in this House on 16 August: âAriel Sharon is putting the ball in Abu Mazenâs court. He cannot afford to drop it.â Early signs suggest that Abu Mazen has only a tenuous grip on that ball. Hamas remains dominant in Gaza. On 24 September, rockets were fired into Israel with inevitable reprisals. Abu Mazen must confront the militants seeking to challenge his authority and put an end to the armed chaos in Gaza. Only yesterday, a Palestinian police commander and two others were killed by militants who refused to hand over their weapons. A meeting is planned for this week, possibly tomorrow, between Ariel Sharon and Abu Mazen. Preparatory meetings have been held over the weekend between their representatives: Saeb Erekat and Mr Sharonâs aide, Dov Weisglass. The key issue, as always, is going to be the control of violence. Love him or loathe him, Ariel Sharon took an enormous riskâa heroic riskâwhen he gave up so much territory, not for peace, not even for a promise of peace but, in the words of the psalmist, in pursuit of peace.</para>
<para>Sharon has managed to fend off a challenge to the leadership of the Likud Party from his former cabinet colleague, Binyamin Netanyahu, but only just. It must be obvious that the political capacity of any Israeli government to make more territorial concessions without an end to violence has all but run out. Therefore, the tension in the upcoming meeting will be between the Israelis saying, âControl your militants,â and the Palestinians saying, âConcede more control in the West Bank.â The problem is that, unless and until Abu Mazen can demonstrate that he can deliver a reduction in violence and demonstrate that he can control the militants, the prospect of further concessions is bleak indeed.</para>
<para>Key players in the months ahead will be other Arab countries who, like Kuwait, recognise that the only way momentum can be maintained is by convincing the Israelis that concessions of territory and authority can be met with a reduction in violence. It is essential in that process of normalisation that there be an end to indoctrination in hate. There must be an end to the glorification of suicide bombing and there must be an end to the constant vilification of Israel and the Jews in the schools of Palestine. We should all pray this Yom Kippur, regardless of our faith, that the risks taken by Israel in their Gaza disengagement will further secure their nation, which one dayâwe must all hopeâshould be able to look forward to a future at peace with its neighbour and free from threats of annihilation. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âWhen a government makes a decision for the common good, it should be praised. The government of Israel has made such a decision. The dismantling of the Jewish settlements in Gaza and the withdrawal from Gaza are decisions that have been made for the common good in pursuit of peace in the Middle East. I am delighted to be able to participate in a debate which is being held in a spirit of bipartisanship. I acknowledge and thank the member for Cook for bringing this motion to the parliament so that we can express our views and our support for a peaceful settlement in the Middle East and for Israel to be able to thrive as a nation, free of terror and with secure borders.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Labor policy supports the disengagement from Gaza. It is part of the road map to peace, which all members of this parliament should support. This could not have been an easy decision for Ariel Sharon. Regardless of the circumstances of the establishment of settlements in Gaza in the first place, it must have been a very hard decision for a government to dismantle them and withdraw from Gaza. This decision by Mr Sharon took courage and foresight. It was done in the context of great criticism from his party and, as the previous speaker, the member for Wentworth, has validly pointed out, at great peril to Mr Sharonâs position. This is a very positive step towards peace in the Middle East and it should be acknowledged as such. It should be acknowledged fully and gracefully as a very positive step. It should be supported without any cynicism, scepticism or qualification. I too dissociate myself from the remarks made by the member for Fowler.</para>
<para>There is now a legitimate expectation that the Palestinians should reciprocate. Hamas must be brought under control. The future of the Middle East cannot be determined through acts of terror. It is of course a tragedy that Yasser Arafat did not accept the Barak-Clinton peace plan at Camp David, a historic and perhaps once-in-half-a-century offer made to the people of Palestine. I was very disappointed that the offer was not accepted; but that is what happened and the consequence of that rejection was the loss of the lives of thousands of innocent civiliansâa real tragedy. I condemn terrorism in all its forms. Like any country around the world, Israel has the right to be free of terror. Suicide bombings in Israel are acts of terror; they are acts of evil. There can be no excuse or justification for acts of terror. Israel has the right to exist within secure borders.</para>
<para>Australia has supported a Palestinian state alongside Israel ever since 1948, when Dr Evatt led the United Nations in voting to partition geographic Palestine into Arab and Jewish states. It was a rational basis for settlement and it has remained Laborâs position. I had the opportunity of visiting Israel with Prime Minister Bob Hawke. I visited the Holocaust museum and the Wailing Wall, and there was a great sense of tragedy for the people of Israel and for Jewish people in general. I lend my full support to this motion and acknowledge Israelâs great courage in making a decision that contributes positively to the peace process. We need to be realistic. This does not signal peace but it certainly creates a legitimate expectation on the part of the Palestinians that they should reciprocate in some way so that we can make progress towards peace. Peace in the Middle East is very important for the rest of the world and for all those innocent people whose lives are threatened by the spectre of terrorism.</para>

<para>âI rise today to support the private memberâs motion moved by the member for Cook, which is receiving bipartisan support from members of the parliament, regarding the Israeli governmentâs disengagement from the Gaza Strip and parts of the northern West Bank. For decades, there has been unresolved conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. The decision by the Israeli government and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was both difficult and sensitive. Prime Minister Sharon should be commended for his leadership and positive steps towards achieving the road map to peace in the Middle East. Part of that was the passing of responsibility for the Egypt-Gaza border to the Egyptian security forces.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>On 23 August the disengagement from Gaza was successfully completed. While extensive media coverage was given to settler protests against the withdrawal, there were no major incidents of violence or disruption by the Palestinians. However, there is still a long way to go before the peace process is completed. There is still much unrest and conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. Over the years, many proposals for peace have been negotiatedâmost notably, the 1993 Oslo accords between the Israelis, the Palestinians and the then US President Bill Clinton. Finally, 10 years later, the road map to peace was negotiated with the assistance of international diplomats from the United Nations, the United States of America, the European Union and Russia. Part of this plan was the creation of the state of Palestine. An important component of that state being created is the withdrawal of Israeli settlers from the Gaza Strip and parts of the West Bank.</para>
<para>There are several reasons why the disengagement from Gaza is so important. It will increase Israelâs long-term security, it will reduce the friction between Jewish Israelis and Palestinian Arabs, it will also improve the economies of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and it will encourage the Palestinian Authority to fight terrorism. To expand on the last point, the commitment of Palestinian President Abbas to stop terrorism during the disengagement period was encouraging. However, I and, I know, members of this parliament call on the Palestinian Authority to collect arms and munitions from terror groups operating in Gaza, to further deliver on this commitment. In order to stop further bloodshed and terrorism, President Abbas must use the disengagement of the Israelis from the Gaza Strip as leverage to maintain the momentum of the peace process. One such terrorist group which must be disarmed is Hamas. This well-known terrorist group, formed in 1987, inflicts large-scale attacks like suicide bombings on Israeli military and civilian targets predominately in the Gaza Strip and on the West Bank. Hamas and other terrorist groups need to be stopped if the peace process is to succeed. However, it is encouraging to hear how Hamas has vowed to halt attacks against Israelis ahead of its participation in the Palestinian legislative elections, which are scheduled for January of next year.</para>
<para>Australia has long supported the peace process in the Middle East and, in this newest phase of action to implement the road map to peace, the Australian government has deployed an Australian Defence Force officer to the International Security Sector Working Group. It is also talking with Australian-born Jim Wolfensohn, who was the President of the World Bank, about projects where Australia can help the Palestinian economy respond to disengagement. Mr Wolfensohn, now the special envoy for disengagement, will coordinate the international communityâs efforts in supporting the disengagement initiative. Practical support is already being provided to the Palestinian people, with at least $16 million budgeted for this financial year through the Australian governmentâs aid program. The United Nations does a wonderful job in advocating human rights all over the world and I encourage the UN to provide both humanitarian and security assistance during this peace process. Whilst the future of the Middle East is looking bright, the process still has a long way to go. We realise and acknowledge that the peace process will take time and that the Israelis and Palestinians need the support of Australia and the United Nations. I commend this motion to the House.</para>

<para>âI have pleasure in also supporting the motion by my colleague the member for Cook, whom I joined on that trip to Israel earlier this year. We met with representatives of the Israeli parliament, as he indicated, and also representatives of the Palestinian Authority. I would also like to acknowledge my electorateâs historical connection to the establishment of the state of Israel through Dr Evatt. When he was the leader of the Palestinian commission recommending the establishment of the state of Israel, he was in fact the member for Barton.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This parliament has perhaps a limited role in establishing peace in the Middle East, but what we can do is acknowledge courage. It is all too easy in politics to speak to an audience in terms of what the audience wants to hear. It is even worseâarguably evilâto attempt to exploit fear and prejudice for political advantage. To do that does not involve political courage; it is arguably political cowardice. In that context, I think we should acknowledge the leadership of the Israeli Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon. His was a tremendously courageous decision to undertake the process of disengagement from the Gaza region. As the member for Cook indicated, when we visited the Knesset we could certainly sense the extent of controversy that decision evoked, given the emotion and anger. Indeed, there was open talk of the prospect of civil war occurring as a result of that decision. Nonetheless, the decision was made and with leadership it was followed through and the process effectively undertaken. I have no particular affinity with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon but I must acknowledge the courage of that decision.</para>
<para>Equally, from the point of view of establishing a viable Palestinian state, encouragement must be given to the Palestinian leader Abu Mazen. It has been argued that the various roadblocks that existed in Gaza were an impediment to the Palestinian Authority security forces enforcing the rule of law, so the disengagement from the Gaza region now puts the weights very much on the Palestinian Authority in terms of what they can achieve in establishing the rule of law, which is absolutely essential to the progress of any modern nation. We note with encouragement that the Palestinian Authority has been prepared to take action against those militants who have insisted on carrying weapons in public. The next step must be a concerted effort to disarm the terrorist organisations.</para>
<para>We saw in our own region that peace could not be established in the Solomon Islands until there was a wholesale commitment to the process of disarming the groups in that country that would engage in acts of terror. Similarly, that has to be the situation in terms of the commitment of Abu Mazen to actually disarm the terrorist organisations. Unless and until that is done, his own security cannot be assured. Certainly the ability of Palestinian people to go about normal life and the ability of those people to develop as a nation and prosper depend very much on that commitment to establishing the rule of law. The international community can assist by providing particular expertise. We can also assist by providing encouragement. As my colleague Mr Turnbull indicated, the international community can also assist by saying that the language of violence, the language of intolerance and incitement to acts of terrorism must stop. They must stop as part of the wholesale effort to help the Palestinian Authority restore the rule of law and end these abhorrent terrorist acts, which we all condemn. Finally, I would like to join my colleagues, obviously as a result of my comments, in disociating myself from the member for Fowlerâs comments earlier this month. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI rise to extend my condolences to all those affected by the devastating earthquake that occurred on Saturday in Pakistan and extending across to India and Afghanistan. The death toll continues to grow alarmingly and is more than 19,000, with early estimates expecting the figure to pass 30,000. I returned from this region 10 days ago, after visiting Laos and Pakistan with a parliamentary delegation that included the members for Herbert and Fisher and Senator Webber. We met with President Musharraf and Prime Minister Aziz. The hospitality extended by the Pakistani people was warm and generous. We travelled to the awe-inspiring North-West Frontier Province, where, sadly, 1,797 people to date have been killed. My thoughts are with the Khyber Rifles and their families, whose hospitality to us was legendary.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The epicentre of the quake was in Kashmir. With a troubled history, it is hoped that in response to this devastating earthquake this region will become more unified. It is in Kashmir that the earthquake has claimed the lives of hundreds of children who were attending school at the time. Most buildings in this area are constructed with mud bricks, reducing the hopes of finding survivors. I commend the Australian government for committing $5Â½ million of aid as its contribution, and I also welcome the United Statesâs commitment of eight helicopters, with more aid to follow. We in this country are sheltered from many natural disasters, and any support we can offer after this calamity should be generous and forthcoming. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThe strongest earthquake this century hit the Pakistan region on Saturday, causing enormous damage. Not only have there been, at this stage, 20,000 people killed, but also at least 40,000 have been injured. Condolences from me and the parliament go to the families of those who have lost their loved ones and those who have lost their homes and their livelihoods. I am sure that under the leadership of President Musharraf, a kind of benevolent dictator leading his country to a very modern Pakistan, the army resources will mobilise and the people will be looked after as best as possible. I know, too, that our high commissioner in Islamabad, Zorica McCarthy, will be mobilising our Australian resources to help the people of Pakistan and others who have been affected. I commend the Australian government for its $500,000 initial donation to the Red Cross and Red Crescent organisations to bring much needed relief. I also note that no Australians have yet been determined as being injured, and we are very pleased to see that that is the situation. I support the comments of the member for Franklin in relation to the warmth and kind-heartedness of the way in which our delegation was received in Pakistan. Our thoughts are with those people today.</para>

<para>âAfter the attacks in London and, more recently, Bali, Australians are deeply aware of the debt they owe to emergency service workers, by which I mean police, ambulance employees and firefighters. These workers are entitled to the support of the community. Their morale is crucially important for the functions they carry out, particularly in a place like Melbourne, with the Commonwealth Games coming up. They are entitled to the best of superannuation arrangements. They are entitled to know that, if the worst happens in the dangerous work they undertake, their families are going to be financially secure in the future. They are entitled to these excellent arrangements to underpin their morale.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In Victoria we have a very good governmentâcertainly a much better government than its predecessorâbut, in seeking to change the superannuation arrangements of emergency service workers, the Victorian government on this limited occasion is frankly wrong. I call upon the Victorian government to back off on changing superannuation arrangements for emergency service workers without the consent of the workers in those industries. It is crucial for the morale and protection of the Australian community that the morale of these workersâpolice, firefighters and ambulance employeesâis protected and enhanced, and the Victorian government should not seek to make changes to superannuation arrangements without the consent of those workers.</para>

<para>âAs was mentioned by the honourable members for Franklin and Herbert, I was part of a parliamentary delegation, also including Senator Ruth Webber from the Australian Labor Party, to Laos and Pakistan. We returned just a little over a week ago. When in Pakistan we were extended incredible hospitality and access to people at the highest level of the government. We were privileged to meet the Prime Minister of Pakistan and also President Musharraf. I have to say, given the difficulties experienced by the world with respect to the war against terror, one can only admire the role played by Pakistan, because, in many respects, Pakistan is very much at the coalface.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Like other honourable members, I was appalled to hear about the earthquake which occurred in Pakistan on Saturday. All of us, no doubt, would be very concerned at the reports of 20,000 deaths so far and possibly many more in that area of the world. I want to say that my personal condolences are extended to the people of Pakistan. I believe very strongly that our nationâs contribution towards the relief effort so far has been appropriate and I would hope that, if necessary, Australia is able to find additional funds. Pakistan is a close friend to Australia. I know we are well represented in Islamabad and that Australia is well regarded as a nation.Â  <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

We know that the laws being introduced by this government are vicious and antiworker. We know that each and every one of them will be an assault upon ordinary working families.

<para>âAbout 10 days ago, I debated the Western Australian Minister for Planning and Infrastructure, Alannah McTiernan, on Perthâs 720 ABC Radio in relation to the Perth to Bunbury highway and her efforts to extort extra moneys from the federal government, to not fulfil her responsibility to get on and build this road as a continuous build. I was taken aback by the fact that the minister, Alannah McTiernan, suggested the federal government expand its responsibilities to include the management of public transport. Does this woman have no shame? Wonât she get on and actually build the transport infrastructure in Western Australia instead of trying to cost-shift and buck-pass by suggesting that the federal government should not only manage but also fund public transport in Western Australia? Is this a suggestion the Labor Party wants to take to other states?</para>
</talk.start>
<para>She has a railway going from Perth to Mandurah which is now dearer than the Alice Springs to Darwin line. How could the Commonwealth ever countenance taking on public transport infrastructure when the state government cannot control its own infrastructure and public transport? She has allowed the cost of this railway from Perth to Mandurah to blow out from less than $1 billion to now $1.53 billion. No wonder the federal government finds this a cynical attempt at cost-shifting by the state minister for transport. We will not be a part of it. Do not try it on, because the federal governmentâs responsibilities are not with state responsibilities, such as public transport.</para>

<para>âThe Treasurer continues to illustrate nothing but contempt for the people of central Victoria by failing to use part of the $540 million he has inherited from the Scoresby Freeway project to fund the final stage of the Calder Highway development. The governmentâs Liberal state colleagues have announced that they too will use tolls to help fund the Eastern Freeway project. The Treasurer has continued to play dog-in-the-manger, juvenile party political games over his election promise to match the stateâs funding for the Calderâand the people of central Victoria are getting increasingly tired and very angry about his game-playing with their tax dollars. Bendigo and central Victorian motorists are being ripped off with excessive federal excise and GST on fuel. On top of this outrage, they cop a toll on the Calder to enter Melbourne and, to add insult to injury, a GST on that toll. And they are not getting a fair go from this Treasurer.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Is it any wonder the Treasurer cannot stay far enough away from Bendigo? He dare not speak the name Bendigo. I thought there may be another reason for his avoiding Bendigo, so I checked the electoral roll. I can inform the Treasurer that Robert âRedâ Bingham does not live in Bendigo, so there is no need to be frightened of Bendigo for that reason. I can only assume he is avoiding the area because he knows how angry the people are over his blatant game of political poker with Calder funding. The shocking aspect of this is that he uses peopleâs lives as the stakes.</para>

<para>âToday I rise to speak about and congratulate the volunteers at Brooklyn Park Meals on Wheels. I had the privilege last week to meet with volunteers from the Brooklyn Park Meals on Wheels, which delivers meals to elderly and frail constituents within the western suburbs of Adelaide in the seat of Hindmarsh. Many volunteers are involved and give their time and labour on an ongoing basis, week in and week out, for this wonderful organisation. I saw the volunteers prepare the meals, pack them and then load them into their cars, ready to be delivered to those in the community who are frail or aged. All of this was done under the auspices of Mrs Anita Watts, the supervisor, and Mr Len Glastonbury, the chair of Brooklyn Park Meals on Wheels, both of whom must be congratulated for their dedication and commitment.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Mr Len Glastonbury and Mrs Anita Watts have given their time and effort year in and year out and have contributed so much to our community in the western suburbs through their volunteer work with Meals on Wheels. I was also privileged to go out on a round of meal deliveries with two of the most dedicated people I have ever seen, Mrs Pam Young and Mr Eddie Smith, who have been volunteers for quite some time at Brooklyn Park Meals on Wheels. I would like to congratulate both Mrs Pam Young and Mr Eddie Smith for their contribution and for their dedication to our area through the voluntary work they do for Brooklyn Park Meals on Wheels. They are both dedicated and committed volunteers to a great cause that provides meals to our frail and elderly. What was so impressive about these two people was not only their commitment to delivering meals but also their caring nature towards those they were delivering to. It is people like Len Glastonbury, Anita Watts, Eddie Smith, Pam Young and many other magnificent volunteersâ<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<inline>âOn indulgence, I mention two great national calamitiesâin particular, the earthquakes in South Asia. On behalf of the parliament and the people of Australia, I offer our deepest condolences to the victims of these earthquakes. The casualties are now calculated to be between 18,000 and 30,000. The country most dramatically affected has been Pakistan, but the consequences have been felt in India and also in Afghanistan. I am conveying on behalf of the people of Australia our condolences directly to the leaders of these two countries.</inline>
<para>The government has already announced a contribution of $5.5 million to the earthquake relief effort. I inform the House that that amount may well rise as we continue to reassess the extent of this terrible calamity. It is a dreadful act of nature which has brought horrendous consequences for the people of Pakistan, a poor country. The people affected not only suffer severely from poor housing and poor infrastructure but also will suffer from the onset in the weeks and months ahead of a very severe winter. The funding that the government has provided will support UN agencies and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. It will mainly be used for medical, food and shelter assistance for the communities in the disaster zone.</para>
<para>I express sympathy at this time to members of the North Asian and subcontinental community in Australia, particularly those with relatives and connections in Pakistan. I encourage Australians in their individual capacities to contribute to relief efforts. We have not at this stage received any reports of Australian casualties, but Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade consulate staff are continuing to get in touch with Australians understood to be in the region. As I said a moment ago, we will continue to monitor reports of this terrible calamity, and if further assistance from Australiaâeither in cash or in kindâis required it will be made available.</para>
<para>I also take this opportunity to extend the sympathy of the people of Australia to those in Mexico and Central America affected by Hurricane Stan. The effects of this hurricane have been tragic for many communities and the loss of life, numbered at the moment in the hundreds, could well grow as details come to hand. Through our embassy in Mexico we are providing some support to the Red Cross in affected countries, recognising the assistance extended by other countries in that region.</para>

<para>âOn indulgence, I join with the Prime Minister in extending our sympathies to the governments of those nations on the subcontinentâPakistan, India and Afghanistanâwho have suffered grievously, particularly in Pakistan, as a result of the earthquake over the weekend. As the Prime Minister has said, there are official reports out that suggest 30,000 killed, but the numbers could go as high as 40,000. And probably they will, as the reporting from many villages and towns they have not yet been able to access begins to be presented to authorities.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This is a terrible event and a terribly destructive event at precisely the time in the year when there is most fear for those who are left without accommodation, warmth and support. The areas where it occurred are high, mountainous regions already feeling the cold onset of winter, even though it is now just autumn. To be without shelter in such inclement, cold conditions is almost certain to substantially increase the casualty rates that we have already seen.</para>
<para>Our hearts go out, in particular, to those parents who have lost their children. There have been terrible sights and terrible stories. In one town alone, 60 students were buried alive in a classroom. These are such heartbreaking things, such terrible things to happen. We support the governmentâs announcement of $5 million in assistance and welcome the Prime Ministerâs statement that that is not, from his point of view, the last thing to be said on the matter. We also support the purposes to which that is put. Given what I have just said, putting it towards tents, blankets, transport, helicopters and medicines through the Red Cross, Red Crescent and the UN is obviously exactly the way to go in the circumstances that the people of Pakistan in particular and the other affected areas now confront.</para>
<para>We should give every support to the call of Pakistani President Musharraf for overseas Pakistani communities to provide assistance to their relatives, their confreres and their fellow countrymen back in Pakistan. There is a huge Pakistani diaspora of very hardworking people. The diaspora extends to this countryâsome of them are now Pakistani Australians and some of them of course are Pakistanis who are here on work permits or study permits and the like. They will be heartbroken by what they see on television. Australians should give them every bit of support. Indeed, we should give every bit of support privately to the collections that they will now take up as a result of their Presidentâs call. President Musharraf was here only a few months ago and he said that he was determined that his country should be an influential broker for peace, security and economic development. He spoke inspirationally of waging jihad against illiteracy, poverty, backwardness and hunger. We hope and pray that this battle can still be won, despite the terrible new challenges that are now presented to him and to his colleagues in similar positions in neighbouring countries.</para>
<para>The Prime Minister also mentioned those who were suffering as a result of the depredations of Hurricane Stan in Mexico, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala. Numbers of people have been killed and the death toll is rising from that, as well. In many places a quagmire 400 metres deep has rendered rescuers helpless as they have tried to get to grips with the effects of mud slidesâa direct product of the hurricaneâon villages. Our hearts go out to them too, and we wish their governments well as they go about the awful task of cleaning up and of comforting the bereaved.</para>

<para class="block">The terrible attack in Bali on 1 October, despite its awful resonance with the events of 12 October 2002âwhich may perhaps in some way have prepared usânonetheless produced a deep shock. It produced in the Australian community a sense of outrage that, once again, Australians engaged in the innocent pursuit of a holiday with families and friends amongst people they have come, over the generations, to love and admire a great dealâthat is, the people of Baliâshould be caught up in a terrorist attack.</para>
<para>That sense of outrage is not limited to the pain inflicted on innocent Australians; it is also extended to the pain and death visited upon people of many countries, many races and many nationalities. As a result of the bomb attack, four Australians have been confirmed dead, including a 16-year-old boy from Busselton in Western Australia, Brendan Fitzgerald. A death in a wanton, indiscriminate fashion is always totally abhorred and is saddening. But there is something particularly poignant about the taking of the life of a young man at the threshold of his life and at the threshold of adulthood. To see the photographs of him and to be reminded of the immense loss to his family and loved ones in the circumstances is deeply moving.</para>
<para>Jennifer Williamson and Colin and Fiona Zwolinski from New South Wales make up the four Australians who have lost their lives. A number of others were injured. On behalf of me, my wife and all of the members of this House, I extend a very deep sympathy and feeling of particular loss and grievance on this occasion. Two communities in Australia, particularly the community of Newcastle in the Hunter Valley and also the community of Busselton in Western Australia, have been left grieving by these events.</para>
<para>I want to pay a special tribute to two of our colleagues, the member for Newcastle and the member for Paterson, both of whom threw their offices open over the weekend and did everything they humanly could to help their communities on this particular occasion. The outpourings of community and solidarityâand I use that word in its best senseâof the people of Newcastle and the Hunter Valley towards those who have lost so much was eloquently expressed in that very moving address given by Joe Frost at the ceremony of remembrance held in the Catholic cathedral in Newcastle. He said it all on our behalf and perhaps said it more powerfully than it has been said before. That Australians going about something as inoffensive as a holiday should have their life interruptedâand, in the case of four of our fellow Australians, taken awayâproduces in all of us a deep and strongly held sense of outrage. That is a depth of feeling that should be maintained by the Australian community. We must not allow the passage of time to remove the sense of outrage and the sense of hostility shared by this community towards the perpetration of acts of terrorism and acts of violence of this kind.</para>
<para>I again have occasion to record my gratitude and, I know, the gratitude of all members of this House to the men and women of the Australian Public Service who, from the moment news came through of this attack, put aside anything else they were doing and set about putting in hand the Australian relief effort. Once again that effort was impressive. Once again we were speedily able to medically evacuate people who needed medical evacuation. On this occasion I instructed that that offer be made available to people irrespective of nationality, and I am pleased to say that that offer was picked up in relation to one or two people. Once again I thank our medical teams, the Australian Defence Force, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the magnificent Australian Ambassador to Indonesia, David Ritchie, who has had to cope with a terrorist attack in each of the three years that he has been our ambassador. Can I say this is a reminder to all of us that the jokes that are occasionally made at the expense of our overseas representatives fall rather flat and are seen in their proper perspective when a challenge of this kind has to be endured. The RAAF transferred nine of the most seriously injured from Darwin to Newcastle on 5 October so that they could be near their families and friends. I am pleased to know that many of them are making a speedy recovery, although the psychological recovery will inevitably be far more prolonged, far more difficult and, sadly, much delayed.</para>
<para>In the aftermath of the bombings, on Sunday, 2 October, I spoke to President Yudhoyono of Indonesia, and we both agreed to redouble our efforts to fight terrorism in our region. There are obviously issues that will be the subject of discussion and debate in another context in this place. But we did agree that rather than driving us apart these attacks would bring the people of Indonesia and the people of Australia closer together. I think I can say without any contradiction that this attack was not only an attack upon innocent Australians and innocent foreigners but also an attack on the moderate face of modern, democratic Indonesia. It is in the interests of terrorists to undermine President Yudhoyono. It is in the interests of terrorists to instil fear and instability in that country. It is in our interests and in the interests of the entire community to do everything we can to ensure that that attempt does not succeed. I offered President Yudhoyono all possible assistance, and already there has been very close cooperation, as there was in 2002, between the Indonesian police and the Australian Federal Police. Some 28 Australian Federal Police officers and some of their state counterparts, including people involved in the grim task of victim identification, have been working in Bali for some days already.</para>
<para>The impact of this attack on the people of Bali will be devastating. It is an interesting observation to make that the links between Australia and the Balinese are very strong. I have not heard one Australian who has been to Bali do other than speak highly of the Balinese people. The constant refrain, even from people who had been injured or who had lost loved ones in that beautiful spot, was to speak well of the people of Bali and to express their sympathy for the Balinese people for what they had lost and for how much they had suffered. Obviously the terrorists will be pleased that the tourist trade in Bali has been virtually destroyed. They will be delighted at the fact that shops will be empty, that tourists will stay away, that people who are poor will get even poorer and that the sense of suffering and deprivation will be the greater. That is their goal. They will rejoice in that. They will draw satisfaction and pleasure from the pain they have inflicted not only on foreigners and Westerners but also on their own people. It is a measure of the type of people that we confront and are dealing with that that should be the case.</para>
<para>May I alsoâbecause this is the week of the third anniversary of the attack in Bali on 12 October 2002, when 88 Australian citizens and three permanent residents of this country lost their livesârecall again the extraordinary and devastating impact that that attack had on this country. That attack and the response by the Australian people has become an indelible element of the Australian story. It reminded us of our vulnerability to terrorism and it reminded us that we could suffer greatly, even though the terrorist attack had not occurred in our country. It brought forth something that we had always believed about ourselves but perhaps on occasion were a little unwilling to expressâthat is, we are a wonderful combination of strength and determination on the one hand and warmth and compassion on the other. The response to that attack in 2002, and the way in which Australians have recalled it in the three years that have gone by, reminds us of that wonderful duality of the Australian personality. It is tough and we are proud of that. We are direct and we are laconic, but we are also an incredibly warm, compassionate and sentimental people when that is needed. I think it is a wonderful duality for a nationâs personality to possess. I could not think of a better duality for the personality of a nation than what is expressed in those characteristics of us Australians.</para>
<para>On Wednesday, to mark the precise third anniversary, I have in discussion with the opposition arranged a simple commemorative ceremony near the Bali memorial in the gardens adjacent to the House of Representatives. I understand, Mr Speaker, that if it meets the convenience of the House there will be a short adjournment, or perhaps this ceremony will start, before the House meets, to accommodate it, at 9.15 in the morning. It will be an opportunity for all of us, in a quiet, simple and dignified way, to remember that day which will forever be part of Australian history as the day when evil struck in full force with unconditional ferocity and a total absence of pity and claimed 88 Australians, and indeed citizens of many other countries.</para>
<para>Many millions of words have been spoken about terrorism and about its causes and its responses, and there are issues relating to it that do belong properly to other debates in this parliament. Let me simply say something again that I said at the time of the attack on Londonâthat is, barbarism will never cow a free people. We are a free people, we are a very proud people and we have every reason to be both free and proud. And whatever our views, whatever our background, whatever our politics, we must on occasions such as this reaffirm our determination in the relevance of that proposition that we must never allow barbarism to cow a free people.</para>

</talker>
<para>âIn seconding the motion, I thank the Prime Minister for his very heart-warming and heartfelt words. They will give comfort to many people who have been afflicted by the atrocity that occurred on 2 October. That atrocity was made more abhorrent, more sorrowful and more poignant coming as it did almost three years to the day after the 2002 Bali attack. The bombings in Kuta and Jimbaran Bay just over a week ago came on the eve of the third anniversary of the attack of 12 October 2002 that killed 202 people, among them 88 Australians. That anniversary was something which all of us were preparing ourselves to engage in in the course of this week, and for us to have this horrific event occur on its immediate eve is an enormous burden for this nation to bear, a very heavy national burden of grief.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>For those who are still recovering in Australia and Singapore and for their families and friends we know there will be tough times ahead, and we want to reassure them today that Australian hearts are with them. Our thoughts and prayers are in particular with the grieving families of Colin and Fiona Zwolinski and Jennifer Williamson of Newcastle and 16-year-old Brendan Fitzgerald of Busselton in Western Australia, who were killed. All these cases touch our hearts tremendously and when one sees somebody young die it touches our hearts particularly. Brendan Fitzgerald looked just like the sort of son we would all want, with his aspirations and affectionsâthe sort of young fellow that any family would be proud ofâand to see him, a life so full of promise, go this way is too hard to sustain.</para>
<para>We think, too, of the people of that great town of Newcastle: the three who are dead and the many who are injured. That is absolute evidence that Bali is not a rich manâs playground. Bali is the focal point where ordinary Australians have come into contact with ordinary Indonesians for years and years and have enjoyed tremendously each otherâs company and have learnt from it. We have become accustomed to the ideas and precepts of Asian culture in our case, and there has been a bit of an understanding of what a laconic, laid-back people we are in the Indonesian case. It has been a place where we have celebrated the fact that we can be of this region and it has been an idea which ordinary Australians advanceâand I would say they advance it in the national interestâin the way in which they have that preparedness to interact with the people of Bali. The people of Newcastle are taking this blow. It is a city that has taken an awful lot of blows over the years. It is a very tough city, and they will take this blow and they will offer each other comfort in the way in which they always do. All the same, we ought to understand, and I am sure we do, what a terrible burden it is for them now to sustain. We think of the injured Australians in hospitals here and overseas and those recovering at home. We think of the families of all those killed and injured, the people of Bali and the other overseas visitors, three of whom we are still looking after in Darwin Hospital as we speak.</para>
<para>We think of the victims of the 2002 attack very much in this context: three years on and some still recovering from their terrible physical injuries. Emotional healing will be a lifelong journey and, inevitably, old wounds have been reopened by this latest atrocity. When Dave âSpikeâ Stewart, who lost his son Anthony in 2002, heard the news of the latest bombings he said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I just cried. My thoughts are for the parents â¦ who are going through what we went through.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">And burns victim Tracey Ball of Perth:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">My heart just broke for all those people who are going through it. And then I just felt totally helpless.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">And from Dawn Foxâmother of burns victim Therese Fox, who spent 12 months at her critically injured daughterâs bedside urging her not to give upâthere was advice that though there will be difficult days ahead, as she says, âThey just have to hang in there.â</para>
<para>I want to join the Prime Minister in the praise that he offered to all those Australians who have been engaged with the recovery from this latest atrocity, and indeed all those who were engaged in the initial recovery from the previous atrocity: the RAAF personnel, who so gently and carefully have flown people around the South-East Asian archipelago, and the officials who have worked so hard to ensure that the best possible communications are kept between victims and anxious loved ones back at home. I join the Prime Minister too in thanking our parliamentary colleagues. The member for Newcastle was straight onto me, and I know all of us, to see what we could do to help the moment this crisis broke upon her community. And I join too in what the Prime Minister had to say about the member for Paterson.</para>
<para>Can I say something nice about the Leader of the House, even though I find this incredibly difficult to do, because he has finally written an article which moved me to tears instead of moving me to fury! I have to say that the statement that he made brought to life for many of us the situation around him on the day that the recovery began from the atrocity. He gave us an understanding of the voluntary assistance that was being provided and the beginnings of the solidarity of the Newcastle people that the Prime Minister referred to.</para>
<para>I made a visit last week to Darwin Hospital and I must say I was gobsmacked by the facilities there and their preparedness to handle this sort of situation. Enormous amounts have been invested in Darwin Hospital and in the personnel over the last little while. The government has made that investment and I congratulate it for it. The personnel are absolutely superbly positioned to handle this sort of appalling atrocity. Many of them, both among the doctors and nurses, are reservists who have been rotated through Iraq and Afghanistan and have picked up an understanding of how to handle the terrible sorts of wounds that were experienced both in the first case which were mainly burn wounds from a fertiliser bomb and in this case which were mainly shrapnel wounds from a pipe bomb type of explosive. They are well trained to handle the consequences of both those sorts of atrocities. They are utterly self-confident.</para>
<para>It has been my misfortune to have to meet people handling the issues that have arisen from atrocities and natural disasters from time to time over the last 10 years or longer. Generally speaking, while people are doing their professional best, there is an air of mystification, an air of not quite knowing what to do amongst the people who actually have the responderâs responsibility. On this occasion, it was different. These were people who knew exactly what to do, had exactly the right equipment to handle the problem and who could do it with great calmness, great effectiveness and great fortitude.</para>
<para>The Prime Minister mentioned, and indeed the motion mentions, other issues related more generally to the war on terror. He said that is for a debate on another day, and so it is. We as a people are resolute in confronting the issues engaged in this conflict. We recognise, as the Prime Minister indicated, that probably in this instance we were not the primary target; it was a generalised Western target combined with an effort to undermine what is a moderate government in South-East Asia. We should never forget that the primary objective of al-Qaeda and its affiliates is not the destruction of the West, although that often seems to be a manifestation of the terrorist acts that they commit. The acts are committed for a political purpose, and the political purpose is to win the Muslim world. The objective of al-Qaeda, JI and the other Islamic terrorist organisations is to win control of the Islamic world and to obtain an opportunity to do that by going through a process of disconnecting the rest of us from the Muslim world. That makes it very important that we do not permit these atrocities to sever the human links between ourselves and the Indonesian people. That will require a deal of thought not only on the parts of ministers but also on the parts of all Australians.</para>
<para>We are not necessarily winning this war. The verdict is very open on this. The battle is engaged, but we are not yet winning this war. We have to get better and better at fighting it. We have to get more deeply involved in the South-East Asian community in the process of fighting it. I do believe we could take leadership positions in establishing intelligence networks. I understand an enormous amount is being done in police networks and exchanges. That is very much to the credit of the government in its response. We can do more. We need to work out a way in which we can be sufficiently trusted in South-East Asia that we can play a role in dealing with the communications networks of the terrorists in the South-East Asian archipelago. There are basically, these days, rivers of open access to various parts of the archipelago for terrorists trained in the Philippines and elsewhere. That is not good enough. That cannot go on, particularly when we have a nation like Australia with the equipment and capacity to do something about those things. This will be all part of a very long debate, because this will go on for a very long time, I am afraid to say.</para>
<para>I would like to conclude where really we began. The Prime Minister drew attention to the remarkable words of Joe Frost, an extraordinary oration given by that young man to those in grief in the community in the church in Newcastle. He concluded:</para>

<para>âI too would like to support the motion moved by the Prime Minister and supported by the Leader of the Opposition and join with them in condemning in the strongest possible terms the tragic bombings in Bali on 1 October. These cowardly acts resulted in the deaths of 20 innocent people, four of whom, as we know, were Australian, and in over 100 people being injured. Three suicide bombers also died. I would like yet again, as I have done on a number of occasions, to extend my sympathy to the families and loved ones of all those who were killed and injured, and particularly to refer to the four Australian victims who have been identified and whose bodies, in three cases, have been returned to Australia and, in one case, will be returned I think during the next 24 hours: Colin and Fiona Zwolinski and Jennifer Williamson from Newcastle and Brendan Fitzgerald from Western Australia.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Picking up on something that the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister mentioned, I thought the response by our emergency services generally and by various government departments and agencies was simply outstanding on this occasion. Tragically, it has to be admitted that we have had a fair bit of practice at dealing with this sort of problem. Of course every time you hope that something is learned, and something clearly has been learned. The fact that we were able to get the 17 injured Australians who had been hospitalised evacuated within 24 hoursâit might have been less than 24 hoursâwas an extraordinary tribute to those who did that not only from my department but from Defence and other government agencies.</para>
<para>I am glad that we were also able to assist those of other nationalities where necessary and have them evacuated to hospitals. I think it is only appropriate that, as we did, we offered that service to all of those who were injured, not just to the Australiansâalthough, of course, the Australians are our highest priority and always will be. As I say, I think the response this time was simply outstanding, but it was also most impressive on the part of the Indonesian emergency services, and they deserve a substantial tribute as well.</para>
<para>The Australian Federal Police are now working with the Indonesians in a project led by the Indonesians to try to identify those who were responsible for this atrocity. As at this moment, I think there are about 41 AFP officers deployed to Bali, and they are focusing on investigations, liaison on operational support, forensics, protection and security, and intelligence. I will be going to Indonesia tomorrowâfirst to Bali and then subsequently to Jakartaâto talk further with the Indonesian government, as I have done on other occasions, about counter-terrorism and in particular to thank them for the very positive response by Indonesian authorities to the Bali attacks. It will be an opportunity not only to review what we are doing together with the Indonesians, in particular the cooperation between our police and intelligence agencies and those of other countries in the region, but also to look to see whether there is not more we can constructively do.</para>
<para>Let me conclude on a point that the Leader of the Opposition raised and which I think constantly has to be made: we must understand what the motives of these terrorists really are. To make a similar point but in slightly different words, these people are motivated by a desire to destroy the established structure of governments in Islamic countries, to tear down, in the case of Indonesia, Indonesian democracy and to destroy elements of modernity in Indonesia and replace them with an Islamic tyranny of the kind we saw in Afghanistan under the Taliban. That is what drives these people. It has driven them in Indonesia not just in recent years but for a couple of centuries. Since independence, under the flag of Darul Islam or, now, Jemaah Islamiah, a tiny minority of people have been determined to create a fundamentalist Islamic society in Indonesia by destroying elements of modernity and links with the West. For example, attacking the tourist industry in a tourist haven like Bali has, if I may say so, the potential to be quite an effective part of a strategy to undermine the Indonesian economy and, in turn, the Indonesian government.</para>
<para>I think we need to understand that when we are dealing with this. We are dealing, in a country of 220 million people, with a few thousand individuals. The terrorist enemy does not represent great chunks of Indonesia; it is a tiny number of fanatics. It is very difficult to track them all down and get into every nook and cranny in a country of that size in order to counter terrorism. We work very closely with the Indonesians to do that. Obviously, as was demonstrated on 1 October, more needs to be done. Of course the war against these terrorists is not over. It has been going on for a long time and it will go on for a long time into the future, but we have to be absolutely determined and united in our fight against these people and make sure that, to the best of our abilities as foreigners, we empower the moderate Indonesians to assist in the fight against these extremists and that we do not in any way allow differences to come between us. We have to work together with the Indonesian government. As the Prime Minister said, these bombings have brought us close together.</para>
<para>This was a tragic event. I feel very passionately and very deeply for those families that were so grievously affected on 1 October. Having seen it all on 12 October 2002 and for it to be repeated is very hard for everybody but particularly for those families. Our hearts go out to them all.</para>

<para>âI would like to join with the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Minister for Foreign Affairs in sharing the feeling of outrage and sorrow at the loss of life and the injuries caused by the terrorist bombings in Bali. On top of the attacks last week, I know that Australians have not forgotten the attacks of 12 October 2002. It is not surprising that Australians take these attacks personallyâof course because of the terrible loss of life but also because the targets could so easily have been us, our family members or our friends. We can all picture ourselves sitting at those tables on the beach sharing the company of friends.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Like the other speakers, I regard this terrorist bombing as an attack on Australiaâs special relationship with the Balinese people. I am sure all of us who have been to Bali know what that means. They are a caring, peaceful, friendly people who make a great impression on so many foreign visitors to their island. For many Australians, Bali is still their only experience of a foreign culture. Many Balinese families rely on tourism, and they have lost so much because of these attacks. Their financial and physical security has been destroyed by terrorists with whom they have no connection. I think we can all identify with the feelings of a Balinese restaurant worker or artist waiting for work or a sale and wondering how they will feed their families now that the tourists have gone.</para>
<para>As with the other speakers, I would also like to pay tribute to the people who came to the aid of the injured and traumatised after the attack. Australia can be justifiably proud of the way its hospital staff, Defence personnel, police and consular officials have responded to this attack. Many survivors have mentioned the care and efficiency with which they were treated, and I have no doubt the police will do everything possible to bring the perpetrators to justice.</para>
<para>I hope that the people directly affected by this latest attack can, with time, overcome their fears and that those with physical and emotional injuries will fully recover. It is easy to say that the Australian and Balinese communities have survived these attacks, despite the terrible loss of life and livelihood. The reality is that the damage done by these terrorists takes a long time to heal.</para>
<para>Three images from this most recent attack on Bali will stay with me for a long time. The first image is that of charred wooden chairs rolling in the surf, the second is the X-ray of a patientâs chest flecked with shrapnel and the third, and probably the most ongoing, is the courageous smiles on the faces of the survivors arriving at the John Hunter Hospital in Newcastleâdemonstrating, once again, that wonderful Australian trait of refusing to be intimidated and never losing our sense of humour, no matter what horrors we face.</para>
<para>We must make sure that we learn whatever lessons we can from Bali, London, Madrid and New York and that young people, in particular, are not exposed to inflammatory material at school. This must be given a high priority by governments around the world, and I know that in our own case it will be. We must make sure that students in our schools and colleges are not being exposed to extremism. This, of course, has to extend to making sure that we teach understanding, tolerance and civic responsibility and that, in so doing, we do not ostracise any mainstream community because of some perceived connection with extremism.</para>
<para>I would also like to express my condolences to the people affected by the two terrible natural disasters that have occurred in recent days. The scale of the damage done by the earthquake in Pakistan and by Hurricane Stan in Central America is beyond our comprehension. The loss of life is enormous. The people left injured or homeless now of course need extensive international aid and will be relying on not only the generosity of governments but also the generosity of individuals. I have no doubt that the generosity of Australians will be there for everyoneâthat we will show our support for the Pakistani people and those in the surrounding countries and also for the people in Central America whose suffering is so great at this time.</para>

</talker>
<para>âI join in the comments of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and others before me on this condolence motion. In 1989 an earthquake shook Newcastle and brought the town to its knees. People thought that neither the area nor its people would ever recover from such an event, but they didâthey rebuilt the community and their resolve was stronger than ever before.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is true that the things that unite us are greater than the things that divide us. The bombings that took place on Saturday, 1 October at approximately 7.30 pm Bali time in Kuta and at Jimbaran Bay again shook Newcastle and, again, have tested the resolve and spirit of the Hunter communities. Whilst the loss and suffering goes on for the sons and daughters of the Hunter, this senseless act has served to unite the people of the Hunter like never before. Our community is grieving that, of the four Australians killed in those attacks, three are sons and daughters from the Hunter. Jennifer Williamson leaves behind her husband, Bruce, who is recovering in a Singapore hospital, and Adam, Duncan and Megan. Colin and Fiona Zwolinski leave behind Isaac and Ben. I would not like to forget the loss of such a young life as that of young Brendan Fitzgerald from Busselton in Western Australia. Our deepest sympathies and prayers are with all of the families.</para>
<para>It is a blessing and a relief that only 17 Australians were injured and that all have been evacuated. What a tremendous job our RAAF and emergency services personnel have done in bringing home to the Hunter: Anthony and Maryanne Purkis; Eric and Jenny Pilar; Aleta Lederwasch; Nicholas and Jennifer Scott; Kim and Vicki Griffiths; Bruce Williamson, who, as I mentioned before, is in Singapore; and my friends Paul and Peni Anicich, who were also evacuated to Singapore where they remain in hospital.</para>
<para>Our office has been working closely with some of those affectedâin particular, the family and colleagues of Peni and Paul Anicich of Sparke Helmore Solicitors in Newcastle. I have just spoken to friends of Paul and Peni who are in Singapore and at their bedside, and I can report that Peni is now out of the intensive care unit and is recovering well. In fact, she has been able to be by Paulâs side in a wheelchair. Paul has a very long and hard battle ahead of him. We are informed that he has been making some great improvements and in the weeks ahead he should be out of the intensive care unit.</para>
<para>The Hunter connection was formed on the basis that these were friends whose children went to St Francis Xavier College in Hamilton. They decided as a unit to go on a surfing holiday to Bali. There are many stories of peopleâs near misses. Geoff Shannon from Tuncurry, whose family was packing up and finalising their holiday in Bali, decided to go to an ATM a couple of doors up from where the blast at the cafe went off. The police used the timing on his ATM slip to determine the time of the blast.</para>
<para>Out of every tragedy emerges a hero, and this one is no different. The toll would have been much higher if it were not for the efforts of a GP from the Hunter, Dr Adam Frost, who helped the Bali bombing victims and assisted in the coordination of the evacuations of the seriously injured. Dr Frost was alerted to the blasts when Kim and Vicki Griffiths managed to drag themselves back to the hotel where Dr Frost and his wife were staying. They had volunteered to chaperone the children who could not go out to the cafe for dinner that night. Dr Adam Frost has a lot to be proud of. My colleague the member for Newcastle and I listened to his son, Joseph, address the 1,200 gathered at the Sacred Heart Cathedral Memorial Service last Thursday night, where he outlined in a heartfelt address how he had been at the blast site. In typical Aussie humour, his friends had tormented and joked with him as he stood there in his undies because his board shorts had been blown offâbut that did not stop him from helping those around him. I will long remember the passionate words of Joseph Frost when he begged an answer to the question: why had this senseless crime happened to those whose only crime was to be out enjoying a meal with friends? The answer to that question is that the extremists hate us for what we are, not who we are. They hate everything we stand for, and everything we believe in as a free nation.</para>
<para>At a time when people are searching for answers, they turn to a god. Many religions share the same god: Christians, Jews, Catholics and Muslims alike. The god I know instructs us to have faith and instructs us to forgive. In fact, the <inline font-style="italic">Lordâs Prayer</inline> says, âForgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us.â The challenge for all of us at the moment is that our faith has been so sorely tested. Those extremists who commit these heinous, atrocious acts of murder in the name of God are clearly mistaken. As I said, it is at a time of a crisis like this that the Australian spirit comes through.</para>
<para>I thank the government for providing $1 million by way of assistance, including 150 cartons of medical consumables, to meet the immediate and longer term needs of blast victims and their communities in Bali. I thank the emergency medical evacuation teams, conducted by Defence and other government agencies, for the way that they were able to assist in getting our people out of Bali. It is fortunate, in a macabre way, that we had the benefit of the newly built hospital in Bali to treat the accident victims.</para>
<para>I would like to thank my office staff, in particular Michelle Moffat, who joined me in opening the doors on Sunday morning and Monday, after the reports of the Bali blasts, to help those in search of loved ones. We took hundreds of calls from people all over the region, most of whom we were able to help. I also thank local radio stations for broadcasting announcements of the help that was available to them. I would like to personally thank the Prime Minister, who took the time to call just to see if there was any more that could be done.</para>
<para>My office would also like to thank, in particular, Doug Foskett from DFAT and Annette Morris, the Second Secretary at the Australian Consulate in Singapore, for their ongoing assistance and advice. I, like everyone else, urge this government and other governments to track down those people responsible for these heinous crimes and bring them to justice.</para>

<para>âI also support the Prime Ministerâs condolence motion, extend my sympathy to the people affected by the 2002 Bali bombings and express my sorrow to those who suffered in the recent Bali bombings. For Newcastle, a truly close community, the most recent bombings have been a very heart-wrenching experience.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>On behalf of the people of Newcastle and my federal colleagues here, I express sincere condolences at the tragic loss of the lives of three of our citizensâColin Zwolinski, Fiona Zwolinski and Jennifer Williamsonâand at the injuries to seven of our families and the deep trauma experienced first-hand by many other people from our city. We also extend our condolences to the family of Brendan Fitzgerald and particularly regret that so many of our young people have been confronted by these terrible events at a time when their lives should be filled with carefree enjoyment, hope and idealism.</para>
<para>In the ceremonies held in Newcastle and in the comments made by many people who knew Jenny Williamson, the words that shone through are that she was a beautiful person in every way, a loving wife to Bruce, a devoted mother to Adam, Megan and Duncan and a generous woman who always gave her support to others. Jenny left a radiance wherever she went. Her courage and that of Bruce, her husband, stand as a tribute to them both.</para>
<para>The family of Colin Zwolinski want everyone here to know that Australia had done Colin proud. He had emigrated from the UK after his father died when he was 15, determined to make his fortune. Colin achieved the Australian dream: he became a successful entrepreneur, devoted to his mine-tunnelling business, constantly travelling and providing employment for many people. He was supported by a loving wife, Fiona, a Merewether girl whom he had met at the Beach Hotel. They had fallen in love, married and raised two wonderful sons, Ben and Isaac. Fiona was a nurse and a successful athlete.</para>
<para>The footpaths of Merewether will seem very empty today. In all, they were three people who lived their lives fully, with love and dedication to their families and generous commitment to their careers and to their community. They were each regarded with great affection and respect and will be sorely missed.</para>
<para>The Newcastle families have worked as one in many ways throughout this ordeal. They want this condolence motion to register their appreciation of the efforts of others, too numerous to all be named. However, they ask that mention be made of the following: the scores of Balinese people and hotel staff who assisted complete strangers to hospital and who gave unsolicited help to wounded Australians in the hours immediately following the bombings; the Balinese medical and nursing staff at clinics and hospitals in Kuta and Denpasar; the many doctors, nurses, police officers, diplomats, flight crews, Australian officials and contractors involved in the expert care, swift evacuation of wounded and stranded people to various hospitals and back to Australia and who provided ongoing assistance. Australia can be very proud of them all, including the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and its consulate and other staff for their professionalism and speedy support.</para>
<para>The Newcastle families particularly wish to mention Mr Brian Diamond, the Australian Vice Consul in Denpasar;Â  Mr David Ritchie, the Australian Ambassador in Jakarta; and Mr Miles Kupa, the Australian High Commissioner in Singapore. They also thank the Australian Federal Police officers and staff in Bali, Singapore, Darwin and Sydney who arranged for logistic and family assistance and liaison. They also thank the doctors and staff of International SOS who evacuated severely wounded people to Singapore; the flight crews from RAAF Base Richmond No. 36 Squadron and crews and medical staff from RAAF Base Amberley, Health Services Wing; Qantas and their staff for undertaking the evacuations from Bali back to Sydney; the surgeons and other medical and nursing staff at Royal Darwin Hospital, particularly Dr Len Notaras; the staff at Singapore General Hospital and Mount Elizabeth Hospital, Singapore, particularly Dr Susan Lim; the staff at John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle; and the staff at the Prince of Wales Hospital, Randwick.</para>
<para>The Newcastle families also thank Centrelink counselling staff and the federal Minister for Health and Ageing, Mr Tony Abbott, for his on-the-ground support when it counted. Tony, your genuine effort,Â  reassurance, comfort and quiet influence will always be remembered and appreciated. They also thank Clare Martin, the Northern Territoryâs Chief Minister, and her ministers; my colleague the member for Paterson, Mr Baldwin, and his staff; our Lord Mayor of Newcastle, Councillor John Tate; and the Newcastle community. They also wish to thank the Catholic Schools Office of Newcastle and the principals and the staff of the local Newcastle primary and high schools whose students were affected. Finally, thanks to Dr Adam Frost of Newcastle, who played a vital role in the care and coordination of the treatment and evacuation of the Australians who were wounded. I also wish to acknowledge the willing and compassionate assistance of my staff, particularly Mr Ben Farrell, and the many people who so readily offered their support and assistance through our office.</para>
<para>There are many unsung heroes in this event, and I personally thank the Australian personnel who liaised constantly with my office, providing the assurance that every effort was being made and ensuring that every request was responded to. I also express my appreciation to the Newcastle community for their continued support to the victims, their families and loved ones. They are an example of everything that is great about this country.</para>
<para>In talking to our affected families, they made some pertinent comments that should be shared here. In spite of their painful experience, they are proud to be Novocastrians and they are proud to be Australians. They will be forever grateful for the public infrastructure that mobilised so quickly to assist them, even when they were in another country, Indonesia. They now fully appreciate how fortunate we are to belong to this country. They value more highly than ever their own personal relationships as well as the relationships that strengthen our community, our nation and our region.</para>
<para>Today is a day when we all should reflect on how we can keep our communities strong by working together to foster unity, security, peace and harmony so that we may continue to enjoy the peace, the freedom, the satisfaction and the joy that any Australian life should forever contain.</para>

<para>âI guess each of us expresses this in a slightly different way, but I think the point the foreign minister was making was that banning an organisation does not automatically mean that acts carried out by that organisation in the past will not be carried out in the future, and I am sure that is what the Minister for Foreign Affairs was saying. I do not believe that statements such as that will in any way prevent a strong case being put by the minister when he goes there, and he will put that strong case. A lot of analysis coming out of Indonesia is suggesting thatâprecisely because JI is a rather amorphous organisation. The Leader of the Opposition would be aware what the expression âJemaah Islamiahâ means. It is not, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs has said, like the Liberal Party or the Labor Party; it does not have a precisely defined membership and it is a rather more shadowy organisation than the two organisations that the Leader of the Opposition and I have the great privilegeâin a parliamentary context, anywayâof leading.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Let me simply say that anything that can be done by this government to persuade the Indonesian government to ban JI will be done. I think it would be good if JI were banned, and I will continue to put that view to the President. The minister will be going to Indonesia tomorrow and he will put that view; but, at the end of the day, the collective action of all the resources of the Indonesian Republic are needed to fight terrorism. A legal ban is part of that, but it should not be assumed that, having achieved a legal ban, you automatically reduce the possibility of another attack. That is what the foreign minister was saying and I agree with him.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Deakin for his question. I can inform him that, since 1996, some 770,000 Australian workplace agreements have been signed. I can inform him that people who have Australian workplace agreements are on average 13 per cent better off than people on equivalent collective agreements. For the managerial sector, the figure is 19 per cent and for the non-managerial sector the figure is five per cent, making an average of 13 per cent. It is interesting to note what the Leader of the Opposition had to say yesterday when being interviewed by Laurie Oakesâand this is relevant to the debate in the Australian community about whether people will be worse off under the workplace relations reforms of the government. He said:</para>

<para class="block">He went on to say in answer to the next question that, by the time of the next election, there would be almost one million Australians under AWAs. The Leader of the Opposition says he does not like AWAs. The Leader of the Opposition says that he is going to strangle AWAs, but what he is going to do is strangle the extra conditions and remuneration that Australians receive under AWAs. Far from the government being the opponent of higher living standards, it is the Leader of the Opposition who wants to cut the wages of a million Australians. He is the person who is attacking the living standards of average Australians.</para>

<para>âMy question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that the Ombudsman has described the Comrie report as the most damning he has ever released and that Mr Comrie identifies a direct link between the conduct of the departmental officers and the flawed culture within the immigration department? Prime Minister, after nine long years, arenât your ministers directly responsible for the culture of the immigration department? Given that the immigration department monitors people leaving and entering Australia, why does the Prime Minister allow this critical national security role to be overseen by Senator Vanstone, given her proven track record of failure?</para>

<para>âI am aware of the conclusions of the Comrie report and I am also aware of the comments made by the Ombudsman. Neither reflects well on the circumstances surrounding Ms Alvarez. I have already indicated, on behalf of the government, that she is owed an apology. She has received it and other matters are the subject of discussion between the government and her legal representatives. Let me say that, in the wake of the Palmer inquiry concerning Cornelia Rau, very, very significant changes have been made in the immigration department and there is an acknowledgement of the need for a changed attitude in relation to these things. I point out to the Leader of the Oppositionâand I do so in the context of him once being a member of a government which championed the propositionâthat over the years discretions previously in the hands of ministers of immigration have been taken away and given to departmental officials. In fact, it was an instrument of immigration policy under the previous government that that should occur.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The point I am making is simply that the Leader of the Opposition cannot have it both ways: he cannot champion a proposition that says that discretion and authority should be taken from the minister and be given to the department and, when that discretion is exercised wrongly, inappropriately, carelessly or indifferently, then turn around and say that direct personal responsibility should be shared by the minister. It is one thing to sheet home personal responsibility when the exercise of a discretion was discharged by the minister; it is entirely another thing to do so when the legal authority to exercise a discretion is under the immigration regulations legislation vested in the hands of officers of the department of immigration.</para>

<para>âI thank the honourable member for Paterson for his question. Can I say what a moving speech he made on the condolence motion earlier, and I thank him very much and very sincerely for it. The member asked me about the economic advantages of labour market reforms. Australia has now had more than 10 years of uninterrupted economic growth. Unlike other major developed economies around the world such as the United States, Japan, France, Germany or South-East Asia, which have all been through recessionsâin some cases more than one recessionâAustraliaâs economy has been continually growing over the last 10 years. That is a result of serious economic reform like balancing the budget, serious economic reform like paying back Labor Party debt, serious economic reform like abolishing wholesale sales tax and replacing it with the GST, serious economic reform like cutting income tax rates and increasing thresholds, serious economic reform like cutting company tax and halving capital gains tax, and serious economic reform of Australiaâs waterfront. If we want to continue to enjoy the benefits of economic growth and higher productivity in this country, this country needs another round of industrial relations reform and, again, it will be the coalition government that leads it.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Leader of the Opposition is on record as saying that there is nothing left in industrial relations. He says the industrial relations lemon has been squeezed dry. Well, there is a lemon in this debate and it is not industrial relations reform. It is the Leader of the Opposition, who parades himself as a front man for the ACTU, saying the industrial relations lemon has been squeezed dry.

I thank the ACTU.

<para>As I have said to this House before, when I opened the campaign for the Liberal Party in the electorate of Lindsay in the last election, I said the proudest boast that I could make to the people of Western Sydney was to say that we had delivered to them a quadrella, the likes of which a Labor government could never have boasted: higher employment, lower interest rates, lower taxation and improved job opportunities for their children. Indeed, the list goes on: under our government 1.7 million new jobs have been created, inflation has averaged just 2Â½ per cent a year, home loan interest rates are at historically low levels, the real wages of Australians have risen by 14.9 per cent over the last 9Â½ years, average household incomes in Australia have grown by 20.7 per cent in real terms over the period 1994 to 2003 and the real income of low- and middle-income households has increased by a proportionately greater amountâthat is, 22 per cent. No government has delivered better benefits to working Australians than has this government. We have done it over the last 9Â½ years and we will do it over the years ahead under this new workplace relations system.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Dobell for his question. I inform him and the House that on Sunday the Prime Minister and I announced the further details to move towards a new national system of industrial relations for Australiaâa system designed for this century to replace a system which was designed at the beginning of the last century to deal with the problems of the 1890s in Australia. These announcements give the lie to some of the claims that have been made in the misleading campaign by the union movement and by members opposite.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In the face of those misleading claims I can confirm a number of facts. Fact No. 1: long service leave in awards will be protected. Fact No. 2: penalty rates, overtime and meal breaks will be protected. Fact No. 3: employees on state awards and agreements will get to keep their current terms and conditions under the new federal system. Fact No. 4: the government will provide greater support and advice to employees to enable them to protect their rights and entitlements. Fact No. 5: it will continue to be unlawful to force an employee from an existing award or agreement onto a new workplace agreement against their will. In the face of the claims of the union movement, these are the facts set out in the details released on Sunday.</para>
<para>For the first time ever at the federal level, minimum terms and conditions of employees will be guaranteed in legislation through the new fair pay and conditions standard. If workers on awards currently have conditions which are more generous than the fair pay and conditions standard then they will keep those more generous conditions. Similarly, if their award conditions are less generous than the new standard then the more generous of the two will apply. Contrary to the claims made by the ACTU and the union movement, on the basis of these details, which will be provided in the legislation, employees can be confident about their existing conditions whilst being in a position to negotiate new agreements to their advantage.</para>
<para>What this shows is that this side of the parliament has a plan for the future of Australia. All we hear from the other side is complaint. The rhetoric we hear today from the Leader of the Opposition and others is the same rhetoric that we heard in 1996, saying that the sky will fall in. Yet, as the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have pointed out, since 1996 we have seen 1.7 million extra jobs created in Australia and more than a 14 per cent increase in real wages. Part of the reason for that is the reforms we made in 1996 to address the challenges that Australia was facing. We must continue to address the challenges that Australia now faces. That is why we are going to do this: it is for the good of Australians and their families.</para>

<para>âI think the Leader of the Opposition needs a new tactics committee after that little performance. When the Leader of the Opposition sat on this side of the House, those of us who were around then remember that he literally boasted about how much he had suppressed the wages of working Australians. He boasted about it. He stood up here with the former Prime Minister and the former Treasurer, and they boasted about how they had suppressed the wage increases of average Australians. Real wages rose by a miserable two per cent in the 13 years they were in government; they have risen by 14.9 per cent in the 9Â½ years we have been in government. I think the Australian people know very well who the better friend of the Australian worker really is.</para>

<para>âI thank the honourable member for Greenway for her question. The Australia Bureau of Statistics today released housing finance figures for the month of August which showed that, overall, the value of commitments fell one per cent. This is the fifth fall in the value of housing finance commitments in the last six months. The overall fall has been led by a decline in investment housing commitments, which fell 4.3 per cent and are now 7.9 per cent lower over the year. But, in relation to owner-occupied commitments, they rose in August and are 14Â½ per cent higher over the year. What this shows is that first home buyers are now re-entering the market. The publication today shows that the number of loans to first home buyers was the highest since July 2002: 10,281. That is 43 per cent above the trough of 2003 and substantially higher than the long-run average of 8,800 loans to first home buyers per month. What this shows is that first home buyers are now coming back into the market, that the number of first home buyers that took out commitments in August was greater than the long-term average.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This is a consequence of the fact that prices have stabilised. The house price series for the national average shows that, after almost doubling in the previous five years, house prices over the last 12 to 18 months have seen hardly any change whatsoever. I think members of the House would welcome the fact that first home buyers are returning to the market now that some of the heat has been taken out of the market. What that means for the economy is that the economy is not getting the push from housing and construction that it was in 2002-03. It is necessary for other areas of the economy to take up the slack. In particular, business investment is very strong. It is led particularly by the mining industry but it is strong generally, as we see business take up a lot of the borrowing and investment in this country to drive the capacity of the economy into the future with strong business investment.</para>

Isnât it the case that, had the governmentâs submissions on the minimum wage been agreed to by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, the minimum wage would have suffered a 1.55 per cent cut in real terms, not the 12 per cent increase in real terms the Prime Minister claims as his own?

<para>âI thank the honourable member for Page for his question. He, like all members who represent regional Australia, realises how inappropriate some of the union driven industrial awards have been in the past. They have denied the flexibility that so many country businesses need to be able to perform effectively and to be able to offer the most flexible opportunities available to their own work force. WorkChoices will greatly benefit the seven million Australians who live outside the capital cities and provide new opportunities for business to offer the kind of flexibility in the workplace that can give them the opportunities to grow and expand. WorkChoices in particular will provide benefits for those regional businesses where there is a need to employ extra people, because in almost every instance they will no longer have the deterrent of the unfair dismissal laws. The unfair dismissal laws have provided a real burden to small business, which has been forced to defend what are sometimes unreasonable cases.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The proposed reforms will certainly provide employees with the flexibility to bargain with their employer directly on any issue that affects their working life. These reforms have been welcomed by many of the organisations that represent people in rural areas, particularly the National Farmers Federation. They spoke out and said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">NFF believes workplace relations reform is one part of the solution to the burning issues of labour shortages in Australian agriculture.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In fact, their only criticism was their concern that there will be some farm businesses that will not be able to take advantage of these new industrial relations laws, and they are grateful for the five-year phase-in period that has been offered.</para>
<para>This example clearly shows that you have got industry groups clamouring to be involved in this process because they know it will deliver real benefits to people right across the workplace. WorkChoices will move Australia towards a simpler and fairer national system of workplace relations where rights are enshrined in the law, where minimum conditions are legislated for the first time and where there is a real choice as to whether people join or do not join a union. There will be the kind of flexibility that is so essential to take account of the particular needs of regional businesses in country towns, where the atmosphere and the working arrangements need to be different from those that are imposed quite often by unions from their capital city offices. This offers real opportunities for regional Australia to grow, expand and take advantage of the opportunities that are provided.</para>

But I will point out to the member for Perth the provisions of our policy, which make it perfectly clear that somebody entering an Australian workplace agreement must given the fair pay and conditions standard. In the absence of any express modification or elimination of matters such as penalty rates and loadings, the default provision of the policy applies, which means the award provision of pay.

<para>âI thank the honourable member for Makin for her question and for her interest. The earthquake was mentioned in the House earlier this afternoon by the Prime Minister. It measured 7.6 on the Richter scale. It occurred at about 1.50 pm Australian Eastern Standard Time on Saturday. The epicentre of it was 100 kilometres north of the Pakistani capital of Islamabad.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This was the first of up to 19 aftershocks which measured up to 6.3 on the Richter scale and which occurred 40 minutes after the initial earthquake. So you can see how substantial the impact of this earthquake was. As the Prime Minister said already, between 18,000 and 30,000 people are believed to have been killed and more than four million people are estimated to be homeless. At this stage, national and international assessment reports are still being compiled, but as you can see from the television footage there has been substantial structural damage to buildings, including the collapse of many residential buildings, trapping the occupants. The Pakistani government has reported that whole villages have been destroyed.</para>
<para>As the Prime Minister said, the government has already committed $5Â½ million in immediate support of the people affected by the earthquake, and that money will go towards organisations that can deliver medical care, shelter and food relief as well as water. During the course of tomorrow, our time, the United Nations is expected to announce what is called in United Nations parlance a âflash appealâ. Based on the assessment of that flash appeal and how the money is specifically going to be spentâand by tomorrow we will obviously have the benefit of another 24 hours of assessment of the damage and the needsâwe will have the option of making a substantial contribution to that flash appeal.</para>
<para>The Australian government offers its condolences to the families of the victims. I am glad to say that there are no reports at this stage from my department, our High Commission in Islamabad or the other Australian missions in affected countries of Australians having been either killed or injured but we continue to monitor that situation.</para>

<para>âIt also provides in relation to some specified mattersâand the member for Capricornia drew attention to themâthat unless there is a specific modification the existing provisions of the relevant award will apply. I do not know, without seeing this particular agreement, about its other provisions. I do not know any of the background. I know that the member for Capricornia would never, of her own volition, seek to mislead the Houseâalthough I might not be so charitable about some of the members of the tactics committee on the other side.

<para>âParticularly since the first Bali bombing, as we now call it, on 12 October 2002, the government have been working very closely with the Indonesian government in the area of counter-terrorism. We have cooperated very closely at the police level. The Australian Federal Police work very closely with POLRI, the Indonesian police. We have good cooperation between our intelligence agencies. Obviously we do not say an enormous amount about that publicly, as members of the House who are particularly familiar with these issues would know only too well. There has been excellent political cooperation between Australia and Indonesia on counter-terrorism but, as we were reminded on 1 October this year, there is still some way to go before the problem of terrorism has been defeated. This is a problem that in the case of Indonesia, as I said earlier in the debate on the motion moved by the Prime Minister, goes back many years.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Since 2004 we have committed more than $250 million in total in the region, including more than $50 million for Indonesia to boost counter-terrorist capabilities in areas like law enforcement and, importantly, border control, because there is some focus in public debate on the maritime borders between Indonesia and the Philippines and between the Philippines and Malaysia. Quite a considerable amount of effort has been put into that, and more will be put into it. We have also been assisting with transport security.</para>
<para>I mentioned earlier that I will be visiting Bali and Jakarta this week, and obviously I will be taking that opportunity to urge the Indonesian government, as we have done on many occasions, to proscribe and constrain the activities of terrorist groups in Indonesia, including Jemaah Islamiah. But as I have made clear in the past, and I make clear again, honourable members should not think that proscribing one or more of these organisations, Jemaah Islamiah in particular, will solve the problem of terrorism. It will not. This is a campaign, if I can call it that, which is going to require an enormous dedication of resourcesâfirst and foremost by Indonesia and countries like Australia but also by the United States, which plays a very big role in the counter-terrorist effort in Indonesia. We can play a significant role as well.</para>
<para>I want to conclude by saying that, while I am in Jakarta, it will be a good opportunity for us to have discussions about reinforcing the coordination of counter-terrorism activities in Indonesia. Again, that is a matter for them, not us. We should not be too robust, particularly publicly, in telling other countries what to do in situations like this. But some thought is being given to improving the coordination of counter-terrorist activities in Indonesia, and obviously we look forward to discussions about that.</para>
<para>I will also once more emphasise Australiaâs very strong view that sentence remissions for convicted terroristsânot those who have been sentenced to death or who have been given life sentences, as there are no remissions for themâin particular for Abu Bakar Bashir but also for others, under Indonesian law as a result of presidential decree are something we would like to see changed. We would like to see the Indonesian government and the Indonesian President repeal that decree. They have been doing some work on that, but it is another point that I will emphasise while I am there.</para>

I would like to take this opportunity to thank Emergency Management Australia, an agency that works within my department, for its role in activating the overseas mass casualty plan and for liaising closely with other agencies to coordinate the emergency flights for medical personnel to deliver urgently needed equipment to Indonesia and in the tragic identification and removal of blast shrapnel victims from Indonesia.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The responses to the second Bali bombing and to those before thatâthe attacks on the Marriott Hotel and our Australian embassy, and in Bali in 2002âhave highlighted the need for very close working relationships between Australian and Indonesian authorities. That regional engagement has always been a very important plank of our work as regards Australiaâs counter-terrorism framework. Terrorist organisations are increasingly transient. Their membership and support networks are spread across the world, particularly in our Asia-Pacific region. Integration and cooperation of law enforcement agencies in which skills, experience and intelligence are shared is imperative to being able to mitigate the threat of terrorism in our region.</para>
<para>The Australian government are applying practical measures to implement security and safety arrangements for Australians. We have committed more than $100 million over five years to enhance regional counter-terrorism capabilities and to fight terrorism at its source. This has included the provision of criminal intelligence, collation and analytical capabilities, and technical expertise. We have also had enhanced language and cultural awareness training, which is helping to strengthen the relationship. The already close relationship between the Australian Federal Police and the Indonesian national police has further bolstered the emergence of intelligence and operational linkages, which we have achieved in the new Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation. These developments and the professional way in which our agencies have worked together are a very clear demonstration to the public that the government see national security as their first responsibility, and there have been very effective measures implemented to ensure that that is addressed.</para>

<para>âI thank the honourable member for his question. I do not accept the premise implicit or explicit in his question, which is that the United States-Australia free trade agreement in any way weakens our quarantine or biosecurity regime. It does not do any such thing, and the government is always committed toâand will continue to beâprotecting our borders in regard to quarantine and to maintaining the health and security of our food standards. Consequently, I think that the memberâs fears or concerns related to be US-Australia free trade agreement are misplaced.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Solomon for his question and I appreciate that this is an issue of considerable concern in his electorate and elsewhere. I should point out to the House that a new influenza pandemic is not a certaintyâit is not even a probabilityâbut it is a distinct possibility and that is why the government has so far invested some $170 million in ensuring that Australia is as well prepared as possible. Australia has just about the worldâs largest per capita antiviral stockpile. The government is stockpiling some 50 million syringes and 40 million surgical masks. We have purchased an additional 303 ventilator machines for distribution to public hospitals. In consultation with the states and territories, we have produced a national management plan for pandemic influenza and this will be updated before the end of the year on the basis of expert and public input.</para>

<para>The National Health and Medical Research Council has recently announced that $7.5 million will be made available for urgent research into the prevention, treatment and management of avian flu. Last week, assisted by a $5 million government grant, CSL began live trials of a candidate pandemic vaccine with mass production possible in the new year. People are entitled to be concerned about the consequences of any possible pandemic. I can assure them that all practical precautions will be considered and that so far all feasible precautions have been taken by the Howard government.</para>

<para class="block">to enable the Parliament and the Australian community, to fully understand the impact the Governmentâs extreme industrial relations changes will have on Australian workers and their families.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">We demand that these measures be tabled in this parliament now. A hundred million dollars worth of government advertising is out there. The government is shamelessly spending taxpayersâ dollars on advertising Liberal Party propaganda and misleading the public as to what its true intentions are. We are entitled, given that it put a statement down in May on this subject, to have before us today in this parliament this legislationâbut it is not here. It is not here because it has wandered around in a state of confusion and fear, coming to understand what exactly it is it has started to do to the Australian people.</para>
<para>We know that this legislation is going to be enormously damaging to young Australians, it is going to be enormously damaging to Australian families, it is going to be enormously damaging to people who have limited skills and it is going to be enormously damaging to family life in this country. The Prime Minister is always fond of talking about barbecue stoppers. He loves that expression, âThis is a barbecue stopper; that is a barbecue stopper.â I can tell you this, Mr Speaker and Mr Prime Minister: if this legislation goes through as foreshadowed in the $100 million worth of propaganda, that weekend barbecue for the family will well and truly stop as fathers and mothers find themselves obliged to go into the workplace at no penalty rates by employers who demand their attendance for that weekend at any particular notice the employer cares to give.</para>
<para>The Prime Minister had sound words to say about the contribution of Australian workers to the prosperous situation this nation has found itself in over the last 15 years. Well he might do so. It is they who have built Australia, it is they who have contributed to the wealth and it is they who are raising the next generations. Why must they take a hit in the jaw like this? When all they have done is to provide for the prosperity of this nation, why must they take a smacking like the government is proposing for them to take in the legislation it has foreshadowed in this place?</para>
<para>If, as Cardinal Pell said, the situation is so good, why make a mess of it? What is the necessity for this legislation? What crisis is confronted in the workplace that obliges this to happen? The truth is that we have in this country just about the most flexible work force in the OECD. We know this: for full-time employees, we have the hardest-working work force in the OECD. An Australian full-time worker works on average something like 1,840 hours a year. The average Japanese worker works about 1,600 hours a year and one from the Netherlandsâand we all admire the working capacities of the Dutchâworks about 1,400 hours a year. Even in the United States the figure is 30 hours a year less than us. The Australian work force is a massively hard-working work force.</para>
<para>It is not, overall, a particularly well-paid work force, although there are extremities where it is. It is a work force, however, which has over the years come to trust the fact that it has an independent umpire. It trusts the fact that an independent umpire presides regularly over a consideration of minimum wages and the fact that those minimum wages then translate through the award system into a series of rates for the rest of the work force which guarantee them, if they are obliged by their employer to work overtime, if they are obliged by their employer to go in for difficult shifts, if they are obliged by their employer to work on public holidays, that they will obtain through that processâprotected by those awards and by that independent umpireâa capacity to earn sufficient to sustain their mortgages, to pay the new large petrol bills that they are being obliged to pay and to sustain family life often in difficult and marginal circumstances.</para>
<para>The Prime Minister has had virtually nothing to do with the establishment of that regime except to have worked the last 10 years to do his level best to undermine it. He has always been hostile to the fact that there has been that degree of protection for the Australian workers. He has done his best to undermine it over the course of the last 10 years, and to some extent he has succeeded, but he has not succeeded absolutely. The Prime Minister has indicated already that this legislation will complete a process that he had Peter Reith desperately try to begin only a few years ago by gutting the umpire completely and by allowing all those conditions to be traded away which people, particularly in the outer suburbs of our capital cities with massive mortgages to confront, utilise explicitly to ensure they can pay their mortgages and by making a work force in this country, particularly in areas where it is not highly skilled and those skills in high demand, a cowed work forceâa work force without dignity and a work force without self-respect.</para>
<para>None of this was foreshadowed in the last election campaign. All of it arrives in this chamber some timeâand we say it should be right now, which is the purpose of this motionâbecause the government believes that, having control of the Senate, it has a licence for extremity and it will not pass up the opportunity. There would have been a bit of surprise in the workplace in the course of the last election campaign if the Prime Minister had foreshadowed some of the measures here. I loathe the way the Australian people are routinely deceived by the use of language by this government. I loathe the way it characterises this act of gross unfairness in the industrial relations system as WorkChoices. It is Orwellian, as the honourable member has said.</para>
<para>I see those faces in the governmentâs $100 million worth of propaganda, shining and laughing over their own demise. It looks like something out of old Soviet propagandaâthe happy workers of tractor factory No. 454 discussing the wonderful conditions that comrade Stalin has extended to them. This is the sort of standard that we are seeing in the government advertising today at a cost of $100 million which could have been so usefully spent on skills or security or something else. We will not know the extent to which this abuse is about to take place until we finally get the legislation; but, by golly, they are giving us a pretty fair impression of what is coming. And what is coming is the use of individual contracts to destroy the substance by which ordinary Australians live, persist in family life and do the things that we have indicated.</para>
<para>Again, there is the abuse of words. The Prime Minister stands there saying, âLook, there is a default clause here. If there is no mention in the individual contract of things like penalty rates, holiday rates or whatever, then you default to the awards.â Suffice it to say that under this regime the awards are certainly not going to be kept up to date and the IRC is not going to have a capacity to do that. It will be there as a default clause to the awards as they exist now. We saw what that meant in the Tancred Fresh AWA. A single sentence moves out the entire default clauseâgone. One sentence in an AWA gone and the full force of the elimination of all those penalties comes into play. We are not going to have a bar of this. We are going to oppose this right down the line. What we want now is for this legislation to be here. You have been chatting about it since last May, but it is still not here. You are spending the taxpayersâ dollars, but it is still not here. The taxpayers, as I said, ought to be able to see those dollars spent on something useful to them, not propagandise them so that you can pick their pockets and encourage others to do so too. This is a relevant motion to pass. We should have these bills before us now.</para>

The opposition has not even asked all the questions which were available to it this afternoon, yet we have the Leader of the Opposition getting up here and saying, âBring forward the legislation.â The reality is that we have a plan to deal with the changes that Australia will face over the coming years and decades.

<para>âbut, in the meantime, yesterday we released a detailed document for the advantage and information of Australians. It sets out, in some 68 pages, the details of what will be in the legislation. That is what we have done. We have put this before the Australian people so that they can see the details of what is proposed and can make up their minds about the type of workplace relations they want in the future. There is a stark choice here between a government that are prepared to make careful further incremental reform to the Australian workplace relations system to ensure that we meet the challenges facing Australia in the future and an opposition that took to the last election a policy which would have seen the winding back of workplace reform in Australia to not only undo changes that this government put in place to the benefit of Australians but undo some of the changes that were started by the Hawke and Keating governments.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The Labor opposition, as the mouthpiece of the union movement in Australia, were against the workplace reform that occurred in 1993 when Paul Keating and Laurie Brereton brought forward changes that were opposed by the union movement in this country. They opposed reform again in 1996, and we have seen the benefit of those changes. As Access Economics said in a recent report, had we not made the changes to the workplace relations system in 1996, which were opposed tooth and nail by the Labor Party, the unemployment rate in this country would be closer to eight per cent rather than the five per cent it is. That is the reality of what the Labor Party is about. I remind anybody listening to this debate that the rhetoric about the sky falling, which we hear again from the Leader of the Opposition and the labour movement, is precisely the same rhetoric we heard in 1996. What has happened since 1996? There have been 1.7 million extra jobs created in Australia. We have something like seven million Australiansâa historic levelâin full-time work and, for the first time in the history of this country, over 10 million Australians working. Beyond the fact that we have 1.7 million extra jobs in this country, we have seenâand the opposition do not like thisâa 14.9 per cent increase in real wages.</para>
<para>Part of the reason for that is that this government have been prepared to take the hard decisions and make careful reform where it is needed so that this country can be set up for the future. That is the choice that the Australian people took at the last election, when they decided to return this government, because they knew that we were prepared to make the reforms which are in the best interests of Australians and their families rather than elect a craven opposition that wants to run away from reform, even some of the reforms put in place by Paul Keating. Speaking of Paul Keating, he was the one who told a meeting of the Australian Institute of Company Directors in 1993 that his reforms were about ultimately replacing the old, rigid award system in Australia with new workplace agreementsâto have agreements as the basis of industrial relations in Australia rather than the award system. What we are doing is bringing to fruition the very thing that Paul Keatingâwho at least was a reformer when he was in government; something that this opposition is notâsaid was desirable as the future outcome of changes to industrial relations in this country.</para>
<para>This is just a stunt from the opposition because they have nothing else to say and cannot even ask their quota of questions on the first day that parliament resumes. These changes have protections for Australian workers built into them. The opposition have been caught flat-footed on some of the changes. Where workers are on awards or in the future will be employed on awards and have protections under those awardsâsuch as the nurses in Victoria, who are in receipt of 26 weeks of long-service leave, which is about double the community standardâthey will retain those entitlements. That is in the protections here. With penalty rates, overtime and meal breaks, workers of Australia will keep what they have in their agreements today unless they decide that they want to change those agreements.</para>
<para>There is the protection that nobody who is in existing employment on some other form of industrial instrument can be forced to take an individual Australian workplace agreement. But the reality is that the Leader of the Opposition wants to strangle those Australian workplace agreements. There have been 770,000 Australian workplace agreements entered into, delivering higher wages to people in both managerial and non-managerial positions. The Leader of the Opposition is saying to more than half a million Australians, âIf I get into government, I will drive your wages down because I donât believe you should have the right and flexibility to make the choice in your workplace agreements.â That is the reality. This is a party which would lower the wages of over half a million Australians by strangling the workplace agreements that people have at present.</para>
<para>I ask the question: what is wrong with ordinary Australians being able to enter into agreements with their employees and having the flexibility to do that? What is wrong with that? There is nothing wrong with that, and Australians are increasingly using the flexibility that is available to them to enter into agreements in a way in which the opposition are opposed. This is a political campaign by the union movement, who are struggling for their very relevance in Australia today.</para>
<para>In Australia today, 17 per cent of workers in the private sector are members of unions. About 70 per cent of the Labor opposition are members of unions. Their representation in no way represents the Australians that they purport to represent in this place. Australians in droves have been moving away from awards. A bit over a decade ago, some 70 per cent of Australians were employed under awards in the federal system; today, it is 20 per cent. Why have people been moving away from the rigid award systemâthe award system that was designed in the first part of last century to deal with the problems of the 1890s? It is because they get better outcomes, better terms, better conditions and better pay under agreementsâand that is what we want to see more of.</para>
<para>What the opposition cannot run away from is that, under this government, we have seen the creation of 1.7 million extra jobs; we have seen real wages go up by 14.9 per cent; and we have seen industrial disputation go down. As the Prime Minister keeps saying, this government is the best friend that Australian workers have ever had. The reality is that the opposition no longer represent ordinary Australians; they just do the bidding of union bosses who are trying to maintain some relevance, while the trends are going entirely against them. This motion is nothing more than a stunt.</para>

<para>âOn 26 May this year, the Prime Minister delivered a ministerial statement on his extreme industrial relations changes. Yesterday, 9 Octoberânearly five months laterâbusiness got an exclusive briefing. If there was ever an example of how this tilts the lever further away from employees to employers, that was itâan exclusive briefing. And still we have not seen the governmentâs legislation. The government have still not been able to produce their legislation so that the Australian community can fully understand the extreme nature of the changes.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The government are trying to con the Australian public, with a sop here, a con there and a mean and tricky explanation here that somehow what they announced on 26 May is now different. The Australian public need to very clearly understand that these framework changes are precisely the same. They are extreme; they are unfair and they are divisive.</para>
<para>They are an attack upon the living standards of working Australian families; they are an attack upon the living standards of middle Australia; they are an attack upon wages; and they are an attack upon entitlements and conditions. They seek to reduce wages and to reduce or remove entitlements and conditions. In economic terms, this is simply an attempt to shift the total factor income proportion of the economy further from the wages sector to the profit sector. That is what this is all about. That is why the Prime Minister refuses in this place, as he did again today, to give a guarantee that no individual Australian will be worse off as a result of his changes.</para>
<para>He gave that guarantee in 1996. In 1996, he had Peter Reith, alsatians and balaclavas. He gave what he described as an ironclad, rock solid guarantee that no individual Australian employee would be worse off. He will not give one now. He will not give that guarantee now because he knows the public policy objective of these proposals is to reduce wages and reduce or remove conditions and entitlements. So you do not find that guarantee given by the Prime Minister in this House or in the community. And you certainly do not find any mention of a guarantee in the million-dollar advertising done by the government in advance of the legislation. In those adverts there is no mention of a guarantee that no individual Australian will be worse off as a consequence of the changes.</para>
<para>Why would the government need to spend millions and millions of dollars persuading the Australian community that these proposals were somehow good for them? Doesnât that give you the answer to the lie that these proposals are somehow good for the economy, good for the nation and good for Australians? Why would the government seek to abuse millions of taxpayersâ funds in a Liberal political party advertising campaign?</para>
<para>The government says: âMy guarantee is my record. Look at my record.â The Prime Minister says that his record, over a long 9Â½ years in office, is that real wages have increased by 14 per cent and that the minimum wage has increased by 12 per cent in real terms. The minimum wage has increased by 12 per cent in real terms despite the Prime Ministerâs best efforts, not because of them.</para>
<para>If the Australian Industrial Relations Commission had agreed to the submissions made by the Howard government since it came to office, making its first submission to the AIRC on a minimum wage case in 1997, those on the minimum wage would be $50 a week or $2,600 a year worse off. That would have been the consequence of the Howard governmentâs submissions to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. That is why the Prime Minister wants to take an axe to the minimum wage and the Industrial Relations Commission. He wants to get through the back door what he has not been able to get through the front door. He has opposed the minimum wage increases. If the Howard government had had its way since 1997, the minimum wage would not have increased by 12 per cent in real terms; it would have been reduced by 1.55 per cent in real terms. The effect of the minimum wage is that, ultimately, it affects everyone; it cascades up. It is not just the nearly two million employees who are entirely dependent upon it; it is also people higher up the scale.</para>
<para>You then come to entitlements and the great con. The great mean and tricky con of the Prime Minister is to say: âLook, weâve got 20 allowable matters. Weâre knocking off four. Weâre knocking off long service leave, jury service, notice of termination and superannuation. Weâre preserving four as legislated minimums, but we are leaving 12 floating, and they will be okay. Public holidays, rest breaks, bonuses, annual leave loadings, penalty rates, and shift and overtime loadings will be fine because you have to have a single line in the agreement to knock them off.â</para>
<para>Paragraph 14 of the AWA referred to in question time today states: âWages: Your rate of pay which is inclusive of leave loading, all allowances, penalties and public holiday pay is $17.20 per hour.â That is all it takes to knock off the default clause. The effect of that clause in the Tancred case is that, when you lose all those entitlements, the best you can do is to get 16c an hour and the worst you can do is to lose $1,916.72âso much for protecting conditions and entitlements. It is simply an attack upon the living standards of working Australians and families, slashing wages, slashing conditionsâ<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

I represent this area and was present at the open day for about 1Â½ hours. My colleagues the member for Canberra and Senator Lundy were also there. The staff did a terrific job, and my feeling was that people present at the open day greatly appreciated all their work.

However, given the statement made earlier today by the Leader of the Opposition, I want to confine myself to one brief additional personal explanation over and above those which he covered. Rather than detail the individual misrepresentations, I will content myself with saying that all but two minor references to me in <inline font-style="italic">The Diaries</inline> are untrue. The particular point of personal explanation that I wish to make is that most, if not all, of those untrue statements were known by Melbourne University Press to be untrue before and when they chose to publish them.</para>

I checked with the Clerk and I have checked <inline font-style="italic">House of Representatives</inline> <inline font-style="italic">Practice</inline>. I think you were referring to the ruling that Speaker Andrew made in relation to a statement that somebody makes when they want to quote from a newspaper. I understand that the ruling has varied since Speaker Andrew made his statement that he would not impose the strict application. However, I am reassured to know that standing order 100 stands.

</motion>
<para class="block">The question of an avian bird flu pandemic is being much debated in the Australian community. It is a matter which the opposition are deeply concerned about. We understand that should a pandemic emerge it could be of such significance for the nation that generally a bipartisan approach would need to be extended to deal with the crisis. The general approach of the opposition has been to extend bipartisanship on this matter but we believe it is incumbent upon us, given such a serious issue, to raise in this parliament and in the public domain things that could be done by the Australian government to prepare Australia to meet this challenge that remain undone.</para>
<para>We do not want to raise alarm unnecessarily. Of course we know that the potential for a pandemic is there but as yet the conditions for a pandemic have not been satisfied. There are three major criteria for a pandemic, and two have been satisfied: lack of immunity amongst the population and the ability of the disease to cause serious illness. Tragically, we have seen a number of deaths overseas particularly amongst people who have dealt closely with birds or amongst people who have cared for those who have become unwell and have become infected with the bird flu virus. The third condition for a pandemic, easy human-to-human transmission, has not been satisfied. There is no evidence yet that the virus has mutated so that it is capable of airborne human-to-human transmission. Should the virus mutate so that it is capable of airborne human-to-human transmission, then the three conditions for a pandemic would be satisfied and a concern would arise across the globe, particularly in this day and age of regular international travel, as to the way in which the virus would move from country to country and population to population.</para>
<para>The best containment measures are obviously measures at the source in the countries of origin should a pandemic emergeâand my colleague the shadow minister for foreign affairs will talk about better preparing to use those measures. Should the virus be in a population overseas including travelling Australians, the issue arises of what can be done to contain the virus outside Australia. We have had some experience with this, most notably with SARS, where various mechanisms, including thermal imaging at airports to identify those with fevers, were used as a quarantine measure to try to establish who could be moving into the Australian community while carrying the virus. In an extreme situation the possibility arises of border closures. That would obviously be an extreme situation but it is something that needs to be contemplated as part of our pandemic planning.</para>
<para>If the virus managed to get loose in the Australian community and if it were capable of airborne human-to-human transmission, there are a number of measures which would need to be put in place. I want to speak about some of the better preparations we think the Australian government should engage in at that point. To its credit, the Australian governmentâthe Howard governmentâhas invested in a national medicines stockpile including antiviral medications and it is supporting efforts to generate a vaccine. We need to remember that the antivirals in the national medicines stockpile, particularly Tammiflu, are believed to have a prophylactic effect should a pandemic occur. They would be given to people, particularly health workers and emergency services workers, to try to prevent those who are caring for people and dealing with the emergency from catching the virus. Whilst there have been hopeful signs for the development of a vaccine, it is impossible to finally deal with the virus and get an effective vaccine until the virus mutates. It stands to reason that you cannot with some certainty know that a vaccine that you are developing now will be capable of meeting the challenge of a virus that is mutating.</para>
<para>So we support the efforts that the Howard government has taken to date in those two areas, but we are concerned that in this area, like so many other areas, the Howard government is overly sensitive to criticism and is unable to accept constructive suggestions when they come along. On the question of being overly sensitive to criticism, it has been of major concern to me that one of the things that the Howard government has done in the recent period is to try to silence sources of criticism, most particularly the Parliamentary Library. Late last year the Parliamentary Library prepared a research paper on the possibility of an infectious disease outbreak, and the paper pointed to some major deficiencies in the capacity of our system to respond to a national infectious disease emergency. It concluded that âthe system would workâ but said there was a general sense that Australian hospitals were underprepared and that there were limited resources, inadequate training exercises and a lack of integration.</para>
<para>You would have thought that a government trying to prepare for a potential national emergency would seize upon this criticism as constructive criticism and use it to spur greater and better efforts to prepare, but that was not the approach taken by the Howard government. Apparently this very thoughtful analysis was too on-target for their liking. We understand that the Department of Health and Ageing, and allegedly the departmental secretary, contacted the head of the Department of Parliamentary Services and then this paper, which we believe was genuine constructive criticism, disappeared from the libraryâs web site and went off to be, as they say in the classics, âreviewedâ. We do not think that that is an appropriate response to criticism. We believe criticism in this area should be taken on board as constructive criticism about better efforts.</para>
<para>Around 10 days ago I published on behalf of the opposition a paper about domestic preparedness which is entitled <inline font-style="italic">The preparedness of the Australian healthcare system for an avian flu pandemic: no room for complacency</inline>. I sent that paper to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Unsurprisingly, I have heard nothing back. But my purpose today is to urge the minister for health and the Howard government more generally to look at the suggestions within that paper, which are genuinely put in a constructive fashion, about what ought to be done to better prepare domestically. Of the things that we advocate in that paper, I highlight the following: should a pandemic break out in Australia, the number of people requiring medical assistance would be astronomical. It is estimated that an avian flu pandemic could lead to millions of Australians contracting the disease, with 2.6 million people seeking medical attention, 58,000 hospitalisations and 13,000 deaths. These figures are not mine; these figures are the department of healthâs and are believed by many to be conservative.</para>
<para>In that circumstance, where people are swamping hospitals looking for medical attention, our overstretched public hospitals would obviously be under even more pressure. There are preliminary plans to divide our hospital system into influenza hospitals and non-influenza hospitals, which would be treating ordinary emergency cases, because you obviously cannot mix the patient loads and have people who have presented for other illnesses becoming infected with the virus. We suggest that in this kind of area there needs to be better exploration of the ability to cooperate with the private hospital system to help with the load, and we seriously recommend that to the Howard government.</para>
<para>We also seriously recommend to the Howard government that they lift the veil of secrecy about the national medicine stockpile and ensure that Australians understand now what is in the stockpile; why Tamiflu was purchased rather than Relenza, the Australian antiviral invention; and who will get access to antivirals in an emergency. Australians are good-hearted people not given to panic, but they will better accept strictures if they understand them now rather than in the heat of an emergency.</para>
<para>Finally, we believe that more resources need to flow to our public hospitals, most particularly to enable them to test their capacity to cope with a pandemic emergency. The Howard government is asking them to test their systems, but our public hospitals have been underresourced for many a long year by the Howard government, not only in money but also in terms of the trained medical work force. We believe additional resources could assist them with preparing now to meet this emergency, should it occur. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âIndeed, as the member for Lalor has alluded to, we do stand on the precipice of a potential bird flu pandemic in our region, and it is only proper that we take every step possible to prepare for that potential eventuality. I think we have gone a little bit too far, though, in the 20-page paper prepared by the member for Lalor which we have here, which has a key focus on saying that the government has been overly sensitive to criticism, that it has not been open enough regarding the stockpile and that it has not been properly integrating many of the elements of the response. Nothing could be further from the truth, and I would like to take a moment to outline first of all that level of integration, which in fact is very high and very far from what the member for Lalor has referred to as being predominantly a series of diagrams and communication plans and little more.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In fact, we have four exceptional organisations and structures that are working to provide the information that is changing virtually on a daily basis regarding bird flu. The first of these is the Communicable Diseases Network Australia, which has experts nationwide who are under the direction of Robert Hall. We have NIPAC, the National Influenza Pandemic Action Committee, which was set up by the Chief Medical Officer in 2003. Right out in the community there is a group called ASPREN, who are randomly sampling and surveying for some of the sentinel signs of outbreaks, and that is auspiced by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. Lastly, right in Melbourne there is the World Health Organisation Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza. That has been very well funded, with $24 million over four years from this federal government.</para>
<para>Each of those four groups plays a distinct role. The information is fed through to the Australian Health Disaster Management Policy Committee, which is represented by the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Health Officer from every state, as well as experts in Defence, Emergency Management Australia, the Department of Health and Ageing and the CDNA, to which I have already referred. There is also a separate body that analyses the evidence as it arrives, as it is uncovered, and determines what phase we are at in the pandemic. That group is the expert advisory group, and its job is pivotal. That is the key issue that the member for Lalor has ignored: any response to the pandemic will be a staged and sequenced one.</para>
<para>There is a certain amount of political relativism in the words of the member for Lalor, because it is almost as if she has taken what the government has done, added a bit onto it and said, âItâd be good if you could do one bit more. Itâd be good if you could buy us a little bit more in the stockpile. Itâd be good if you could have a bit more money for the public hospital system to be prepared. Itâd be good to have a bit more communication.â That is very much a relativist approach to the problem. You almost have the sense that, were she in another country, she would be holding up what Australia is doing right now and saying, âWe should be doing this,â because the truth of the matter is that Australia is one of the leading countries in the world in its response. It has one of the highest per capita expenditures on stockpiling and antivirals for the population.</para>
<para>The point that I think the member for Lalor is missingâwhile I forgive her for that, certainly those who write her material should not miss itâis that a sequenced approach means, first of all, you have got an initial phase where certain groups will have access to antivirals. It moves from that initial containment phase to a maintenance phase. So, in your early phase, you have treatment of family members of those who are infected, those who are working in the health facilities, those who are working for AQISâthose who are on the front line. When you move to the maintenance phase, there is a different model in place, and that is where you are trying to maintain services while you bring the pandemic under control. At that time, water workers, sewage workers, telecommunications workers, emergency service workers and those who produce the vaccine are treated with the antivirals or the vaccine, when available. Once again, I think it is a little bit superficial for the member to Lalor to stand up and say, âTell me exactly who will get this vaccine. Who will get the antivirals?â It is not quite as simple as that; it is a staged and sequenced approach.</para>
<para>What I found a bit more interesting was the criticism of the amount of public information that is available in the awareness campaign. That too is done at the appropriate time. There are panels of experts, who I have already alluded to, who make those decisions. There are very good reasons for not mounting a massive public information campaign on bird flu today. There are very good reasons that we start with the first responders. In what I think was a very pre-emptive and intelligent move, DVDs were sent to 35,000 first responders. They had information in them on exactly how to respond, how to prepare and how to identify and on basic anti-infection practices in clinics and the workplace. Now the member for Lalor has come forward and saidâand I would like to quote her hereââThis DVD lacked information for GPs on how to train receptionists in infection control. It lacked information on how to maintain supplies of protective equipment.â After a six-year medical degree and four years training in general practice and having been in a career in general practice, I think most GPs are quite capable of working out how to transmit information to their staff, how to preserve cold chain for vaccines and how to store essential pharmaceuticals and other equipment. Again, I find the criticisms a little thin.</para>
<para>The comments about antivirals, based on the fact that Australia has about the highest per capita expenditure in the world on these, also look a little dubious. There is a lot of good news here. To pick out one or two issuesâlike why we bought one drug and not the other, and why we donât throw open the doors and show the world what we have in our stockpileâwill not make a difference to responding to this pandemic. To say that we should have bought more or less Relenza escapes the basic fact that we bought both. It was the experts who came forward and recommended what to buy and how much, and they recommended we buy more Tamiflu. Whether it is the means of delivery, the efficacy or the cost, that was done by a panel of experts. The member for Lalor has come forward without any attribution. Put your experts up, tell us your views, show us the cost and efficacy dataâyou have access to experts. But no: no attribution, just a vague claim that touches on a nationalistic sense that we should have bought an Australian product. The answer is that GSK next year will in fact start producing Relenza itself. The fact is CSL has started the first trials in a vaccine. Most importantly of all, Australia, like many other countries, is already preparing that regulatory dossier for regulatory agenciesâin our case, the TGAâto make sure that we have approved as much as possible of the new potential vaccine for bird flu to minimise the odds that it is held up at the regulatory stage. There will be only the last-minute elements of getting the antigens right.</para>
<para>Most breathtaking of all is the claim in this 20-page paper put together by the member for Lalor that we have failed to engage the private sector in the bird flu response. I would be the first to say that that is a very important partnership to build. It would also be a very important topic for the IDC, looking at that very matter, to comment upon. But it strikes me as extraordinary that the other side of the chamber, which has rarely shown a warm embrace of the private sector playing a key role in welfare provision, which has railed at every point against private health insurance, and which, apart from the Medicare Gold experiment of the last election, has barely mentioned private health and private providers of health, to suddenly turn around and say, âWhere are your partnerships with the private sector?â I found that very thin and very unconvincing.</para>
<para>But there is something even more unconvincing about the words of the member for Lalor: that familiar echo back to âthere isnât enough resourcingââthe sense that, every time you have to do something new, you turn to the public teat of provision and say, âWhereâs the money?â instead of, âHow can we do it with the resources we have?â Let me give you Queensland as an example: a 70 per cent increase in hospital funding over 10 years in the face of a 125 per cent gross government revenue increase over a similar period of time. Make no mistake: they have got the money. I think it is very superficial to turn to the federal government every time you have to order an extra aspro and say, âShow us the money.â Everyone who has worked in a hospital knows that they have been working on their emergency plans. To say that resources prevent you from doing that is extraordinarily narrow. In her next breath, the member for Lalor said that two-thirds of the 82 public hospitals have trialled their plans. One or two might have complained that it might throw them off their game or distract them from their workâthat is what a flu pandemic will also do. So it is only proper that these things are tested. It will take additional resources: state governments have them.</para>
<para>The solutions are to speed up vaccine productionâtick, that is happening; to move quickly and be positioned well, if and when it arrivesâtick, that is happening; and to quarantine areas if and when this bird flu surfacesâtick, those areas have been put in place by the appropriate committees. In addition, we need to boost health systems and make sure that they are primed for actionâand I have confidence that state governments have the commitment to do that and are working in partnership with the federal government to ensure that occurs.</para>

</talker>
<para>âFrom time to time a country confronts national security challenges that require long-term analysis, long-term planning and long-term preparation. One of those challenges is avian influenza, a virus which, in the view of the WHO, has the potential to mutate into a global flu pandemic with potentially a massive loss of life, a massive impact on the global economy and a massive impact on global, regional and national security.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Let us remember that this avian influenza virus first rose to international consciousness back in 1997, when it hit Hong Kong. Since then, it has spread to some 10 countries and has resulted in some 60 deaths. That is why governments around the world in recent years have been preparing for this contingency. We have had a debate here so far today about the level of domestic preparedness; I do not propose to go there. But I am concerned about preparedness within the region and what we as a country are doing specifically to assist countries in the region to deal with this challenge.</para>
<para>What has alarmed me is that, in the seven years since avian influenza first emerged into the international debate through the Hong Kong experience, we have had statements like the following from the foreign minister. Last year, 2004, Mr Downer said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Well, Iâm not a scientist but, I suppose itâs conceivable it could come to Australia but I think thatâs, frankly, a little unlikely and I havenât been advised that thereâs a real threat that it will come to Australia.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Mr Downer then said last year, on the question of what Australia could do to help the region to prepare for avian influenza:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Australia will do what it can, which might not be very much, but we will certainly do what we can to try and help our regional partners address this issue.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">On the economic impact to Australia, Foreign Minister Downer last year said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Well itâs obviously got the potential to haveâit has had some effect on our chicken trade.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I am not quite sure what he was referring to there, but he went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We are not importing chickens from a number of countries in the region that have been affected by bird flu or avian flu, but other than that it shouldnât have any effect, we hope it wonât. I just make this pointâwe hope very much that it wonât have any effect on tourism and business in Asia more generally.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The House needs to be aware of the fact that the foreign minister made these statements some seven years after avian influenza first arrived with a bang in Hong Kong. Until very recently, all we have seen from the foreign minister is complacency, complacency, complacency. This is not just my view. Todayâs <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline>, for example, says:</para>
<quote>
<para>The Office of National Assessments and the Department of Foreign Affairs should have been buzzing with bird flu warnings for the past five to eight years.</para>
<para>If that buzz wasnât there, they were not doing their jobs as principal advisers to the Government on international matters which affect Australia.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Further:</para>
<quote>
<para>If the ONA and Downerâs own department were in fact doing their jobs, it is difficult to understand why the Governmentâs response was not more comprehensive.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> goes on specifically to criticise the complacency reflected in Mr Downerâs public statements as recently as last year. I am concerned equally about the level of complacencyâtinged, I have to say, with arroganceâcontained in the remarks just made in this debate by the member for Bowman concerning domestic preparedness. Let us wait and see how prepared we are. That is why earlier this year I decided that we had to raise the alarm regarding what Australia was doing within the region. In the address-in-reply debate earlier this year, in March, I said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The region needs ... a comprehensive regional strategy to deal with the threat posed by avian flu. The strategy would include as a priority an urgent audit of the capacity of our neighbours in the region to detect, investigate, diagnose and report the virus. The strategy should demonstrate a detailed approach on how to manage and control any outbreak once detected.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Given the potential harm to Australiaâs health and economic security, the government must demonstrate leadership within the regionâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">and I specifically called upon the government to deploy the AusAID budget accordingly. Still, nothing much happened. That is why in early September I released a five-point action plan for the region, calling for the following: firstly, a regional ministerial forum on avian influenza to do the sorts of things I was outlining in March; secondly, on top of that, to use our aid budget to assist in the establishment of a comprehensive community-level surveillance network across South-East Asia to enable us to spot this disease when it first emergesâbecause speed is of the essence; thirdly, to provide greater diagnostics assistance through the excellent capacity we have at present at the Animal Health Laboratory at Geelong; fourthly, to contribute to and to establish a regional compensation fund to assist chicken farmers to destroy their flocks; and, fifthly, consular agreements with affected countries. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThe H5N1 strain of influenza, so named after its surface proteins, has been circulating in poultry in China for about a decade. Since 2004 it has travelled through East Asian poultry farms, killing millions of birds. Up to the end of September 2005, it had infected 116 people, 60 of whom died. It is feared that a descendant of this strain could cause a lethal new flu pandemic that would be prevalent worldwide. The current strain is hard for humans to catch and almost impossible for one human to pass to another. The virus is like a key, its shape formed by surface proteins, and it needs to unlock the receptors on the surface of human cells in order to enter and infect them. H5N1 is currently a very poorly matched key to our cell receptors.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The flu viruses belong to a large group; each possesses a mere eight genes in a stingle strand of RNA. All 16 known groups of flu virus originate in waterbirds, in particular ducks and gulls, and the virus causes only a mild illness in these birds. This leaves the birds free to move around and spread the virus. In chickens, which are forest birds and not natural hosts, it causes a moderate disease and can mutate into a more severe lethal strain, such as H5N1. This is of great concern, as in 1997 it was observed for the first time that H5N1 flu was capable of infecting humans. It was found in 18 people, six of whom died. All the poultry in Hong Kong was destroyed to stop the spread, but it continued to circulate, especially in China. Further human cases were reported in China in 2003 and in Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand in early 2004. Mass culling of poultry stopped outbreaks by March 2004, by which time 23 people had died. The virus persisted, howeverâmost probably in ducksâand an outbreak started again in the summer of 2004. By mid-April 2005 it had caused 51 deaths, all in Thailand and Vietnam.</para>
<para>In 1918 a virulent strain of flu appeared in humans which killed 50 million people in a matter of a few months. It is thought that the common cause of death was acute respiratory distress syndrome, triggered by a severe inflammatory reaction called a cytokine storm. This virus was resurrected in a US lab last week in the hope that research will lead to vaccines and antivirals against other flu strains. Researchers have found that the 1918 virus was a bird flu that went pandemic without combining with a human flu. They have also found the mutations it needed to go pandemic, and it is important to note that H5N1 has developed some of these mutations at this time.</para>
<para>Other pandemics have included the Asian flu of 1957, which caused between one million and four million deaths, and the Hong Kong flu of 1968, which caused between one million and two million deaths. Both these viruses were human viruses which had combined with the bird flu viruses, rendering them unrecognisable to the human immune system.</para>
<para>The threat of the H5N1 strain is very real and should not be underestimated. It could evolve into a potential pandemic by recombining with human flu, especially as most people in the Far East are not vaccinated against ordinary flu strains. It could also develop the necessary mutations without recombining, as the strain is constantly evolving. It is suspected that the strain may be acquiring mutations making it more dangerous to mammals, because it is jumping back and forth between ducks and pigs.</para>
<para>The government takes this threat very seriously. It has provided funding of $156.8 million, which is being put towards: developing a vaccineâcurrently in trialâof which Australia has been committed 50 million doses, capable of vaccinating Australiaâs population; stockpiling 3.8 million courses of Oseltamivir, the most effective antiviral availableâa stockpile that will be increased if necessary; providing two million P2 masks and other personal protective equipment; provision of quarantine officers at airports and sea ports; the development of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza; provision of information kits for health professionals and information to industry; assistance to Indonesia to help combat H5N1; and improvement of our national infectious disease surveillance system. We are a world leader in our planning for an H5N1 pandemic.</para>

</motion>
<para class="block">Last Saturday I was a guest at a function organised by the fledging Free Speech Central West group in Orange. It was attended by well over 100 people, including Senator Bob Brown; Senior Counsel Brian Walters, who is author of <inline font-style="italic">Slapping on the Writs</inline>; and journalist and broadcaster Mike Carlton. They were people from all walks of life with one common concern: the threats we are facing to our cherished free speech. These people and many, many more are concerned not only with the subject of this motion and the current court case involving 20 Tasmanian individuals and organisations being sued by the Gunns company but also with other issues such as the detention and removal from Australia of US peace activist Scott Parkin, certain aspects of proposed antiterror laws, the threatened jailing of two Australian journalists for not divulging the source of leaked material, attempted restriction of political activity, defunding of lobby groups that criticise government and the lack of a bill of rights. These are all issues that go to the heart of free speech. More specifically, this motion is a response to the so-called Gunns 20 action, where Gunns Ltd are seeking more than $6Â½ million damages for an alleged conspiracy to damage their timber business, which involves highly controversial practices including clear-felling and woodchipping of old-growth forests, large-scale burning of valuable residues, massive replantings and poison baiting of wildlife.</para>
<para>Strategic lawsuits against public participation, or SLAPP writs, are most often designed to intimidate and scare off community protest and dry up the resolve and financial resources of those who dare to speak out. Unless we have specific legislation in place, there is a real danger that individuals and legitimate community lobby groups could be tied up in hugely expensive litigation that is essentially aimed at deflating their energy and financial resources. It must be remembered that, while the companies taking such action can claim tax relief for most of their legal expenses, the community activist and defendant cannot.</para>
<para>Some US states have moved to outlaw such suits at an early stage, but a protection of public participation law introduced in British Columbia in 2001 has since been repealed by a so-called Liberal government. Most SLAPP suits are brought over environmental issues. In Australia we have had similar instances in the cases of Crown Casino in Melbourne and the Oyster Point marina development near World Heritage listed Hinchinbrook Island in Queensland, where concerned community members were sued for daring to challenge developments. Brian Waltersâs book has detailed these Australian cases. He is also representing defendants in the Gunns case. Even if successfully defended, after months if not years the suits could cost hundreds of thousands of dollarsâmoney the defendants just do not have.</para>
<para>One of the Gunns defendants, Dr Peter Pullinger, a dentist and former member of the party liberals for forests, faces a crippling $784,000 suit for campaigning for the protection of the Tarkine wilderness from logging. The recent agreement between the Commonwealth and Tasmanian governments will dramatically reduce logging of old-growth forests in the Tarkine. That change of heart was the result of public action led by people like Peter Pullinger, yet the lawsuit remains in place as he expends money and anxiety to defend himself, like the other defendants.</para>
<para>While no-one should deny the legitimate right to seek justifiable restoration of reputation and damages, every step should be taken to defend free speech. To this end, given the absence of a bill of rights and with protection of free speech largely covered by state law, I have written to every state premier and attorney-general, urging the states to establish legal procedures which would allow unsoundly based SLAPP suits to be dismissed by a court at an early stage in proceedings.</para>
<para>Since I lodged this motion in March, several states have moved to introduce standard defamation laws which will prohibit some corporations from suing for defamation. However, the federal Attorney-General is considering amendments to federal laws to allow the practice to continue. But even the state amendments are weak, with exemptions for corporations employing fewer than 10âa condition that allows any development company, for example, to structure its staffing in such a way as to still take advantage of the SLAPP suit option. However, the states have at least put in place an intergovernmental agreement to ensure that future changes remain uniform. Changes will be requiredâparticularly the striking out of vexatious SLAPP lawsuits. Another required step is the need for constitutional recognition of freedom of speech by way of a referendum. Without that safeguard, free speech remains at the mercy of courts and politicians. I commend the motion to the House.</para>

<para>âObviously, the aim of the honourable member for Calare in moving this particular motion is to highlight the importance of free speech in a democratic society. Most reasonable people in a democratic society believe that people do have the right to express their views, regardless of the economic situation in which those people find themselves. I am aware of the phenomenon which has become known as SLAPP suits. In Australia, these have thankfully not become anywhere near as common as they are in the United States of America. The government does not have any particular evidence that these SLAPP suits are becoming so regular as to become a major problem in stifling community debate. Nobody accepts any abuse of the law. It really is important that, as a community, we continue to review the situation to make sure that it does not get out of hand.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In the United States there is a major problem where these frivolous suits are very much stifling public debate. In fact, one American web site, www.nj-landuselaw.com, notes that SLAPP suits are common and that the suits contrast with other forms of litigation in that, as the web site commentator says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... the SLAPP suit is brought not to resolve a problem, but to remove a controversy from the political arenaâwhere the developer may be losingâto the judicial arena where the âchillâ and expense may enable the developer to seize victory from defeat.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The web site commentator also points out:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Even though most of the suits are legally baseless and are eventually dismissed by the courts, the defendants often incur substantial legal expensesâsuch as court costs and attorney feesâin defending themselves.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The member for Calare is of the view that these legal attempts that we see in the United States to stifle debate are creeping into Australia in an ever-increasing way. I understand that there could well be only one major example that has been suggested as an Australian version of a SLAPP suitâthe issuing of several million dollars worth of writs by the Tasmanian logging and milling firm Gunns Ltd to a list of 20 people, including environmentalists, the Wilderness Society and Senator Bob Brown.</para>
<para>In the United States, figures suggest that around three-quarters of SLAPP suits eventually fail in the courts. Unfortunately, in that country the issuing of the writs is often enough to effectively stifle debate by squandering the resources of the defending organisation. In many cases this has seen substantial financial reserves entirely consumed. They also work to divert attention away from the public issue at hand and send a serious warning to others who may disagree with the corporation that they too could be sued.</para>
<para>It is important to make sure that SLAPP suits in Australia do not follow the same path as those in the United States. I do not think that the situation in Australia is at all grave. The government is obviously maintaining a close watch on the situation. Free speech is still an attribute in this country that we cherish and support, and it is a freedom that is very much embraced by the current federal government. Writs must be upheld as what they are: legitimate legal tools to protect legitimate business interests.</para>
<para>In some cases, businesses are left with no choice but to take legal action to safeguard against financial damage. It is one of the benefits of our court system that business operators have a genuine legal option available to them to protect their commercial interests when all else fails. I do not think that very many people in our community would oppose the fact that in a democratic society people do have access to the courts of the land to ensure that their legal rights are able to be protected. It is important to be very careful about SLAPP suits and to make sure that they do not consume the amount of resources that they consume in the United States, and that they do not distort legal proceedings in this country in the way that they have done in the United States.</para>
<para>I understand that the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General has been discussing ways to improve the range of mechanisms available to courts. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI support todayâs motion by the member for Calare. Even though most of the contribution of the member for Fisher was in support of the concerns that the member for Calare expressed, I refer him to a book, <inline font-style="italic">Slapping on the Writs</inline>, by Brian Walters QC. It details a number of issues dating back to the seventies where these sorts of issues have been raisedâthe use of defamation law on organisations or individuals by corporations. The member for Fisher made the point that Gunns is the only case where this has raised its head in Australia. That is not the case. I refer you to that publication.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Both the member for Calare and the member for Fisher spoke about freedom of speech. It is something that we should preserve within this nation. I have often used the phrase âthe world is run by those who turn upâ. In a democratic nation, within limits, we should, as individuals and groups, have the right to turn up and make a contribution in terms of policy and the various debates that take place. Obviously, there are cases where you have conflict, as is occurring in Tasmania at the momentâand it has occurred there in recent yearsâbut in other cases there have been various development issues, and views both pro and against. There is the example of the water debate in New South Wales and Queensland at the momentâon the border. It is not always about green groups versus other groups; it can be the other way around. Where we can, we must preserve the right of those individuals and groups to play their role in relation to the political process and the democratic process.</para>
<para>If we look at what has happened recently, and we look at the history of the United States in particular, we should take the current happenings on board as a warning to Australia. We must safeguard our position and make sure that we do not tie up in long, expensive litigation people who, in my view, have the right to make a contribution to the broader debate. Obviously, there are corporations. Some people have suggested that the law of defamation has been around since the Middle Ages. Corporations have not been. We are seeing a creeping in of the use of the law of defamation, which was put in place for right and proper reasons. We are in fact seeing a possible abuse of the legislation or the defamation law by corporations trying to outspend individuals or groups who might believe that what a corporation is doing is not completely appropriate.</para>
<para>When I was in the New South Wales state parliament, an issue similar to this was raised. I will not get into the detail of it, but a major bank was using its financial muscle to crush an individual in a court case. In the long run, the individual was found to be correct, after a very expensive âhow much can you spendâ operation. That individual won, but he took an enormous risk, even though he was right. There is a valid point to be made here. Being right does not mean that you actually win in terms of the law. There is the use of large amounts of money to protract cases, and a lot of cases run out for 10 to 15 years. The use of money can protract those cases. As I said, being right does not mean that you necessarily win. What money does is remove people from the scene in terms of their right to protest about various things that might be happening within the communityâwhether those are the development issues that arise from time to time or the current example that the member for Calare referred to.</para>
<para>The member for Fisher alluded to the US experience. I think that there has been something like an 87 per cent failure rate in SLAPP writs in the United States. A number of states over there are starting to outlaw them.</para>
<para>In conclusion, I urge the Attorney-Generalâit has been rumoured that the federal government is looking at putting in place legislation that enshrines the right to issue SLAPP writsâ<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI have become aware of the phenomenon described as SLAPP suits and I welcome the opportunity to make a few comments on the motion of the member for Calare. As I understand it, the government has no plans to introduce legislation to prohibit corporations from bringing actions against individuals, as is permitted under the general law. Nor is the government aware of any conclusive evidence that commercial enterprises in Australia are prone to launching proceedings to stifle community debate. The fact that there has been one caseâthe Gunns litigation, which has attracted significant media attentionâdoes not mean that there is a widespread problem in this area. The Federal Court already has a range of mechanisms available to it to deal with vexatious litigants. The Commonwealth has been consulting with the Federal Court about improvements to vexatious litigant provisions. As the member for Fisher alluded to, the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General has been discussing ways to improve the range of mechanisms available to state and territory courts to deal with vexatious proceedings.</para>

<para>The Australian government is committed to the protection of human rights and recognises that the protection and promotion of rights in Australia is best achieved through strong and robust democratic institutions such as an independent judiciary, responsible and accountable government, the rule of law, well-resourced and respected opposition parties and a free media. The Australian government believes, as I do, that the right to freedom of speech is a fundamental human right, but recognises that this right is subject to limitations that are reasonable and necessary in a free and democratic society. The framers of our constitution put great thought into the issue of rights. They consciously put their faith in the capacity of parliamentary democracy to protect individual rights.</para>
<para>As far as the background to the SLAPP suits is concerned, certainly such suits are much less frequent in Australia than in the United States. There are some well-known SLAPP suits in the UK, apparently known as the McLibel actions. I have already alluded to the issue of Gunns.</para>
<para>In terms of human rights protection in Australia, let me remind the House how human rights are protected in Australia in many ways. There is the separation of judicial power from executive and legislative power. There is responsible government, with a representative government that is democratically elected. There is an accountable public service: decisions of all public servants are generally available and the public service is apolitical. There is an administrative law system where the governmentâs administrative decisions are transparent and reviewable. There is a transparent legislative process: laws are made by the legislature; regulations are made under enactment and are disallowable. That is all fairly straightforward stuff. There is a fair and transparent criminal justice system. There is a constitutional right to freedom of religion and implied freedom of political communication. The High Court has given direction on this.</para>
<para>Other institutions that play a role include HREOC, the Ombudsman, the National Committee for Human Rights, the Australian Law Reform Commission and royal commissions. At the federal level laws protecting human rights include antidiscrimination laws, privacy laws, evidence laws, criminal laws and sentencing laws.</para>
<para>Freedom of speech itself is subject to limitations. Under international law, fundamental rights are not unqualified and may be restricted to preserve other human rights. For example, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights recognises these rights in accordance with the law. The Commonwealth Racial Discrimination Act 1975 prohibits racial vilification.</para>
<para>In all of these processes we can seeâand most people throughout the world, including people within our own country, would agreeâthat we have a healthy, robust and open democracy that does not exhibit the sorts of excesses that I suggest the member for Calareâs motion is alluding to. I am therefore quite confident that our existing system is coping well and that it will continue to do so in the future.</para>

<para>âI congratulate the member for Calare on raising this matter before the House. Speakers have referred to our robust parliamentary democracy. Whilst sometimes that is rhetorical, it will only remain a reality if parliamentarians act when matters that are appropriate to protect our freedoms of speech are brought to their attention and they bring these matters before the House, as the member for Calare has done.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is difficult to rely on the common law, established often a century or more ago in its principles, to take into account the values that we express under freedom of speech. It is certainly true that there is an implied constitutional right that protects aspects of political speech, but whether that goes so far as to provide a lawful defence in instances where the economic torts are alleged seems quite doubtful. These are issues that may need to be resolved, depending on the outcome of the Gunns litigation. If that litigation does proceed to judgment, and then through the appeals system, some of the issues that are most material to the concerns of this House will have to be resolved.</para>
<para>Let me make three quick points. Firstly, it is not merely the law of defamation that is a risk to a person in the position of the defendants in the Gunns case. That litigation gives fresh life to the old economic tortsâthe torts of conspiracy and various torts that relate to intention to harm the economic interests of corporations. If it is not a proper basis to defend those cases in the public interest that matters are being urged that go to issues of the natural environment, the need to protect our resources or the like, then there is a real risk not only that the tort of defamation will be used in SLAPP writs in the future but also that these economic torts will be usedâand the reach of those is quite profound, if one considers their potential ambit.</para>
<para>So there is not only the issue as to whether or not corporations should be able to sue for defamation, an issue where I join the member for Calare in urging the Attorney not to proceed with any suggestion that the federal parliament be invited to fill a gap that the states have quite properly left so that this kind of abuse does not occur. There is no plausible reason to permit corporations to pursue remedies in defamationânone whatsoever. It is a right that is perfectly legitimate for us as individuals to pursue to defend our reputations and to seek redress when that reputation is damaged. But to extend it to corporations is entirely in conflict with where we would wish to be as participants in an active democratic society.</para>
<para>The second point I want to make is that we need to revisit the question of tax deductibility. This was one of the matters referred to by the now Justice Sackville when he chaired the <inline font-style="italic">Access to Justice</inline> report, which he tendered to the Keating government. It was not then immediately proceeded with but certainly it does mean that, when it comes to a contest between citizen and large corporation, not only does the citizen have to pay the full cost of their legal defence but they face an opponent that can write off those costs against their tax liabilities. It is quite an unequal balance. There is no need for that tax deductibility.</para>
<para>The third point I want to make is that we have a whole range of areas, not only ones involving environmental issues but also issues such as asbestos, thalidomide, fears about toxins in food, genetic engineering and campaigns against whaling, where, if corporations pursue courses along the lines that Gunns has done, it will chill absolutely our capacity to participate in effective public debate, much to the public detriment. So there is a public interest in parliaments around Australia grabbing hold of this issue, grappling with it and trying to deal with it before we end up with the kind of situation that is said to be so prevalent in the United States. To say that this is less prevalent in Australia may be true, although those who read <inline font-style="italic">Slapping on the Writs</inline> by Brian Walters would realise that it is much more prevalent than many would suggest. Nonetheless, even if it is less prevalent now, now is the time to anticipate the harms and to commence parliamentary action across the parliaments of this countryâthe states, the territories and the Commonwealthâto prevent that harm becoming worse. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI am aware of the phenomenon that is the subject of this motion today that is colloquially described as a SLAPP, which I understand stands for âstrategic lawsuits against public participationâ, suit. But I am only aware of it because it is a phenomenon that is experienced in other countries, primarily the United States. I am not aware of it becoming a particular problem presently in Australia. Indeed, in listening to the speeches made by the member for Calare and the member for New England, they referred primarily to overseas examples when providing the parliament with examples of these so-called SLAPP suits.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The member for Calare has proposed a motion to the parliament today that calls for state and federal action to control the issuing of SLAPP suits. I can only assume that this move was triggered by the action that has been taken in the courts by Gunns Ltd in Tasmania. They seek damages against 20 individuals and groups who have allegedly conspired to damage their business. I do not wish to dwell on the specifics of that case, although it is unfortunate that, when the case has been mentioned in the parliament today, it has been mentioned in the context of being a SLAPP suit. I do not think that that is a judgment for this parliament to make. I do not think that we should assume that, when a business takes legal action, that legal action is designed just to silence its critics. It is possible that the business has legitimately suffered damages. In that case, it is perfectly entitled to protect its commercial interests through the courts, as current law provides.</para>
<para>I am not aware of many examples in Australia that warrant our rushing to legislate or to refer this matter to the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. This being the case, I question why the member for Calare is so concerned about this SLAPP phenomenon, when it has not really proved to be a problem in Australia at all. Should the Australian government and our counterparts in the states and territories rush to legislate and deal with problems that occur in other legal systems? I do not believe so.</para>
<para>I support the governmentâs stance on this matter. The government does not have any plans to introduce legislation that prohibits corporations from bringing actions against individuals, as permitted under the general lawânor should it, because there really is no reason for it. We are not in the same position as America, as has been discussed in this chamber by speakers earlier today. We do not need to legislate against this particular action.</para>
<para>There is no conclusive evidence that commercial enterprises in Australia are particularly prone to launch proceedings that stifle community debate. In fact, the only case that has received any substantial media attention has been discussed widely todayâthat is, the Gunns litigation. That one case does not mean we are dealing with a widespread problem. As I said before, I do not think that we should be rushing to judgment about that case anyway.</para>
<para>It is certainly true that, if you look at some elements of the Green movement, many of whom I would classify as extremistsâ</para>

<para>âMy grievance tonight relates to the plight of chicken farmers in Australia, particularly chicken growers in my electorate of Prospect. Chicken growers operate in a unique environment. They grow their chickens on their own land with their own infrastructureâsheds et ceteraâbut the chickens are provided by a processing company, as is the feed. The processing company delivers day-old chicks to farms and provides the feed. The grower then feeds the chickens, raises them to a mature state and returns them to the processor.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is widely recognised that the bargaining relationship between chicken growers and chicken processors is very uneven. In New South Wales there are six major chicken processing companies and over 300 chicken growers. The six processing companies, to my understanding, all operate in similar ways. They all have very similar contracts; the terms of pay are all exactly the same; the modus operandi is very similar. So, if a grower is unsatisfied with the conditions they are receiving from a particular chicken processor, they are unable to go to another chicken processor to get a better deal, because all the deals are the same. Chicken growers find themselves in a very unequal bargaining position. This has been recognised by state governments across the nation, and there has been a series legislation to assist chicken growers. Many of these pieces of legislation are being removed or substantially amended under national competition policy, which I will refer to in a moment.</para>
<para>I would like to provide the House with a couple of examples of the unequal bargaining position the chicken growers find themselves in. Perhaps the best example of why chicken growers find themselves in an unequal bargaining position is the price that a chicken grower receives per chicken, which at the moment is 53c. For those outside the industry it will be difficult to make a determination as to whether 53c is a fair or unfair rate. I simply make this observation: the rate has not changed for many yearsâin many cases, for as much as 10 years. There are few industries where you would find that people who have worked hard and productively have had no increase in their income for the last 10 years and, thereforeâvery clearlyâhave had a reduction in their real income. This is what I mean when I refer to the unequal bargaining position that chicken growers find themselves in.</para>
<para>I would like to share with the House two specific examples from my electorate to show the unequal bargaining position chicken growers are in and how hard they are doing it throughout the nation. Recently a chicken farmer in my electorate received a contract from his processing company, and he was told to sign it that day. There was no choice in the contract between an efficiency based system and a standard system. He was told that, if he wanted to renew the contract, he had to sign it that day. He said that he would not sign it that day and that he would take it to his solicitor, which I am sure the honourable member for Denison would agree was a very wise course for him or almost anybody to take.</para>
<para>The chicken farmer was advised to recall that the processing company still had the payment from the previous batch of chickens and that, unless they received the signed contract, he would not receive payment for the last batch of chickens that he had already returned to the company. So a chicken farmer who is doing it tough and who has provided chickens to the processing company has found that his payment has been withheld until he is in a position to sign the contract. He showed quite a considerable degree of courage and refused to sign the contract until his solicitor had had a chance to look over it.</para>
<para>Another chicken farmer in my electorate had his pay docked without negotiation following a mistake he madeâand which he freely admitted toâwhen ordering the chicken feed. The processor was aware of the mistake well in advance of the batch of chickens being ready but waited until it was time to make the payment before informing the chicken farmer that his pay would be docked. This chicken farmer has found himself in an invidious position, but there is no other chicken-processing company to which he can turn.</para>
<para>In the past, these chicken growers received some protection through state based legislation. In New South Wales, legislation to protect chicken growers was first introduced in the 1970s and was updated in 1986 with the Poultry Meat Industry Act. In 2003 the federal Treasurer accepted the findings of the National Competition Council that the New South Wales Poultry Meat Industry Act 1986 did not comply with competition policy and imposed a $12.86 million penalty on the New South Wales government. It was indicated to the New South Wales government that these penalties would continue until the New South Wales government substantially amended the Poultry Meat Industry Act.</para>
<para>I have to put it on record that, generally speaking, I think national competition policy has been a very good thing for this nation. We have seen reductions in energy and water costs. We have seen the introduction of a national access regime, which hopefully will come before the parliament this week after many delaysâwhich is something that I will refer to in the debate on that legislation. We have seen reform of laws which restrict competition. We have seen the development of competitive neutrality so that privately owned businesses can compete on an equal footing with those owned by government.</para>
<para>All these reforms have been designed to benefit the average Australian working family and to reduce their costs of living and, largely, those goals have been achieved. But national competition policy has to be implemented in a sensible way. I referred earlier to the fact that the price that chicken growers receive for each chicken has not increased for the last 10 years. Hence it would be very difficult to mount a case that chicken growers are in a monopoly situation, that they have been price gouging or that they have in any way contributed to an increase in the price that the average Australian family pays for their chickens when they go to the supermarket to buy their dinner. In my view, nobody can mount that case.</para>
<para>That case has not been argued or put by the National Competition Council because they could not sustain it, yet the New South Wales Poultry Meat Industry Act 1986 has been amended by the New South Wales government, with the sword of Damocles hanging over it: âIf you do not amend this act, then we will withhold from you $13 million a year in grants from the federal government to the state government.â That is not something that the New South Wales government could sustain, and I do not blame them for then amending the Poultry Meat Industry Act 1986 to comply with the National Competition Councilâs and the federal Treasurerâs interpretation of the national competition policy.</para>
<para>I will refer briefly to Laborâs policy, which was announced before the last election. There is no doubt that this is a complex area and that poultry farmers will not have any easy answers under any government, but Laborâs policy, which was announced by the honourable member for Corio on 6 July 2004 in the lead-up to the last election, was a substantial step forward for chicken growers and for other people in very similar situations. With small providers, often the whole family works on that farm and they are in a situation such that they can deal with only one or two companies and they are in a very unequal bargaining position. Laborâs policy was to allow collective bargaining between those groups. Labor promised to bring forward legislation to amend the Trade Practices Act to introduce a collective bargaining notification scheme, including the right to collectively boycott in cases where it was considered to be in the public interest.</para>
<para>We hear a lot from this government about choiceâthat people should have the choice to bargain how they wish to in relation to workplace relations and other mattersâbut this government, through its National Competition Council, is taking away the choice of hardworking chicken growers in Horsley Park, Kemps Creek and elsewhere throughout the nation to bargain collectively with the chicken-processing companies. I have no doubt that the chicken growers would welcome a situation where they could get a fair deal from the chicken-processing companies. All they want is a fair deal. They are not asking for any special deals, and I do not think it is unreasonable for them to ask for a bargaining regime through which they can negotiate a small increase in the price they receive for each chicken. I do not think that is an unreasonable request considering they have not had an increase in the last 10 years. I do not think it is unreasonable for their being able to negotiate a contract in good faith.</para>
<para>At the moment they negotiate a contract in a situation where many of the forces impacting on how much they receive are out of their control. They do not choose the chickens that they grow. They do not go down to the auction like many farmers do and buy the beasts, for example, and choose which chickens they grow. The chickens are delivered to them by the chicken-processing company. They have no choice over the quality of chickens that they grow. They do not buy their own feed. They have no choice over the quality of the feed, yet they are penalised if a chicken grows at a slower rate than is the average and they receive a lesser payment from the chicken-processing company. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talker>
<para>âI wish to speak about the road and rail debacle in Western Australia and the fact that just about every aspect of this debacle impacts on my electorate of Tangney. I am speaking of the rail line from Perth to Mandurah, the Peel Deviation, Roe Highway stage 8, the Fremantle Eastern Bypass and associated noise standards. Quite frankly, Tangney residents are sick of it. The whole situation is an absolute mess in WA, and this is of Minister Alannah MacTiernanâs personal making. We have a litany of disastrous decisions by the Gallop government regarding infrastructure development and planning that, as I have said, have had a significant negative impact on the lives of people living in the electorate of Tangney.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Quite a few years ago, the Gallop government made the decision to run the railway line down the middle of the Kwinana Freeway. This was decided more or less on a whim, without adequate planning or consultation, which is situation normal for Minister MacTiernan. As a result, the Mandurah rail link is significantly over budgetâand this was predicted years ago. Not only that, but when you have a look at the planning regulations you will see that the route they have taken is illegal. The Labor government lied in parliament, as it is actually a major scheme amendmentânot a minor scheme amendmentâunder the major region scheme guidelines. For example, the noise report did not take account of freeway realignment. What has occurred is that they have the railway running down the centre of the freeway, and they have shifted the lanes of the freeway itself at least 10 metres outwards, so that is obviously closer to the houses. There has been no account taken of this freeway realignment or of the concrete barriers that are adjacent to the railway itself, reflecting the road noise up to the residents.</para>
<para>The EPA was completely inept in studying this. All it considered was the sound levels associated with the railway itself. I view this as the EPA following a political agenda, not serving the public interest. I made a previous speech on the lack of rigour of the environmental impact statement on the Kwinana desalination plant. The EPA really needs to be picking up its act in this regard. Additionally, there was no considerationâin terms of planning and whether this was a major or minor schemeâabout the car parking at Leach Highway and South Street in my electorate, which is going to have a considerable effect on not only the noise associated with the railway/freeway but also the traffic volumes coming in from South Street and Leach Highway. Also, the railway and the associated freeway realignment contravene World Health Organisation guidelines on acceptable noise standards. Thus, the WA government could potentially be held criminally negligent, as would be the case in parts of Europe.</para>
<para>Additionally, as I have mentioned previously, the cost of the railway has blown out by hundreds of millions of dollars. This has a flow-on effect. The purpose of the Peel Deviation is to bypass Mandurah, which is one of the fastest growing areas in Australia. The Peel Deviation was put on the backburner. As a result of this and the fact that essentially the planning for the Peel bypass was totally inadequate, once again there has been a blow-out of $110 million in the cost of the bypass. And now the state government expect us, the federal government, to cough up half their blow-out. One thinks of the Dickensian, âPlease, sir, can I have some more?â or more demandingly or shrilly, in the case of the Gallop government, âCanberra give us our fair shareââa series of ads that they are putting on TV and that they have on billboards. Canberra should only offer a fair shareâin other words, halfâof the cost that is put by the state government. In fact, the federal government have done better than that. The initial figure given by the state Labor government on the cost of the Peel Deviation was $300 million. We not only offered $150 million but topped it up to $170 million. But now, as I have said, the cost is $450 million and rising again.</para>
<para>These are clearly some of the hallmarks of a totally inept government. Additional examples that significantly affect my electorate are the noncompletion of Roe Highway stage 8 and the deletion of the Fremantle Eastern Bypass despite decades of planning and massive community support. This is the single biggest issue in my electorate. The Fremantle Eastern Bypass was deleted to benefit the re-election of members such as Alan Carpenter. Never mind pork-barrelling in order to help members; this is putting the entire swine herd in a massive transporter.</para>
<para>As a result of the increased noise levels on Leach Highway, South Street and so on, many residents experience noise levels of over 80 dBA, despite WHO guidelines indicating that noise levels of above 40 to 45 dBA at night have negative public health outcomes. Not only is there a cost in the negative impact on health but this also clearly results in the lower productivity of these people in the workplace.</para>
<para>The state governmentâs lack of concern about the health of residents in my electorate goes further. The political decision to push trucks off Leach Highway to get yet another member re-elected in the last state electionâthat is, Riverton MLA Tony McRaeâmeans that this traffic will be pushed down to South Street, or Roe Highway when it is completed, back onto the freeway and back up to Leach Highway. This will exacerbate an already untenable position. This demonstrates that Alannah MacTiernanâor perhaps it should be Alannah âMacBlowoutââcould not plan her way out of a paper bag. However, if there is some political expediency, this Gallop government will do it. Or, if it is expedient to abandon it, it will abandon it, regardless of costs either financial or in terms of community wellbeing.</para>
<para>In summary, we have a state government riding roughshod over sensible planning in an ideological zeal. They are unconcerned about the negative health and economic effects of their ineptitude and negligence. They expect the federal government to bail them out when they are unable to undertake planning and costing 101. I absolutely support the federal governmentâs position of not simply rolling over and paying for the incompetence of an inept state government. We will not meet half the cost of MacTiernanâs ineptitude. I urge my constituents not to simply let the state government hoodwink them that the federal government is holding out. Hold those responsible to accountâthe state government. Pressure them not only to be truly responsive to community demands but also to carry out their infrastructure development in a competent manner that includes proper economic costing and taking requisite notice of the health effects of their planning. I also urge them to pressure MacTiernan to adequately deal with noise from these infrastructure debacles where this is causing negative health impacts.</para>

<para>âWith the second tragic bombing in Bali, I read again the chilling interviews that were held with quite a senior journalist and Abu Bakar Bashir in which he set out his obviously strongly held but deeply disturbing views about the way in which it was justified to establish a caliphate across the area that has a predominant Muslim population. I was deeply concerned whether within those views there were the seeds that might motivate many young persons to take action as a consequence of a set of beliefs that ultimately are extraordinarily destructive. But I then turned a little bit to the realisation that we ourselves need to try to understand how others could see us, because that kind of extreme view is not uniquely expressed by those on the Islamic side of the equation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I think we too readily perceive people like Abu Bakar Bashir as a representative voice of the Islamic community. There is no doubt that those voices exist and that they can lead to others making decisions and taking actions that threaten our peaceful existence, but we also have to understand that that kind of indifference and balefulness towards people who do not share a set of religious beliefs are expressed frequently by those in our own Western democracies. I take you to one of the prominent United States conservatives of the New Right, Ann Coulter, who, speaking on her views, said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity. We werenât punctilious about locating and punishing only Hitler and his top officers. We carpet-bombed German cities; we killed civilians. Thatâs war. And this is war.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">When those kinds of views are expressed we do not take them particularly seriously, but the same kind of audience that is receptive in our community to the outrageous and inhumane views of Abu Bakar Bashir are listening to those kinds of remarks and perceiving an attitude that they then reflect and disseminate back to their communities as stereotypical of Western views. Of course, that is not the only similar expression of the strong views that are held by persons in the United States and expressed as part of the new religious Right. Joseph Morecraft, of the Chalcedon Presbyterian Church, said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Nobody has the right to worship on this planet any other God than Jehovah. And therefore the state does not have the responsibility to defend anybodyâs pseudo-right to worship an idol.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">When George Bush began to rally those who were concerned about the acts of terrorism that had been inflicted on the United States, he used this phrase:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">This crusade, this war on terrorism is going to take a while.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Sadly, the expression âthis crusadeâ feeds back into a perception by those who would wish to create a climate that this is a clash of civilisations, a clash of cultures in which only one side can prevail. That does not have room for tolerance and understanding. It gives them a perception of this community that of course is wrong but that is nonetheless a powerful weapon.</para>
<para>We need to rethink our rhetoric about this circumstance we face as a free and democratic society. I know it is common to speak of the war on terror. Indeed, leaders on our own side use that expression. I reject it. I do not think it is appropriate to use the rhetoric of war when what we face is the need to use effective law enforcement to bring down those whose acts threaten us. I think the rhetoric of war actually creates a seedbed to inflame the possibility that those who are listening to the more extreme of our comments will respond in a way which is ultimately destructive.</para>
<para>The rhetoric of war allows our side to do the unthinkable. It encourages the kind of mindset that allowed the incidents at Abu Ghraib prison. It allows tolerance for the kinds of abuses that the United States has implemented in Guantanamo Bay. It leads to the President of the United States, after congress passes a resolution to prohibit the use of torture and brutality, saying that the proposal would restrict the Presidentâs authority to protect Americans effectively from terrorist attack and bring terrorists to justice.</para>
<para>The great Scottish poet Robbie Burns said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">O wad some Power the giftie gie us,</para>
<para class="block">To see oursels as ithers see us!</para>
<para class="block">Wad frae mony a blunder free us</para>
<para class="block">Anâ foolish notion.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Give us the gift to see ourselves as others see us, indeed. Rightly or wrongly, in protecting our perceived interests, we have invaded the territory of Iraq. At the time, the opposition warned that such a move would create a seedbed for the potential growth of terrorism and place our country at greater risk. Others have made the same judgment. But put aside the politics of thisâbecause this issue will be decided clearly in the future; at the present stage it looks as though our engagement in Iraq is creating that very seedbed of extremism that many predicted it wouldâand look to how others would see us. If Australia were to be invaded by another nation, bringing with it a set of values, no matter how liberal, democratic or valuable, it is likely that many Australians would resist.</para>
<para>I will give a very good example. I went on a parliamentary trip to the Prado museum in Spain and I saw the pictures there by Goya. Goya is remembered as the great artist who saw war face to face. âI saw it,â is what he said. What he saw was the effect in Spain of Napoleonâs troops invading that country. About Spain, which was then a most unenlightened country, Napoleon used almost exactly the same kind of language about bringing enlightenment as we use about Iraq. The Spanish Inquisition still existed, there were very poor levels of education and, essentially, a totalitarian government ruled by the Bourbon monarchs. Yet, rather than welcome the bringing of the enlightenment, the Spanish developed, for the first time in modern timesâalthough it may have existed beforeâa guerrilla war. It was the first time. It was not in Vietnam that guerrilla warfare first developed but in that period when Napoleon invaded Spain. The armies of Napoleon succeeded instantly but the battle for Spain was waged by a series of irregularsâand the French responded by increasing terror, by hangings, by committing atrocities and by suspending all the rights that they purported to uphold. In the end, the consequence was the destruction of Franceâbut also the plunging of Spain back into the most totalitarian re-establishment of the Bourbon regime, despite the best wishes of those who were of a liberal intent.</para>
<para>So âgie usâ the capacity to see us as others see us. Remember that our conduct is being judged, just as we are judging the conduct of others. Let us not fall into the trap ourselves of dehumanising those whom we deal with. Remember that those amongst our Australian community who are of Islamic bent also have their fears, their concerns and their worriesâand what they believe matters. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âToday I draw the attention of the House to my grievance on behalf of the people of New South Walesâand, in particular, those of Sydney, Australiaâs oldest and largest city, in which my electorate of Wentworth is situated. I grieve on their behalf that for 10 years New South Wales and Sydney have had the misfortune of having an extraordinarily indolent and inept government, a Labor government that has been described as having perfected the concierge style of governmentâjust watching things go by, barely reacting to events and allowing itself to be overwhelmed by them. Sadly, all this laziness has caught up with the Labor government in New South Wales and, to our great misfortune, the people of New South Wales. In the 12 months to August, the increase of two per cent over a year in full-time jobs in New South Wales was the lowest of any state in Australia. The increase in Queensland was 4.6 per cent; in Western Australia, fuelled no doubt by the resources boom, it was nine per cent. Even Tasmania was ahead of New South Wales.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In its September 2005 <inline font-style="italic">Budget Monitor</inline>, Access Economics said about New South Wales:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">While NSW accounts for around one-third of national population and economic activity, in recent years it has been a growth anchor rather than a driver for the nation.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">They went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Even though Sydneyâs strengths as the most globalised part of the Australian economy have helped it across a period when the world has been growing at its fastest rate in a generation, New South Wales has lagged the nation.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It has not been through want of resources. The New South Wales government has been awash with cash, not least because of the GST, but also because of its wide array of property taxes and the property boom. This financial year the New South Wales government will spend $40.5 billion. That is an 11 per cent increase in three years from the $36Â½ billion spent in the year the Carr government was re-elected. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has confirmed that New South Wales is the highest taxed state in Australia. Per capita each New South Wales resident pays $2,597 in state taxes. How much do they pay in the other states? In Queensland it is $2,128; in Tasmania, $1,698; in Victoria, $2,455; and so on.</para>
<para>New South Wales is the highest taxed state yet the poorest performing state. New South Wales businesses pay on average $2,627 in payroll tax and workersâ compensation charges per employee. That is 71 per cent higher than in Queensland, 41 per cent higher than in Western Australia, 40 per cent higher thanÂ  in Tasmania, 28 per cent higher than in South Australia and 19 per cent higher than in Victoria. Payroll tax is six per cent, compared to 4.75 per cent in Queensland. The payroll tax threshold is $600,000, compared to $850,000 in Queensland. Average workersâ compensation costs per employee in New South Wales are $1,161, compared to $602 in Queensland. Last year WorkCover made a $1.3 billion surplus, so it can afford to cut premiums, but it does not.</para>
<para>If the economy tells the final story about the management of New South Wales, it is a very sad story for the people of my stateâand in particular for the people of Sydney. Far from being an economic powerhouse, 10 years of Labor government have put New South Wales in the economic doghouse. They have put the state in the doghouse, due to laziness and inaction. Nowhere is this laziness and inaction seen more clearly than in respect of two of the most vital elements in the sustainability of any societyâin particular of any large city. I speak, of course, of water and transport.</para>
<para>Sydney is at real risk of running out of water. Sydney is at risk of dying of thirst. It is not because there is a lack of waterâthere is plenty of water; it is because of the tragic ineptitude of the Labor government in failing to manage that water. We pump three-quarters of all the water that is consumed in the Sydney metropolitan area out into the ocean as barely treated sewage. We recycle virtually none of it. Everywhere else in the world recycling is becoming the norm. It is the direction in which responsible cities and responsible governments are moving everywhere else in the world, but not in Sydney. So determined is Sydney Water to resist large-scale recycling that, when a private company, Services Sydney, sought to do that, without seeking any compensation or subsidy from government, they were resisted at every turn. They are now finally appealing to the Competition Tribunal to get access to the waste water of Sydney Water.</para>
<para>Sydney Water, of course, has a very high fixed overhead and a very low variable overhead, so it has a vested interest in selling as much water as it can. It has a vested interest, in effect, in promoting extravagance. The last thing it wants to have is competition. This is a terrific cash cow and it is sought to be protected by the state government. It is as though we are in an alternative universe in Sydney, because not only are we failing to promote large-scale recycling but also the need for large-scale recycling has been obvious for nearly 20 years. In the early 1990s, shortly before the change from the Liberal government of John Fahey to Bob Carrâs government, Sydney Water was toldâand it knew from its own workâthat there were basically two solutions to Sydneyâs water requirements. One solution was to build a new dam. That was quickly ruled out by the new government. The other one was large-scale recycling. There is no other way of getting a substantial addition of water to Sydney, other than large-scale desalination, which quite rightly has until very recently always been dismissed. Indeed, Bob Carr said in October last year that desalination was bottled electricity. How right he was.</para>
<para>He spoke the truth when he said that. As a recent paper from the Parliamentary Library shows, the energy cost of desalinating sea water is between four and five times as much as the energy cost of recycling waste waterârecycling sewage. That is an enormous margin. Yet that is the route we are heading down, contrary to every other major city in the world, even those that are using desalination. Everywhere else recycling is a major priority. When I was in Israel in Aprilâof course they have a much harsher climate in terms of rainfall than we doâthe Israelis told me that they recycle 70 per cent of their waste water. What do we recycle? A couple of per cent in Sydney. Of course Israelis are big desalinaters too, but they said that recycling was what you do first, because recycling is always going to be cheaper.</para>
<para>The bizarre aspect of this desalination plant that is being offered as the solution is not that it will cost $1.75 billion and not that the water will cost over a $1.50 a kilolitre, a cubic metreâthese are the figures from the governmentâs own consultantsâbut the very obvious reality that to finance a plant of this kind there will need to be a take-or-pay contract. In other words, Sydney Water will have to either take the water at that very high price and pay for it or pay a lesser percentage, generally around 60 per cent. This would mean that if there were plenty of rain, the plant would cost Sydney Water 60 per cent of $270 million, which is about the cost of 180 billion litres a year at $1.50 per litre. In other words, in years of good rain Sydney Water would be paying $162 million for water it did not receive. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âIn a statement with the Orwellian title âWorkChoicesâ, released yesterday, the Howard government indicated that it sees the future of Australian workplaces as lying in individual contracts. It asserts that these contracts are and will be negotiated genuinely and in good faith between employers and individual job applicants.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I have a copy of an individual contract. It is an offer of employment by Boating, Camping and Fishing, which I am advised is a subsidiary of Autocheap, and it is made to Jason Towers. I will not go through the full details of this contract but I am sure that members of this House will be interested in some of them. In relation to hours of work, it says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It is expected that in this position you will be required to work a minimum of an approximately 45 hour week to perform the duties and responsibilities effectively.</para>
<para class="block">You will be expected to complete these hours during BCFâs normal working hours. You may, however, need to work outside these normal working hours as reasonably necessary to complete or perform your duties, which may include overtime/weekends/public holidays or night work and will not incur any additional payment.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So the document is saying there may be a requirement to work on public holidays or at night, overtime or at weekends but there will be no additional payment. It goes on to say in relation to leave:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Please note you are not entitled to any leave loading as it has already been factored into your base salary.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I am advised that you cannot take leave loading out of contracts and you cannot take public holiday rates of pay out of individual contracts, yet that is what this document does.</para>
<para>Another set of provisions relates to inventions, because this is a boating, fishing and tackle business. In relation to any inventions that the employee might create, it says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... and the inventions will thereafter be the sole and exclusive property of BCF.</para>
<para class="block">b)Â  You will immediately deliver to BCF full particulars concerning the inventions ... and to assign to BCF all rights which may be acquired by it in relation to them and to vest title in them in BCF absolutely.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So any intellectual property, any new ideas that the employee comes up with are immediately then the property of the employer. This is a very sad story. We are now witnessing employers being emboldened by this governmentâs statements and its exhortations to employers to put people on individual contracts.</para>
<para>It is such a ridiculous claim to say that these contracts are in fact negotiated. I say that because I have now a letter from the same person, Jason Towers and I want to quote parts of that letter:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">At the end of the day at 6:15pm Mark [who is the employer] gave me the contracts to take home and read and said I want them back tomorrow. But on the contract it states:</para>
<para class="block">Please review the enclosed documentation carefully, and in order to signify your agreement to the offer of employment, return a signed copy of the enclosed Terms and Conditions of employment to head office at your earliest convenience.</para>
<para class="block">Should you wish to discuss any matters resulting from our discussions or contained in this offer, please do not hesitate to contact me.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So the contract says, âTake your time, have a good look over the contract. If you have any queries, letâs have a discussion and a genuine negotiation.â That is what it says in the document. But Mark said to Jason, âI want you to take the contracts home, read them and bring them back tomorrow.â</para>
<para>Jason goes on in his letter to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Mark approached me and asked if I had brought the contracts back signed, I said, âno I have left them at home so I can review them tonight as I was sleepy last night and I had not had enough time to read and fully understand what was written in the contract and that I would give the contract to him tomorrow and talk about it then.</para>
<para class="block">Mark then raised his voice to me and said âI told you to bring the contracts back today, how far away do you liveâ, I replied ânot far 10 minutes awayâ. Mark then told me to go home at lunch time and get the contracts and bring them back, I nodded yes feeling intimidated.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Jason goes on further to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Mark then told me to have some lunch first then go home and get my contracts, I replied and said that I am not ready to sign them yet I want to read them through more. Mark said angrily âI heard you say that this morning you donât have to tell me twice, now go home and get the contractsâ, he said to me as I walked away from him avoiding confrontation. I immediately left without lunch on my lunch break to go home and get the contracts as he angrily demanded I do.</para>
</quote>
<para>Jason goes on to say that he requested a phone call to Wayne Faulkner, whose name was on the contract, to talk over clause No. 16 on inventions. The upshot is that he asked Mark if he could take home the contracts, read through them carefully again and think about it some more. The letter states that Mark:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... strongly replied âthe answer is NOâ.</para>
<para class="block">I was given 5 minutes to read through both contracts in the lunch room and to make a final decision. With the way I was being treated by Mark, I couldnât make phone calls out to anyone and I didnât have a mobile phone with me.</para>
<para class="block">I felt I was being forced into the contract without me having my own amount of time to think it over, this is not my earliest convenience that right had been taken from me. I had to sign the contract that day or I didnât have a job.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He goes on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Mark took a small tape recorder out from behind some books on his desk and asked for my decision only a man can make. I replied âI wonât sign the contracts, so I resignâ. ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Jason then says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I was not made aware the meeting was being recorded nor was I asked if it was alright by me to do so.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Is this the Australia to which we aspire? This was supposed to be a negotiation, but there was no negotiation in relation to this contract. Employers right through Australia will be emboldened and encouraged by the Howard government to adopt this sort of behaviour toward employees and job applicants.</para>
<para>The government has said time and time again that individual contracts are negotiated and that they are the basis of negotiations for working out flexible working arrangements between employer and employee. Where is the flexibility in this? There was no flexibility whatsoever. There was no scope for negotiation whatsoeverâsimply a demand that Jason sign this contract and the threat that, if he did not sign the contract, there would then be consequences. Jason decided that he was not going to sign the contract and that he was going to resign.</para>
<para>The truth is that, in coming forward, this man Jason is rare amongst working Australians. There are innumerable cases where this same sort of treatment is meted out to employees and to job applicants, but in their cases, if they are in employment, they feel intimidated. They feel that if they come forward and say what has actually happened to them they will then lose their jobsâand who will look after them then? That is how the government has been able to get away with this approach in relation to its favoured form of individual contracts, AWAs. These are non-reviewable, secret documents. If AWAs are so terrific, if they are so great for working Australians, why is there secrecy with them? This answers that question.</para>
<para>I am not asserting that this is an AWAâit does not have âAWAâ written on itâbut it certainly is an individual contract that was not subject to negotiation. There is plenty of evidence here that the employee was put under enormous pressure to sign that contract, but in the end he did not do so. This is the âbrave new worldâ of workplace relations under the Howard government: employers being encouraged to treat employees like dirt.</para>
<para>Surely this is not the Australia to which reasonable people would aspire. No $100 million of taxpayer funded propaganda will convince the working people of this country that arrangements such as this are good for themâarrangements where the employee has little or no say in working conditions; arrangements that appear, at least on the face of it, to be in breach of the laws of the land. The advice to me is that this particular contract is in breach.</para>
<para>Where is the enforcement? This government has an inspectorate but it does not utilise that inspectorate, because it does not want to shine a light on this sort of behaviour. This cannot be the future of Australian industrial relations. It cannot be the future for our country.</para>
<para>This government should be condemned for encouraging this sort of contract, for encouraging intimidation and for encouraging the loss of basic pay and working conditions for working Australiansâall in the name of some mad, right-wing ideology, some zealotry regarding an article of faith of the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party is absolutely determined to erode the working conditions of Australians and to smash the trade union movement in this country; it will not succeed. We will win this argument in the court of public opinion, and the government will rue the day that it ever came up with the stupid idea of bringing in this Orwellian legislation that encourages appalling behaviour such as this.</para>

Late last week I urged Indigenous Australians on Palm Islandâthere are 4,000 of themâto take advantage of the new federal policies that have been articulated by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, as they will allow Aboriginal communities to deal in their own land and to deal with individuals and businesses. To do so is particularly important for Palm Island. Palm Island is an out-of-sight, out-of-mind community made up of the descendants of 50 tribes who were sent to that island in penal colony arrangements. The community continues to go from drunkenness to domestic violence to drugs and back to drunkenness. It is really quite sad. My heart goes out to the people of Palm Island when I go there.</para>
<para>But when I made this suggestionâand I made it for some very good reasonsâPalm Island Council Chairperson Erykah Kyle said that the policy sounded ridiculous and amounted to âgovernment wanting to steal their birthrightsâ. For more than two years, I have been campaigning for a revolution in rights to see an enterprise culture develop on Palm Island. Only through an enterprise culture will we see jobs, self-respect amongst the Indigenous community, and Indigenous workers being able to go home to their families and say, âI did a good dayâs work today. I achieved a lot. I feel good about myself.â That just does not happen on Palm Island.</para>
<para>The Palm Island chairman said that Aboriginal communities had not had the opportunity to even think about such a ridiculous situation. Goodness me, her council had discussed it in full detail, but I will say more about that in a moment. She said that Palm Islanders were born on the island and selling it off would amount to stealing their birthrights. The government does not intend that that land be sold off; it intends to have 99-year leases so that Indigenous people themselves can have their own piece of land, their own house and their own self-respect.</para>
<para>The council chairman finally said:</para>

<para class="block">Fortunately, another councillor, Councillor Magdalena Blackley, bravely spoke up. She broke ranks with the council leader, pointing out that the council had discussed this and made representations to the state government to get it to agree to free up land tenure. The council had agreed:</para>

</quote>
<para class="block">She said that there are âhundreds like meââincluding other like-minded councillors, who certainly support the availability of land tenure to the Indigenous people of Palm Island.</para>
<para>Others have a different view. Dr David Cooper, who runs Australians for Native Title and Reconciliation, put out a fearsome press release last week. He is an example, I believe, of somebody who is living in the past. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para>Australians for Native Title and Reconciliation (ANTaR) has accused the Federal Government of ignoring the urgent needs of Aboriginal families in its pursuit of unnecessary changes to Aboriginal Land Rights Act in the Northern Territory.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">My answer to Dr Cooper is to say that changes are needed right across Australia, not just in the Northern Territory. Dr Cooper went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Meanwhile, Aboriginal families in the Northern Territory face shortened lives, debilitating diseases long eradicated in white communities and chronic housing and infrastructure shortages because governments withhold the necessary resources to address these basic human needs.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Dr Cooper, governments do not withhold these services. They are available to all Indigenous communities. But, Dr Cooper, you ought to come to Palm Island and see what I have seen for the last 10 years: no change in the dysfunctional hopelessness on that island.</para>
<para>Education is a key, along with land rights. Sensible Indigenous community leaders tell the parents of children, âYou have to do everything you can to get your kids to go to school and stay at school because it is only through education that you can empower future Aboriginal leaders and Indigenous workers to do their very best. They are not going to do their best if they have not stayed at school.â</para>
<para>Dr Cooper went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">ANTaR is concerned that economic benefits to traditional owners under the proposed changes are uncertain at best. The Governmentâs model denies traditional owners ongoing benefit from future commercial development on their communities and vests control in the Northern Territory Government.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Goodness me, Dr Cooper; how many stories have we heard about what has been going on in relation to current dealings with the land council? How many stories have we heard about a very small few creaming off the money and the other people in those communities staying poor? It happens all the time, and it must not happen. We have to make sure that individual Indigenous Australians can benefit from the developments that can occur with their land.</para>
<para>Finally, Dr Cooper says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Sadly, such considerations are overshadowed by the ideological fixations of the Federal Government.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is the comment of an organisation that wants to keep Indigenous Australians in a museum. I say that quite directly. It will be offensive to Dr Cooper, but I say that quite directly because the government do not have ideological fixations. Our hearts go out to Indigenous Australians who are disadvantaged. We want to give them the maximum help, and we will.</para>
<para>Unless the opportunity is available for Indigenous Australians to deal in their own land, the people on Palm Island in my electorate will continue to live in a dysfunctional, hopeless community for the next century. Indigenous Australians should have the same rights as all other Australians. In my area, education and land ownership are the two key issues to achieving better lives for these people. My appeal to the Indigenous leaders of this country is: look forwards, not backwards. The world changes. You must do better for your people and you must lead your people out of the mess that they currently live in.</para>

<para>âI rise tonight to reflect on the recent introduction, at least in broad policy form, of the governmentâs intentions to fundamentally alter the industrial relations system in this country. It is clear from the 68-page document that has been distributed amongst media and other commentators by the government that there has been a significant amount of misrepresentation about exactly what will occur. One of the difficult things for parliamentarians to do in this debate is to go into the detail because, notwithstanding the fact that the government is expending millions of dollars of taxpayersâ money on a propaganda campaign to sell its policies, we do not have one provision of a bill to debate in this place. It is an awful thing to see, an extraordinary waste of public money that could be spent in so many other, beneficial ways. And this money is being spent on convincing the public about a set of propositions that are not contained within any bills presented to this House.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Having looked at the summary of the 68-page document presented by the government, it seems to me that there are certainly efforts to misrepresent the intention of the proposals foreshadowed by the Prime Minister in May in relation to the new laws. People say that sometimes it is the big lie that is believed the most, but there seems to me to be a series of small lies, small mistruths, in the explanation for the changesâand, indeed, of what will result from themâincorporated in this 68-page document headed âWorkChoicesâA New Workplace Relations Systemâ. I want to go through some of the assertions made in the document to really make this clear to my constituents, on behalf of more than 2,000 of whom I was today able to table a petition opposing these IR laws. It is important for us to highlight, not only for those constituents but for constituents across the country, the problems as the changes are presented by the government.</para>
<para>Firstly, there is the governmentâs assertion that the new workplace relations system will move towards being one simpler, national system. I think that there is a whole question over whether the government will be able to cover the industrial relations field in this country with one simpler, national system. It has already been foreshadowed by state governments that they are likely to challenge the basis upon which the government is proposing these laws. Everyone is also aware that the corporations and labour powers of the Constitution are not sufficient to provide the coverage for one system to be in operation without the state governments referring particular powers to the Commonwealth. So it is not the case that there is clearly going to be a simpler, national system.</para>
<para>The second assertion is that the government will simplify the workplace agreement-making process. I guess whether they will simplify the agreement-making process will be in the eye of the beholder. There is no doubt in my mind that the endgame for the government is to create 10 million AWAsâ10 million instruments of the system. It is not necessarily going to make life easier for employees, employers, unions, employer bodies or, for that matter, those statutory authorities presiding over those instruments. Again, it is not the case that the government can clearly say that there will be a simpler process.</para>
<para>A further assertion is that the changes will introduce the Australian fair pay and conditions standard to protect workersâ wages and conditions in the agreement-making process. This is clearly a furphy. Given the way in which the Australian fair pay and conditions standard is set up, by the governmentâs own definition this will be an inferior level of protection to what is already afforded to workers as a result of the no disadvantage test. Again, the truth in the argument asserted by government that there will be protection is that there will be less protection. If they were true to their word and properly categorised the consequences of this provision, they would say that there would be less protection as a result of the introduction of that fair pay and conditions standard.</para>
<para>Another assertion made is that the changes will enshrine a set of minimum conditions in federal legislation for the first time. Again, there is an acceptance that those conditions prescribed in awards which are pursuant to Commonwealth acts are already protected. So it is a furphy and a misrepresentation to argue that there is not already protection.</para>
<para>The governmentâs summary also asserts that they will ensure an ongoing role for the Industrial Relations Commission. We know, as a result of the proposals made by the Prime Minister and the minister yesterday, that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission will be gutted. There will be no capacity for the commissionâthe umpireâto preside over matters that will potentially adversely affect working people in this country. The government will remove the capacity for the commission to compulsorily bring parties together. They will also prevent the commission from presiding over hearings when certified agreements are being presented for scrutiny to ensure that they are consistent with the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. Again, it is a lie being put forward by the government when they say that they are providing an ongoing role. Upon the enactment of these proposed bills, the role of the commission will be so minimal as to be negligible in its protection of working people in this country.</para>
<para>The government then go on in summary to say what will not change. They say that they will not cut the minimum award classification wages. That is not true. It is clear that, by providing the powers from the commission to the Australian Fair Pay Commission, there will be the capacity to reduce the classifications that are already incorporated in awards and agreements.</para>
<para>A further assertion made is that the changes will not remove protection against unlawful termination and will not abolish awards. The government may well not abolish awards, but they will render them so narrow as to not properly cover employment conditions for employees in this country. The fact is that the government want to move from 20 allowable award matters that are currently prescribed within section 89 of the Workplace Relations Act, down to five basic conditions. The others will be subject to so-called negotiation between the employer and the employee. Whilst there may not be an abolition of awards, the awards will not be as we know them today. They will be a different creature and they will be a limited instrument for protecting working people in this country.</para>
<para>The government go on to say that they will not abolish the Industrial Relations Commission. As I said earlier, we know that the changes will change the fundamental nature of the Industrial Relations Commission. They will remove the powers that that commission has had almost since Federation. They will deny the commission the powers to bring parties together to reconcile differences. They will not allow the commission to arbitrate a dispute in order to settle the matter and provide some relief for the parties on both sides of the fence. Further to that, the government will ensure that the Employment Advocate presides over award matters from the enactment of these bills on so that parties will no longer be able to preside over the scrutiny of a collective agreement being certified. The collective agreement will be filed in the Employment Advocateâs offices and will not be subject to scrutiny. It will be a secret document. Not only AWAs but non-union certified agreements will now be filed like a document, without any scrutiny whatsoever by the parties.</para>
<para>We need transparency. There are very good employers in this country but there are some that are not so good. There are some that do not care what they do to workers in this country. These changes are unfair and the government is not telling the truth about them. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI rise to grieve for the modern-day family, whatever that is. I note that right at the moment, as I speak, in South Australia, my home state, there are people boarding buses to go to Parliament House to protest about legislation which seeks to undermine one interpretation of the family.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The concept of family is much bandied around. This is probably best represented by a current television advertisement for a compact four-wheel drive. The ad starts with a vehicle with the âperfect nuclear familyâ, two parents and two children, travelling in the vehicle. When the father is left on the side of the road, the resulting single-parent family travels a short distance before being joined by a single dad and his children, highlighting the flexibility of this vehicle, in which the seating can be rearranged to suit the blended family. The advertisement goes on to the empty-nesters and finishes by claiming to be âthe four-by-four for the modern-day familyâwhatever that is.â</para>
<para>In a world where marketing is usually trying to sell us our dreams, this advertisement is cleverâeven humorous in a self-deprecating kind of way. The irony is apparent, though, when the ad appears in the middle of a film that typifies the dreams of manyâwhere the heroine meets her love in the face of some great danger which they overcome together, and romance and marriage follow before they set off happily ever after into the future. Despite the reality for many in Australia today, where there is no âhappy ever afterâ, romance, love, marriage and family remain a dream for many men and women.</para>
<para>A number of questions arise from this. Why does the dream persist in the face of what is commonly perceived as reality? Do the perceptions match the facts about modern family structures? Does it matter? Finally, canâand, perhaps more importantly, shouldâthe government do anything about it?</para>
<para>Why the dream? In <inline font-style="italic">Reinventing Australia</inline>, Hugh Mackay writes:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Families are still seen as having the potential to provide the emotional security of permanent relationships, as well as a strong sense of identity arising from those relationships ... Family life is thought to teach us important lessons about loyalty, responsibility and compromise, and many Australians believe the quality of family life is an important index of the quality of life in the wider society ... Families are not necessarily expected to be happy, but they are still seen as one of societyâs most precious resources.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This position was supported by an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper on 10 February 2005 about a couple who, despite being faced with a range of issues, have remained married for 32 years. The couple interviewed for this article demonstrate that the process of working through tensions, conflicts and differencesâas opposed to avoiding themâcan actually add depth and strength to a marriage. They highlight the benefits that their strong relationship has had for their children.</para>
<para>Given the common perception about the demise of marriage, one could be forgiven for thinking that these views no longer represent the views of the majority of Australians. However, research indicates that the majority of young people in Australia intend or desire to be married at some stage in their life. Some would argue that this is just a cultural response, a construction of Western society originating in the last century, but they conveniently ignore the fact that the virtues of a man and woman coming together in marriage to form a healthy family unit were being debated by Aristotle some centuries ago.</para>
<para>In addition to natural predisposition and considered choices, the persistence of the dream may be due to personal beliefs. Despite the perception that the established church is irrelevant, the Australian Bureau of Statistics publication <inline font-style="italic">Australian Social Trends 2004</inline> indicates that at least 68 per cent of people affiliate themselves with the Christian faith. Place alongside them the Muslims, Hindus and Jews, all of whom esteem marriage, and there is clearly a substantial base of support for the institution of marriage in our community.</para>
<para>What are the facts? Mark Twain is credited with the oft-quoted line âLies, damn lies and statisticsâ. Depending on how they are used, statistics can record circumstances factually but also communicate a message about the situation with considerable bias. Take, for example, the prevalence of marriage today as compared to the time of âformer generationsâ. Ask most people and they would respond that fewer people are married these days. In fact, in 1901, just over 46.4 per cent of the population in Australia was married. In 2001, not only was the percentage higher, at 54.6 per cent, but, given that Australiaâs population was also larger, the total number of people in marriage was far larger.</para>
<para>Early last century, the patterns of and reasons for immigration meant that there were some 115 men for every 100 women, and society was coming out of the depression of the 1890s. Demographers cite these reasons along with the mores of the day to explain why the marriage rate was so low. Today, a closer look at context will identify that there are also factors which may explain why the rate of people in marriage as a percentage of the total population has reduced from the peak in 1971 of 64.5 per cent. Some of those reasons include the fact that people are getting married later and living longer. This means that, while the total number of people in marriage may still be increasing, the percentage in marriage may not correspondingly climb, due in part to the growing number of people at both ends of the normal distribution of populationâthat is, those yet to marry and those who are widowed.</para>
<para>Where do the facts leave the traditional family unit? In a democratic system, where an electoral win by a few per cent on a two-party preferred basis is seen as a strong mandate, one could contend that marriage is still looking pretty good. The 2001 census revealed that of all Australian households 72.5 per cent consisted of families. Of those, 82.5 per cent were couples, of which 87.6 per cent were legally married. Of those couples that had dependent children, 90.1 per cent were families where both biological parents were present. There appears to be a considerable gap between the modern family structures that existâand are in the main desired by our communityâand the perceptions we hold about them.</para>
<para>Does this discrepancy matter? In a word, yes. William James, an American philosopher born in 1842, is credited with the quote âBelief creates the actual factâ. Our society, aiming to be egalitarian, generally tries to operate on the basis of fact. When a perception becomes so widely accepted as to become fact in peopleâs minds, it can gradually become a self-fulfilling prophecy.</para>
<para>In the case of marriage, despite the large numbers of people desiring and choosing to wed, overt support for their decision is reducing in contemporary Australia. This is due in no small part to the âbelief-become-factâ that marriage and the traditional family are in crisis and should now be viewed as just one of a number of equally valid lifestyle options. The problem is compounded because the perception, operating in a politically correct environment, has led to the view that all relationship forms are not just equally valid but equally desirable. To say otherwise may appear discriminatory. So the perception indeed starts to determine fact as it undermines multicultural, multigenerational mores which have upheld marriage as something worth fighting for. Why would a person enter intoâor indeed stick atâsomething that at times is just plain hard work, if the alternativeâcohabitation or divorceâis being held to be an equally desirable outcome? There would not be an issue if in fact the outcomes were equally desirable, but in the majority of cases they clearly are not.</para>
<para>While not seeking to devalue the compelling reasons that lead some couples to separateâand some individuals to never marry in the first placeâthere is a growing body of evidence that those who work at remaining married have better mental, physical and emotional wellbeing. Mental health issues in particular are doubled for divorced men and women as compared to those who remain married. The high and rising rate of adult suicide in Australia also has strong links to marriage breakdown. Divorced women take their own lives at a rate four times that for married women, while the suicide rate for divorced men is up to three times the rate for married men.</para>
<para>In the vast majority of cases both parents and their children are also far better off financially when their marriage remains intact. AMP and NATSEM highlight the different impacts on men and women with respect to income, equity, debt levels and long-term wealth potential but conclude that, from a financial perspective, divorce is a loss-loss outcome.</para>
<para>The taxpayer also suffers when a marriage ends. The Department of Family and Community Services estimates that for an average family with two children, on an average income of $35,000, government support rises from $8,800 to over $22,000 following separation. In 2001, 53,400 children were affected by their parents divorcing. Assuming two children per family, this equates to over $35 million each year in direct support provided by the taxpayer.</para>
<para>The increase in separation and divorce does not just affect parents. The Democratsâ youth survey results, which were released in August this year, highlight that the most important issues of concern to young peopleâaround 64 per cent of themâare family matters such as divorce and separation. With up to one million Australian children having a natural parent living elsewhere, the impacts of divorce are far-reaching. The facts also give the lie to the perception that alternate forms of relationships, such as cohabitation, are differentiated from marriage by just a piece of paper. De Vaus and others cite a range of studies that highlight this.</para>
<para>Can anything be done? Yes, it can. But it comes down to changing attitudes, for example through sustained awareness campaigns and through education, giving people the skills. Research has shown that, while no marriage is perfect, with help marriage can be functional, supportive and a healthy place for both parents and children. Researchers have shown that the most important thing is the will to make a marriage last and the tools to apply that to work through the conflicts and issues that every relationship will have, to make a marriage a healthy place both for the adults and for the children concerned.</para>

</talker>
<para>âBefore the three non-sitting weeks intervened in this debate on the <inline ref="R2376">Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005</inline>, I started to make a contribution indicating my opposition to this piece of legislation as it is set out. That was based on three distinct themes. The first was the inequitable nature of the Medicare safety net. The second was the fact that this legislation is a broken election promise. The third, and I think the most telling concern, was that this legislation represents the continuation of the mishmash way in which this government has approached its health policy. It reveals yet again a misdirection of resources in health expenditure.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>One of the interesting things is that, in the three weeks that have intervened, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report outlining Australiaâs expenditure on health has been released. One of the telling things that this study shows is the increase in out-of-pocket expenses that has occurred. The figures show that overall spending on health rose by $6.1 billion in 2003-04. The report reveals that spending on health Australia wide was $78.4 billion, but, as I said, the thing that is of most concern is the fact that this detailed analysis of health expenditure actually reveals the way in which there has been a cost-shift in health expenditure from public to private.</para>
<para>That is the theme that we see continually in the way this government sees its role. Whether it be health, which we are discussing tonight, or education, at all levels this government continues to put in place policies that shift responsibility from the public to the private. In any case where that is the ideological backing for what a government is doing the disadvantaged are not catered for in the way they should be.</para>
<para>That is what we are now seeing revealed in the way health expenditure is unrelated to outcomes. This is the real worry. As I put on the record three weeks ago when I started my contribution: how can this piece of public policy be correct when, if you do an analysis of the geographic regions that the money is going to, you find that as a result of the Medicare safety net in Victoria the benefit in yearly terms to an electorate like Kooyong is $560,000 and the benefit to an electorate like Scullin is $185,000? On any analysis of need, the levels of disadvantage in an electorate like Scullin are much greater than those in an electorate like Kooyong, which I have used as an example in this instance. With this simple measure of the Medicare safety net and the way that it is implemented, we see on the latest figures that are available over half a million dollars of resources going in health expenditure for the people of Kooyong, as against a figure of less than $200,000 for the seat of Scullin.</para>
<para>This would be dismissed on some occasions as me engaging in the politics of envy. It is not about the politics of envy; it is about stepping back at a national level, deciding what our overall input should be into health expenditure and making sure that it is directed so as to have the best impact. This is my point about these mishmash policies and the misdirection of funds, because at the same time we see the operation of the Medicare safety net, which is flawed by not having a cap on what a person can be charged for out-of-pocket expenses; when they reach the level, they can then claim the 80 per cent, but it is an open-ended program. It is open-ended on how much can be claimed and on how much can be charged. It does two things: firstly, it does not in any way rein in health expenditure and, secondly, it means that people that are having private care are going to be forced into a situation where there is encouragement to have excessive fees.</para>
<para>We can compare it to another piece of public health policy that this government put in place many years ago. That, of course, is the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate. The expenditure on that is in the order of $2,500 million for 2004-05. The argument that has not been addressed by this government is whether, in fact, we should have a piece of policy that so indirectly influences health outcomes. The private health insurance rebate is an industry rebate. It is industry support for the private health insurance industry. It directly supports private health, because it is about the actions of the funds and all the things that the funds do.</para>
<para>As we have argued, the irony about this is that, at the same time, the government are saying, âWeâre not going to fund a proper Commonwealth public dental scheme, because that is something that the states should be doing.â In fact, the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate, to the extent that it is a rebate on the private dental health cover through the various private health schemes, has an order of magnitude greater than all the resources that were put in place under the Hawke-Keating years for the Commonwealth public dental health scheme. The government say, âWe are not interested in dental,â but they have not come to grips with the fact that they are already involved. By propping up people going into private health insurance through this measure, they are in fact making a subsidy to dental health. We have heard the argument about there being other ways of doing this, and some of the policies that the government have put in place have been, in the proper literature and criticism, indicated as better and, in fact, more effective influences on the levels of private health cover.</para>
<para>But why is there no analysis, when we see legitimate health economists like Stephen Duckett and others indicating that if that $2.5 billion had gone directly into public hospitals we would have seen a better outcome? Remember that when this measure was put in place the mantra was that the rebate on private health insurance would cut down on public hospital waiting lists. That is a nonsense. Any progress that has been made in that area has not been because of this, because this has seen a mopping up of other things. In the health policy area we do not need another whim, change of heart or something we have to pull out of the drawer because an election is coming up; we need the government to step back and actually say what they are on about. They are not going forward to the public and saying, âThe main reason that we put these things in place is that we are going to shift the cost of health from the public sector to the private sector.â</para>
<para>The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare study shows that, because of the increases in the private provision that people have had to make for their health, slowly but surely our Australian health system is going the way of the American health system, where we see extraordinary levels of GDP being spent on health for outcomes that are much worse, especially if we look at the difference in the way in which the disadvantaged and the advantaged have access to health in America. Over the last 10 years, slowly but surely we have seen the percentage of GDP spent on health ratcheting up from around the eight per cent mark to around the 10 per cent mark. This is outlined in the analysis in the document released late last month on health and welfare expenditures. I urge those in the government that are giving advice to Minister Abbott to have a look at this study, to analyse what the problems are and to not make a glib analysis to hide behind. It is true that this study indicates that aspects of the increase in out-of-pocket expenses are because of things like medical appliances and dental health.</para>
<para>Figure 2 shows the expenditure increasing from below $50,000 million in 1993-94 to over $70,000 million in 2003-04, expressed in 2002-03 prices. We have to ask ourselves whether we have really seen that sort of increase in the outcomes. If we have spent 40 per cent more over a 10-year period, can we honestly go to the community and tell them that they are seeing outcomes that are better in the order of that magnitude? I do not think that we can. The other problem that we confront is that many of the policies of the government do not address the problem of the ageing of the Australian community. Whilst the Treasurerâs mantra is that demographics are our destinyâhe often trundles that out and goes on about it being confronting and that we have to slash, burn and cutâthe government never look at alternatives.</para>
<para>The government scoff at Laborâs Medicare Gold proposal but they do not address the problem that Medicare Gold identified. The analyses of moneys that are expended by private health and by Medicare indicate that it is older Australians that are incurring the greater costâbecause their medical needs are greater. Medicare Gold was about the Commonwealth taking over that cost, which had a number of advantages. Firstly, it becomes seamless for the people involved. They would not have had to worry about whether they were going into institutional aged care or about their health problems. They would not have had to worry about whether the Commonwealth or the states were paying. In fact, because Labor would have covered private health insurance, they would not have had to worry about that.</para>
<para>It not only had that advantage for older Australians but it also made private health insurance more efficient, because we would have taken those people who had higher health needs out of the sector. This would have allowed for that sector to sell packages to their clients that were cheaper and would have been of greater incentive for people who wanted to make their own private provisions. But we do not see that type of analysis from the government; instead, we see proposals like this one that we are debating today. The governmentâs proposal that came out in the election campaign was supposed to have been about catering for older people and ratcheting up the private health insurance rebate based on age. There was no understanding about people not being able to afford private health insurance when there was a 30 per cent rebate and what it would mean if there were a 35 per cent or 40 per cent rebate. The government went against what health economists said and proposed to put older people into the private health schemes.</para>
<para>Because the government have made this policy on the run, the legislation will not address those problems. In the run-up to the election, the government placed a value on the levels over which the rebate was going to be made, and they broke the promise. When the government found out during the election campaign that this was inconsistent and untenableâwhen they had had advice about the analysis that on an ongoing basis something would have to be done about itâthey broke the promise. But of course the gallery is not really worried about that, because this is a Liberal government. A lot of people are not worried about it because they have an expectation that the Howard government will deceive them on these sorts of things. But what galls me is that, if it were this side of the House or a Labor government, the scrutiny would be greater. What we need from the government is a reassessment overall of how they see Australia going forward and protecting our good health system by putting in place measures that will make it better. This legislation does not do that. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI rise tonight to talk on the <inline ref="R2376">Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005</inline>. At the outset I am fairly alarmed that we are discussing a âsafety netâ. I always thought a safety net was put in place if something was going to fall or if something bad was about to happenâfor example, if you are up on a trapeze and you are about to fall over. It worries me a great deal that Medicare has got to such a stage that we need to put a safety net under it. Surely the universal health cover that all Australians in this country have come to know and love should not be propped up by a safety netâone that is so faulty that, after only after a few short months, we are already amending it. After a few short months, we are in here moving amendments that will disadvantage people who already need to access the safety net. That is the irony of this bill.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We on this side of the House opposed these measures when they were introduced and we will oppose them again because it is bad policy. Nothing in this bill will assist the health care of our nation. Nothing in this bill will assist those people out there who are in genuine need of access to health professionals. It was quite illuminating to read the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline>. I will read the concluding commentsâand I know that is a no-noâbut I was just astounded at the frankness of the person who drafted the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline>. It is summed up quite remarkably in the concluding comments:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">In the short term, the increases to the Medicare Safety Net thresholds contained in this Bill will have the desired effect of stemming expenditure on the Safety Net by making it more difficult for patients to qualify for Safety Net benefits.</para>
<para>However, the effectiveness of the threshold increases in containing Safety Net expenditure in the medium to longer terms is uncertain. Arguably, the reason expenditure on the Safety Net has blown out to the extent that it has since March 2004 is not a result of the threshold levels. Rather, it is a result of the Safety Netâs structure, whereby Safety Net benefits are not tied to any price signalsâthat is, they are uncapped and effectively unregulated. This being the case, increasing the thresholds will limit the cost of the Safety Net in the short term but controlling aggregate expenditure in the medium-longer term may still prove to be problematic.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline>. It is not even the Labor Party. It sums it up. This is a short-term measure designed to stem a budgetary flow problem. It is not about assisting the health care of our nation. It is doing nothing about stemming the flow of money going into and out of the medical system. It is not about assisting patients in their need to access timely, affordable medical treatment.</para>
<para>It is really quite astounding that the safety net was introduced with so little thought and so little understanding of how the health budget works, but I suppose we should not be surprised. We have a Minister for Health and Ageing who cares nothing about his portfolio. He shows no interest in his portfolio whatsoever, and that is highlighted beautifully in respect of this bill. When the government had to come in post the election and say, âOops, we got it wrong and weâre now going to have to change it,â where was the minister? Nobody really knows, but he could not comment. The Prime Minister had to come out on behalf of the minister for health and say, âTerribly sorry. You know that ironclad guarantee we gave? Oops, dear, forgive meâI had my fingers crossed, really, at the time. Weâre going to change our mind.â</para>
<para>But that was not what the minister was saying prior to the election. No, as the member for Scullin has rightly said, the minister was out there bagging all our policies but at the same time claiming:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I absolutely guarantee that the safety net, as the Government has put it into operation, will continue. I absolutely guarantee that.</para>
<para>This Government does not believe in cutting spending on health.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That was what the minister said prior to the election. And it was only a nanosecond after the election that the government dumped that promise. Again, on <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners</inline>:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Ticky Fullerton: Will this Government commit to keeping the Medicare-plus-safety-net as it is now in place after the election?</para>
<para class="block">Tony Abbott: Yes.</para>
<para class="block">Ticky Fullerton: Thatâs a cast-iron commitment?</para>
<para class="block">Tony Abbott: Cast-iron commitment. Absolutely.</para>
<para class="block">Ticky Fullerton: 80 per cent of out-of-pocket expenses rebatable over $300, over $700?</para>
<para class="block">Tony Abbott: That is an absolutely rock solid, iron-clad commitment.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I am not sure what definition the minister has of ârock solid, ironclad commitmentâ. It seems a little different to mine. Mine would be that we have actually committed to that, not that we are here today debating increasing those thresholds. Yes, as I said at the outset, the increase of the thresholds may have a short-term effect on the budget bottom line, but it is not going to help people access health care, which I would have thought is the bottom line of providing a health policy to this nation.</para>
<para>What is the real problem here, and why has it not been fixed? At the time the legislation was introduced, a Senate inquiry summed it up very simply, very easily: if you do not regulate and cap the charges that doctors put onto their fees, this will just implode. And that is exactly what has happened. It has imploded in three very critical areas, but three areas in which it is very easy for specialists particularly to move their costs from in hospital to out of hospital. It has been in obstetrics, in mental health and in plastic surgery.</para>
<para>You do not really go around saying, âNo, Iâm not going to have the obstetrician turn up to the birth of my baby.â You might if you know everything is going to go fine. You might be very happyâand a lot of people areâto have a midwife there. But, if you think anything minor is going to happen, you want to know that that obstetrician is there. I remember very vividly this day six years ago, because it was the day that I gave birth to my adoring Madeleineâand I want to wish my gorgeous girl a very happy sixth birthday because I am here and missing it very much, I can tell you.</para>
<para>For my first child I had full private health insurance. I went to Jessie Mac inside Monash Medical Centre because my husband was far happier that I was inside the public hospital and I was a bit happier to go private with the doctor of my choosing, so we both got the outcome we wanted. I paid $1,000 out of pocket on top of my full private health cover. The second time around with lovely baby John it was up to $1,200 out of pocket. My staff member recently gave birth to a child, and that out-of-pocket expense was up to $2,500. The obstetricians can now push this onto the safety net. At the time, I did not begrudge paying it. I was going to a specialist. She was a phenomenal doctor, and her medical indemnity was going through the roof because she did such complicated births. I was happy to pay and I could afford to, but not all of my constituents can, and not all of the constituents represented by the people in the room can find that money and somehow pay it.</para>
<para>The Prime Minister and the minister for health talk about choice. That is fantastic if you, like me, are in metropolitan Melbourne, where you can actually find a range of obstetricians. But if you are in a regional centre, perhaps, like the member for Ballarat, or in a rural areaâas Deputy Speaker Adams, in the chair, would attest toâor in the outer suburbs of Melbourne or Sydney you do not have a choice. You probably have the one doctor going, if you are lucky. You may have one obstetrician around. You do not have bargaining power. You do not have price control. You are going to pay, because that is your only choice. And what has that done? It has just ratcheted up the cost and it has ratcheted up the safety net system.</para>
<para>I have also had the joy, or the misfortune, of having to use a plastic surgeon. Before anyone gasps, it was not for me; it was for my baby. My baby was born with what is known as bilateral syndactyly, or fused fingers. So I am very indebted to one of Melbourneâs leading plastic surgeons, whose other specialty is paediatric hand surgery. He does a lot of work in his private practice to supplement what he does in the public sector. Again, I went as a private patient, but I was $6,000 out of pocket. Again, I am not going to begrudge that, because my child now has functional fingersâand when he was born he did look a bit like ânanu, nanuâ and we were terribly worried. But now he is a fully functional, terrifying toddler. So you do those things, you make those choices, but a lot of other people whose children may have been born with slight defects like mine would not have had the choice of going to the top plastic surgeon in Victoria. No, hopefully they would rely upon that doctor still doing public work. But that is not the case, because this government has its funding so skewed that doctors are running away from the public sector and totally going private. We are denying basic medical care to most of our community, those who simply cannot afford to pay.</para>
<para>Most of the articles at the time of the safety net indicated that the health care market was going to be abused by the doctors, but it did not seem that the Minister for Health and Ageing cared. An article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> in April 2005 quoted the minister as saying:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I think health is a market.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It continues:</para>
<quote>
<para>Abbott says that there are no set medical guidelines and warns people to find out medical costs before they proceed with an operation.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is all well and good if you can do it, if you are not already on the table about to have the procedure. The article continues:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">â[Thatâs] so if they think they are being ripped off blind they can go elsewhere,â he says.</para>
<para>Ripped off or not, everyone knows health is a huge and growing expense, for patients and for governments. No one has a solution and a worrying trend is emerging: some specialists are deserting the public sector where the government caps payments to doctors, in favour of working in the private sector where they can, in theory, charge what they like and, in many cases, are doing just that.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Another quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> says:</para>
<quote>
<para>Australia Institute deputy director and health economist Richard Denniss said: âFor things to blow out so far and so quickly shows [the government] really doesnât have a good understanding of the cost drivers in health ... and itâs unlikely that this will be the last time the government needs to tinker with the system.â</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So what we get, time after time, are blowoutsâno cost control, no understanding of the system, no capping of the fees.</para>
<para>I have recently written to the ministerâand I am yet to get a responseâon behalf of a constituent who went to have a mammogram. She comes from a family background of breast cancer and this was just something she had to do. She was charged $308.85 for her mammogram and received only $165 back. As the Medicare reimbursement is 85 per cent, this means her doctor charged $113 above the schedule fee for a procedure that was needed. The tragedy of this situation is that, if my constituent had received better advice from her doctor, she probably could have had this mammogram free of charge. But she did not know that. She needed the mammogram, she thought this was the only way to go and now she is $113 out of pocket. I wrote to the minister, saying:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I think it would be unfortunate if doctors were taking advantage of the governmentâs safety net policy to overcharge women trying to maintain their health. As my constituent has a family history of breast cancer, I feel this experience is particularly disgraceful. Can you please inform me of what the government is doing to ensure that doctors do not take advantage of the safety net and what you, as minister, intend to do to rein in the inflationary nature of this policy.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The only thing the minister is doing is putting before this House a bill that, as we have indicated, will do nothing in the long term. It may do something as a short-term budgetary measure, but it will do nothing to assist with health costs in this country, it will do nothing in the provision of services and it certainly will not help the most vulnerable in our community who cannot afford doctors.</para>
<para>I do not want to say that doctors are rorting the system but, sadly, that is what is happening. Unless we put in decent policy, all we are going to be doing is creating more and more safety nets to ensure that people are not falling through the gaps. We need people in this country to know that Medicare is the system it was designed to be: a universal health system for all. I stand opposed to the bill before the House.</para>

<para>âIn rising to speak in this debate on the <inline ref="R2376">Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005</inline>, I find myself again witnessing the government in full backflip mode, with the well-rehearsed dexterity of a leading trapeze troupe. While there are times it is nice to be right, this is certainly not one of them. My constituents and the broader Australian community deserve much better than this. This amendment says, in plain English, that the government got the basic maths on this policy wrong.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Setting aside the fact that the Medicare safety net has only become necessary because the government presided over a massive collapse in bulk-billing rates and a massive hike in the costs of going to see a doctor, turning Medicare from a universal system for all into a three-tiered system that sees different levels of service and affordability, depending on where you live and what your level of income isâleaving that fundamental point aside and looking at what this bill does regarding the safety netâthis bill shows that the entire concept was flawed from the beginning. The Minister for Health and Ageing basically said, âLetâs have a completely uncapped rebate, and then weâll just let any doctor charge whatever he or she wants.â The minister added two and two and came up with 22ânot good enough, Minister.</para>
<para>In recent weeks we have heard again and again that those who do not espouse Australian values should just clear off. If only the members sitting across from me were subject to that same set of standards, this would be a very different place. I thought that, given that both the Minister for Education, Science and Training and the Minister for Health and Ageing see themselves as contenders for leadership, it would be interesting to apply Brendanâs values to Tonyâs actions. Let us look at some of the values that the minister for education expects Australian children to have. The first on the ministerâs value list is honesty and trustworthiness. It is described as the capacity to be honest and sincere and to seek the truth. But that seems to be beyond the Minister for Health and Ageing.</para>
<para>During the federal election campaign in September 2004, Treasury figures showed clearly that the cost of the Medicare safety net would be more than double the approximate $120 million originally forecast for the 2004-05 financial year. Further modelling showed that the total cost of the safety net over the four years from 2004-05 to 2007-08 would have blown out to around $1.05 billion. At that point, the minister had his opportunity to seek the truth, to establish whether the Medicare safety net thresholds could stay at the same levels with such clearly ballooning costs. Either he did not want to know about it and he failed to seek the truth, or else he knew and he chose not to be honest and sincere about it.</para>
<para>The minister for health gave us his now infamous rock solid, ironclad commitment, not on one but on numerous occasions. On 16 September 2004, at a doorstop, he said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I absolutely guarantee the safety net, as the Government has put it into operation, will continue. I absolutely guarantee that.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">On 6 September, on <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners</inline>, the minister was asked:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Will this Government commit to keeping the Medicare-plus-safety-net as it is now in place after the election?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The minister responded:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Yes.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The minister was questioned again:</para>
<motion>
<para class="block">Thatâs a cast-iron commitment?</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">The minister replied:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Cast-iron commitment. Absolutely.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The minister was then asked:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">80 per cent of out-of-pocket expenses rebatable over $300, over $700?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The minister responded by saying:</para>
<motion>
<para class="block">That is an absolutely rock solid, iron-clad commitment.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">We now know just how ironclad and rock solid this commitment was. It was broken in less than two months. The Australian electorate now demands that the minister tell the truth. When did he find out about the safety net blow-out and why did he keep it a secret? There are other secrets the minister refuses to share, despite their importance to the electorate. Medicare safety net data analysed by electorate has been released only onceâon 16 September 2004. The data released then showed how powerfully the safety net was favouring high-income electorates, especially those held by the members sitting opposite. In fact, some of the wealthiest people in the countryâwith median weekly family incomes of $1,296 to $1,759âlive in the 12 electorates where Medicare safety net repayments are the highest in the country, while in the bottom 12 electoratesâthose that have received, on average, less than $66,000 per electorate in safety net rebatesâthe median weekly family incomes are just half that amount. Since September 2004, the minister has refused to share further data so that we can look at whether this trend is continuingâmore secrets from the minister. He is certainly not seeking out the truth, and he is certainly not being honest and trustworthy.</para>
<para>The next value espoused by the government is doing your best, which means pursuing excellence and seeking to accomplish something worthy and admirable, another feature that is missing from the Medicare safety net. When the Medicare safety net was introduced in March 2004, we said that it was flawed and unworkable; we said that it would create health care cost blow-outs; we said that it would benefit the rich at the expense of the poor; and we said that there was a better way to do this. But the government stuck to its guns.</para>
<para>There are two possibilities. One is that the government genuinely thought this package would deliver fair, equitable and affordable primary health care within its own budget constraints. The Senate Select Committee on Medicare, at its January 2004 inquiry, heard many submissions throwing doubt on this premise. Several commentators noted that the concept itself was flawed. The Australian Consumers Association said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">There is a major fiscal design flaw in that the safety nets ... provide an open-ended opportunity for medical practitioners to charge as they please ... We are concerned about price inflation in the health care sector, for the long-term policy responses to price inflation usually involve some combination of higher consumer out-of-pocket expenses and arbitrary rationing of services.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is exactly what we are now seeing. The Australian Council of Social Services noted:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The proposed safety net removes the sense of public disapproval of excessive charging and makes the level of threshold the only lever with which to control public spending. If the thresholds are reduced to a level which makes the safety net attractive to patients, it is hard to see how health price inflation would be managed.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">These comments, coming from respected national organisations that represent those who most need good health care, were clearly ignored by the government, with its usual blend of arrogance and incompetence. Pity the poor adviser who had to point out to the ministerâwho has himself confessed that he is insensitiveâthat this policy would not work.</para>
<para>The other, much more sinister, possibility is that the government knew exactly what this would mean, and it was not worried about it. Those who spend more on health are, not surprisingly, those who have more to spend. It is not rocket science to deduce that those who will benefit most if you put in place a system which simply helps those who are spending moreâwithout structuring it properlyâwill be those who can spend more.</para>
<para>The next value espoused by the Minister for Education, Science and Training, against which I am testing the Minister for Health and Ageingâs actions, is the value of a fair go. According to the minister for educationâs values for Australian schooling, a fair go means that we demand the pursuit and protection of the common good, where all people are treated fairly in a just society. Recent submissions to the Senate Community Affairs Committee overwhelmingly tell us that the increase in the threshold that is represented by this bill is unfair. The Public Health Association noted:</para>
<quote>
<para>The governmentâs proposed amendments to thresholds under the Medicare Safety Net would harm those least able to afford out of pocket expenses for health care. The increase ... will affect those who are more likely to be both poor and sick. This group has the least financial resilience and is most vulnerable to falling into poverty traps brought on by medical costs.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The National Rural Health Alliance pointed out that:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... a universal system is politically stronger and safer than a targeted safety net. Co-payments ... do not have these positive characteristics. They are regressive, more complex, and partial.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The Rural Doctors Association of Australia stated:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The 30 percent of Australians who live in rural and remote areas carry a higher disease burden and tend to be poorer than urban Australians, yet they do not have equitable access to either public or private health services ... Raising the threshold is likely to penalise poorer patients and those with chronic conditions.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Even the Australian Medical Association, who initially supported the concept of the safety net, criticised the amendments. It said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">In the view of the AMA, the measure will impact hardest on those who are in most need of health services (chronically ill) and those least able to afford to pay for such services (low income groups).</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In fact, out of the 11 submissions to the Senate committee, only oneâprovided by the ministerâs own departmentâdoes not criticise the amendments before this House for their unfairness and inequity. That submission states that over one million fewer people will qualify in 2006, but it fails to ask the crucial question: whether the make-up of that group will be a fair and equitable representation across the community. That data on the distribution of safety net rebates across electorates may be a year old, but it is still the strongest indicator we have that the majority of the cash is going to those who need it least. The change in threshold is unlikely to redress that imbalance.</para>
<para>The Medicare safety net was nothing more than a political fixârather than a serious attempt to address the bulk-billing crisis at the last election. While there have been moderate but sporadic improvements in bulk-billing, out-of-pocket costs continue to increase. Families are now forced to pay an average of $24.61 per medical visit, compared with $21.02 last December. The ABS household expenditure survey has shown that medical costs were one of the largest expenditure items in the family budget. Some families are in the situation where they literally cannot afford to get sick. That is definitely not a fair go from this minister.</para>
<para>The next of the minister for educationâs espoused values that I want to look at is responsibility. Responsibility, according to the minister for educationâs <inline font-style="italic">Values for Australian schooling</inline>, requires one to be accountable for oneâs own actions and to resolve differences in constructive, non-violent and peaceful ways. Ministerial responsibility is a cornerstone of the Westminster system. It is absolutely fundamental to the system of accountability. It is hard to imagine how the ministerâs actions on this matter of the safety net could be described as responsible. Many commentators have written about the retreat of ministerial responsibility as a means of holding governments to account, while some have tried to justify this in the face of ministerial overload and unreasonable expectations. However, even this more conservative definition cannot save this minister. This was not a departmental blunder that the minister had no control or knowledge of. The blow-out in the costs of the safety net were certainly known by the department by mid-July, and we can only hope that the department passed the information on to its minister. By the time of the last election we knew, through the Charter of Budget Honesty process, that the Medicare safety net had blown out to $1.4 billion over four years.</para>
<para>On top of this, a number of respected health and political investigative journalists highlighted the emerging problems with the program. In April, Tom Noble, health editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline>, reported that specialists across a range of disciplines were likely to exploit the safety net scheme. If the minister did know about the massive increase in costs and yet took no action prior to the election, that is taking irresponsibility to new heights. In fact, not only did the minister take no action to correct the problem; he hid the problem. He then stood by while the government spent $20 million of taxpayersâ money to promote the Medicare safety net. Not once did he say, âHang on a minute; we think we have the maths of this wrong.â Not for one minute did he actually say, âWhat we are saying in this ad will not be available after the election.â Responsibility is clearly a foreign concept to this governmentâand to this minister in particular.</para>
<para>By any standard of parliamentary responsibility the minister should have resigned. However, the Howard government is so out of touch with community and parliamentary standards that this does not seem to worry either of them very much. One of Australiaâs leading academics in this area wrote this in a recent study about ministerial responsibility:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Much depends on whether the individual minister is a mate of the leader and the extent to which the issue has a leg politically.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It is a sad day in Australian politics when one of the cornerstones of our system of responsibility has been corrupted because of who you may or may not be friends with. All those years of being Howardâs attack dog has paid off for this minister. Maybe the minister could have salvaged his reputation, which is now in tatters, by taking some responsibility for the issue and fixing the problem before the election.</para>
<para>The Medicare safety net blow-out problem is not fixed by this bill. The minister will not give an unequivocal commitment that the Medicare safety net is now running on track to budget expectations and that the government will not seek to amend it again. He was happy to give a rock solid, ironclad guarantee in the context of an election campaign, but now, two years out from an election, knowing that he is going to have to come back into this place, if he is still minister for health, and amend the Medicare safety net again, he is unable to give a guarantee that he will not change it. We all know why he is not giving those commitments. I do not think it is running on track. Even with these threshold changes in place, in the next two or three years we will see the Medicare safety net blow out again, and it will blow out again because it is inflationary in its very design. I am willing to bet that there will be a sequel to this bill. Whether it will be starring the hapless health minister we have at the moment or some other Liberal star, we will see a series of other bills that will see the pruning back of the Medicare safety net.</para>
<para>The government will come back and change the thresholds again, bringing increased health costs and adding to the pressure on families across Australia. I never thought I would say this, but maybe the minister for education is onto something when he says that those who do not espouse his Australian values should just clear off. I have not had time in this debate to go through all the values he has espoused, but I reckon it would not be hard to come up with an answer under âcare and compassionâ, which is defined by the minister for education as âcare for self and othersâ. The minister for health has got one of those right.</para>
<para>Integrity is another value espoused by the minister for education as one that Australian schoolchildren should follow. Integrity, according to the minister for education, is ensuring consistency between words and deeds. Again, it is not hard to imagine how the minister for health comes up when measured against this value. It is clear that the minister for health has failed to espouse the values of responsibility, a fair go, giving it your best shot, honesty and trustworthinessâas espoused for the minister for education. Perhaps, with the evidence that we have before us with the Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005, it is time for this hapless health minister to hit the road.</para>

<para>âI welcome this opportunity to speak on the <inline ref="R2376">Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005</inline>, because this is a classic case of shutting the gate after the horse has bolted, as you well know, Mr Deputy Speaker Somlyay. Despite the protestations that might otherwise come from the government, this Medicare safety net in its first year and a half of operation has not been the great reform to Medicare that the minister for health trumpeted it as being when he introduced the concept prior to last yearâs budget and subsequent election. Indeed, you will recall the position of the Labor Party at that time. Firstly, we opposed the introduction of this safety net and we expressed our concern at the inflationary effect it would have on health costs. I am sure you can recall how that view was pooh-poohed by the government side of the House, with the minister and the Prime Minister using the airwaves to denigrate the position of the opposition, saying that there would be no blow-outâand of course we had the infamous cast-iron guarantee.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Medicare safety net policy first came into effect in March 2004 and, as others have said, the policy pays a rebate of 80 per cent of out-of-pocket costs for MBS services out of hospital for registered participants after a threshold has been reached. The level at which the thresholds were set became the subject of a series of protracted discussions between the minister for health and minor party senators who successfully negotiated that the thresholds be set atÂ $300 for concession card holders and FTB part B recipients and at $700 for all others. We opposed the policy on the basis that it was inequitable and because of its inflationary effect on health costs.</para>
<para>During 2004 the policy became the centrepiece of the governmentâs Strengthening Medicare campaign, which, as we all remember, involved an extensive advertising campaign across all media that built on the previous ministerâs A Fairer Medicare package, costingÂ $20Â million. We are used to this government using public funds to advertise for political purposes. Here was just another example. The position adopted by the government was that the safety net was going to be good for the health care of Australiansâit would be equitable and it would not be inflationary. But a very short time after it was put in place very serious concerns emerged.</para>
<para>Within the first three-month period of its operation, the cumulative number of families and singles registered for the safety net reached 500,000 people, while the first signs of a cost blow-out emerged as safety net expenditure outgrew the estimated expenditure by 40 per cent. This pattern continued until the commencement of the caretaker period of government, when the election was called on 29Â August 2004. Indeed, the variation between estimated expenditure and actual expenditure reached 60 per cent in July and 70 per cent in August 2004.</para>
<para>Senate estimates hearings have revealed that prior to the caretaker period the minister for health and the minister for finance were both aware of the cost blow-out in the safety net but they failed to address the issue prior to the election. Why would that be? Here we have the government going to the people with this as one of the centrepieces of its public policy in the lead-up to an electionâselling to the Australian people the benefits of this policy, telling the Australian people that it was equitable, that it was fair and that it would not be inflationary. Yet the government knew prior to the electionâthey know it, you know it and now hopefully the Australian community understands and recognises itâthat the costs had blown out, that it was inflationary and that it was inequitable. The government knew these things, yet they advertised falsely and dishonestly to the Australian community in the lead-up to the last election that that was not the case.</para>
<para>When these concerns were raised and expressed in the public domain by the opposition, what we got was denigration and abuse from the governmentâand particularly from Minister Abbott. That is a major issue here. It rests on the shoulders of Minister Abbott, acting as a spokesman for the governmentâJohn Howardâs protector, one of the Praetorian Guard. Minister Abbottâs deceit and his failure to come clean prior to the last election about what he knew when about the safety net blow-out is a major issue here. This is a serious allegation which demonstrates not only hypocrisy but, most fundamentally, gross dishonesty. Gross dishonesty was shown to the Australian community, which was taken for granted, while at the same time it was said that somehow or other the views which the opposition was representing were false representations of the facts. As it has come to pass, we now all know that what the opposition said at the time was truthful and that the assumptions inherent in the oppositionâs propositions, put properly at the time, appear now to have been correct.</para>
<para>The real questions are: when did the minister for health and the minister for finance know about this blow-out; why didnât they come clean with the Australian community; and what was known by the Prime Minister? I cannot believe that this coterieâthis cabal who run the leadership of the Liberal Party under the stern chairmanship of the Prime Ministerâdid not collude and were not aware of what the true situation was. I cannot believe that they were not advised by their advisory staff nor made aware by the departments of finance and healthâthat no-one said, âHey, we have a problem.â I would be very surprised if the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet were not raising alarm bells about the impact of what the government was saying at the time and about the fact that it was fundamentally misleading the Australian community. We know that in that election the government decided to proceed with its $20 million Medicare campaign, even though the cost of the safety net was blowing out.</para>
<para>Mr Deputy Speaker, you have to wonder why, unfortunately, the community are so disrespectful about politicians. Just maybe it is because some politiciansânot all politiciansâhave fabricated evidence and been fundamentally dishonest with the Australian community. It is no wonder that the community then say, âWe have a real problem with what you politicians say, because we cannot guarantee that you are going to tell us the truth.â</para>

<para>âIn the case of the government, as I am reminded by my colleague the shadow ministerâas though I needed remindingâit does not. We knowâit is now on the recordâthat Minister Abbott did not tell the truth.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I have some respect for you, Mr Deputy Speaker Somlyay, as someone I have known for many years. I can talk frankly to you and I know you will be honest in return. I cannot say that about the minister for health. Firstly, I have not known him for as long as I have known you and, secondly, I know from what I have seen of him publicly that he is not half the figure you are in terms of his own personal integrity and honesty. He has shown his preparedness to be fundamentally dishonest and to mislead the Australian community in a way that was designed to ensure that the Australian community did not understand the true state of Medicare that would result under his stewardship with the introduction of this scheme.</para>
<para>Now we have seen the governmentâs decision to lift the threshold for both low- and high-income earners, and even that action has been inequitable. The lower income threshold has been increased from $300 to $500, an increase of 66 per cent, while the higher income threshold has been increased from $700 to $1,000, an increase of 44 per cent. So, relatively speaking, lower income families will have to pay more before qualifying for a discount. To me, that is not fair.</para>
<para>I am not surprised, though, when reading through the information about the electorates that do best out of this process. Mr Deputy Speaker, it may surprise youâalthough I am not sureâthat the electorates that do best out of it are those on the North Shore of Sydney; I think I am right in saying that. Would it surprise you to know that the second-last one on the entire list of electorates is my own of Lingiari? We have at the very top some of the richest electorates in Australia doing extremely well out of this system and, at the bottom, the poorest of Australians doing very poorly out of it. We know that, in relative terms, lower income earners now pay more for the minister for healthâs broken promiseâhis âironcladâ guarantee during last yearâs election campaign to retain the Medicare safety net thresholds.</para>
<para>Much has been said, both prior to the election and especially this year, about the cost of the safety net blowing out. I will go to the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline>; I think it is illuminating. It provides us with a table showing that, in November 2003, the safety net as originally proposed was expected to cost $266.3 million in the first four years of its operation, from 2003-04 to 2006-07. In March 2004, the revised four-year cost of the safety net was $440 million. In September 2004, the cost over four years had blown out to approximately $1.05 billion. We are only talking about 400 per cent here. Let us be clear about this: it is not a lotâonly 400 per cent! Then in April 2005 the government confirmed that the cost of the safety net, if the current threshold levels were maintained, would be $1.4 billion to 30 June 2008 and $1.65 billion to 30 June 2009. That is why we hear the government announcing its proposal to mend the safety nets.</para>
<para>Who warned the government of this when it announced this program? It was my colleague the shadow minister for health, a woman of great perspicacity, who was able to foresee the problems that would dog this ministerâand we would not want to say that he has been barking up the wrong tree. However, as I said earlier, from the government there has been a fundamental dishonesty. It has been fundamentally unable to understand the weakness of its own public policy position and it has displayed an absolute unwillingness to come clean with the Australian community.</para>
<para>I do not think that is something we should be tolerating in this place. As has been pointed out by others elsewhere, in the past ministers have resigned for a lot less than this. But the minister swaggers into this place, approaches the dispatch box and swears on his heart that he actually thought this was truthful at the time. We do not believe him. I am sorry to say that, when we go to the question of what the Australian community think, we know that, despite the dishonesty, well-informed persons in the Australian medical community are all disparaging of these proposals to raise the threshold. If you lead people to a belief, if you give them a cast-iron guarantee but then as soon as it turns a little sour you expose your own lack of credibility by backing down, by backing away from the guarantees once given, then why wouldnât people be concerned about your integrity?</para>
<para>The Australian Medical Association, Catholic Health Australia, the Australian Council of Social Services, the Australian Consumers Association and the Doctors Reform Society have all been critical of this decision, for various reasons. When someone gives a cast-iron guarantee, we expect it to be a cast-iron guarantee. This minister has exposed himself in a position where he has not been able to tell us the truth. Instead of accepting responsibility for the fact that he misled the Australian community and told us a whopping fibâ</para>

<para>âI will delete the âwhoppingâ! But, when someone tells us an untruth, whether or not we call it a fib we know it is an untruth. This minister should have resigned after the election. The Prime Minister should have sacked him. One thing is for certain: the Australian community will not be fooled by this minister or by what he says anymore and they will not believe what he says about these issues, because of what he has done. He has the form; he has the track recordâhe has shown he is not to be trusted. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âin replyâThe Medicare safety net is good policy. It was good policy with thresholds of $300 and $700, and it remains good policy with thresholds at $500 and $1,000. I do not really think it serves much purpose to trawl over again and again in this House something which was well and truly canvassed in debates several months ago. Suffice it to say that everyone knows that the government support the safety net. We believe that it is the most important architectural change to the Medicare system since it began in 1984.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Members opposite do not support the safety net in any way, shape or form. They did not support it at the $300 and $700 thresholds, and they do not support it now. The truth is that, if members opposite had their way, there would be no safety net whatsoever. Next year 1.5 million Australians would be out of pocket, and every year some hundreds of millions of dollars would not be spent on health costs, dollars that would then have to be paid by individuals out of their own pockets. I think the issues are quite clear. This government supports the safety net. Members opposite do not. I think it is time that this question was resolved by the House.</para>

<para>âIn 2003, the government attempted to pass legislation that would have imposed a number of unreasonable industrial relations conditions on the capacity of universities to access additional funding. These were components of a package of legislative changes to higher education that the government was then attempting to win support for in the Senate. In order to secure majority support for the bulk of the package, the government agreed to drop these industrial relations measures from its higher education legislation. Following the last federal election and the recent changes in the composition of the Senate, the government has once again introduced the IR proposals that were not supported in the Senate in 2003.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>This bill proposes placing on universities various obligations to meet the provisions of the national governance protocols and the higher education workplace relations requirements. The universitiesâ basic grants for a year will increase by five per cent in 2006 and 7.5 per cent in 2007 and beyond, if the minister is satisfied that these conditions have been met. The higher education workplace relations requirements were jointly announced by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and the Minister for Education, Science and Training on 29 April 2005.</para>
<para>This bill seeks to put these higher education workplace relations requirements into legislation and to tie a proportion of annual funding to their observance. The higher education workplace relations requirements are consistent with the direction of government industrial relations policy for the work force generallyâthat is, for AWAs to override collective agreements. However, they go beyond the governmentâs declared intentions for the Australian work force. In particular, the higher education workplace relations reforms specify that every university employee must be offered an AWA by 31 August next year. This is clearly in excess of the governmentâs proposals for employees in other industries. Similarly, under the higher education workplace relations reforms, enterprise agreements will have to be stripped back to the safety net awards. These higher education workplace relations reforms will also lead to the removal of limitations on the employment mix of institutions in relation to casual and limited-term contract staff.</para>
<para>In general, the bill and the associated higher education workplace relations reforms are an attempt by the government to micromanage universities, regardless of outcomes negotiated at enterprise level by management and unions. The governmentâs approach compromises the independence of higher education institutions and threatens to diminish their international competitiveness by compelling the introduction of inferior terms and conditions of employment in an increasingly mobile and competitive international climate for the recruitment and retention of high-calibre academic staff.</para>
<para>The passage of this bill is damaging to Australiaâs national interest. Mr Deputy Speaker, you have to wonder: how could the government in all conscience have these proposals put when it knows that they are opposed by the university sectorânot only by the staff of the universities but by the vice-chancellors, those people responsible for managing what is arguably one of the best university systems in the world? They are now being told by the government that the government is going to micromanage their industrial relations affairs.</para>
<para>We know, and we have heard over the last day, what the government really means when it says it wants to reform industrial relations. Those guarantees that were there when I first joined the work forceâas a builderâs labourer in 1965âwill no longer apply. When I went onto the work site I got basic guarantees about what I was entitled to in terms of sick leave, holiday pay, overtime allowances, meal breaks et cetera. They will be gone. Whilst the government says that they are going to provide some guarantees to people under current award conditions, we know what that will mean in the future. It will mean that people who come onto these AWAs, whether in the university sector or not, will not be guaranteed the basic conditions that have been so much a part of the Australian industrial landscape.</para>
<para>We also know, despite the protestations of the government, from those people who are informed on the subject of industrial relations, that there will be no new economic nirvana as a result of these changes to workplace relations. There will be no dramatic increase in the competitiveness of Australian industry as a result of the general changes to industrial relations that the government proposes to introduce. We know all of this.</para>
<para>We know that those who are informed about the subject, even the most conservative commentators, are saying that the economic benefits that the government says will accrue to the Australian economy as a result of these changes to industrial relations are in fact illusory. What we know is that these changes are going to depress the Australian community. That is what is going to happen here. Those people who most want and need protection from the collective bargaining processes that unions are integrally involved with are going to be denied that protection, if the government has its way. We know already that AWAs are offered in the university sector. High-flyers regularly get particular deals, but donât forget that these AWAs must be compulsorily offered toâgiven to, made available to or bludgeoned intoâall university staff and other personnel by the end of August 2006.</para>
<para>Mr Deputy Speaker, do you know what will happen in regional universities? They are already suffering tremendously because of the withdrawal of government moneys from the university sector since this government came to powerâI think in the order of $5 billion has gone. What we know is that, if you live in, say, Alice Springs, and you work at the Charles Darwin University campus in Alice Springs, it is very likely that you are going to be exposed dreadfully if management decides that it wants to impose on you Australian workplace agreements that are both unfair and potentially unreasonable. They can do this, despite what the Prime Minister has said in the last 24 hoursâthat, if you do not like your employer, you should go somewhere else.</para>
<para>If you happen to live in a small, isolated community like Alice Springs, what options do you think you might have, Prime Minister? What alternative employment options do you think you might have if you are dissatisfied with your employer, who happens to be the university, and you believe the university is dealing with you unfairly? You will not have the option of going to another university or another place of higher learning to get a job, because there is not one. More than likely, you would have to cop it sweet. That is the problem. What this government is proposing will fundamentally undermine the working conditions of Australians, whether they work in the university sector or elsewhere.</para>
<para>If the Australian community thought there was great benefit in AWAs, they would be clamouring to get them, but we know that they do not believe there is that benefit. As a result of the changes that the government is proposing, we are not going to see an equal bargaining position. Imagine that you walk into a university to get your jobâperhaps as a contract cleaner, working in a library or as a technical assistant in a laboratoryâand they say, âHereâs a list of what weâre going to provide you with.â We know what that can mean. We heard evidence in question time today of how an employer can unreasonably and unfairly abuse their power to impose upon working people working conditions and a salary package which fundamentally undermine the workerâs positionâand they can destroy their entitlements. The package provides the worker with no real security and puts them in a position where the relationship is unequal.</para>
<para>We are told now that the government is trying to moderate the impact of trade unions as third parties in the negotiations that might happen between an employer and an employee. Funny, isnât it! It would seem that there is one consistent third-party intervener in the process of the relationship between a worker and the employer. That third party is, of course, the Australian government, who seeks to unreasonably interfere in the relationship between employers and employees, in the process of collective bargaining and in the role that the trade unions play in representing the interests of Australian workers in negotiations with employers about working conditions and other entitlements.</para>
<para>It is most unreasonable for the government to come into this place and tell the Australian community that it is in the Australian national interest to have this amendment to the higher education legislation that will only, in fact, enact the governmentâs IR policies. It will not give us any better educational outcomes. It will not improve productivity. It will do none of those things. It will just allow the government to say that it has had its ideological fix. The governmentâs ideological fix is the pogromâbecause that is what it isâthat the Prime Minister and his government have embarked upon since they got control of the Senate at the last election, and prior to that of course, to destroy the Australian union movement, to abolish collective bargaining and to undermine the working conditions of Australian workers. That is what the government is aiming to do. Then it claims it is in the best interests of the community. As I said earlier, informed commentators tell us there will be no dramatic increase in productivity or employment opportunities as a result of the IR changes the government has proposed. That will certainly be the case in the university sector.</para>
<para>As someone who has worked in a university, and as someone who has enjoyed opportunities as a result of a decent education and the sacrifice of others, I take great offence at the fact that now when young people start off in their working lives they will not have the same protections that I had. They will not have people to advise them in the way that I was able to be advised; they will be denied that opportunity. Imagine that you are a 23- or 24-year-old and you front up to a university campus where there is some informed industrial relations personnel manager who says, âMy boy, come in. Look at the deal that we have got to offer you. Weâve decided that weâre going to offer you a deal which says youâre going to sacrifice some of your holidays and work at times which are convenient to us.â It is going to change the whole relationship.</para>
<para>It is a matter of concern that we do not have the ability to absolutely ensure that the rights of Australian workers are properly protected. We know that this is not where we ought to be. We ought to be in the interests of protecting the rights of Australian workers, whether in universities or anywhere else. We are seeing here a path of destruction being wrought upon the Australian community in the university sector by this government. Universities are big; they are able to manage their own affairs and have historically done it well, and yet we have this intervention. They do not want these changes; the government is imposing them. The changes are unfair and unreasonable and should be opposed.</para>

</talker>
<para>âIn the <inline ref="R2387">Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Workplace Relations Requirements) Bill 2005</inline> we witness one of the worst cases of industrial blackmail in this country. In recent times the government has made much of the actions of the union movement in various industries and categorised the movement as being laden with thugs who are keen to impose their will on unsuspecting employers, yet the national government of Australia is engaged in one of the worst cases of industrial blackmail that this country has ever seen. The government is using its financial power to impose its ideology and industrial relations framework on the higher education system in this country.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is important to reflect on the record of this government after nine long years of incompetence. There has been a cut of some $5 billion from the universities of Australia. Australian students, many of them in my electorate of Corio, cannot get a place at an Australian university. Those students who are fortunate enough to get a place at university are saddled with debt, courtesy of this Prime Minister and the Liberal government. Families have been burdened by the policies of this government. But there are some fortunate ones. Never let it be said that the Prime Minister, John Howard, and the Liberal government never looked after their own. If you have $100,000 or a credit card you can buy your way into a course in Australia. But you cannot get there on merit, because this government has cut $5 billion from those universities and, in the process, has curtailed the opportunities of good Australian students.</para>
<para>What we see in this legislation is a gross interference in the affairs of the tertiary sector. The government wants to attack the working conditions of those whom we rely upon in our higher education institutions to keep us competitive and ahead of the rest of the world. In June this year, 17 of Australiaâs leading academics in the field of industrial relations and the labour market released a series of papers on the issue of industrial relations reform. In these papers, they identify the labour market issues that are facing Australia: labour and skills shortages, courtesy of the Howard government; a productivity slowdown, courtesy of the Howard government; work-family tensions, courtesy of the Howard government; and growth in low-paid, insecure employment, courtesy of John Howard and his Liberal government.</para>
<para>These academics are of the view that the governmentâs ideological approach to industrial relations will undermine peopleâs rights at work. It will deliver only one-way flexibility. It will do nothing to ease the work-family tensions; indeed, it will make them worse. It will have no direct positive impact on productivity, and it will disadvantage already marginalised individuals and groups. If those are the criteria for good policy, the sooner the Australian people get rid of this government the better.</para>
<para>There are many workers out there listening to this debate who put their faith in the Prime Minister at the last election. Already they have witnessed the betrayal. I would say to those workers: do not blame Labor when this Prime Minister strips away your wages and your conditions, and do not blame any Labor member in this parliament for making it harder for you and your families to balance work and the responsibilities of family and your community. There is only one person to blame, and you should have been aware of this Prime Ministerâs record when you made the decision to vote Liberal at the last election.</para>
<para>This Prime Minister has a record of saying one thing to you on a whole range of policy issues and doing another. This Prime Minister said to Australians that he would not sell the rest of Telstra. This Prime Minister told Australians to put their lives on the line for a lie in Iraqâa deception that has cost thousands of lives. There were no weapons of mass destruction, yet there were many working people who voted for the coalition on that basis. Of course, the Prime Minister has longstanding friends in this place. I note the presence tonight in the chamber of the member for Corangamite, from the electorate adjoining mine in the Geelong region. I say this to the member for Corangamite: you have the tall order of going into the Geelong community and convincing working people that they will keep their houses, when you intend to strip their penalty rates and the income that they have received from those means.</para>

That is one thing that the honourable member for Corangamite and I share, and I do believe that the honourable member for Corangamite and I share a desire for Deakin University to get a new medical school. We are in agreement on those matters. But we will never be in agreement on the contents of this particular bill, which seeks to impose on the Deakin administration a set of ideological straitjackets on the basis of the ideological prejudice of the Prime Minister and the Liberal Party, not related to good administration at all. I do not know how the member for Corangamite can sit there bald faced and front up to Deakin University, to the hundreds and hundreds of staff who live in his electorate, who will be forced onto AWAs and will have their wages and conditions cut and whose families will be affected by this legislation. How does the member for Corangamite look them in the eye when he goes around Deakin University? It is an extraordinary proposition that we have here today that this government seeks to interfere so much in the affairs of a great university like Deakin University.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Let us look at a few of the platitudes that are wheeled out by the government in regard to this legislation. The first is that employees will have freedom of choice. They will not have freedom of choice. For new employees, at least, it will be: âAccept a workplace agreement or look elsewhere for a job.â By what tortured definition of choice could you describe this as giving any employee or prospective employee a fair crack of the whip or a shot at the title? The freedom to choose to bargain collectively has also, in reality, gone. It is worth noting that this loss of the freedom to engage in collective bargaining has occurred because, simply, it is not guaranteed in any shape or form as a right in Australia as it is in the United States and in other OECD countries.</para>
<para>The government also claims that employees will have the same job security that exists before the bill is passed. This is clearly not the case, because there can be no limit set on the use of contract and casual staff. There will obviously therefore be an increase in both contract and casual staff at the expense of staff who have ongoing employment. The increase in casual staff will put great pressure on those full-time staff who have to support them in their work, because the casual staff are not familiar with the processes or the systems in place at the university. The increase in casual and contract staff clearly undermines the independence of the staff in this academic environment.</para>
<para>If AWAs get a foothold in universitiesâand I am hopeful that their staff will be wise enough to resist them all the wayâcan you imagine how impossible it will be for the human resources department to monitor and look after the staff with, say, 2,000 of their 5,000 staff on AWAs and the rest on an enterprise agreement? Each AWA has the potential, if the ministerâs dream becomes a reality, to be unique. Holidays, allowances, workloads, attendance, special conditions and salaries will be different for each employee. The efficiency gains the minister thinks he will make with the AWAs will be lost through gross inefficiencies in the administration of these contracts. Extra staff will have to be employed to keep track of all these variations. Imagine being a dean and trying to manage a department of 50 teaching and research staff, all of whom have these different conditions of employment.</para>
<para>The minister says minimum standards of salaries and conditions will be maintained. Of course they will not. Everybody knows that they will simply be whittled away. The award will become a skeleton award with few allowable matters. The minister does not propose how his minimum standards will be maintained in this legislation, but of course that is not surprising, because it is not his intention that they should be maintained. The minister knows very clearly the import and impact of this legislation, and so do his advisers. We can expect to see the wages of the administration staff and lecturers at universities like Deakin University in Geelong drastically reduced over time. But, as we know from our experience in other industries, the wages and salaries of management near the top will of course increase. This is a trend that has always occurred with these sorts of reforms.</para>
<para>This type of action or policy sets the scene for a change in culture at higher educational institutions. A âthem and usâ mentality will develop between the few at the top of the hierarchy, those close to the vice-chancellor, who will benefit from the introduction of AWAs, and the rest of the staff, who will have to provide the productivity increases with lower salariesânot a great way to build the vibrant, modern organisations that are critical to Australiaâs long-term competitiveness and development. As with all retrograde industrial relations changes, and those that are being proposed are certainly no exception, the impact will fall most heavily on women. It is always women who are overrepresented in the statistics of casual and contract staff.</para>
<para>Let me now turn to another reason for this legislation. It centres upon the lack of funding that the government has provided to these universities. This government has pushed the universities so hard with its reduced funding that there is serious concern now about the viability of many of them. The government can see itself as having to bail out a university or two before the term of this parliament is finishedâmaybe right at election time. So this governmentâs second aim is to set the scene so that the universities can reduce their costs through the appointment of staff on lower salaries and with worse working conditions. It will therefore be the administration of a university that is at fault, not the government, if they run into financial difficulties. The government will claim it gave the universities the ability to manage within their budgets, because they had AWAs available to them.</para>

<para>âI wish to raise a matter of great importance to many thousands of families across Australiaâthat is, the issue of young people in nursing homes. For those affected, it is of course an issue of huge importance. Many of us would find it difficult to understand what families with young people in nursing homes are going through. Many of the young people themselves are still very cognisant of their surroundings: they understand full well where they are, and they understand full well that they are somewhere inappropriate. The families of those affected also suffer. Parents who see their children suffer in nursing homes in situations which are appalling and grossly inappropriate feel a range of emotions. I know that many of them feel inappropriately guilty.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, there are over 6,000 people under the age of 65 in nursing homes across Australia. This issue receives very little publicity, but it is an issue of great tragedy and it is an issue which we as a nation need to better address. All governments need to do better. The federal government made funding available to the states and territories in 2003-04 under the aged care innovative pool for a two-year pilot program to investigate ways of moving young people out of aged care facilities. This is not enough. The Minister for Ageing wrote a letter to the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> last year which said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The states and territories have responsibility under the Commonwealth States/Territories Disabilities Agreement to provide supported accommodation for people with disabilities.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">But this not just about people with disabilities. It is about people who have suffered because of accidents in hospitals or because of other medical calamitiesâpeople who were perfectly healthy but who now find themselves in a position where they cannot support themselves or where their families cannot support them.</para>
<para>Labor took a promise to the last election that a Labor government would provide $50 million in interest-free capital loans to organisations that could demonstrate that their housing reflected the preferences and needs of young peopleâa worthwhile initiative which I hope the government also takes up. But I do not wish to make political points about this. All governments, including state governments, need to do better.</para>
<para>A particular constituent in my electorate is suffering in this situation at the moment. He is one of several in my electorate, but he is the one whom I will mention tonight. He is Mr Paul Leaver, a 53-year-old from St Clair. He suffered an accident at Nepean Hospital when his surgery for acute pancreatitis went wrong, and his legs needed to be amputated. They were amputated on 23 December 2003. Further complications dogged Paul following the amputation, including pneumonia, a collapsed lung and golden staph. After a seven-month stay in the intensive care unit of Nepean Hospital, Mr Leaver was transferred to a rehabilitation unit in the hospital. After an almost 12-month stay there, his bed was needed and at the age of 53 he was moved into an aged care facility.</para>
<para>To be in an aged care facility at such an age is simply inappropriate. In the words of Paulâs wife, Jan, whom I met at a mobile office in St Clair, it is âdemoralisingâ and âbeginning to wear him downâ. Paulâs and Janâs sheer frustration is reason enough for decision makers to move past pilot programs, show leadership and fund supported accommodation for young people. People as young as 16 are in nursing homes with 85-year-olds and 90-year-olds. They receive the best care possible from the nurses and medical practitioners in those nursing homes, but it is not appropriate. These people deserve better. As a nation we must do better, and I call on all governments to do better.</para>

<para>âLast week, on 4 October, I had the pleasure of announcing another major investment made by the government in the ever-expanding industry base of Bundaberg. Five hundred and fifty thousand dollars from the Sustainable Regions Program has been delivered to Coral Coast Mariculture, a consortium of visionaries who plan to establish the worldâs first soft shell crab aquaculture venture.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The funding will go towards the first stage of a three-stage $3.5 million project based at the port of Bundaberg. On-site earthworks are already under way, and the Sustainable Regions funding will go towards construction of the first stage of developing infrastructure, including buildings, ponds and technical facilities. When fully realised, the precinct is estimated to have a turnover of about 1.3 million crabs each year and to employ a direct and indirect work force of about 55 people.</para>
<para>Soft shell crabs are considered a gourmet delicacy around the world, with other nations harvesting crabs from the wild and holding them until they grow to the desired size, normally around 120 grams, and go through the moulting stage. That means that the crab does not have any sort of shell, or carapace, and the entire crab is able to be cooked and eaten. Although widely practised, this production method does not give proponents any control over the supply of crabs or any guarantee of the number of crabs able to be harvested.</para>
<para>The Bundaberg venture, a world first, involves crabs being grown from go to whoa in ponds and harvested when ready, giving Coral Coast Mariculture a guaranteed year-round supply of soft shell crabs. The market for soft shell crabs is phenomenal. Estimations of the value of the export market are as high as $1 billion, and I predict there will be very strong demand for these delicacies in the domestic market as well. It is a viable and sustainable alternative to the traditional wild-catch fishing industry and will enhance the regionâs existing seafood industry while at the same time protecting the environment.</para>
<para>I offer my congratulations to the proponentsâchairman Dr Clive Keenan, who is a marine scientist, adviser John Dugan and process manager Gary Blackâon being the latest recipients of a Sustainable Regions grant. Looking back at the list of ventures which have received funding under Sustainable Regions, it is quite evident that the program is achieving its goals of building new and dynamic industries from existing strengths.</para>
<para>Other funding recipients in the Bundaberg region include Queensland Sea Scallops, which has established a land based scallop hatchery near Bundaberg where natural scallop breeding stocks will be used to seed juvenile scallops back into selected seabeds in Hervey Bay; the Auspac goat meat processing venture, which will grow, slaughter and package ready-to-eat goat meat for the domestic and foreign markets; Austchilli, which has built new infrastructure so that it can expand production of its processed and packaged chilli, herb and vegetable purees; and Jabiru Aircraft, which used Sustainable Regions funding to type-certify the companyâs aircraft and engines. In fact, that small company is coming close to turning out its thousandth Australian-built aircraft, which is quite extraordinary for a small country community.</para>
<para>There is no doubt that the entire Wide Bay-Burnett region has really started to blossom with the wise investments made by the government from the Sustainable Regions program. Looking at the quarterly regional labour force figures for June, the Wide Bay-Burnett region achieved the biggest percentage drop in unemployment in Australia for the third quarter in a row. Those figures showed that unemployment in the region fell to 6.5 per cent for the June quarter of 2005, down from 11.7 per cent for the June quarter of 2004. Previous quarterly regional labour force figures showed a 5.6 per cent decline for the March quarter of 2005 compared with the March quarter of 2004. The December quarter of 2004 showed a 3.6 per cent drop in unemployment compared with the December quarter of 2003. I look forward with great anticipation to the next quarter, the September quarter. If we can sustain unemployment drops like that for four consecutive quarters, it will show that the government initiatives are well targeted. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>.</para>

<para>âOnce again I rise to speak on the crisis which is facing the River Murray. In a bad year South Australia draws about 750 gigalitres from the river. In higher rainfall years, our reservoirs and other waterways reduce our reliance on the Murray. The 750 gigalitres used by South Australia compare with the several thousand gigalitres used by New South Wales. Clearly, the closing of the Murray mouth, the death of the river red gums, the poor quality of the river water and the destructive effects of salinity cannot be combated even by the very best efforts of South Australia. Even if South Australians stopped using water from the Murray, which of course is impossible, it would not add sufficiently to the flows required to restore the river.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>A national plan is essential, and that is why federal and state ministers signed the Adelaide declaration in 2003. The declaration recognised that water from the Murray is overcommitted and that in some areas water licence allocations for irrigation exceed the water volume in a given water catchment area. Being at the bottom of the river means that South Australians have been able to see just how serious things could get, because downstream the condition of the River Murray is already deadly serious. Four points bring that point home: half of the Murrayâs native fish species have been lost; 90 per cent of the Coorongâs migratory bird species are gone; murray crayfish, which many people will remember coming across as they swam in the river in their youth, have gone entirely from South Australia; and the Murray wetlands are dying. The rate of death of our river red gums has increased from 50 per cent to 75 per cent, so action is needed, and it is needed immediately.</para>
<para>The Adelaide declaration proposed that immediate steps be taken to restore 500 gigalitres to the river. Accordingly, the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council agreed on the Living Murray Business Plan and an initial four initiatives which would recover 240 gigalitres, at a cost of $179 million, as a first step. Unfortunately, it seems that the 500-gigalitre target by 2008 will not be achieved, because infrastructure solutions, such as using pipes rather than open waterways to reduce evaporation, will go only part of the way to reducing water use.</para>
<para>Fortunately, there is another, achievable option which could make a very rapid, very significant difference. There is no doubt that we can and should buy back water licences from willing sellers. The Murray is overcommitted, and purchasing water to increase the flows through the river would provide an incentive for some irrigators to shift to more sustainable practices and crops. To illustrate this point, I refer to the CSIROâs recent report on irrigation in the Murray and Murrumbidgee basins. The New South Wales Murray region uses more than 2,000 gigalitres a year to irrigate 321,000 hectares, and that results in produce worth about $310 million. In South Australia the Riverland uses just 311 gigalitres to irrigate 36,000 hectares for produce worth $555 million. That means the Riverland in South Australia uses one-sixth of the water on one-tenth of the land to produce 1.8 times the revenue. It is all about smarter irrigation techniques and about more-appropriate crops. If we fail to look seriously at buying back water licences as one way in which we can increase flows through the Murray, we will be making the same mistake that has led us to the dire circumstances we are now in.</para>
<para>In South Australia we are in no doubt that there is no time to waste. The River Murray is in urgent need of action and the National Partyâs Karlene Maywald, who is also the Minister for the River Murray, is calling on the federal government to look at water purchasing as one of the ways in which we can work towards restoring the health of the river. We are not talking here about a forced buyback; we are talking about purchasing from willing sellers. They may wish to sell a part of their licence, because they think they can become more efficient irrigators, or they may wish to begin a transition to more sustainable crops and reduce their water use that way. Ideally, sellers would be doing a combination of both. If we fail to do this, we are not doing the dairy, cotton and rice farmers any favours, because the Murray River cannot sustain current use. In April next year the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council will meet again to consider the options for water purchasing. If we are to reach the target of recovering 500 gigalitres by 2008, we must look at the option of buying back water licences.</para>

<para>âIn electorates such as Macquarie the first weeks of spring bring a renewed awareness of the threat of bushfires. The dryer and warmer-than-usual winter and several blazes being battled on the last day of winter and the first day of spring caused the New South Wales Fire Commissioner, Mr Phil Koperberg, to warn residents on that first day in spring to prepare themselves for a âvery difficult fire seasonâ. Those conditions caused 29 councils around the state to bring forward the official start of the fire season in New South Wales. The hottest 1 October on record, recorded this year, exacerbated the concerns of people about the threat of fires around the state.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the outstanding work of our local bush fire brigadesâour local Rural Fire Service volunteers. In the Blue Mountains we have 2,200 volunteers in 21 brigades. They are the brigades of Bell, Blackheath/Mount Victoria, Blaxland, Bullaburra, Faulconbridge, Glenbrook-Lapstone, Hazelbrook, Katoomba-Leura, Lawson, Linden, Medlow Bath, Megalong Valley, Mount Riverview, MountTomah, Mount Wilson/Mount Irvine, Shipley, Valley Heights, Warrimoo, Wentworth Falls, Winmalee and Woodford, in addition, of course, to headquarters, group support and communications.</para>
<para>Similarly, in the Hawkesbury, we have 1,534 volunteers at the moment in 20 brigades. I would like to mention those brigades and give credit to those people as well. They are the brigades of Bilpin, Blaxland Ridge, Colo Heights, East Kurrajong, Ebenezer, Freemans Reach, Glossodia, Grose Vale, Grose Wold, Kurrajong, Kurrajong Heights, Lower Macdonald, Lower Portland-Hawkesbury, Mountain Lagoon, Oakville, St Albans, Tennyson, Upper Colo, Wilberforce and Yarramundi. I also want to pay tribute to the permanent staff and to those at headquarters and in the catering and communications sections.</para>
<para>These people do a magnificent job for our community. Year after year they are the last line of defence between raging fires and peopleâs homes. In fact, many people in the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury owe the existence of their homes and in some cases their own lives to the bravery of these fine men and women. It is not just a matter of bravery, however; it is not just a matter of character and commitment; it is also a case of sheer hard work. There are hundreds upon hundreds of hours of training that go into preparing these people for the disasters that do beset us from time to time.</para>
<para>A few weeks ago I had the privilege of being at the Hawkesbury Bush Fire Brigade and Rural Fire Service field day and seeing those brigades in an enjoyable atmosphere demonstrating the skills they have built up over a long period of time in competition between the brigades. The weekend before last I was privileged to be at Blackheath for the long-service awards and the presentation of national medals. The recipients there had between them several hundred years of service to our community. In each of those years were hundreds of hours of preparationâlet alone the intensity and the risks involved in those fire seasons.</para>
<para>These are outstanding men and women in communities such as the Blue Mountains and the Hawkesbury, where we are so prone to the ravages of bushfires from year to year. We had a terrible summer at the end of 2001, when 25 homes were lost. We had a another nasty summer at the end of 2002, when we lost again a couple of homes. But had it not been for the magnificent work of these very committed volunteers, the losses would have been much greater. I want at this stage in the season, as the threat of fire approaches, to say to our volunteersâand the permanent staff as wellâhow much we as a community greatly appreciate the outstanding work they do at great risk and great sacrifice to themselves.</para>

<para>âI want to draw the Houseâs attention to the importance of a strong not-for-profit sector supported by generous philanthropic organisations. I also want to talk about an example of the kind of collaboration between government, the not-for-profit sector and philanthropic organisations that should be strongly supported.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>A report coordinated by ACOSS, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Giving Australia: research on philanthropy in Australia</inline>, released today, shows that Australians are givers. I welcome the report and, more importantly, I welcome what it uncovers about the generosity and selflessness of our nation. Australians deserve a pat on the back. In the year to January 2005, 87 per cent of individuals and 67 per cent of businesses gave money, goods or services to not-for-profit organisations. Philanthropy is clearly the province of the hardworking, generous-spirited individuals and businesses of Australia. To promote philanthropy is not to give up on the social responsibilities of government. On the contrary, government and the not-for-profit sector have complementary strengths and work together.</para>
<para>One particular way that philanthropic support for projects can be particularly useful is in piloting innovative approaches to difficult social problems. A project that I want to talk about is a very good example of just that kind of collaboration. When I travelled to Israel in 2003 I visited a number of innovative education programs and leading non-profit education organisations. Some of the non-profit organisations I visited there have been delivering education programs tailored to the needs of disadvantaged communities for over 20 years. Since my visit to Israel, the Yachad Accelerated Learning Project has been established in Australian Indigenous communities to bring those Israeli experiences to the challenging task of improving Indigenous education and increasing work readiness in regional and remote communities. These programs are operating with the support of the federal government, in partnership with a range of philanthropic organisations, community groups and schools and universities.</para>
<para>The Yachad Accelerated Learning Project is modelled on those Israeli-pioneered programs which have been proven over more than 20 years. These programs are designed to combat patterns of educational disadvantage, through accelerated learning and community involvement, rather than through conventional remedial approaches. The work in Israel on which this program is based involves principles normally associated with gifted and talented education, but the result they have achieved has been to bring the lowest performers in literacy and numeracy up to and often beyond benchmark levels. The principle of the program is to take the lowest educated 25 per cent of a group and give them intensive tutoring, not only from local school teachers but also from parents and siblings trained for the purpose. These children are brought up to the benchmark standard in a fraction of the time it would take using conventional schooling. That core group motivates others around them.</para>
<para>It is an approach that helps all studentsâ learning, particularly in the key areas of literacy and numeracy. It is especially valuable for those students in danger of failing and leaving education altogether. These programs aim to foster good results, maximise attendance and improve school retention rates. The project also provides ongoing professional development for teachers, recognising that the vast majority are not trained for cross-cultural or second-language classrooms.</para>
<para>The first phase of the accelerated learning project began in February 2005 in Aurukun in Queensland, in Halls Creek in Western Australia and at four schools in Shepparton, Victoria. It is continuing as a partnership between Israeli educators, Australian schools and Indigenous communities. The extraordinary Israeli involvement in the accelerated learning project is led by people from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The project is strengthened by pooling the diverse experience and specialisation of schools, community, business, philanthropic organisations and government. Support for the project reaches across Australia to include: Indigenous leaders and communities; Monash University and the University of Melbourne; Jewish community organisations and leaders; and Israeli educators from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.</para>
<para>Substantial support comes from a range of philanthropic foundations, including the Pratt Foundation, the Victor Smorgon Charitable Foundation, the Nordia Foundation, the Gandel Foundation, the Jack and Robert Smorgon Family Foundation and the Rio Tinto Foundation. The value of improving education and work readiness is not lost on Australian industry in remote regions, where, alongside communities suffering chronic unemployment, there is a scarcity of skilled labour. Argyle Diamonds, with its operations in the East Kimberley, is a keen supporter of this project. Corporate funding comes from Argyle Diamonds and the National Australia Bank, and pro bono project advice and facilitation has been provided by Hindal Corporate, Arnold Bloch Leibler and HLB Mann Judd. Over $3 million is provided by the Department of Education, Science and Training. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talker>
<para>âQueensland this week sits in the eye of a tempest, between the release of the Peter Forster report a couple of weeks ago and the patient wait for the mini-budget of Premier Peter Beattie on 25 October. The Forster report was damning in its recommendations, and those reverberations are now being felt around the state. That report identified pressure points in Queensland Health in the areas of cancer management, elective surgery, cardiac services, emergency services, surgical waiting times, intensive care beds and mental health servicesâall areas where it is very hard to sustain the argument that any form of lack of Commonwealth funding is responsible for those kinds of logjams.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Last week a small amount of money was allocated to Rockhampton Hospital, but it just represented the âdo as little as one can as late as one canâ attitude of the current state government to solving the problems of health in the state. What we have had over a number of years in Queensland, and in Queensland Health in particular, is a focus on budget integrityâmaking the waiting lists look short and monitoring inpatientsâ activity but, at the same time, completely letting go of issues such as patient outcome, population health and, as Forster described, quality and safety.</para>
<para>I would like to run through four areas, with your indulgence, Mr Speaker. The first is spending. If there is ever a measure of commitment in politics, it is how much money one commits. I have said in this place before that Queenslandâs gross government revenues have grown by 125 per cent in real terms over the last 10 years but the increases in spending on health in Queensland have been far less than that. Queensland can make no argument that health spending has kept up with need. It has fallen behind the rest of Australia. That is obvious when the average spending in Queensland of $1,245 per person is compared with the national average of $1,444 per person.</para>
<para>It is all well and good for a state to make an argument that its lower expenditure is due to its being more efficient than other states. That is fine. But let us not have reports like Forsterâwhich demonstrates that efficiency is not the issue here; it is lack of service delivery. It is fine to aim for efficiency, but let us spend the resources we save intelligently and effectively in areas of health. That clearly has not been happening. Cost minimisation has been the dominant ideology in Queensland Health. Forster estimates that we will need in excess of 170 beds per annum and spending of around $45 million to $50 million per yearâspending equal to that needed for, say, a medium-sized provincial hospitalâevery year over the next decade or two. That is the shortfall that Queensland Health has experienced.</para>
<para>The budget, as I have pointed out, has not grown at a rate commensurate with the growth in gross government revenues. That means that, when one looks at the pie, the relative contribution that health takes from the pie is shrinking in Queensland each year. Queensland, of course, is an exceptional state because it has the great benefits of GST revenue plus stamp duty and mineral royalties favouring it in particular.</para>
<para>Let us look at the waiting lists, because that is where the logjam is. That is where one can hold up services through a hospitalâby simply making needy patients wait longer. The figures are astounding. With 108,500 people waiting on waiting listsâwaiting to be waited on and waiting againâ25,000 would potentially be added to waiting lists for surgery. That is in addition to the 33,600 people already on those waiting lists. These are just extraordinary figures. Of those, 22 per cent have been waiting longer than is clinically acceptable. I think we should be looking seriously at a policy that says, if a public patient waits longer than is clinically acceptable, that patient should go through the private sector and be given treatment in a timely fashionâand that should be paid for by the state government that is failing its own population. That would be one solution.</para>
<para>Looking at the health work force very briefly, we have seen a complete shrinkage of the VMO population in this state. The number of specialists who work in the public sector has fallen from 407 to 240. At the same time, as resourcing and population is going up, we have seen a shrinkage in what Premier Peter Beattie finds to be the most expensive part of his sector.</para>
<para>We need to focus on training. We need to get nurses working part time back into full-time work by offering them decent conditions, family friendly environments in hospitals and flexible arrangements. Queensland is significantly behind other states; you cannot argue against that. Every single financial figure demonstrates that. We need to be raising our allied health populations to support our clinical population. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>Under section 162 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the Commissioner can also require a return to be lodged, regardless of whether a taxpayer has an obligation as per the gazette notice.</para>
</item>
<item label="(5)">
<para>The requirement to lodge an income tax return is dependant on an individualâs own circumstances. Generally, the ATO expects around 11 million personal taxpayers to have an obligation to lodge a return for the year ended 30 June 2003.</para>
</item>
<item label="(6)">
<list type="loweralpha">
<item label="(a)">
<para>As per Table 3.25 of Taxation Statistics 2000-01, there were around 8.4 million individual taxpayers that were taxable in the 2000-01 income year (based on 2001 individual tax returns processed by 31 October 2002). A similar number of taxable taxpayers were present in the 2001-02 income year as per Table 3.25 of Taxation Statistics 2001-02. Around 8.6 million taxable taxpayers were present in the 2002-03 income year in the equivalent table of Taxation Statistics 2002-03.</para>
</item>
<item label="(b)">
<para>There is no requirement for persons to have or quote a TFN under Australian taxation law.</para>
<para>The relevant section that covers the issue of a tax file number is section 202B of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (ITAA 1936), which states that âa person may apply to the Commissioner for the issue of a tax file number. The Commissioner has issued Tax File Number Guidelines which are pursuant to section 17 of the Privacy Act and the TFN offence provisions in the Taxation Administration Act 1953. Paragraph 1.2 of these guidelines states âThe rights of individuals under taxation, assistance agency or superannuation law to choose not to quote a tax file number shall be respected.â This forms the basis of what is known as the âvoluntary quotation principleâ, which recognises that an individual is not legally obliged to quote a tax file number. Neither taxation nor assistance agency nor superannuation laws make the quotation of a tax file number a requirement, although a financial consequence of not quoting can be severe. Under assistance agency law, the quotation of a tax file number is a condition for the receipt of assistance payments.</para>

<para>,Â  (b), (c), (d) and (e) â (i), (ii) and (iii) The information requested for years 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 is not available. Preliminary figures on tax and penalty raised from compliance activity in the 2002/03 and 2003/04 years were published in the Compliance Program 2003-04 and 2004-05 booklets respectively. The figures are updated in the Commissionerâs annual report. (iv) Where people do not pay tax liabilities by the due date, a debt is created for collection by the ATO. The ATO invests significant resources in these activities on an ongoing basis. In instances where debts are likely not to be recoverable the ATO uses standing accounting practice in relation to these amounts. These figures are presented in the ATOâs Financial Statement published each year in the Commissioner of Taxationâs annual report.</para>

<item label="(8)">
<para>The ATO has recently augmented its efforts to identify people who are operating outside the system by implementing an expanded program of data matching. This expanded program utilises a range of third party data providers with a particular focus on sources that may indicate business or income earning activity. The ATO is also looking to better utilise data that is already available to the ATO, including financial investment return data.</para>
<para>As part of these activities, the ATO is also seeking assurance that particular groups, particularly high income earning professionals are participating in the system as expected. The ATO will be sourcing membership records held by a range of professional associations and bodies to ensure registered professionals are in the tax system. The ATO is presently targeting members of the legal profession, accountants, architects and medical practitioners.</para>

<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The superannuation preservation age is to increase from age 55 to 60, commencing in 2015. A review on whether police should be exempt from the new superannuation preservation rules was recently undertaken by Treasury and independently chaired by Mr Gary Potts.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The review found that police are not in a unique position insofar as they are affected by the increase in the preservation age and that issues specific to the police force would be better dealt with by targeted responses by police employers.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The review recommended that no special exemption to the preservation age be made for police officers on the basis that the preservation age is a communityâwide standard and to lower the age would erode this universal element of the Governmentâs retirement income policy, central to dealing with the key longâterm challenge of the ageing population. Police would also have fewer years in which to accumulate adequate superannuation benefits to fund their retirement.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Government has accepted these findings.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Notwithstanding the above, it will remain the case that, subject to a superannuation fundâs governing rules, the superannuation law will continue to allow a person to access their superannuation benefits on termination of gainful employment at any age if it is taken in the form of a nonâcommutable life pension or annuity.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The purpose of EMDG grants is to assist small and medium sized Australian businesses to enter export markets and become sustainable exporters by reimbursing up to 50 per cent of eligible export promotion expenses they incur above $15,000. The maximum grant is $150,000 and a maximum number of seven grants is payable to an individual recipient. Eligible export promotion expenses include marketing visits, overseas representation and marketing consultants, participation in trade fairs, communications, free samples, promotional literature and advertising, and visits to Australia by overseas buyers. Eligibility for an EMDG grant is determined in accordance with specific eligibility criteria as set out in the Export Market Development Grants Act 1997.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The scheme makes a provision for peak industry associations to seek âspecial approval statusâ to enable them to apply for a grant. Under this provision, eligible business associations can apply for a grant as an Austrade âApproved Bodyâ.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">To qualify for âApproved Bodyâ status, an association must be the âpeakâ industry body for the industry it represents and must be undertaking generic export promotion on behalf of its members. To be a âpeakâ industry association, an applicant must be able to demonstrate that it ârepresents the majority of businesses engaged in that total Australian industryâ. Austrade determines if a body meets these requirements in accordance with a Ministerial Determination.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">* Section 94 of the Australian Trade Commission Act 1985 authorises Austrade to provide only certain limited details of grant recipients (name, address, industry, grant amount) to third parties. Therefore, the exact date of payment of EMDG grants cannot be provided.</para>

<para>CASAâs strategic direction is underpinned by high-level goals, which in order to be achieved, must be supported by a range of safety related actions. Within this context, CASA has determined that where appropriate, greater emphasis will be placed on using data analysis in the decision making and planning process within CASA.</para>
<para>One of CASAâs objectives is to identify and address the most significant safety related trends and risk factors in the system of civil aviation safety in Australia.</para>
<para>As outlined in CASAâs 2005-2006 to 2007-2008 Corporate Plan, a series of initiatives have been developed to enhance CASAâs safety research and analysis capability. These initiatives include: resources reporting directly to the Chief Operating Officer; development of research and analysis strategies to support standards development; the development of cooperative research and analysis programs within CASA and with regulatory authorities, aviation organisations, universities/colleges and manufacturers; and conveying results of safety research and analysis to stakeholders.</para>
<para>In the past year, CASA has initiated a number of data analysis projects aimed at improving aviation safety. Of particular importance was an extensive analysis of fatal accidents in the general aviation sector. This project was undertaken within CASA and did not involve the use of any external consultants.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>As the program is being embedded in CASAâs decision making processes, it is difficult to provide detailed costings. However, the initiatives which have been developed to enhance CASAâs safety research and analysis capability include the appointment of resources within the Office of the Chief Executive Officer. This equates to two Senior Officer (2) appointments with a salary banding of $76,674-$92,269.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Australian Government provides support for people with incontinence through a range of national services. Specifically, continence advice, information and support is provided through the National Continence Management Strategy and National Continence Helpline on 1800 330 066 (free call). In addition, some financial assistance for products to help eligible people with permanent incontinence is provided through the Continence Aids Assistance Scheme (CAAS) and the Stoma Appliance Scheme.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The CAAS was set up by the previous Government as an employment-related scheme in which assistance was provided to people in the 16-64 years age group. The Scheme was designed to help people with incontinence remain in the workforce by assisting with the financial barrier continence management can cause to participation in education and employment. The CAAS was intended to complement State and Territory Schemes and was never intended to cover the full cost of continence aids.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The CAAS continues to provide some limited assistance to people over the age of 65 years, though only where applicants are involved in paid work of at least eight hours per week and where their income and asset levels are such that they are eligible for an income support benefit.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Australian Government provides assistance to States and Territories through the Commonwealth State/Territory Disability Agreement to provide aids and equipment for people with disabilities. The State and Territory Governments administer a range of schemes, set their own eligibility criteria and determine the range of aids supplied. The CAAS was intended to complement these State and Territory schemes. It was not intended to replace existing schemes of assistance. Most States and Territories fund schemes that provide continence aids for people with disabilities, except Western Australia.</para>

<item label="(a)">
<para>The Australian Government has endorsed the MCEETYA National Framework for Professional Standards for Teaching, to help identify the key elements (knowledge, understanding, skills and values) of effective teaching. The Framework acknowledges that the nature and content of professional teaching standards developed at the local level will vary according to their purpose and context. Professional teaching standards therefore provide a possible mechanism for assessing teacher performance. The profession, through the National Institute of Quality Teaching and School Leadership, has commenced the development of advanced standards to identify highly accomplished teachers and school leaders.</para>
<para>The Government strongly supports performance-based pay for teachers. Salary advancement for Australian teachers is currently almost exclusively based on an incremental scale, reflecting longevity of service and experience rather than qualifications or teaching performance. The Australian Technical Colleges, funded by the Australian Government, which will be senior secondary schools which provide students with trade training, will provide their teachers with access to performance pay and will offer them the option of an Australian Workplace Agreement. The broader implementation of performance pay however would be a matter for the education authorities that run schools and employ teachers.</para>
</item>
<item label="(b)">
<para>The Australian Government is committed to ensuring parents receive more meaningful information about school performance in order to assist them in making decisions about their childâs schooling.</para>
<para>In order to assist parents, the Australian Government is making State and Territory funding conditional on a range of measures being implemented. A key requirement is that, from 2006, State, Territory and non-government education authorities will have to ensure that each school makes available to parents information about the performance of the school. This information will encompass key student outcomes including the percentage of students achieving literacy and numeracy national benchmarks, professional engagement including teacher qualifications and teacher attendance, and information about parent, student and teacher satisfaction. Schools may publish other material about the school as they see fit.</para>

<list type="loweralpha">
<item label="(a)">
<para>The National Goals for Schooling in the 21st Century, endorsed by all education Ministers in 1999, provide that âSchooling should be socially just, so that: studentsâ outcomes from schooling should be free of negative forms of discrimination based on sex, language, culture and ethnicity, religion or disability; and of differences arising from studentsâ socio-economic background or geographic locationâ. They also state that âthe learning outcomes of educationally disadvantaged students [should] improve and, over time, match those of other studentsâ.</para>
<para>When they endorsed the National Goals for Schooling, Ministers directed that work commence on the development of national performance measures in key areas of schooling, including literacy, numeracy, science, ICT and civics. Recognising that the capacity to obtain a national picture of the educational progress of students is affected by the variety of definitions of student groups used by different States and Territories, school systems and schools, Ministers also directed that common national definitions of student background characteristics be developed and put in place across Australia.</para>
<para>The development of both national performance measures and definitions has been the job of MCEETYA taskforces of State and federal officials, most recently the Performance Measurement and Reporting Taskforce.</para>
<para>Since 1999, reporting in the Annual National Report on Schooling in Australia (the ANR) on student achievement in each State and Territory against national literacy and numeracy benchmarks has gradually expanded to cover Years 3, 5 and 7, disaggregated by sex and for Indigenous students and students of language background other than English. In 2003, reporting by student geolocation (metropolitan, provincial, remote and very remote) was introduced.</para>
<para>The national definitions and data collection mechanisms needed for reporting in the ANR according to studentsâ socio-economic background are being implemented as from 2005, with full reporting expected from 2006.</para>
<para>The Schools Assistance Regulations build on the MCEETYA definitions by requiring that the performance measures to be included in the ANR each year will include information disaggregated according to the student characteristics noted above, using the definitions approved by MCEETYA. The Regulations also require that this information will be reported not only for literacy and numeracy, but also for the national sample surveys in science, ICT and civics which will occur over the 2005-08 quadrennium.</para>
<para>The provision of school performance information (see 1b above) will require schools to give a description of the value they add to studentsâ learning. Typical of this kind of analysis is the reference to relevant background characteristics of students that schools may wish to include.</para>
</item>
<item label="(b)">
<para>The Australian Government acknowledges the differing backgrounds and experiences of students, but nevertheless is committed to the expectation that all schools can and should deliver high standards of achievement for their students. The key imperative driving this commitment is a desire to see all children, regardless of their background, experiences and opportunities, including access to private tutoring, achieve minimum standards in literacy and numeracy to enable their successful participation in schooling, further study, training and work.</para>
<para>In relation to the impact of private tuition on studentsâ achievement, a review of the Aboriginal Tutorial Assistance Scheme (as part of a review of the Indigenous Education Direct Assistance Programme) found that individual tuition can make a difference to performance where the needs of the student are clearly matched with the expertise of the tutor. (The Scheme provides funding for extra tuition for Indigenous students who are assessed by their relevant educational institution as needing some tuition over and above that which is normally provided by the institution.)</para>
<para>The Australian Government is funding a pilot Tutorial Voucher Initiative. This in an innovative and practical measure designed to be additional to any other assistance children may receive during school hours. The pilot was developed to enable access to valuable one-to-one tuition delivered outside school hours.</para>
<para>An independent evaluation is running concurrently with the pilot Tutorial Voucher Initiative. It is investigating the impact of the pilot on student reading development, and the effectiveness of the pilot as a means of assisting children who did not meet the Year 3 national reading benchmark in 2003. The evaluation will provide valuable information for the development of future programmes in literacy. The Department expects to receive a final report early in 2006 after the pilot ends.</para>

<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>The average commencement payment (GST exclusive) per New Apprentice paid to employers under the New Apprenticeships Incentives Programme (NAIP) since 1 July 1998 is $1,515. This figure includes any special or additional incentives paid under NAIP that were attracted with a standard commencement incentive.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>The average completion payment (GST exclusive) per New Apprentice paid to employers under NAIP since 1 July 1998 is $1,686. This figure includes any special or additional incentives paid under NAIP that were attracted at completion of the New Apprenticeship.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>The average total payment (GST exclusive) per New Apprentice over the life of the New Apprenticeship paid to employers under NAIP since 1 July 1998 is $2,275. This figure includes all standard, special and additional incentives payments under NAIP.</para>
<para>The average total payment covers the full range of the New Apprenticeships Incentives Programme, including commencement, progression and completion payments as well as special and additional incentives. It is important to note that there is no direct correlation between the number and value of claims as this information reflects only those claims submitted by employers.</para>
<para>All data is drawn from DESTâs Training and Youth Internet Management System (TYIMS) database as at 19Â AugustÂ 2005. The database is DESTâs management information system for making payments through NAIP and the New Apprenticeships Support Services contracts.</para>
