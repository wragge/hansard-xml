<para>âI rise on behalf of the opposition and, in particular, the Manager of Opposition Business, to indicate our support for this motion. The Chief Government Whip and I share a common desire to increase the opportunities for private members to speak, whether in adjournment speeches or three-minute statements. This proposed change to the standing orders reflects that desire. I would like to acknowledge that we would not have reached this point without the Chief Government Whipâs strong support, and I thank him for that.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Essentially, this proposal allows an extra 10 minutes on the two sitting days of the Main Committee, Wednesday and Thursday, for three-minute statements. One might say that is not a big advance, but I accept every small step as progress. I should also place on record the factâwhich is not reflected in this motion to amend to the standing ordersâthat, wherever possible, we are looking for additional sittings of the Main Committee to enable an additional half-hour of three-minute member statements. Again I thank, and acknowledge the role of, the Chief Government Whip.</para>
<para>I cannot let this motion to amend the standing orders go by without expressing my regret that the other element in the proposalâthe preservation of the three-minute statements and five-minute adjournment speeches in the Main Committeeâhas not been acted upon. In the Main Committee, if a member is in the midst of a three-minute statement or an adjournment speech and there is a division in this place, the Main Committee proceedings are suspended and, unfortunately, the member effectively loses their spotâit is gone. They do not get another opportunity. I understand that there are constraints upon the government. Naturally, the government wants its business to go through the Main Committee expeditiously, and I accept that. But I need to place on record, on behalf of the Manager of Opposition Business and myself, a willingness to look at this issue to ensure that, if we are able to entrench those three-minute statements and adjournment speeches for members, we do so in order that members do not lose them. The government should look at ways in which it would not lose its time.</para>
<para>In summary, on behalf of the opposition, I indicate our support for the motion. I thank the government for it. I do not want to be churlish and say that the Procedure Committee has provided many other opportunities for the government to make reforms because that would only reflect on me. I welcome this initiative. I support it. I think all members of this House will benefit from it.</para>

<para>âThe <inline ref="R2405">Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005</inline> contains four major schedules instituting four new initiatives in our tax laws. The first schedule provides for the introduction of the governmentâs pre-election promise of a 30 per cent child-care tax offset to offset child-care fees for families. The second schedule extends deductible gift recipient status to a number of charitable organisations. The third schedule frees up information sharing arrangements between the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Australian Taxation Office to allow the ABS to conduct some very important work, particularly in the area of small businessâwhich I certainly supportâto better assess some of the issues in regard to the ageing population in this country. The fourth schedule seeks to extend the wine equalisation tax to producers in New Zealand.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The primary initiative in the billâthe most controversial initiative, and the one which will no doubt get the most attention in this place todayâis the 30 per cent child-care tax offset. Labor accepts that this is an election commitment and that thus the government has a mandate to implement the measure as it was announced in the 2004 election campaign, but we also note that it is not quite the initiative the government took into the 2004 election campaign. Indeed, a $4,000 cap has been introduced, and recent revelations show that families seeking to benefit from this offset will be waiting considerable periods before being able to do so.</para>
<para>I will leave it to my colleague the member for Sydney, who has responsibility for child care, to expand much more on these issues when she makes a contribution to this debate today. But I want to take the opportunity to raise a few questions about tax policy generally and how talk about the goals we strive to meet in tax policy falls silent with this badly constructed 30 per cent tax offset. One of the great achievements of the Keating government was its ambitious program of tax reform. It was an important part of the microeconomic agenda of that time and it delivered significant productivity benefits to the Australian economy. Those productivity benefits, which have underpinned the growth we have enjoyed continuously over the last 14 years, are benefits that, of course, have been largely enjoyed by the government currently occupying the Treasury benches.</para>
<para>The Keating governmentâs policy reform program was characterised by two major policy thrusts: first, a reduction in personal tax ratesâand, in addition to that, a reduction in the company rate especially; and, second, a broadening of the tax base to create a more neutral and a fairer tax system. Another major reform was the introduction of a capital gains tax, a path-breaking reform by international standards and by any standard. It may be worth noting that it celebrates its 20th birthday next month.</para>

<para>âby creating neutral tax treatment for investment decisions between income and capital producing assets. By the way, I will take the interjection of the government member and reply that that is not my memory. In fact, I seem to recall that the present Prime Minister was highly critical but refused to commit to repealing the tax. That is my memory of the situation back in the mid-eighties. Maybe the member for Mitchell and I can have that one out later on this afternoon. Similar examples exist in the creation of the dividend imputation system. I note the member for Mitchell is leaving the chamber to check his history. I look forward to him correcting himself when he returns.</para>

<para>Under that reform project, we also introduced a fringe benefits tax and eliminated the many complex and unnecessary taxation concessions which at that time were distorting the tax system. Laborâs reforms made the tax system fairer, more efficient and much simpler. But the Howard government did not continue the program of reform and simplification, and the capital gains tax measure has been systematically eroded by the governmentâs tinkering around the edges of the system.</para>
<para>The tax system has become extremely complex. A long list of capital gains tax events occur that even the experts admit are extremely difficult to apply and interpret consistently. The same can be said of the personal income tax system. Attempts to reduce the size of the act have proved decisive in leading to an increase in the size of taxation legislation. I do not expect honourable members to take my word for this. A Treasury internal memo has come into Laborâs possession which indicates that two-thirds of the original taxation act is now redundant and 50 per cent of the total tax legislation is redundant. That is a great record of</para>

<para>I take the opportunity to note that the minister has produced a tax bill that is not correcting another one of the governmentâs GST anomalies or trying to fix up the consolidation rules. Such repairs have been common events in this place in recent months. I do hope that we are not back here in the not too distant future making repairs to this billâmaking a repair has been too common an incident over the last months and, indeed, the last year.</para>
<para>While Labor sought to clean up the tax system and make it more neutral and less distorting, the government seems to be addicted to building further dodgy extensions to the act. We have tax </para>

This is not surprising, given that it was designed during the course of a heated election period, which is never a good time to be designing tax policy. I remind the House that this was announced during a short period of time in which the government announced a $66 billion spending spree to retain its place in office and to retain control of this place.</para>
<para>This tax credit is problematic in a number of ways. First, there is the question of whether the funds would have been better directed to other ways of subsidising child careâbut again I will leave it to the member for Sydney to further expand on that point. Second, the offset is deficient in design. We understand that the government would have preferred to give tax deductibility for child care, and our information is that they were very close to doing so during the course of the election campaign. I can only assume that this current proposal before the House proved to be the most popular and the fittest for an election period.</para>
<para>However, this does not really gel with the current child-care benefit payment regime. Something for which a payment is received is usually not treated as deductibleâso the tax credit provided the benefits of tax deductibility while preserving the child-care benefit regime. The problem here is that the government has sought to insist on reconciliation between the payments made to child-care agencies, payments made by Centrelink and, of course, tax records. This is a very time-consuming process and drives a wedge between the receipt of the offset and the expense being incurred. This wedge could be well over two years, as the Treasurer conceded to reporters yesterday.</para>
<para>This is not much use to struggling families. How out of touch is this government if it thinks this measure will help familiesâforcing them to wait up to two years for the assistance it extends? It would have been better to consider a mechanism for families to be able to claim the expense, net of the CCB, on the basis of payments they believe they have madeâon a self-assessment basis. The essence of this problem is that the tax offset is variable with respect to income and expenditure. The government recently created two offsets that are income contingentâthe 25 per cent entrepreneurs offset and the mature Australians tax offset. But these can be easily calculated in the tax returns of taxpayers. The problem with this measure is that it is not just income contingent but contingent on the income less estimated expenditure. But the government is saying that the taxpayer cannot estimate the child-care expenditure and thus the out-of-pocket expense. Rather, the government insists that it must check for itself.</para>
<para>The government agrees on a self-assessment system for the tax act generallyâand we all live under that regimeâand it has recently reformed this, with Laborâs support. But in relation to families with child-care benefit, the government simply refuses to take them at their word. It wants to be a nanny state, putting the familiesâ child-care expenses under the microscope, assessing every taxpayer. Let me make it clear: this is not a normal audit process based on rigorous statistical sampling techniques; it is a process of individually checking every child-care expense, payment and income receipt. This is likely to cost an enormous amount in administrative costs. In this regard, I would like the minister to clarify in his summing up exactly how much the ATO has set aside to fund the implementation of this measure.</para>
<para>The member for Sydney will later be moving amendments which will give the government an opportunity to make amends for this unexpected time delay, and we will be giving government members an opportunity to support those amendments. As I said earlier, we live under the self-assessment system in every other regard, and we see no justification for the government not accepting that system for the purpose of implementing this 30 per cent election promise. It was a key election promise, one which received quite a deal of attention. But, as I said earlier, back then no mention was made of any caps and certainly no mention was made of the possibility that families would be waiting up to two years to access the benefits of the new arrangement.</para>
<para>Schedule 2, as I noted earlier, provides for deductible gift recipient status for a number of worthy organisations. One key element of this schedule is the listing of playgroup associations. Labor has sought to support these listings in the past. The Chifley Research Centre listing replaces the DGR listing of the Herbert Vere Evatt Memorial Foundation Inc, with effect from 20 May 2005. I thank the minister for honouring his commitment to give effect to this extension.</para>
<para>While we are talking about charities, I invite the minister to respond in his summation to an article by Fred Brenchley which appears in todayâs <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline>. It suggests that the tax office might be moving to change arrangements for charitable organisations. At this critical time, this seems potentially to be an attempt to muzzle these charitable organisationsâat a very sensitive time for this government. In recent weeks, we have seen a number of church groups in particular criticise the governmentâs extreme approach to industrial laws in this country, and it seems to the opposition an extraordinary coincidence that we are reading today that the government might be considering changing the rules which currently dictate that this process of public commentary must not be the dominant purpose of the charity. From the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> article this morning, it appears that there could be a change to ensure that the body must âexclusivelyâ not be dealing with that sort of public comment. I invite the minister in his summation today to pass comment on the Fred Brenchley article this morning and to assure the House that this will not result in a Goebbels style censorship of the very worthy and good comments of charitable organisations in this country, when they find it necessary from time to time to criticise the government and government policy.</para>
<para>With respect to schedule 3 of the bill, at present the tax act only permits the disclosure of taxation information to the Australian Statistician for the purposes of conducting: one, periodic surveys of research and development activities; two, periodic surveys of industries; and, three, the compilation of the Australian national accounts. This amendment enables the Commissioner of Taxation to provide the Australian Statistician with business income tax information collected for the purposes of the Census and Statistics Act 1905, as requested by the Australian Statistician.</para>
<para>In practice, this means that the Australian Bureau of Statistics would be able to expand its use of information to other important and emerging statistical purposes including: (1) the development of a longitudinal database of business; and (2) the production of regional small business outputs. These will be very important for small business planning in particular. They will also be important for policy development processes.</para>
<para>I remind the House again, which I have done on many occasions in this place, that in 1995 the then Keating government commenced a very important longitudinal study for small business in this country, funded out of the Working Nation program. It was providing a great source of information to a number of policy thinkers around this countryâacademics undertaking PhD works relating to the future of small business and small business policy planning. Unfortunately in the final year, the fifth year, of that longitudinal study, the government decided to cease funding for the project, leaving a lot of academics around the country high and dry in terms of their information flows and leaving a great vacuum for the small business community. We on this side of the House certainly support the idea of the ABS being able to secure that additional information in order to assist small business planning in this country and to give us a closer breakdown on small business output in regional areas.</para>
<para>I turn to schedule 4, an interesting schedule indeed. Under existing law, wine producers can claim a wine equalisation tax rebate of up to $290,000 each year. The rebate effectively makes the first $1 million of the wholesale value of each producerâs wine sales in Australia per year free of the wine equalisation tax. The existing rebate is available to wine producers who are registered for GST in Australia. This bill provides this rebate to New Zealand wine producers.</para>
<para>I would like to take this opportunity to quickly remind the House of some history on the wine equalisation tax. This was a tax introduced in conjunction with the goods and services tax. The policy thinking at the time was that, for a number of reasons, it was not socially acceptable that the tax on wine should reduce from the high 40c in the dollar right down to 10 per cent. The government took what I think was a fairly acceptable decisionâa decision we supported at the timeâto introduce an equalisation tax which was intended to leave the tax on wine at its level pre the introduction of the GST.</para>
<para>The great difficulty arose when we on this side recognisedâwith the assistance of the wine industryâthat this was not a revenue neutral measure. It struck at 29 per cent; because of the compounding effect of the GST, the wine equalisation tax proved to be anything but revenue neutral. Indeed, the government stood to raise a couple of hundred million dollars additional with the wine equalisation tax rate at 29 per cent.</para>
<para>At the time, Labor introduced some very good amendments to exempt small wine producers from the wine equalisation tax as a means of promoting wine tourism. The government later took this idea and transformed it to an across-the-board tax rebate under the WET for all wine producers. This was the governmentâs way of, if you like, giving effect to a lower rate of wine equalisation tax. The problem now, of course, with that faulty approach, is that we have a discriminatory arrangement where trading partners like those in New Zealand complain that they are being discriminated against in terms of the wine equalisation tax.</para>
<para>The government is proposing to extend these measures to New Zealand, but the question I pose to the minister today is: where does it end? What implications does, or may, this have for our relationship with our other trading partners? For example, we already have a free trade agreement with the United States. Does it have implications for that arrangement? We are working towards a free trade agreement with China. Does it have implications for that relationship as well? In the future, will we find ourselves in the circumstances where we will be sending cheques out of the tax office to residents of China and the United States? I invite the minister, in his summation, to answer those questions. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI appreciate the opportunity to speak on the <inline ref="R2405">Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005</inline>. The purpose of this bill is to amend various taxation laws to implement a range of changes and improvements to Australiaâs taxation system for the benefit of all Australians. The changes include the introduction of the child-care tax offset; an update of the list of deductible gift recipients; an expansion of the purposes for which business tax income information may be disclosed to the Australian Statistician; and amendments to the wine equalisation tax.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The child-care tax offset provisions recognise that Australian families are fundamental to the strong cohesive communities that make up our nation. The Howard government recognises that families face competing pressures on their time, their energy and their finances, particularly when they have very young children. Families should have the choice as to how they fulfil their responsibilities and how they balance their own lives.</para>
<para>This government believes that the best way it can support Australian families is to provide them with real choices about their working arrangements, their family payments and their child care. Accessible, affordable and high-quality child care is vital for many families to enable them to participate effectively in the work force or to undertake study or training. Under the Howard government the number of child-care places has grown from 306,500 places in 1996 to 563,000 places currently.</para>
<para>Affordability of child care has improved as a result of the introduction of the child-care benefit. With the introduction of the child-care benefit as part of A New Tax System, families on average now receive around $2,000 each year in child-care benefit.</para>
<para>The out-of-pocket costs families face can vary according to the type of service used to meet their particular needs, whether that is long day care, occasional care or outside school hours care. Out-of-pocket costs can also vary depending on where families live. All families who receive the child-care benefit, which has a work, study or training test, will benefit from this extra assistance to help them meet the extra costs of child care. Setting the new rebate at 30 per cent of the out-of-pocket costs recognises that the child-care costs faced by families vary according to where they live and the type of service they use.</para>
<para>Providing a rebate on the out-of-pocket costs supports families choosing the child-care service which best suits their own personal circumstances. Many families choose to have one parent stay at home to look after their children or to work for just a few hours a week. The Howard government supports families who make this choice by providing family tax benefit part B, which is also paid to eligible single-parent families in recognition of the additional pressures that they face.</para>
<para>The government has been able to deliver these benefits to Australian families because of disciplined and responsible economic management over our time in government, which has resulted in a strong economy and consequently the opportunity to provide a sound budget that is welcomed by the wider Australian community.</para>
<para>I turn to the bill itself. Schedule 1 introduces the child-care tax rebate. This initiative will help families by giving them a rebate on their tax of 30 per cent of out-of-pocket child-care expenses. The rebate will cover child-care expenses for taxpayers who use approved care services and meet the child-care benefit work test or one of the equivalent child-care benefit limits. The rebate will be payable up to a maximum of $4,000 per child. Importantly, taxpayers will also be able to transfer any unused portion of the rebate to their spouse. The child-care tax rebate will assist families with the cost of approved child care, building on the child-care benefit system and family assistance currently provided through initiatives such as the family tax benefit, and it honours the coalitionâs election commitment.</para>
<para>I should explain the meaning of âapproved child careâ for the purposes of this legislation. Approved child care is child care provided by a child-care service that is approved under section 195 of A New Tax System (Family Assistance)(Administration) Act 1999. The following services can apply to the family and community services departmental secretary to become an approved child-care centre. They can be either a centre based on long day care services, family day care services, in home care services, occasional care services or outside school hours care services.</para>
<para>Approved child care also includes absences under section 10 or 10A of the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) Act 1999. This includes circumstances when a child is away due to illness and a medical certificate covering that illness is obtained from a medical practitioner, or when the child is attending preschool or has a pupil-free day, or an absence occurs in permitted circumstances as specified in the determination under subsection 11(1) of that act. There is no limit on the number of these absences that can occur during a financial year for which a taxpayer can be entitled to the approved child-care benefit and, as such, be eligible for the child-care tax offset. Other absences not included in the previous list are classified as permitted absence days. There is a limit of 30 permitted absence days per financial year.</para>
<para>The deductible gift recipients covered by schedule 2 of this bill amends the lists of deductible gift recipients in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Deductible gift recipient status will assist the listed organisations to attract public support for their various good works and activities. The income tax law allows taxpayers to claim income tax deductions for gifts of $2 or more to deductible gift recipients. To be a deductible gift recipient, an organisation must fall within a category of organisations set out in division 30 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 or be listed under that division. The amendments of schedule 2 will assist relevant funds and organisations to attract public support for their activities and good works within the community.</para>
<para>One such organisation is the Chifley Research Centre Ltd, which was established to undertake economic, social, cultural and political research. The centre publishes and disseminates its research results to the public and therefore promotes a better understanding of the Australian political environment. In addition, schedule 2 repeals the deductible gift recipient listing of the Evatt Foundation that was listed as the Herbert Vere Evatt Memorial Foundation Inc. This reflects the foundationâs agreement to transfer the gift deductibility status from the Evatt Foundation to the Chifley Research Centre. Another organisation to benefit from the amendments is the Crime Stoppers Northern Territory program, which encourages community involvement in the apprehension and conviction of criminals and assists reduction in crime by the provision of information to the proper authorities.</para>
<para>The government also announced in June 2004 that it would legislate to ensure that playgroup associations would benefit from being able to receive tax-deductible gifts. Playgroup Western Australia Inc., Playgroup Queensland Inc., Playgroup Tasmania Inc., Playgroup New South Wales Inc., ACT Playgroups Association Inc. and the Playgroup Association of Northern Territory Inc. provide positive learning and social experiences for children, families and carers who may otherwise be socially isolated and disadvantaged.</para>
<para>The Rotary Club of Katoomba Inc.âthe Convict Roadbuilders and Pioneer Memorial Wall Fundâis another organisation that will benefit from the provisions of this legislation. This fund was established to erect a memorial to recognise the important contribution of the convict teams involved in building the road over the Blue Mountains in 1815, especially those who lost their lives in the long construction process under the extreme duress caused both by their imprisonment and the inclement weather conditions in that part of New South Wales.</para>
<para>In conclusion, this bill is about continuing this governmentâs commitment to improve the Australian taxation system most importantly to the advantage of Australian families with the introduction of the child-care tax offset. These benefits are able to be delivered to Australian families because of the strength and vigour of the Australian economy, which is due to the disciplined economic management of the Howard coalition government. I commend this bill to the House.</para>

<para>âLater on in my remarks I will be moving a second reading amendment to the <inline ref="R2405">Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005</inline> specifically in relation to schedule 1, the child-care tax offset. This tax offset, or child-care rebate as the government has been calling it, is a 30 per cent rebate on out-of-pocket expenses for parents. It means that they will get back 30 per cent of what they are spending minus the child-care benefit that they already receive, to a maximum of $4,000. That is the first election promise that the government has already broken in relation to this. During the election campaign this rebate was supposed to start immediately. It was supposed to be available in the next tax year and it was supposed to be uncapped. We see in todayâs legislation that indeed the rebate will be capped at a maximum of $4,000.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The other major election promise broken by the government is the intimation during the campaign that this rebate would be available immediately. Nowhere during the election campaign and nowhere in subsequent discussions was it saidâuntil the Treasurer blurted out just before Christmas last year in the hope that nobody was paying attention and that we were all on our summer holidaysâthat it would not be available immediately and to make up for that he was going to backdate it to July the previous year. As more detail emerges about this bill, the scenario becomes worse and worse. Now we find out that many parents will not be eligible to receive any of the money that this rebate entitles them to until up to two years or more after they have actually spent the money. It means that if you are paying for child care today, in August 2005, you will not see any financial help from the government until late in 2007. For most parents that is absolutely unacceptable. They just do not have the money to be forking out very high fees now, particularly in capital cities, and not to see any relief from the government until August 2007 or later.</para>
<para>This measure is also inflationary. The member for Hughes was saying that child care is more affordable than ever. I do not know which planet she is living on. I know the area that she is fromâshe has left the chamber, unfortunatelyâbut I know the Sutherland Shire pretty well; in fact I grew up there. I know that there are very expensive child-care centres there. She has the same problems of very long waiting lists as we do in other parts of metropolitan Sydney. I would like her to go to her constituents and tell them that they are not paying too much for child care and see what they say to her.</para>
<para>This measure is regressive. It delivers the highest benefit to the people on the highest income. It is a favourite strategy of the government to deliver the highest benefits to the people on the highest incomes, and once again, in this measure, we see the people who are earning the most getting the most from the government. Also, as I said, it does nothing to help parents now. Parents are paying very high fees week after week. To tell them that it is all going to be okay because they will get a check in the mail in two years time I think is simply a defeat of will and imagination on the part of this government to help parents now.</para>
<para>Another major problem with this child-care measure is that we are spending a billion dollars and there is not one extra child-care place. Parents who are currently waiting for years to get their children into child care get no relief from this measure at all. This does nothing to help parents who are currently waiting for child care. It can cause parents, however, to fall into a debt trap. ABC child-care centres are offering parents a loan of up to $4,000âsign on the dotted line. They say that parents will be able to pay this back in September. If they do not, of course there is an eight per cent interest penalty clause. There are many problems with this. Firstly, parents will not necessarily get the full $4,000 rebate and, secondly, many parents may not be eligible for any rebate. The notion that parents will be taking up this HECS for child care option now is a worry, and I will go into more on that later.</para>
<para>Another issue that I intend to discuss today is the number of parents who miss out. There are plenty of parents who, during the last election campaign, would have read the headline â30 per cent back on child-care expensesâ. âTerrificâ, they would have thought. There are plenty of parents who will miss out on this and I will go through the categories of those parents a little later.</para>
<para>The final issue that I want to discuss is the complexity of this rebate. It is already incredibly confusing for child-care centres and for parents. I receive phone calls and emails to my office all the time asking for information about this because the Australian tax office cannot help parents. They keep saying: âWeâre not sure. It depends on what legislation gets through. We canât really tell you yet.â The child-care centres do not know because the government has not informed them appropriately about what they will need to do and what they should be advising parents. It is very complex and I will go into more detail of that later.</para>
<para>The first issue that I want to address in some detail is the delay. The shortest possible time, I believe, between when parents will be paying for their child care and when they will be receiving the rebate, we estimate to be around 14 months. Fourteen months is a long time to wait for money back from the government on such an expensive item as child care. Fourteen months is a long time but 30 months is a lot longer. Thirty months is what they are more likely to be waiting. Parents will not get the child-care rebate until the end of the financial year subsequent to the year that the child-care fees were paid. In other words, child-care fees paid by a parent in a financial year cannot be claimed at the end of that financial year; they have to be claimed at the end of the following financial year. The government says that it is impossible to do anything about this because the child-care providers do not give their information to the government until September or October. For the March-June quarter, they give the information around October and that is too late for the tax office to verify the parentsâ claims. I am very concerned that the Treasurer is more concerned about the convenience of the tax office than about getting parents the money they need when they need it.</para>
<para>The argument is weak because child-care benefit, if people take it in a lump sum, is paid within or soon after the end of the financial year. Family tax benefits are also paid on the basis of estimated income, and a reconciliation is routinely done around November of that year. So I believe it is certainly not beyond the wit or wisdom of the Australian tax office to work out how parents can be paid the rebate a little earlier.</para>
<para>Another issue that I have alluded to briefly is what is going to happen with parents getting into debt because of this two-year lag between when parents are paying for their child care and when they are receiving the money. We already see ABC Learning, Australiaâs biggest child-care provider, offering parents a $4,000 loan. Unfortunately, ABC are not in a position to know whether parents will receive $4,000 from the government. The parents may receive a lot less than $4,000 from the government. Many parents were expecting to receive the money at the end of this financial year, but the fact that the government has shillyshallied around with this legislation for so long means that this financial year is a wipe-out. Certainly, from what was said to them during the election campaign, they would have expected to see the money in this tax year. On that basis, they would take out a loan from ABC, expecting to see $4,000 at the end of the tax year and expecting to see a full $4,000. On both of those counts they are going to be seriously disappointed.</para>
<para>A parent, Katherine from Goodna, contacted me and said she has three children who have gone to ABC child care and a fourth who is now of school age. She has just withdrawn her kids from child care because she cannot afford it anymore. The fee increases in the previous years have been $1 per child per day but on 1 July they rose by $4 per child per day. Even with full fee relief that is an extra $1,800 per year. The director of the child-care centre is privately advising parents from that child-care centre not to take up the deferral offer that would make it easier to pay for this child care up front because, the director says, not everyone will be eligible for the rebate and people will end up owing debts to ABC that they will not get sufficient money from the government to repay.</para>
<para>The issue of no parent being able to claim the rebate until the 2005-06 tax return is also referred to by another parent in Brisbane, Sonia, who wrote to me very concerned and surprised that she would not be receiving the 30 per cent rebate on her child-care fees this year. She has been paying for expensive child care in the Brisbane CBD and she was certainly under the impression that she would be receiving a rebate at the end of this year. The debt that parents will get into and the lag are having a very serious affect on parents.</para>
<para>The tax rebate is a very complicated and inefficient vehicle for child-care relief. I have mentioned already the inflationary effect it is having on child-care fees. We see quarter after quarter that child-care fees are going up three, four and even five times the rate of the basket of goods that make up the general CPI. Certainly, this rebate has given a signal to child-care providers that they can jack up their fees because parents will be getting more money soon and, because of the horrendous shortages of child care, parents do not have an option. They have to take it or leave it in most parts of Australia.</para>
<para>The implementation mechanism for this is fiendishly complex for child-care centres and for parents to understand. It would be a terrific gesture if the government offered to help the child-care centres with the implementation of the software or paper accounting systems they are going to need when parents come clamouring to them for annualised statements of what they have been paying. There are many child-care centres that have this technology already and have the ability to produce those statements, but I think there will be many, many that do not. It is very important for the government to offer a bit more guidance to child-care centres than they have been offering up until now on what will be expected of them and what they should be telling their parents.</para>
<para>It is phenomenal that the government are happy to advertise these changes without really being in a position to tell parents very much at all about what they should be doing to keep receipts or to work with their child-care centres to make sure that information will be available and acceptable to the tax office. Like we see with the industrial relations campaign, the government are happy to spend the advertising money up front and then, when they are asked decent and perfectly fair questions about what is in the detail and what needs to be done, the response comes back from the information line at the bottom of the page: âSorry, I canât tell you that. The legislation is not confirmed yet. We are not really sure.â Why spend the money to give parents and child-care centres no practical information?</para>
<para>The parents who have not kept their receipts are very worried about what will happen to them. We have had comments from the government that the tax office will be expected to take a sympathetic view of parents who have not kept their receipts. I do not know what that means and I do not think that parents know what that means. Does that mean an individual tax officer will have discretion about whether to accept a parentâs assessment of what they have paid? Does that mean that parents will have to go to their child-care centres and get annualised statements? Does that mean they will be dependent on the ability of the child-care centre to produce those annualised statements that they have not needed to produce before? The lack of clarity around this issue of receipts is key to this policy. Parents are being told that they should have kept receipts for child care three months before this policy was ever announced. This policy was announced during the election campaign and when the Treasurer broke those election commitments in December the sweetener was that the rebate would be payable from 1 July 2004 instead of 1 January 2005 as long as people had their receipts.</para>
<para>It beggars belief. Anyone who has had children would know there are many bits of paper flying aroundâthere are the school reports, the bills, the docket for the school photos, the additional $3 a week for music. The notion that parents are keeping, week in, week out, filed somewhere carefully, every receipt from the child-care centre just in case the government announces a rebate is fanciful. The government should make it absolutely clear that parents who have not kept receipts before this policy was announced will not be penalised.</para>
<para>Another group that misses out, as parents who do not keep their receipts might miss out, are single parents with very low tax liabilities. They are likely to get very little or nothing. I have an example of a single mum with one child who gets 100 per cent of the child-care benefit rate, and she pays $76 per week out-of-pocket expenses for full-time child care. That means about $3,900 per year out-of-pocket expenses. So she would be eligible for a tax offset of about $1,150 if she had a tax liability. If she starts up her own business, for exampleâif she is struggling to put bread on the table for her family and she has taken the governmentâs advice and gone out there to look for work in the work forceâshe may have no tax liability, either because the business has not made a lot of money, as they frequently do not in their first year of operation, or because she has had a number of deductible start-up costs. If she has no tax liability and no spouse to pass on the child-care tax rebate to she will miss out entirely.</para>
<para>Why should someone who is, say, starting up a business, struggling to put bread on the table and doing the best she can on her own for her kids miss out on $1,150 from the government? How is it fair that someone on a very high income who might work one or two hours a week will get the full value of the $4,000 and someone on a very low income will miss out entirely? It is certainly no encouragement for parents who are on their own and struggling to make ends meet. Here is another example. Jane contacted me and said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I do not currently put my school age child into any after school care as it is just not worth it. I have never found it worth it to put him into care so that I could work. I am educated to the post graduate level but the costs of working outweigh the benefits for me. I have returned to part-time education while I wait for policies to change in Australia to make it feasible to work and have my child in care. Jobs are not flexible enough around child care and child care is too expensive.</para>

<para class="block">I have another example from Sophie, who says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I am writing to you regarding the 30 per cent childcare rebate which is yet to be enacted. I am a single mother and have been studying full-time for the past three years. I have completed an advanced diploma and have 18 months left until I complete my degree. Whilst I have been studying, my son of course has been in child care. From July to December last year I paid $951 in childcare fees. However, because I do not have a taxable income and therefore do not lodge a tax return, I am ineligible for the 30 per cent rebate. I feel that whilst this policy was well meaningâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">and that is very generous of Sophieâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">and could be most beneficial, because it is being implemented via the taxation system it makes it exclusive. Those on very low incomes would receive most of their tax back. Those who do not lodge a tax return will see not much or no benefit. I contend that as I have maintained a full-time study load, I work as many hours as if I were in paid work and the education allowance I received certainly did not cover childcare costs when my son was in child care. As he is now in school the situation has eased somewhat, though he still requires after school care. If the intention of the childcare rebate is to ease the costs of child care for families then it should be inclusive of those families on low incomes.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Too right, Sophie. It should be inclusive of those parents on low incomes.</para>
<para>The other group who will miss outâand I am sure that they did not realise this during the election campaignâare parents who pay for child care but whose children are not in approved care. An example that came up during the election campaign related to nannies. The government initially said that nannies would be covered but now they are not. That is just one example. There are many others.</para>
<para>Some parents pay family members or friends to look after their children. That will not be covered. Also, parents of children who are in preschools, creches and kindergartens that look after preschool aged children will not get the 30 per cent rebate. This is by far the largest group who will miss out. There are a lot of parents of preschool children who think that they are going to get $4,000 from the government but will not. I have one example from someone who says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Basically, I have never been able to get child care for my eldest child who is now 3Â½, despite having him on waiting lists from a young age. So I have always had nannies at great expense at many different times, and at the moment we have a serious debate why one or other of us is working. It is just to pay the nanny.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">There is no child care or preschool available in this womanâs suburb. She has been forced, again, to find a nanny three days a week as a stopgap until, hopefully, she gets her child into family day care. She says that she will only be a temp, which is not great for the kids, and she goes on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">All this chopping and changing. We have no family in Sydney to help.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This woman is saying that because there are no places at all she has made a private arrangement. She will not get the 30 per cent rebate. If her child went to a preschool she still would not get the 30 per cent rebate. As in many families, one person is working just to pay the child-care bills.</para>
<para>Parents with very high child-care expenses will hit the cap. The rebate is capped at $4,000 per child per year. Where a parent is entitled to the minimum rate of child-care benefit, both parents are working full time and the children need to be in full-time long day care, if they are paying $65 a day, 48 weeks a year, they will hit the cap. There are an awful lot of parents out there who are paying a lot more than $65 a day. I hear from parents all the time who say $80 or $90 a day is quite standard. I have heard of parents paying $100 a day for long day care. They will not get the full benefit of this $4,000 rebate.</para>
<para>The government should have been very clear about this when they announced this election policy. If the government want to be fiscally responsible I have no difficulty with that but I would like them to be honest with the Australian people. They are not going to get what they expect. Some parents will never benefit from the rebate because they cannot afford child care now. They just cannot afford it. They cannot get their kids into care and when they do they cannot afford it. So they will never see a cent of help from the government to afford child care in the first place. They cannot carry the debt for two years so they will miss out altogether.</para>
<para>The government has also been trumpeting its welfare changes. We expect that parents on supporting parent payments or disability support pensions will be returning to the work force. The Treasuryâs most recent forecast of the numbers who would find jobs as a result of the welfare changes is 109,000. Most of them are sole parent pensioners and most of them have kids. Many of them will have more than one child. Many of the children will require long day care or before and after school care. That has not been factored into the cost of this proposal at all.</para>
<para>Finally, I want to address the incredible complexity of having two work activity tests for child-care benefit: one for child-care benefit and one for the child-care tax offset. As we know, parents need to satisfy the child-care benefit activity test to be eligible for the rebate. At the moment, the child-care benefit activity test is just one hour of work, study or training a week, but the government has indicated in the budget that it is going to increase the activity test to 15 hours a week from July this year. This bill is scheduled for debate later in this session. The change to the child-care benefit activity test will mean that workers who are working, say, 12 hours a week will miss out on child-care benefit altogether. We criticised this before the break because someone working 12 hours a week may well need child care for three full days a week. That means they are still paying for 30 hours ofÂ  child care a week but are working only 15 hours a week. We drew attention to this anomaly and asked the Treasurer, at the end of the last session, which activity test would apply for the child-care tax offset. It took him six hours to tell us that the activity test that would apply for the child-care tax offset was the old CCB activity testâthat is, the current CCB activity test that the government is about to change, or the one-hour-a-week activity test.</para>
<para>Parents will have to work, study or train for up to 15 hours a week to be eligible for the full amount of child-care benefit for up to 50 hours a week, but they will have to work, study or train for only one hour a week to get the 30 per cent child-care tax offset. Can anyone explain to me the logic of having two different activity tests and having the more generous activity test, the easier activity test, on the more expensive measureâthe measure that benefits the wealthiest people the most? It is an absolutely illogical approach that will disadvantage part-time workers on low incomes who are struggling to get into or stay in the work forceâwhich is what this government says it wants them to do. They will be the ones that miss out, and someone who is working a couple of hours a week will be eligible for the full 30 per cent rebate on out-of-pocket expenses. It beggars belief.Consequently, I move:</para>

</talker>
<para>âBefore going into the detail of the <inline ref="R2405">Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005</inline>, to put the whole of the child-care and family benefit discussion into context I should point out to the House that NATSEM reports that the incomes of low-income families with children have grown by 18.5 per cent since 1997-98. That was not achieved under the previous government. Low-income families have had an increase in income of almost 20 per cent since 1997. Over 2.1 million families with four million children now receive $7,500 a year on average in family tax benefit to assist in the cost of raising their children. In 2004, the government introduced a new ongoing $600 per child increase in family tax benefit part A. The government delivered an additional one-off $600 per child payment as a result of running a strong economyâall of it going to families with children. These facts seem to be completely glossed over or neglected by the people speaking for the Australian Labor Party. Under the Labor Partyâs child-care programs there was complete chaos. I was here. I heard the Labor Partyâs promises and saw them fail to deliver. The memory of the opposition spokesman seems to be short indeed, but the community has not forgotten.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Family tax benefit part B has provided extra assistance to families with only one main income earner. Eligibility is based on only the secondary earnerâs income. Sole parents receive the maximum benefit regardless of income. All of these facts go to support families with children. To isolate child care as the only thing that benefits families is a false argument. It is an argument that is run by the Australian Labor Party, which claims that there is a shortage of child-care places. I know that my district might be exceptional but I have child-care providers coming to me and saying, âCan you stop the government putting so many child-care centres in our district, because we are not filling them? There are too many places for the number of children that we have coming to us.â That is the role of state governments; the Commonwealth does not determine where child-care centres are placed. So in my district I have an oversupply of child-care centres and providers are having difficulty filling the places. It is not a good scene, although it is good for parents to be able to pick and choose. Given that there seems to be an inequitable distribution of child-care places, I suggest that Labor members in the parliament go to their state governments, have a yarn with their child-care ministers and get them to adopt a better approach to the provision of child care. Local government ought to also be involved in this discussion.</para>
<para>As I said, the Commonwealth does not determine the placement of child-care centres. The fact of the matter is that there is an oversupply in one part of Sydney and an undersupply in other parts. I have not tested the undersupply situation, but every time I hear that there is an undersupply of places I look at my own district and see the petitions and note the groups that have come to see me saying, âWeâve got too many child-care places not filled. Please change that.â It does not seem to be within the capacity of Australian Labor Party members to talk to their state colleagues to take up the case of a sensible approach to child care whereby most child-care places should be situated where there are the most children. That is not happening at the momentâso much for all of the arguments about a shortage of child-care spaces. You should look at the facts. The Howard government have already invested over $12 billion compared with Laborâs $5 billion, so we have more than doubled funding for child care in 13 years. The Howard government have delivered a record number of child-care placesâabout 600,000 as of July this year, almost double the 306,000 places in 1996 when Labor left office. So in that period we have doubled the number of child-care places available and more than doubled expenditure on child care.</para>
<para>The strong economic management of this government has given us the opportunity to reinvest in families. To begin with, I outlined some of the benefits that flow from family tax benefits part A and part B and the facts that 2.1 million families with four million children are now receiving an average of $7,500 a year from family tax benefits and that the income of low-income families has grown by 18.5 per cent since 1997-98. In addition, family tax benefit part B was increased by $300 a year in the 2005 budget. As well, six months earlier it was announced that from 1 January 2005 eligible families would benefit by an extra $150 when they lodged their tax returns this year. All of this is not taken into account by Labor spokesmen. They just dismiss it; they do not even take in the total family income. Instead they say, âLook, this is not working very well.â Let us go through it. I think that the basis of the idea is good and that the out-of-pocket expenses concept is great, yet the fact that we have doubled Laborâs expenditure on child care in the period of time that this government have been in office is not acknowledged in any way.</para>
<para>The 2005 budget is the largest government investment in child care in Australiaâs history. It includes 84,300 outside of school hours care places, more than the total of 72,000 that Labor had in its last year of government. In addition, the government is making child care more affordable for families because they receive an average of $2,000 a year as part of the governmentâs child-care benefits program. This program was introduced in 2000. The average benefit that flows to families taking advantage of child care is $2,000. In addition, in the election campaign last year we announced the new 30 per cent child care tax rebate, which will provide eligible families with extra assistance of up to $4,000 a year for out-of-pocket child-care expenses. I will come back later to the child-care tax rebate. On top of these things, for the whole of the family relationships area the government has announced $397 million to deliver the most significant reforms ever made to the family law system, to assist families with spouses separating, particularly families with children. The centrepiece of the package is $189 million to establish 65 family relationship centres where families can go to get help over their relationships. All of this is impacting on families, child care and the relationships between parents and their children.</para>
<para>The whole of this programâand the governmentâs recordâflies in the face of what the Labor Party did when they were in office. They failed to deliver on Paul Keatingâs promise of 1993 to meet the demand for child care. They were irresponsible in the way in which they went about the planning and management of publicly funded child care. There was a serious deficiency of child care in rural and remote areas and a large undersupply across Australia in services for school-age children, particularly before and after school care. Before and after school care where both parents are working is one area of high demand in my district. The government addressed that during the election campaign, and in this first budget since the election it is meeting its election promises by providing outside of school care in great quantities by an additional 84,300 places this year. Our strong economic management has allowed this to happen.</para>
<para>Let us look at the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy. That has been an excellent program for communities to support parents and their children by providing up to $4 million over four years for disadvantaged communities. The Local Answers program, which includes volunteer small equipment grants and which is popular with all members of this House, supports communities and family based programs.</para>
<para>I now turn to the provisions of the <inline ref="R2405">Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005</inline>. It comprises two parts: the child-care tax rebate and concessions for individual organisations, giving them a tax deduction for donations. I have looked at that, and previous speakers have failed to mention that for the playgroup centres across Australia donations are now tax deductible. One of the most important elements in child care is the playgroup movement. It is Australia-wide and is a wonderful organisation for parents and children. Apparently it is not supported in any way by the Australian Labor Party, but across every state this government is supporting the playgroup movement and providing tax deductibility for donations. That is something that is sure to build the libraries of toys that these groups depend on and help to provide the instruction and overview that coordinators for each district need. It is sure to benefit playgroups. In my area, I know the number of people who take advantage of playgroups is absolutely huge. There are stacks of centres across Western Sydney. I do not know the exact number, but I know that every town centre has more than one group. They are enjoyed by parents of all ages and also by grandparents.</para>
<para>The provisions of this bill also extend tax concessions to other organisations. This is a much better way of providing tax concessions, if I may say so, than the one adopted by environmental groups. I think that the process for environmental groups is absolutely wrong. All groups should have their applications go through the normal channels and be listed by the tax office rather than by a minister or by an application going through the environmental processes for tax deductibility. I do not believe that they deserve that sort of special treatment compared with other worthy organisations that are seeking tax deductibility and may be unable to obtain it. That is an administrative matter that I believe needs to be straightened out.</para>
<para>Looking at the child-care provisions, I have read the explanatory memorandum and looked at the examples given, which are very helpful for understanding the way this new measure is going to be applied. Of course the formulas are there, but when one assesses the process it is quite an easy application. As a previous speaker said, the cap has been applied, but the rebate claim has been brought back to 1 July last year, so the first provisions start to come into effect about now. The cost of these measures is set out in scales in the explanatory memorandum. The cost of this provision for family tax rebates amounts to hundreds of millions of dollarsâan expected total of $970-odd millionâas compared with the billions of dollars currently paid in family care.</para>
<para>The tables that have been produced for the Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005 indicate that, with a taxable income of $30,000, the child-care benefit per week could be about $144. The out-of-pocket amount will be $56 a week. This measure would provide about $16.80 per week, making a combined benefit of $160.80 for that family. Therefore, the percentage of child-care costs that would be covered by both these measures for a person on an income of $30,000 is about 80.4 per cent.</para>

<para>âIt was a rotten performance; we have doubled your effort. We have doubled the number of child-care places and more than doubled the expenditure on families with children. We have provided all sorts of benefits. The member strolled into the chamber, I would like to observe, unaware of the spurious arguments presented by the previous speaker, and failed to hear the brilliant, successful arguments that this government has presented for families. This is a family-friendly government, not only in this area of child care; family-friendly policies are emerging in the workplace as well. Despite Sharan Burrow trying to claim that this government is anti-family, this government is pro-family in its workplace relations, and one only has to look at some of the concessions. I see the papers today are full of people saying what a great thing it is to have an Australian workplace agreement that is family-friendly. So in the workplace we are moving into a new era of family-friendly policies.</para>

<para>I am pleased the honourable member came into the House because he has really sparked my attention on how poor the delivery of programs for child care has been by the Australian Labor Party. I was pointing out that partway through this table it shows that a family with an average taxable income of $30,000 will have a percentage of child-care costs covered by both these measures of 80.4 per cent, but a family with an income of $70,000 will have only 55 per cent of their child care covered. The spurious argument of these measures benefiting those with the greatest income is absolutely wrong. If you put the two elements togetherâ</para>

<para>âI withdraw my comments, but the member for Sydney subverts the argument by the gross inaccuracies of the presentation, and the gross inaccuracies fail to recognise that people with the lowest incomesâtaxable incomes of $30,000âget 80 per cent of their child-care costs covered. Those on $70,000 get only 55 per cent of their child-care costs covered. Those on an income of $100,000 get only 35 per cent, 36 per cent covered. The tables are there; they are out. The Parliamentary Library is full of this information. All the honourable member has to do is to be decent enough to pick up this information, which is readily available to every member, and use it. You do not have to run spurious arguments; you just have to run with facts. I know that when I say âyouâ I am speaking to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, because I know that if you were to persuade the member to be more accurate in the presentation we would have a better debate. But she cannot; she uses spurious arguments. The final argument in favour of the governmentâs policies, by this and previous measuresâapart from all the doubling of expenditure and the increase in the number of children in child-care centresâis that the benefits for families are such that those on the lowest income will have 80 per cent of their child care paid and those on the highest income will have only 35 per cent, 38 per cent paid.</para>

<para>âIt is with some pleasure that I speak on the <inline ref="R2405">Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005</inline>. I must say, in due deference to the member for Mitchell, that he would hardly spark any activity on either side of the House. The truth is that we well appreciate that he has been here far too long, and his last speech reflects well on why some people want to take him out at the next preselection round. Having said that, this bill is very important. I would urge the member for Mitchell to stay and learn something about child care, because his previous contribution has proved that he has no understanding not only of the child-care measure before the House this morning but also, more importantly, of the crisis that confronts the child-care industry at the moment after almost 10 years of the Howard government being in office.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I want to raise some issues relating to the tax laws amendment measures bill which go specifically to my portfolio responsibilities, in addition to speaking on the issue of child care. My view is that this bill is the latest in a long line of tax law amendment bills that reflect the governmentâs incompetence and mismanagement of the taxation system in Australia. This governmentâs approach to the taxation system is to continually fiddle at the edges. It is about including more and more complexity, more and more special circumstances for certain sectors, more and more opportunity for rorting by certain sectors, often friends or mates of the government, and more and more administrative costs and red tape associated with tax collection and rebate payments.</para>
<para>Let us start today with schedule E. This schedule relates to the extension of the wine equalisation tax rebate to New Zealand wine producers. That is an interesting concept. As we have already heard this morning, wine producers will be able to claim a wine equalisation tax rebate of up to $290,000 per year paid by Australian taxpayers. The net effect of this measure is that each year about $1 million of the wholesale value of each producerâs wine sales in Australia is exempt from the so-called WET. The existing rebate is available to wine producers registered for GST in Australia, but this will now provide the rebate to New Zealand wine producers. In essence, the Australian Taxation Office will now be sending out tax rebates to foreign nationals not paying tax in Australia and living in another country.</para>
<para>I am concerned that this is potentially the thin edge of the wedge. It is not clear from the ministerâs comments so far what damage could be done to Australian producers. Further, it is not clear whether this measure will open up the floodgates for wine producers in other countries where Australia has trade agreements or what the extent of revenue leakage could ultimately be. We are advised by the government that the measure was apparently undertaken as part of the closer economic relations program and on request by the New Zealand government. As my colleague noted earlier, New Zealand will obviously have to withdraw its objections to the WET rebate in the WTO as part of this proposal. Of course, it remains to be seen how other trading partners will react to that. I would like the government to address this very serious issue in its response to the debate today as to what reaction it expects from other trade partnersâwhether it expects the extension of the WET to New Zealand wine producers will impact on the reaction of other trading partners. For example, what will the government do if the United States or Australiaâs other trading partners ask for the same treatment? I think we should be properly informed today as to what implications it has with respect to our revenue base.</para>
<para>I consider this proposal to be ill thought out and fraught with the potential for industry harm and enormous revenue leakage. But I am not surprised, given the governmentâs position on the protection of Australian producers. This proposal comes on top of an unwillingness by the Howard government to do something about country of origin food labelling. Now we will be subsidising New Zealand wine producers to take away Australian jobs, with hard-earned Australian tax dollars being given to them to produce wine in competition with Australia.</para>
<para>Australians have a right to know the country of origin of the food presented to them in Australian retail outlets. Under the current regime, labelling options are not clearly identified for consumers. This effectively means that, under current arrangements, retailers may label fruits and vegetables with their countries of origin but they are only required to display a small sign stating that the product might be imported. I am strongly in support of the campaign being run by Tasmanian growers hand in hand with the Tasmanian government, led by Premier Paul Lennon, which is about expressing to the Australian community how concerned Australian farmers are about proper labelling on the products they produce for Australian retail outlets.</para>
<para>The current situation denies consumers the opportunity to support Australian producers, and I believe that extending the WET proposition to New Zealand producers builds on the difficulties currently confronting Australian industry. The truth is, and the record shows, that the Howard government has been promising to fix the problem since it took office in 1996, but it has failed to do so. This is now a major issue not only in Tasmania with respect to the producers of products such as potatoes and peas but also in the minds of Australian consumers. They want to buy Australian products, and I am sure there are sensitivities about the tax option before the chair today to subsidise New Zealand wine producers to the potential disadvantage of Australian wine producers.</para>
<para>I now want to turn to the question of child care, a very serious issue. I think the child-care industry in Australia is in crisis at this point in time. The problem is that this tax option does little to resolve the major problems confronting the child-care industry. I am seriously worried about the potential impact that the governmentâs proposed industrial relations changes will have on the welfare of child-care workers. I have a long history of representing child-care workers, not only from an industrial point of view but also through the accord process and the decision to extend fee relief to the private sector. That was a major policy change in the provision of child care in Australia, aimed at lifting the number of available places. It was a huge policy decision that required the implementation of an accreditation process at armâs length from government so as to guarantee the commitment of private child-care providers to the provision of quality child-care services throughout Australia. That decision did a lot to increase the number of quality child-care places available to working people in Australia during the accord process of 1983 to 1996.</para>
<para>Having said that, I also have had the long-term view that too many in the Australian community regard the requirement for child care almost as charity, that it is something they should not have to pay for and that, frankly, child-care workers are not entitled to fair wages and conditions of employment. I am seriously worried about the potential breakdown in the industrial relations system. This is a group of workers, predominantly women, who very much depend on the Australian industrial relations system, which is about a fair go. This year a major decision was made on the wages of child-care workers, which recognised the fact that they are undervalued and accepted that the only way to rectify that was to phase in significant wage increases over an extended period of two years, if I remember correctly. That is not different from what Labor did during the accord period, with the assistance of the Industrial Relations Commission, in remedying the lack of wages justice for the lower paid in the Australian community.</para>
<para>In this debate about tax, we must also have regard to the importance of child care in the debate about industrial relations and to those who potentially are the big losers in terms of the changes that will be imposed by the Howard government. Child-care workers are potentially the biggest losers. They are at the bottom end of the wages system in Australia. They have little collective strength. They are often in small workplaces and are at the tail end of a capacity to negotiate individually with employers, as set out in the system to be imposed by the Howard government. Their current wages and conditions of employment are moving towards a position where they could be regarded as fair, when you consider the responsibilities they accept in caring for our young people, given the assistance of the Industrial Relations Commission over many years. I say to those child-care workers, the majority of whom are women: âYou should stand up and be counted in this debate about industrial relations, because not only are women potentially the biggest losers but, more importantly, many child-care workers are potentially the biggest losers as a result of the changes being pursued on the industrial relations front by the Howard government.â</para>
<para>That brings me to the issue of the crisis in child care. There are many thousands of parents who want child care, but their problem is that not only is the tax issue being incorrectly addressed by the Howard government but also there are major structural issues. Thousands of families cannot find a place in any type of child-care facility for their children. It is suggested that, at the moment, 50,000 places are needed nationwide just for those children who are currently missing out. I wonder where we as a community would be if we had not experienced the decline in the fertility rate in recent decades in terms of the huge demand that currently exists for child care.</para>
<para>I say to the Howard government that, after almost 10 years of government, it is about time they got serious about doing something with respect to the provision of child care throughout Australia and produced a more constructive working relationship with state and territory governments to not only provide the additional places but also guarantee that they are quality places. There are special problems confronting shiftworkers and people who work casual weekend hours. The provision of child care for those people is far more limited. We have to think more seriously about the nature of the child-care system, especially with the changing nature of work in Australia, and how we can make available quality child-care places for those people in the Australian community.</para>
<para>In relation to child care and the taxation debate, there are serious difficulties with the proposals before the chair. Some of those primary changes, which are about creating a new tax offset called the child-care tax offset, are outlined in schedule 1 of the bill.</para>
<para>As the shadow minister, the member for Sydney, has clearly identified to the House this morning, the child-care rebate has been a mess from the beginning. It has been a mess from day one and it is still not rectified by the measures before the House this morning. While the proposal does implement one of the governmentâs election promises, this change now has a $4,000 capâsomething the government forgot to tell the Australian voting public in the lead-up to the election last year. One problem with the rebate is that the parents will not get itâand this is very importantâuntil the end of the financial year subsequent to the year that the child-care fees were paid. It is almost as if it is on the never-never.</para>
<para>The truth is that many people who have to avail themselves of child care live from week to weekâthey find it hard to make ends meet. Under this proposal they are going to have to wait, in essence, 30 months before they will get any relief from the burden of fees they have already paid. That is a very significant burden on Australian working people. It is a more significant burden on the low paid in the community and, unfortunately, this proposal does not recognise the heavy burden that these people bear on behalf of the Australian community.</para>
<para>The government, as part of its justification, is suggesting that this lag exists because it does not get information about child-care usage and fees for the March-June quarter until around October, when it is too late for the Australian Taxation Office to verify parentsâ rebate claims. I believe this is a very weak argument. There are many examples of benefits being paid on the basis of estimated income with later reconciliation, including family tax benefit.</para>
<para>There is also the potential for a new type of debt trap for parents. ABC Learning, Australiaâs biggest child-care provider, is heavily advertising a $4,000 credit line, offered to parents for child-care services. Because of the two-year delay between incurred expenses and the receipt of the rebate, parents who accept this offer will have their debt repayable at least 12 months before they receive the rebate. Also, it will not be until the 2005-06 financial year that parents can claim the rebate in tax returns for the first time.</para>
<para>It is also accepted that the tax rebate is very complicated, and many parents do not and will not understand how and when they can claim the rebate or how much they will receive from it. The list of problems with the child-care rebate is long and reflects yet another area of the governmentâs incompetence, mismanagement and lack of understanding of the pressures on working people in this day and age.</para>
<para>Let us deal with a few of these. Parents who do not keep all their child-care receipts could miss out. Single mothers with a very low tax liability, but the greatest need, will not receive the full value of the rebate. Parents who pay fees to child-care providers that are not approved will miss out. Parents with high child-care expenses will hit the cap of $4,000. Some parents will never benefit from the rebate because they will not be able to afford to pay the costs of care up front. I believe that this rebate is another example of financial mismanagement. It is likely to lead to a further budget black hole.</para>
<para>There are two activity tests for the child-care benefit, which means more red tape, more administrative costs and more difficulty for parents trying to access the benefit. In essence, the opposition believes that this proposal is regressive and inflationary and that it does nothing to address the real problemâthat is, the need for an increase in supply of quality child care and its accessibility to parents, including parents with different working patterns such as casuals and shift workers.</para>
<para>My colleagues spoke earlier on schedules 2 and 3. Labor, as our representatives have indicated, have significant reservations in relation to this bill. In particular, this bill introduces into an already overly complex tax system more complexity, loopholes and costs, and it introduces into the Australian taxation system the potential for revenue leakage and a budget black hole. It is a very long way from serious and meaningful tax reform and also a very long way from a serious and meaningful commitment to improve the provision of child care in Australia. Also, I believe that it winds back the achievements of the Hawke and Keating governments not only on tax reform but also on the provision of child care in Australia.</para>
<para>It is for that reason that I support the second reading amendment moved by the member for Sydney, the shadow minister, which clearly focuses on the governmentâs failures on the issue of child care. As the second reading amendment suggests, this measure does nothing to increase the availability of quality child-care places. Further, it breaks the governmentâs own election promiseâon top of a range of broken election promisesâthat the rebate would be available immediately and uncapped. Working people actually have to wait 30 months to receive the benefits of this tax measure. I do not believe it makes any sense for working people who are finding it difficult to meet their financial commitments to have to wait 30 months for relief from high child-care fees. It also causes confusion by creating a different activity test from the test for the child-care benefit, and it introduces an unfair rebate that leaves many Australian parents who have high child-care costs out of the system. It is interesting that this is to occur at a time of significant debate on welfare to work, which is often tagged in the context of the governmentâs rhetoric about getting single mothers back to work. I would have thought we would have been doing more to assist single mothers back into the workplace to overcome some of the skill shortages in Australia by being overgenerous with the provision of child-care benefits for that particular group of the Australian community. On that basis, I commend the second reading amendment to the House and, in doing so, suggest to the government that after 10 years it is time for it to do something of real benefit to assist in the provision of quality child-care places in Australia.</para>

<para>âI rise today to speak on the <inline ref="R2405">Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005</inline>. This bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the Taxation Administration Act 1953, the A New Tax System (Family Assistance) (Administration) Act 1999 and the A New Tax System (Wine Equalisation Tax) Act 1999. The first schedule of this bill fulfils the governmentâs election promise of providing Australian parents with a 30 per cent rebate on out-of-pocket child-care expenses of up to $4,000 per child.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I was sorry to hear the previous speaker, the member for Batman, taking the opportunity in addressing this measure to perpetuate the sweeping unfounded statements that have been made by the union and the Labor Party about workplace reforms. The member for Batman sought to unnecessarily frighten child-care workers in addressing this bill. The member for Batman understands, as should everybody on the other side of the House, that the workplace reforms are not about the removal of rights; they are all about retaining protections in awards while at the same time creating the opportunity to add new rights and explore new conditions. They are in fact a continuation of the measures begun by the Keating government 12 years ago. They are part of a remodelling of our workplace relations arrangements that was begun in 1993 and continued in 1996. We are now reaching stage 3.</para>
<para>If you look at what former Prime Minister Keating said at the time to the Australian Institute of Company Directors, you will see that he said that we should reach a point where agreements are separated from awards and where arrangements are struck at a workplace level. These are the best arrangements, he said, and are the ones which will provide the best productivity as well as the best quality of life for employeesâand he was right. We are continuing that process with the reforms that are before the House at the present time. It is regrettable that the member for Batman would take this opportunity to frighten child-care workers. The workplace reforms are an opportunity for child-care workers, not a cause for concern. I can say to child-care workers: seize the opportunity, take advantage of the things that are going to be offered and have no concern for the rights that have already been hard-won and earned.</para>
<para>The child-care rebate that we have in front of us in this amendment is just one pillar of the governmentâs initiatives to support Australian families. Again, if you listened to the speakers on the other side of the House, you would think that there was not a range of measures which go to providing a comprehensive child-care support system within Australia. Under this government, the number of child-care places has grown from 306,500 to 563,000. Not only that, but families have been given further support for the cost of child care through the child-care benefit, with Australian families receiving on average around $2,000 each year from the child-care benefit. Of course, Australian families are also benefiting from the family tax benefit part B. There is a comprehensive range of assistance directed very much to child-care arrangements in this country. It has been a proud area of activity for this government over 9Â½ years and one which we are continuing with these amendments.</para>
<para>The government announced in December that the 30 per cent child-care rebate will now be backdated to 1 July 2004, allowing Australian families to claim an extra six months of out-of-pocket expenses for child care. This rebate will provide extra assistance for around 640,000 families, with a cost of $1 billion over four years. It is real money, it is serious money and it adds significantly to the range of other measures which assist families in accessing child-care places in Australia today. In order to maximise the benefit of the rebate, taxpayers with insufficient tax liability to absorb the whole rebate will be able to transfer any unused amount to their spouse. This is a genuine attempt to allow families to get the maximum benefit from the rebate.</para>
<para>The rebate can be claimed by Australian families in the subsequent yearâs tax return. The decision to have the rebate claimed in the subsequent year was made in order to avoid any complication that may occur if a family is also eligible for the child-care benefits. This way, families will know the final amount of their child-care benefit received and can adjust accordingly. The child-care benefit is claimed fortnightly through reduced child-care fees which are based on an estimate of the familyâs adjusted taxable income. The correct entitlement to the child-care benefit is calculated on an annual reconciliation by Centrelink. The government felt that the system of claiming the cost in the subsequent yearâs return was the one which would reduce any possible complications, any confusion, any stress and any concern for families. This measure is taken in good faith to assist and add to the wide range of measures that we are seeing for child care in this country.</para>
<para>The second schedule in this bill adds nine new organisations to the list of deductible gift recipients in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Amongst the list of new deductible gift recipients, my colleagues on the other side of the House will be pleased to noteâI might add that the member for Hunter welcomed this inclusion earlier this yearâis the Chifley Research Centre. I can only hope that this opportunity will assist the Chifley Research Centre to provide some much needed serious policy input to the opposition benches. The other organisations listed include Crime Stoppers Northern Territory; Playgroup WA, Queensland, Tasmania and New South Wales; and the Rotary Club of Katoombaâimportant additions.</para>
<para>The third schedule to this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to expand the ability of the Commissioner of Taxation to disclose business income tax information to the Australian Statistician for the purposes of improving the quality and scope of information that can be provided to the public. Currently, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 only allows for the disclosure of this information for the limited purposes of conducting periodic surveys and the compilation of national accounts. This limits the ability of the Australian Bureau of Statistics to use this information for broader analytic purposes. Those broader purposes include using this information for longitudinal studies to develop more comprehensive databases of businesses and for statistical modelling. Also, the Australian Bureau of Statistics may use the information for producing regional small business outputs. Allowing the broader use of this information will provide a great benefit in providing detailed statistical information about Australian businesses.</para>
<para>The fourth and final schedule to this bill provides that New Zealand wine producers whose wine is exported to the Australian market are able to access the wine producer rebate that is currently available to Australian producers. Australia and New Zealand entered into the closer economic relationship agreement in 1983, and it remains one of the worldâs most successful free trade agreements. I think it has greatly influenced the attitude of Australia to other bilateral agreements that have been successfully negotiated. It has shown that successful bilateral agreements can be a forerunner to putting pressure on wider multilateral agreements and, in the meantime, very important benefits can be achieved by individual economies in those bilateral agreements. On any count, the closer economic relationship agreement has been an outstanding success and has been added to through the years by both sides of this House.</para>
<para>Since 1983, two-way trade with New Zealand has expanded by some 500 per cent. In 2003-04, trans-Tasman trade amounted to $A17.3 billion. New Zealand is Australiaâs fifth largest market, taking 7.4 per cent of its exports, and it is Australiaâs seventh largest source of imports. Australia is New Zealandâs principal trading partner, taking 22 per cent of its exports and providing 22 per cent of its imports. It has been manifestly good for both countries. It has required give and take and a harmonisation of more and more arrangements between our two countries, and that can only continue into the future.</para>
<para>As part of this closer economic relationship, which has benefited both economies over the past two decades, Australia agreed to extend the wine equalisation tax rebate to New Zealand wine producers selling into the Australian market. Currently, Australian wine producers can claim a wine equalisation tax rebate of up to $290,000 per year. This effectively means that $1 million of the wholesale value of each producerâs wine sales per year are exempt from the wine equalisation tax. Following the implementation of this legislation, New Zealand wine producers will be able to apply to the Commissioner of Taxation to become approved New Zealand participants in this scheme. If they receive approval and can demonstrate that the wine equalisation tax has been paid, they will be eligible for the rebate.</para>
<para>The closer economic relationship between Australia and New Zealand is of vital importance to our two economies. This initiative continues that closer relationship and the understanding and give and take that is essential to the relationship that has been forged over the last two decades, and I commend this initiative in further helping to improve that relationship. I commend these four initiatives and this bill to the House.</para>

</talker>
<para>âIn my remarks on the <inline ref="R2405">Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005</inline>, I wish to address the 30 per cent child-care rebate and to support the second reading amendment moved by the member for Sydneyâin particular, to condemn the government for doing nothing to increase the number of child-care places or to address their affordability, for breaking its own election promise that the rebate would be available immediately and uncapped, for making people wait for up to 30 months for relief from high child-care fees, for causing confusion by creating a different activity test from the test for the child-care benefit; and, finally, for introducing an unfair rebate that leaves cold many Australian parents who have high child-care costs and for making them wait for a long period of time.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>From the beginning, this child-care rebate has been a mess. As one of my colleagues has said, it is a headline dreamt up during the election campaign looking for a policy. I well remember the day that the Treasurer announced his changes from those that he had put forward during the election campaign. It was 21 December last year, four days before Christmas and the day that the Treasurer brought down the midyear economic review. He held a press conference in Parliament House where he announced that this rebate would not be available quickly to parents, as they would have to wait up to 30 months before seeing one dollar of this new initiative that was supposed to go to the heart of addressing the financial concerns of many in the community who are working hard to improve their financial situation and require expensive child care.</para>
<para>This retreat from the original measure promised shows that this Treasurer is simply a phoney when he claims either to be an economic reformer or, on the other hand, to be in touch with the challenges and struggles of working families. In the way it is constructed, the measure is inflationary, as my colleagues have said. But, in the way he has amended it, the Treasurer has made it virtually impossible for many families to continue to work and access the child care they require because it is simply unaffordable. If you move out into the community and talk to parents about what the government has done, it is unbelievable to find that a government could dream up a measure where some parents will have to wait for over two years before they see a dollar of the money. Before the election, the government claimed that the rebate would be available from this financial year. But, as we know, after the election they said that parents would not get their child-care rebate until the end of the financial year after the year that the child-care fees had been paid.</para>
<para>I think what this change demonstrates is that the government was driven by one motive and one motive alone: its desire for re-election. It was not driven by the desire to provide some affordability to child care in the long-term interests of families who are struggling to be, on the one hand, good parents and, on the other hand, good workers. This measure, more than any other, exposes the phoneyness of our Treasurer in claiming that somehow he is a compassionate conservative. This demonstrates that the Treasurer is nothing more than a cold-hearted conservative who is seriously out of touch with the lives of working families in this community. How he could possibly mount an argument that families facing very high out-of-pocket child-care costs can afford to wait over two years for the rebate is simply beyond me, because most families do live from payday to payday. Most families require that relief as soon as they can possibly get it.</para>
<para>And we see recognition of this fact in the initiative of ABC child-care centres to provide loans to families who may be eligible for the rebate. The loans did not just suddenly materialise. They materialised because they saw a revenue stream potentially available to ABC child-care centres, brought about by this act of vandalism from the Howard government in forcing families to wait that long for their out-of-pocket expenses, and so they came forward with a commercial loan. That is why that commercial loan arrangement has arrivedâto fill the gap in Peter Costelloâs broken promise. That is why it is there for everybody to see and it recognises the fact that people cannot afford to carry such out-of-pocket expenses for that long.</para>
<para>As we know, most families have maxed out on their credit cards already, which is why we are seeing high levels of household debt. It is not just their home loan mortgages; it is the amount of money they have maxed out on their credit cards. On top of that, in an environment where record amounts of debt have been transferred to households, the Treasurer comes up with a brilliant initiative to make parents wait over two years for their rebates. Nothing demonstrates more how out of touch this government is, how arrogant it has become and how phoney our Treasurer is than this broken promise and the financial implications of that for the debt of household families. Nothing demonstrates that more clearly than this bill before the House today.</para>
<para>The government does need to go back to the drawing board and come up with a solution which helps parents now, not in two years time, not in 30 months time. This is bad social policy and it is bad economic policy. On the one hand it is inflationary and on the other hand it does not recognise the financial pressures faced by families. And it runs directly contrary to all the rhetoric we hear from this Treasurer in the House about how he is a great advocate for the three Ps. What does this do to participation if families cannot afford to carry those out-of-pocket expenses that he wants to delay for 30 months? What it probably means is that they cannot work harder. What does that do to participation in our economy? I will tell you what it does: it completely shreds his claim to be an economic reformer in this area of participation, just as his recent tax package completely shreds any pretence that the government is serious about participation. This measure points to the phoneyness of the governmentâs approach completely. It exposes it completely.</para>
<para>So we have a Treasurer who is going to make Australian families wait two years before they receive a red cent of the 30 per cent child-care rebate. And he made this clear four days before Christmas, hoping no-one would noticeâand, of course, they did not. But now families are noticing and that is why the backlash is developing. He has done this in an environment where the costs for many families are simply exceeding the average inflation rate. He has done this in an environment where we have had one interest rate riseâI would say $48 a month for someone with a relatively modest mortgage of $300,000. He has done it in an environment where Tony Abbott has broken his ironclad promise on the Medicare safety net, and that has cost an extra $17 a month. And he has done it in an environment where private health insurance premiums have skyrocketed by an average of $14 a month. That is the environment he has done it in. Then what does he do? On top of this broken promise and the financial pressure that he has put on Australian families he then overlays a new level of complexity. It is so typical of this government. What is the complexity? They are demanding that parents claiming the rebate will have to present all their receipts, even if the child-care provider has a record of the payments. More regulation. Of course this is the Treasurer that has produced the 9,000-page income tax act, so we should not be surprised. There should be a legislative guarantee that parents will get the rebate they are entitled to whether or not they have their receipts.</para>
<para>But what is really bad about this measure is what it does, or does not do, for participation in the work force. Making families wait two years for the rebate, as I said before, will make child care much less affordable. That means that the rebate will do far less to encourage mothers back into the paid work force than if they could claim the rebate in the same year as the expenses were incurred. As I said before, we hear a lot from the Treasurer about the three Ps, particularly about the participation challenge. If we are serious about the participation challenge, why are we making families wait and making child care less affordable? All that will mean is keeping people out of the work force for longer.</para>
<para>The public record will show that after the last budget Labor proposed a genuine tax reform package that sought to tackle the participation challenge in our economy. The government did notâin that package there was no effort by the government to target reductions and marginal tax rates to those whose participation would respond most. The Melbourne Instituteâs analysis of Laborâs tax proposal showed not only that it delivered more tax relief for all but the highest income families but also that it would have encouraged 75 per cent more Australians into the labour market than the governmentâs plan. In particular, the Melbourne Institute analysis also shows that Laborâs package would have delivered double the increase in the average hours worked compared to the governmentâs.</para>
<para>Government policy in tax, government policy when it comes to the 30 per cent child-care rebate, is heading in the opposite direction. It is heading in a direction which discourages participation and pushes people away from the work force. It does not encourage them to go into the work force. It does not provide the incentive when they are in the work force. It does not provide assistance with child care, which of course then brings us to the attack on peopleâs living standards that is coming from the governmentâs extreme industrial relations policies. The government in this instance wants to attack their household income and take away penalty rates on overtime, which people need to either pay the mortgage or pay for the gap that is left in the affordability of their child-care fees brought about by the fact that the government is making them wait for two years to receive any money under this so-called initiative.</para>
<para>The Treasurer had the hide to come into the House yesterday and dress up his extreme attack on the living standards of low- and middle-income Australians by claiming that somehow there is going to be some productivity dividend from what the government is about to do to the take-home pay and the living standards of average families. I am afraid the evidence is not there for the Treasurer. Essentially, the case that he tries to make is repudiated by eminent authorities. Professor Richard Freeman, the Professor of Economics at Harvard and the London School of Economics, deals with the claims of the Treasurer that somehow there is going to be increased productivity from slashing wages and that somehow there is going to be this big productivity dividend, by looking at experience from around the world. This is what Professor Freeman had to say about the sort of case mounted by the Treasurer in this House yesterday:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">As the criticisms have mounted, many international organisations have backed away from their condemnation of labour institutions and now express more nuanced views about the economic effects of labour market institutions than they did a decade or so earlier.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">New Zealand moved to individual contracts in 1991 when Australia moved to enterprise bargaining. But between 1991 and 1997 New Zealand labour productivity fell behind that of Australia. Professor Freemanâs argument is also relevant to the assessment of the OECD of the New Zealand experience. In 1993 the OECD made claims about what would be the outcome of the New Zealand experience. They said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">By allowing more decentralised employment contracting, it is expected that the Act will allow managers and workers to introduce practices that improve productivity.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That was the claim from the Treasurer in the House today. But it is not what the OECD are now saying about the New Zealand experience. In 2003â10 years laterâunder the heading âHave the economic reforms paid off?â this is what the OECD had to say about the New Zealand experience, which is where this government wants to take this country and why this government wants to attack the living standards of low- and middle-income workers in this community:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The reasons why past reforms have not yielded larger productivity gains are not fully understood.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is their verdict on the New Zealand experience.</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Some further increase may still be the pipelineâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">that is, we are still waiting for itâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">but it would be unwise to assume that it will be large.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So the claims that the Treasurer has made for his attack on the living standards of families are phoney and a furphy, just as this 30 per cent child-care rebate is a phoney attempt to claim that this government is in touch with the financial pressures on Australian families.</para>
<para>Nobody in their right mind could possibly be claiming that their desire is to assist Australian families with their out-of-pocket child-care costs by turning round and making them wait for two years after they have spent the money to receive a single cent. No-one could possibly claim that, particularly in an environment where many families may have to go to ABC child-care centres to borrow the money. Then the Treasurer turns around and says, âBut you may not see a cent of it after two years because we want you to produce every single receipt.â If there were ever anything that indicated how out of touch the front bench of the government is, it is that administrative requirement. These are people who probably never fill up a tank of petrol, probably never open their wallets to do the very basic things that families do every day to pay the bills, to pay for the petrol, to pay the electricity bill, to fix the car, to do all of those sorts of things. As the member for Sydney was saying earlier, families do not live that sort of lifestyle. They have a stack of papers that pile up and up and up. After two years, the government wants them to produce all of the receipts, with all of the complexity and all of the strain that will produce around the kitchen table, when they have the information anyway. I would accept this as a reasonable requirement and as a protection of public funds if it were not for the very simple fact that the government actually has all the information in the first place.</para>
<para>This is regulation gone mad and we have seen it again. It is regulation gone mad because it has a purpose. The government never really wanted to pay for the promise it made and that is why it announced this backdown, this cut to it, four days before Christmas last yearâand we are now living with the consequences. We are living with the consequences of a policy that is not economically responsible, does not enhance participation, is not necessarily equitable and is horrendously complex. And in that environment the Treasurer claims to be a reformer.</para>
<para>What do we see today? We see an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> that talks about a new tax office ruling that essentially says churches and charitable organisations that are struggling to help families out there in a whole variety of ways could well lose their tax deductibility if they criticise the government. The church and charitable organisations of this country have got a very big stake in the failure of government policies in areas like child care because they are picking up the pieces from the governmentâs failed welfare reform policies in the first place. Those failed policies are going to slash the incomes of many people who are very vulnerable, such as sole parents and disability support pensionersâprecisely the people the government claims, on the one hand, that it wants to participate in the work force. This is the core of their participation initiative. On the other hand, they bring in an initiative such as this which actually makes it even more difficult for these people to participate. This is very bad social policy and it is very bad economic policy because it does not maximise the potential of our work force, of every human being out there who wants to participate. It fails to provide the incentive when people need it, it leaves people high and dry and it will leave many families with a potential debt trap. So the governmentâs final solution to this mess, this horrendously complex, unfair proposal, is then to turn round and say, âAny of those great organisations out there that want to stand up for families: weâre going to slash their tax deductibility if they dare to criticise our horrendously unfair and inefficient social policies.â</para>
<para>It just says so much about the arrogance of this government. After nine long years the best it can do to enhance participation is to tell families with young children that they have to wait two years before they see one dollar of additional financial relief. This is a window into the soul of the Howard government, into its modus operandi and into the fact that it does not really care about or understand the financial pressures facing Australian families. We saw it in the proposals it had for tax during the budget where basically everyone earning under $100,000 was left out of any substantial tax relief. This government is really only ever operating in its own political interests, not in the long-term interests of the nation. The failure of the government to deliver a fair 30 per cent tax rebate is a perfect example of that. For that reason the government ought to be condemned.</para>

<para>âI rise to support the amendment to the second reading of the <inline ref="R2405">Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005</inline> moved by the member for Sydney. This is an omnibus bill but there is only one element that I want to go to, and that is the proposition to extend what, on the face of it, purports to be a government promise to introduce a 30 per cent child-care rebate. That was their election promise. They went to the Australian people promising to deliver it. This has now been exposed not only in this legislation but also in statements from the Treasurer subsequent to the election as a deceitful promise and a hollow one. It is deceitful because not all will be able to benefit from it, and that was the governmentâs claim. They said that the rebate would be available immediatelyâit is not. They promised that it would not be capped and now it will be. It is a hollow promise because it fails to provide, and this government have consistently failed to provide, for the massive deficiency in child-care places.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In a sense, giving financial relief is important for child care, but of what importance is it if the places do not exist, if people cannot get access to the places to take advantage of this narrowed-down version of the rebate? This is a huge problem in regional Australia, the area for which I now have responsibility on this side of the chamber in this parliament. The issue of balancing work and family is recognised by everyoneâeveryone, that is, except the government. The historic decision of the Industrial Relations Commission the other day understands the fundamental importance of enabling families to balance the work and family relationship, to not have to make a choice between being a good parent or a good employee but to be able to be both and to have the opportunity to look after the family and to get flexibility in their terms in workplace arrangements. It is one thing for the Industrial Relations Commission to recognise thatâand we wait to see whether the government are going to back that decision; so far they have refused to say that they will honour the outcome in the new industrial relations agenda that we still await the details ofâbut, again, there is no point in arguing that there should be balance between work and family if people cannot exercise the balance because the child-care places do not exist. For that reason the amendment from the member for Sydney has been moved and I am speaking in this debate.</para>
<para>I come back to the deceit. It is important to remind this House yet again of a government saying one thing before the election and doing something different once they get elected. The fact is they promised that all would be able to benefit from this. The truth is that if people do not pay for child care because they cannot get a place then they do not get the benefit. If they do not get a place they simply do not get the benefit. And if the cost is in excess of $4,000 the rebate is capped. None of this was ever said in the lead-up to the election. In circumstances in which people do not pay taxâand there are some who for a lot of reasons are outside the tax netâthey do not get the benefit. So it is not true to say that all will benefit, and it was never true on the governmentâs part to promise that it would be uncapped. It did not take too long after the election for them to break that promise. This legislation simply confirms that.</para>
<para>Also, it is not immediate. We were told when this election promise was made that it would be from July 2004 and claimable thereafter. We now find out that, whilst you can go back to July 2004, it is only claimable in the 2005-06 context. This can lead to delays, as I understand it, of up to 30 months. I think the member for Lilley referred to this; I know the member for Sydney has. It also means that, if the benefit is to be obtained, people have to keep all their receipts and lodge their proposals on time even to make this 30-months delayâmore headaches for them. We also have this incredible circumstance where some agencies are offering loans, encouraging people who cannot afford it to go further and further into debt. We already know of the debt trap that Australian families have been forced into because of the policies of this government. This is another one of them. In many senses what they are introducing here is a HECS scheme for child care. That was never said in the lead-up to the election, and neither was the cappingâI have mentioned that before. So this is not a simple proposition, it is not an honest proposition and it does not address the fundamental problem, and that is the lack of child-care places.</para>
<para>In contrast, Labor went to the last election promising a package that would do just thatâincrease the number of child-care places. It did a lot more. It offered important fee relief of, on average, $20 a week. But on the question of places, we proposed a universal free day of care for every three- and four-year-old eligible child who was on child-care benefit. And we promised to provide 6,500 more long day care places and 8,000 more out of school hour places. So there were guarantees in terms of a place and the provision of additional places. In addition, we said that as well as those places we would give assistance to the states to reduce preschool fees. We proposed funding for 35 multifunction child resource centres, assistance to family day care and play groups, parenting education and home visits for new parents, an adult literacy network and the promotion of reading aloud to young children.</para>
<para>That was a comprehensive policy dealing with child careâand Labor proposed it. It was fully costed and funded. We published those proposals. Treasury costed them and gave them the tick. So it is not as though this is not affordable; it comes back to the priorities of the government. We put forward proposals which were fully costed and funded. They would not have put upward pressure on inflation but would have given important relief and opportunity to parents wanting to get back into the workplace and participate in the work forceâsomething about which we hear empty words and rhetoric from the other side.</para>
<para>In contrast, the governmentâs policy, which has now been exposed as being so deceitful, was not properly costed. This raised the questionâMr Deputy Speaker McMullan, you and I have had the opportunity to talk about this issue on other occasionsâof just how much of a sham the Charter of Budget Honesty is. Where was the requirement for this government to put up for costing its proposal for the child-care rebate? As far as I can find out from the record, that did not happen. Laborâs proposals were fully costed and funded. Not only were the governmentâs proposals not costed but we now know they deceived the electorate about what the promise actually meant. So here we had another example of an opportunity going wanting. We could have addressed the issue of an increase in child-care places. We could have done something really constructive not just to help the balance between work and family but to drive a micro-economic reform that would have encouraged greater participation in the work force.</para>
<para>The question of participation is very interestingâand I noted that the member for Lilley referred to the OECD reportâand we face a lot of challenges. We have talked about this in the parliament: over the next 40 years the proportion of Australians aged over 65 will almost double to around 26 per cent. A lower proportion of working aged people will be asked to support an increasing number of older people. There is only one way we can start to address that and that is to encourage greater participation in the work force. But current projections show that work force participation is anticipated to decline from 63Â½ per cent to around 56 per cent over the next 40 years. Those figures have come out of the <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational report</inline>.</para>
<para>The government has to do two things: it has to encourage fertility by ensuring that policies are family friendlyâand, again, that shows the importance of the decision of the AIRC the other dayâand maximise the prospects for all groups to participate in the labour market. One of the most important of these groups is women. The OECDâs report <inline font-style="italic">Economic policy reforms: going for growth</inline> identified two clear opportunities for Australia to improve the opportunity for women to enter the work force. Firstly, it pointed to the poor financial incentives for women to participate in the labour market as a resultâand this is their assessmentâof the governmentâs dependent spouse tax offset and the family tax benefit. On both of these issues, as you would be aware, Deputy Speaker McMullan, Labor proposed real alternatives to review and correct this situation in the lead-up to the last election. But we also proposed to address disincentives in relation to work force participation. What did the government do? They just ran a scare campaign. They did not pick up the initiativeâand they have not picked it up yet. I urge them to pick it up now because it is still there and able to be adopted if they are serious about encouraging participation.</para>
<para>Secondly, the OECD report points to the inadequacy of child-care support in Australia relative to other leading nations. The OECD research found that each of these measures could increase Australiaâs female participation rates by around five percentage points. So I urge those sitting in the advisers box to take proper account of what international research and proper policy direction is saying. I ask them to put some sense to their political masters and understand that there is a real problemâa challengeâfacing this country, and that there are solutions available to address it. It is interesting that Dr Peter Whiteford, who was associated with that OECD study, said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Australia is one of the few countries where only half the women with two children have paid employment.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Being a mother in Australia reduces employment compared to men the same age in a much more spectacular way than elsewhere.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So Australia has a problem. Other countries are doing it better. Australia needs to learn. Dr Whiteford made a number of recommendations about benefit payments in relation to single parents but the most relevant of his views was that the government should guarantee single parents an affordable child-care place. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Child poverty rates fall considerably when lone parents get jobs.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This is what the research is saying. This is what good policy should be following. This is what Labor policy was advocating. It is what this government should embrace. I hope that, out of this debate, the government looks at this again and comes back with some important initiatives. For its part, Labor will be continuing to develop and refine its message in this area, because it knows the importance of it.</para>
<para>In my role as shadow minister for regional development, one of the main themes I will be pursuing is, of course, how we attract economic sustainability into the regions. That means the attraction of human capital, the skills base, the improvement of skills, the investment in training, the matching of skilled workers with the employment needs of a particular region to take advantage of the new growth opportunities and greater participation in the work force for those who wish to do so. This is not something that can be focused on only in the urban context; there is a regional focus as well. Regions are the great driving force of this country. Our economic growth is always enhanced when the regions get their acts together, identify opportunities and chase them.</para>
<para>How are they going to not only attract labour but also encourage people who live in the area and raise their families there to come back into the work force? You cannot do that unless you make provision for additional child-care places. We know that, under this government, the services we take for granted in the cities are far less available in the regions. The government has run down services, so there needs to be not just an overall commitment in terms of child-care places but also proper targeting so that the regions get their entitlement.</para>
<para>One of the major impediments to work-force participation in the regions is this lack of adequate child care. But this bill does not make one extra place available. I said earlier that it is crucially important that this issue be addressed in the context of the industrial relations decision the other day. But what do we have from the minister responsible? First of all, Senator Patterson asserts that there is not really a problem in child care, but, in any event, it is the problem of the states. How money times have we heard this excuse from this government? It is called buck passing. People in the community are sick of it. They want governments to get together and solve the problem, not just make excuses. The governmentâs assertion that it is the statesâ problem is an excuse, not a solution.</para>
<para>One of the interesting things the minister was asked to do was to identify the problem in terms of the actual shortage. She has undertaken no analysis to find that out, but in 2002 the most recent figures available from the Bureau of Statistics show that there was a national shortage of over 170,000 child-care places. You can hardly assume that, since that time, the situation has improved, because quite frankly this government has not put resources into meeting the shortfall. We get it in our electorate offices all the time: âIâd like to get back into work, but I canât get back into work because there are not child-care places.â I get it in my electorate office. From talking to other members with regional responsibilities, I know that they get it. I am certain that members on the other side of the House get it, and if they were honest they would be complaining about it too. I am not saying they are dishonest as such, but they are not bringing to the attention of the ministers responsible the importance of addressing this issue.</para>
<para>We urged the minister to do what a nonpartisan group of local councils has called for, and that is to hold a national summit on children. The minister claims that the Commonwealth has no responsibility for child-care planning. What nonsense! We all have a responsibility. It is a national problem. Participation of the work force requires national solutions. We have the Prime Minister lecturing us on the need for the states and the federal government to work together to fight terrorism, so why not work together to solve the crisis in child care, amongst other things? Instead of passing the buck, let us sit down and have a summit, work with local governments and state governments, and have the Commonwealth government come in with some effective resources to do it.</para>
<para>Labor again calls on the government to convene a national summit on child care, as requested by local councils and child-care operators, to take stock of the problem and start devising a solution. We all know that this governmentâs response to everything is to come up with a financial incentive gimmick. The incentive is never what it appears and never, as a policy, addresses the real problem. This is a classic example. The electorate is deceived again, finding that they are getting far less than they thought they would be getting, and the government is failing to address the national shortage in child-care places. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talker>
<para>âIn my remarks on the <inline ref="R2405">Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005</inline>, I wish to focus on child care and the governmentâs very poor policy of announcing during the election campaign a new child-care rebate which fails on economic grounds and fairness. We have heard in other speeches the Treasurer has made in this parliament that he is the architect of the three Ps frameworkâthat is, population, participation and productivity. The government, through the Treasury, in 2002 correctly identified as a challenge for Australia the ageing of the populationâthe first P. It went on through the <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational report</inline> and subsequent analysis to identify potential solutions to the economic challenge of the ageing of the population. Those solutions lie in the other two Ps: participation and productivity. I will speak today about the second of the three Ps: participation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We can ameliorate some of the worst economic consequences of population ageing by lifting the work force participation of working age Australians. Over the coming four decades there will be a smaller and smaller proportion of working age Australians earning the incomes and paying the taxes to provide care for those who are too young and too old to work. Both the <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational</inline> <inline font-style="italic">report</inline> and the Productivity Commission have released projections indicating the likelihood of a doubling of Australiaâs population over the age of 65. That means that we will need more participation amongst those who are able to work. The Treasurer himself knows that; he has said that many times. He had an opportunity in the election campaign to release a child-care policy that was helpful in that regard. Instead he has released a child-care policy that is of no use whatsoever in lifting work force participation. I will explain what I mean by that.</para>
<para>The Treasurer has invoked other reports in support of the governmentâs position on economic policy matters. Barely a day goes by without the Treasurer talking about an OECD report that he asserts justifies the governmentâs positions on industrial relations and other matters. He is a very selective reader of these OECD reports. In fact, I wonder whether he reads them at all, instead receiving briefing notes from Treasury or his office that support the propositions that he wants to put. If the Treasurer did in fact read a more comprehensive range of OECD reports, he would find amongst them analyses which reveal that there are potentially very large returns, in terms of participation in the work force by mothers, from increases in child-care benefits. But, crucially, the OECD points out that those returns are concentrated at the lower income levels. That makes sense because people on low incomes are going to find inevitably that child-care costs are an effective deterrent to moving from having had children into the work force. It is a matter of commonsense but it is also a matter of empirical investigation, because the OECD has done intercountry analyses of the efforts that various countries put into child care and has found that the Australian governmentâs child-care effort is very low; it ranks very lowly amongst OECD countries. Consequently, the OECD has come to the conclusion that from extra child-care support for lower and middle-income families there would be potentially very large yields in terms of increased work force participation. It uses by way of comparison the Danish experience, which has very high levels of support for child care for lower income families. In Denmark work force participation by working age mothers is very high, whereas in Australia it is comparatively low.</para>
<para>In the year 2000, in association with the introduction of the GST, the government changed the arrangements in relation to child-care subsidies by providing child-care support in the form of child-care benefits. Child-care benefits is a good policy. It is an outlays policy concentrated on lower and middle-income families. It has been consciously developed to elicit greater work force participation by those families, to remove a very important impediment to work force participation by lower and middle-income families. In the design of child-care benefits the governmentâand I give it credit for this; I give credit where credit is dueâhas made the benefits larger for lower income families, then phasing out the benefits as income risesâas it should to attract the greatest potential return in terms of work force participation.</para>
<para>But what did the government do in the 2004 election? You would think that perhaps the government had done the right thing in the year 2000 and maybe it could build on the achievements because there is still a lot more work force participation to be gained by further increasing child-care benefits for lower income families. But instead of doing that, the government corrected its ideological mistake, because this governmentâs ideology is not to concentrate benefits on lower income families but to extend government benefits and concessions through middle Australia to the wealthyâand that is what the child-care rebate does. Whereas the child-care benefits introduced in the year 2000 are a very progressive measure, the child-care rebate announced in the 2004 election is a very regressive measure because it subsidises 30 per cent of out-of-pocket expenses. Who has the remaining out-of-pocket expenses? Given that the child-care benefit is directed at lower income families, the people who have the remaining child care out-of-pocket expenses are higher income families, therefore they are the beneficiaries. They are unashamedly the target of the child-care rebate policy. The policy is designed by the government to do nothing more than attract votes, even though it is bad economic policy and, as I will now set out, also bad policy in terms of its unfairness.</para>
<para>Because the child-care out-of-pocket expenses are larger for higher income earners, this measure gives them a 30 per cent subsidy on those, and of course this is an unfair measure. But it is not the only unfair measure that this government has implemented. Yesterday we had the Prime Minister again asserting in the parliament that, under this government, government benefitsâcash benefits plus education and health spendingâhave resulted in lower income earners getting a better share of national income than higher income earners. But the truth is otherwise. Quite perversely, the truth is that, if anything, private incomes have probably become more equally distributed under this government. But when we now turn to government benefitsâcash benefits in terms of family payments, tax concessions and also expenditure on health and educationâwe see that there has been a correcting of the more equal distribution of income from the private sector, from the market, such that the government has shifted the distribution of government benefits more in favour of middle-income earners and high-income earners.</para>
<para>So let us not pretend that this government has been progressive in its policies when it comes to the distribution of benefits. It has shifted those benefits to middle Australia and to high-income earners. Why? Because it decided that they were target groups and it certainly suits this governmentâs philosophy. When the Prime Minister says that the income support system in this country is progressive, on this occasion he is telling the truth, but the reason it is progressive is that the system that was inherited by this government was progressive and this government has made it slightly less progressive. Nevertheless, it has not destroyed the progressivity of income support payments and health and education spending, but it has slightly worsened the distribution of that spending by lifting the share going to higher and middle income earners.</para>
<para>Yesterday, in supporting these measures, the Prime Minister said, âUnder this government taxation has fallen.â Only the Prime Minister and the Treasurer believe that is the case. The only way they can arrive at that conclusion is to ignore the $36 billion monsterâthe GST. They are the only two people in Australia who continue to argue that the GST, itself a regressive tax, is not a Commonwealth tax. In 1999 and 2000 we sat in this parliament debating the GST as a Commonwealth tax. Then, once the legislation was passed, the GST became an orphan because the Prime Minister and the Treasurer said, âItâs not ours, because the proceeds go to the states.â Of course, when the GST was introduced some $18 billion of untied grants to the states were abolished simultaneously, but we do not hear about that from this government.</para>
<para>The point I am making is that, if you adjust for the reality of the GST, then this is easily the highest taxing government in Australiaâs history. The truth of a Liberal government is that it is a tax and spend governmentâa government that is taxing middle income earners through the mechanism of bracket creep and then recycling those proceeds into a bloated welfare state where welfare has been extended through middle Australia to the very wealthy. It is a tax and spend government that in the term of its administration has presided over an increase in social security spending of almost half in real terms. The government would have you believe that that has been done to help the poor. It has been done to provide welfare for the wealthy. That is the purpose of the bloating of the welfare state under this government. At a time when real private incomes have increased by 15 per cent and unemployment has fallen to its lowest level in 30 years you would think that welfare dependency would have fallen. It should have fallenâand it has fallen. Dependency on welfare has fallen, but during every election campaign the government says, âHereâs some more welfare for you, especially if you are a higher or middle income earner.â That is what this child-care rebate is. It is welfare for higher and middle income earners simply to buy votes. So this is a high-taxing and high-spending government.</para>
<para>The critique of the government is quite eloquent and comes from an unusual quarter, because it is not often that the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has anything negative to say about this government. Witness the current industrial relations debate where the Australian Chamber of Commerce and IndustryâACCIâis absolutely 100 per cent behind the government and pushing it even further. But in a very important publication released in May this year the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry criticised the government severely for its tax and spend policy and criticised it from the same perspective as I am todayâthat is, the government has concentrated welfare increases into the hands of higher and middle income earners. This bill further compounds that error.</para>
<para>The report was prepared by Des Moore, a former Treasury official. No-one could call him a pinko or on the left of politics, as you would well know, Mr Deputy Speaker Somlyay. I would never accuse Des Moore of being on the left of Australian politics. He says that higher income groups:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... receive 30 per cent of social security (including selected education and health) benefits and thus receive back nearly half the taxes they pay.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He goes on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... since the last year of the Labor government in 1995-96 ... the relative size of discretionary spending has actually increased.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is, it has increased under a coalition government that parades itself as the champion of private initiative and small government. Further, he says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... if interest and defence are excluded on the ground that they are not part of discretionary spending, total outlays were nearly a percentage point of GDP higher in 2003-04 than in the last year of Labor.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Is this Des Moore actually supporting Labor? No, I do not think so, but at least on this occasion the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has had the honesty to point out that the welfare state is exploding under this government. Mr Moore also says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... a major contributor to the continued high rates of more discretionary spending has been the upward trend in payments of Social Security benefits. ...Â  total outlays ... in 2003-04 were at an all time high and 3.3 percentage points higher than in the last year of the Whitlam government.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Here we have a government presiding over an explosion of the welfare state. It has fattened up the welfare state and tipped the benefits of welfare to higher income earners. The report continues:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Reflecting much âchurningâ of taxes, these benefits are also now contributing an all time high 14.3 per cent to household disposable incomes. This is despite the much stronger growth in recent years in average real per capita incomes ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is the very point I was making earlier in my speech. There are more revealing statements in this report:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">At present ... about 2.7 million or around 20 per cent of the working age population receives income support compared with only 15 per cent at the end of the 1980s and 4 per cent in 1969. Looked at from another perspective, social assistance benefits (which exclude health benefits) now contribute 14.3 per cent of gross household disposable income, compared with just 8 per cent in the last year of the Whitlam government.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Yet the government say: âThe Whitlam government, the previous Labor government, were a terrible left-wing government. Weâre a right-wing government, but we have presided over, quite deliberately, policies such as these being debated todayâan expansion in the welfare state, directed particularly at higher and middle-income earners.â</para>
<para>What are some of those other benefits? Family tax benefit B was introduced by this government. It means that millionaire couples can receive cash benefits from this government so long as the mother chooses to stay at home and not work. But, of course, poor, single mothers are required to go out and work. So wealthy, married mothers are paid to stay at home and poor, single mothers are required to go out and work, otherwise they will receive a cut in their benefits. This is social engineering by a government that says it wants to stay out of the lives and the faces of Australian higher and middle-income earners. But it is in their lives in every possible way: providing child-care subsidies, providing cash payments, providing education subsidies and providing health subsidiesâall directed towards higher income earners.</para>
<para>Des Moore also states that, while encouraging family formation is desirable, direct assistance should be concentrated on those with lower incomes who may otherwise be deterred from raising or bringing up children. I could not agree more, yet family tax benefit A is now payable on household incomes of up to $145,000 a year. Clearly the government is concentrating family tax benefit A increasingly in the hands of higher income earners. Yet who is paying the bill? It is certainly not Peter Costello, and it is not John Howard; it is long-suffering middle Australia, and it is also the higher income earners themselves, which makes a mockery of it. It makes this whole systemâthis giant recycling machineâan insane policy. That is what we have: an insane policy, a giant recycling machine, where the government uses bracket creep to take tax revenue off people and then turns around and gives it back to them around election time, saying: âWhat jolly good fellows we are. Vote Liberal, the champions of private initiative and of self-reliance.â</para>
<para>The government has made the Australian people far less self-reliantâand in fact the Prime Minister has boasted about this. In a speech on 3 May the Prime Minister said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Although family tax benefits appear on the expenditure side of the budget, in reality they represent tax relief.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">They represent recycling. What the Prime Minister is ignoring is the fact that people are taxed and then the money is recycled and given back to them by this government. The Centre for Independent Studies has estimated that, for every dollar of income tax collected, 20c is lost through inefficiencyâincentives that are being destroyedâand more through the army of bureaucrats who are hired to collect and then administer the benefits. This is poor policy. It does not achieve any decent result in terms of participation in the work force. It is yet another example of this government extending welfare right through middle-income Australia and to the very wealthy.</para>

</talker>
<para>âIn rising to speak on the <inline ref="R2405">Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005</inline>, I want to focus my contribution on schedules 1 and 4, which are the areas covering the governmentâs delay on its election promise of a 30 per cent child-care tax offset and the extension of the wine equalisation tax rebate to New Zealand winemakers. This policy initiative is absolute classic policy on the run. Announced by the Howard government in the heart of an election campaign, it has been a debacle from start to finish. It was ill-thought through and was a knee-jerk response to the crisis in the affordability of child care. It does not represent a sound policy instrument that will do what we hoped it would do, which is to make child care cheaper for parents. In fact, it does the reverse, and the way in which the government has structured it runs the very real risk of placing families into further debt.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>During the election campaign the Howard government announced the 30 per cent rebate for out-of-pocket costs for approved child-care services, with approved child-care services being those that meet the accreditation standard in offering places for parents who can then claim the child-care benefit. The tax rebate announced in the election campaign was just that: a 30 per cent rebate for out-of-pocket expenses for accredited child care to be backdated to July 2004. This was one of the governmentâs first broken election promises. Barely a few weeks after the election, the policy was changed.</para>
<para>In the bill before the House we have the revised, watered down election promise of a capped 30 per cent rebate and a delay of some 14 to 30 months before parents will receive the rebate. The consequence of this is an extremely complex system for claiming the rebate and an inadequate policy instrument for alleviating the costs of child care. The first key problem with the governmentâs change of heart on the 30 per cent rebate is the delay. Parents claiming the rebate will not get it until the end of the financial year subsequent to the year the child-care fees were paid. Parents paying child-care fees today will not be able to claim the rebate for those child-care fees when they do their 2005-06 tax returns but will have to claim it in their 2006-07 tax returns. By the time some families receive the rebate they will no longer have children in child care.</para>
<para>Child-care benefit is able to be paid within or just after the financial year that the parents pay for child care on the basis of similar data that is going to be required to reconcile this rebate. Yet the government is out there trying to argue that it does not receive evidence from approved providers of parentsâ child-care usage for the March to June quarter until around October and that that will be too late for the Australian Taxation Office to verify parentsâ rebatable claims against information supplied by the relevant child-care provider. If the child-care benefit is able to be paid within months, why is this rebate not able to be paid on the same basis? I do not understand why that is not possible. I certainly hope that the minister, when he comes back into this place in the consideration in detail stage, will be able to answer that question.</para>
<para>The second key problem with this legislation, and the governmentâs change of heart on its own policy announcement, is that it creates a massive debt trap for parents. ABC Learning operates five child-care centres in my electorate alone. It is advertising a line of credit of up to $4,000 to enable parents to meet their child-care costs. But, because of the way the government has structured this rebate, parents will have a debt to ABC that is repayable at least 12 months before they receive the rebate. Parents are obliged to pay their debts to ABC by the September immediately following the financial year in which the debt is incurred, but they are not able to claim the rebate for the relevant financial year until they lodge their next tax return. While ABC have said they will not claim interest on the debt, there are penalty clauses for overdue repayments in the contracts that parents sign. It is unclear at this stage whether these penalties will apply. I hope the minister will come into this place and assure the parliament that that will not happen, that parents who find themselves in circumstances of having to be extended a line of credit by ABC child care will not be financially worse off as a result.</para>
<para>The line of credit with ABC is available to all parents, regardless of their eligibility for the rebate or the amount of rebate they will eventually receive. The government is creating another massive debt trap for parents with the way in which they have set up this system. With private providers offering lines of credit, which desperate parents will take up to meet the increasing needs of child care and the increasing costs of child care, the situation will only be exacerbated. I can anticipate the calls to my electorate office when parents are confronted with having to pay a lump sum of $4,000 in September if they have used the line of credit, not being able to claim their rebate until July the following year, and maybe not even getting the full $4,000, and then being confronted with another $4,000 debt if they have again had to use the line of credit in September. This is a spiral of massive debt creation for families, and it is an extremely dangerous situation for parents and families to find themselves in.</para>
<para>There is also great confusion in the community as to how this system will work. Rather than spending millions of dollars on advertising their extreme industrial relations agendaâlegislation that has not even been through this parliament and legislation that certainly nobody on this side has even had a look atâthe government should look at how it will get the message out to parents on how to claim their rebate under this extremely complex system. The reality is that the government had an idea during the election campaign, and now it has been left to the officers of the Australian Taxation Office to try to patch together a way of implementing it. Parents are confused because the government said one thing before the election and another after the election. They restricted the policy after the election. It is administering the policy through an extremely complex system and the information being provided to parents is not detailed or comprehensive enough, and frankly you need a degree in tax law to understand how to claim this rebate.</para>
<para>The policy is also inflationary in that it has sent a signal to child-care providers to increase their fees. Child-care fees have been increasing rapidly in recent years, and were estimated to be at double the inflation rate between 2002 and 2004. With demand for places in many areas exceeding supply, desperate parents are being faced with massive child-care fee hikes. My concern is that, as with the private health insurance rebate, this policy will increase the likelihood that child-care centres will put up their prices, rather than acting to suppress inflation in this area. Child-care centres, rather than holding their fees stable, knowing that there will now be a government rebate, will put up their fees to absorb the rebate. The real beneficiaries of the government funding will be the boards and shareholders of private child-care companies, not average working families.</para>
<para>Recently we saw the former Minister for Family and Community Services, on losing his seat in this place, find a lucrative position in this industry. In my view this was an extremely inappropriate appointment. With a number of Liberal Party senators and members having a financial stake in the business end of child care, you have to wonder who the real beneficiaries of this policy will be. Gone are the days when the lobbyists for child care walking the corridors of this place were parents desperate to increase places, access and quality. In their place we now have corporates, predominantly men in suits, desperate to ensure that the government subsidies remain and grow. But the parents are still out there and we still see them every day in our electorates. At the end of the day, you have to wonder whether they are the people most likely to benefit from this policy. I do not think so.</para>
<para>This legislation does absolutely nothing to address the concerns about supply. We have seen massive shortages in long day care. The government has totally failed on a number of levels to address this issue. I would like to use the example of my electorate of Ballarat. When I was first elected to parliament, a group of some 20 parents came to see me about shortages in long day care. These were parents who were using a mix of child care. They had to use occasional care, they had to use family day care and they had to use parents, friends and grandparents to make up long day care. There were massive shortages in my electorate. We embarked locally on a very strong campaign to try to attract a private provider into the district because we had been unable to convince the local council to extend the number of their child-care places. Under the policies of this government, it is not something that local government is likely to do; in fact, we see most local governments trying to get out of providing child care and we are seeing less community based child care as a result of the governmentâs policies.</para>
<para>Because there was no money available to us as a large regional city, we ourselves funded a study into the child-care needs in our electorate. I was shocked to discover that the Department of Family and Community Services does not collect data on child-care needs, so we could not even find information to tell any potential child-care provider in the district what the demand was. They just did not collect it. What information they did collect was totally inadequate and not publicly available. We managed to get some information leakedâand I do not know how we managed to get that but we didâand even that was absolutely shocking. I think the data back then, which is well over two years ago now, was that there was a shortage in Victoria of over 4,000 long day care places. That situation has become worse in many areas.</para>
<para>We funded for ourselves a study into child-care demand in the local government area of Ballarat. I contributed $500 of my personal funds to that study. What a ludicrous situation. We have a government that say they are interested in families and interested in having good policy, but they do not provide any money to local councils to work out what the demands for child care are so that they can go about the business of either determining to set up a child-care centre themselves or getting in a private provider.</para>
<para>The government are very determined to provide market based solutions in the area of child care. In essence, instead of having child-care centres subsidised by government, which is what we had previously, they set up almost a voucher system by way of a child-care benefit and now we have this child-care rebate. The government think that child-care providers will set up in areas of demand.</para>
<para>Even with a market based solution like that, you have to have perfect information for it to work. The government does absolutely nothing to provide information to those private providers about where the areas of need are going to be and whether the industry is going to be profitable. So, while this bill before the parliament is about the child-care rebate, it does nothing to address concerns about the demand and supply of long day care places.</para>
<para>The other problems with this policy are the gaps in it. There are a number of parents who miss out under this policy. I hope this debate clarifies whether parents who have not kept adequate receipts will still be able to claim. The policy, when announced, was retrospective. It is unlikely that many parents would have kept receipts for child care for the period between July 2004 and the time the policy was announced. The government is requiring parents to send in receipts for all child care with their tax returns, but it is yet to make clear whether those parents who do not have sufficient records of expenses will be able to claim. I hope the minister is able to clarify that situation in this place.</para>
<para>Parents who pay fees to child-care providers who are not approved also miss out under this policy. Parents who are entitled to a child-care benefit and who use registered carers such as nannies, family members or friends will not be able to claim the rebate. Parents often have to make these arrangements because of the inflexible hours of long day care. Often they have shift work or casual employment and have to work late at night, and they are not able to get adequate child care in long day care centres. There is a shortage of places in family day care and a lack of people providing it, so parents often have to use different models of care to balance work and family. Under this system, those parents will not be eligible for the rebate. The government needs to clarify its position on that and explain why it has decided to go down that track.</para>
<para>There are some parents who will never benefit from the rebate because they will not be able to pay the cost of care up front. The rebate does nothing to improve the affordability of child care, and parents who cannot afford the up-front cost or who cannot find a place in approved care miss out altogether. In my own electorate, the situation has been alleviated somewhat. Our community campaign actually worked. We managed to get more private providers into the electorate of Ballarat, and we now have a reasonable supply of long day care places, which is fantastic.</para>
<para>Back in the days when we did not, a couple, one of whom was a nurse and the other a teacher, came to see me. Ballarat is desperate to attract new people, and this couple had moved from Adelaide. One had managed to get a job and the other, the nurse, was quickly offered a job as well, but they were unable to accept those positions because they could not get child care. One of them had to decide not to take work. Those sorts of situations are totally unacceptable and the government has not dealt with the issue of supply of long day care places. Obviously, those parents will never be able to claim the rebate until they can actually get a child-care place.</para>
<para>The other issue is that the government has created a budget black hole. It does not like to talk about the black holes that it createsâit likes to create imaginary ones in Labor Party policyâbut the financial implications of a 30 per cent rebate on child-care demands post 1 July 2006 have not been budgeted for. The government is determined to push ahead with welfare reforms that will adversely affect sole parents and force them into the work force, rather than look at their training needs and develop pathways for them into the work force. The government has not factored in the fact that we are going to see a sudden increase in the number of sole parentsâand, potentially, a number of parents on disability support pensionsâin the work force. So we will see in budget projections that the government has created a black hole with this bill. The government has already had to come back, post election, and cap its election promise because the huge demand in this area will not be affordable. It makes one promise before the election and does something else after it.</para>
<para>The other issue that will be difficult for parents to deal with is the two activity tests for child-care benefit. At the moment, for people to claim the child-care rebate they need only one hour of work, study or training per week. The government has a proposal on the table to change that to 15 hours. The change to the child-care benefit activity test would preclude all approved child-care users who work fewer than 15 hours a week from claiming the rebate. We will, potentially, see two systems.</para>
<para>I support very strongly the second reading amendment that was moved by the shadow minister. The government could have introduced a better system which made sure that parents receive this rebate without delay, but it has decided not to do that. We have called on the government in the amendment to give parents the option of either self-assessing their entitlement to the offset and keeping receipts as evidence or electing to have the Australian Taxation Office assess their tax offset entitlement once the relevant data is received from child-care providers. The government has created an extremely complex system for this child-care rebate, and I can already hear the calls to my electorate office complaining about this. I know the bureaucrats who are sitting here from the Australian Taxation Office will be getting a lot of calls from electorate offices as we work our way through this system.</para>
<para>In the closing minutes of this debate, I want to turn to schedule 4 of this bill, which is the extension of the wine equalisation tax rebate to New Zealand. Under existing law, wine producers can now claim a wine equalisation tax rebate of up to $290,000 per year and the rebate effectively makes $1 million of the wholesale value of each producerâs wine sales in Australia per year exempt from the wine equalisation tax.</para>
<para>The history of this tax has been unbelievable. During the period of the negotiations around the goods and services tax we saw the government create an impossible situation for wineries, and my focus is on some smaller wineries because they are at the heart of regional development and regional tourism in electorates such as mine. They created an absolute debacle with the wine equalisation tax. They were brought kicking and screaming by the shadow Assistant Treasurer into getting a cellar door rebate. In the 2001 election they did not match Laborâs promise on this issue at all. They promised an inquiry. We had the Trebeck report that after the 2001 election campaign got narrowed to look only at issues of wine tourism. Finally, we had the government introducing this rebate.</para>
<para>My concern with the issue of New Zealand, and I am a consumer of New Zealand wineânot a great deal but I certainly think they have a fabulous productâis what this means for other bilateral relationships that we have. We obviously have a bilateral economic relationship with the United States. What is this extension of the rebate actually going to mean? We already have difficulties with small wineries having to unfairly compete. They are really struggling at the moment and the profitability of small wineries is under threat. My concern about this extension of the wine equalisation tax rebate to New Zealand is that we are creating a further problem for small wineries. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThe <inline ref="R2405">Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005</inline> does four things. It more or less implements the governmentâs election promise of a child-care rebate. It adds a number of organisations to the list of deductible gift recipients. It extends the range of information the Commissioner of Taxation may make available to the Australian Statistician, and this will allow the Statistician to develop a longitudinal database of businesses and produce regional small business outputs. Finally, this bill extends the wine equalisation tax rebate to New Zealand wine producers. I have no problems with the last three of these proposals, although I understand that there are concerns with the extension of the wine equalisation tax rebate to New Zealand, and the member for Ballarat just talked a little bit about that. There are concerns about what this might mean for Australiaâs other FTA partners, but I will leave that discussion to others.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>What I would like to speak about today is the first schedule: the tax rebate for child-care costs. The Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer said in his second reading speech that this rebate will âhelp families by giving them a rebate on their tax of 30 per cent of out-of-pocket child-care expensesâ. He notes:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The rebate will cover child-care expenses for taxpayers who use approved care and meet the child-care benefit work test or one of the equivalent child-care benefit limits.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He goes on to say that the rebate is payable up to a maximum of $4,000 per annum and that, where a taxpayer is unable to use all of this rebate, the unused portion can be transferred to their spouse.</para>
<para>The explanatory memorandum that accompanies this bill explains that this tax offset will apply to fees for approved child care incurred since 1 July 2004 and can be claimed by taxpayers in their 2005-06 tax returns. The financial impact of this measure shows no cost to revenue in the 2005-06 financial year and a cost of $280 million in the 2006-07 year, moving to $305 million in the 2007-08 year. This tells me that there will be no payments or rebates made to parents until the 2006-07 financial year, even though we are talking about rebates for expenses paid in the 2004-05 financial year. This represents a very long timelag.</para>
<para>There are a number of points to be made about this proposal. Firstly, it does nothing to address the problem I keep on hearing about in my electorate, which is a lack of child-care places. I am not arguing that this proposal should be rejected, but I do point out that, whilst it will eventually benefit those who can find and afford child care, it does not help those people who ring me because they cannot find any child care at all for their children. This lack of child care, both long day care and out of school hours care, is a real problem.</para>
<para>The phone call I had recently from a woman in my electorate trying to get back into the work force sums up the situation. This woman has a school aged boy who goes to one of our local schools. My constituent found herself caught in a trap. When she went looking for after school care she discovered there was a waiting list. This is a woman who was trying to get back into the work force. She applied for and was offered a job but could not accept because she did not have immediate access to child care. She thought through the other optionâthat is, putting her child into an after school care program as soon as she got to the top of the waiting list and then going out looking for work. The problem there was that she could not afford the fees without a job. My constituent was caught, and I am sure many other members here have constituents with similar stories. This proposal does nothing to address that problem.</para>
<para>The second point is to note this proposalâs evolution. This child-care rebate has had an interesting journey from election promise to legislation. The election promise was for a rebate scheme to start for child-care expenses incurred from 1 January 2005, claimable in the 2004-05 tax return. It was to be uncapped and not means tested. Then in December last year, not long after the election, the changes started. The scheme was to be backdated to cover child-care expenses from 1 July 2004. But there was a catch, the catch being that the rebate was not claimable until the 2005-06 tax returnâthat is, the one that we lodge after July 2006, at least two years after the first expense has been incurred and probably a lot more in practice. There is now a cap of $4,000 per annum.</para>
<para>The third point, of course, is the difficulties attached to the big timelag between meeting the expense and getting the rebate. The obvious problems here are to do with parents having to keep receipts for a long time, parents having to pay first and recover the costs laterâvery much laterâand the mismatch ofÂ  financial years in which the expense is met and the rebate being made available. Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not know about your household, but asking parents to keep receipts for two years is a big ask. I know that in an ideal world we would all be organised enough to file these things away and then be able to find them again later on, but we do not live in an ideal world and it is fact of life that receipts wander off of their own volition. Many parents are going to be caught without receipts when it comes time to lodge their tax returns. Parents have been reassured by the Treasurer that the Australian Taxation Office will look at situations where receipts are no longer available with sympathy, but this could be cold comfort. It would be better, fairer and simpler if the Treasurer just followed the advice of the member for Sydney in her amendment, which allows parents to receive the rebate in the financial year in which the expense is met.</para>
<para>The long timelag is of no assistance whatsoever to families trying to make ends meet. The rebate will be welcome once it is received, but it does not help a family or a parent get child care right now. If a parent cannot afford to pay the child care up front, the promise of a rebate in future years is of no assistance at all. The government has said that it has introduced this measure to assist families. This measure, with its amazingly long timelag, demonstrates that the government has no idea how most households operate. This measure does not help families that are struggling to find money to pay for child care. The promise of a rebate in two years to meet the costs of child care just does not cut it, if it does not put money on the table right now.</para>
<para>I note that one child-care provider, ABC child care, has recognised this problem. On the strength of the rebate becoming available a year later, it has offered loans to parents to cover their child-care costs. Now that the rebate is not available for yet another year, it will be interesting to see how these loans are managed. It must be a worry for parents who went into these loans thinking that the rebate would be available in the financial year following the expenseâthat is when the loan was dueâonly to discover that there is now another year to wait. Whatever happens to these loans, someone is going to be out of pocket unexpectedlyâeither the parents, if the loan is to be repaid now despite the delay in the rebate, or ABC child care, if it chooses to extend the loan period.</para>
<para>The other obvious disadvantage of the long timelag is the mismatch of financial years in which the expense is met and the rebate is available. The rebate is not claimable in the tax return for the financial year in which the expense is met; it is claimable in the tax return for the following financial year. This return is lodged at the end of that financial year. This means that there is a timelag of at least two years after the expense has first been incurred, and the exact delay depends on how long it takes to lodge the return and for it to be processed. There is an issue of inequity here due to that delayed rebate.</para>
<para>There are issues here too if the taxpayer has vastly different incomes from year to year. It might well be that, in the year in which the child care was incurred, the parent had a taxable income that would absorb that rebateâthat is, if the rebate was claimable in that year, it would have been of benefit because the tax payable was more than the rebate. But what happens if that parentâs taxable income reduces dramatically in the following year and the assessed tax is less than the rebate payable? The answer is that the parent loses that benefit to the extent to which it exceeds the tax payable. I acknowledge that the legislation does provide for the taxpayer to transfer any unused rebate to his or her spouse, and that is fine for some households but not for others. The household where there is only one parent loses the benefit and the household where the other partner does not have a taxable income also loses out.</para>
<para>I see this mismatching of the years in which the expense is incurred and the rebate claimed as unfair and a problem. The government argues that this long time delay is necessary because of delays in data being made available to verify child-care payments that have been made. This excuse is a bit difficult to swallow, as parents will pay the child-care benefit at the end of the year in which the expense is incurred. The child-care benefit is calculated on similar data to that needed for the child-care tax rebate. It is interesting too to note that at the end of the last financial year the Taxation Office ran advertisements to alert parents that the rebate was not claimable on 2004-05 tax returns. At least the Taxation Office had the sense to see a potential problem and to try to avert it.</para>
<para>The fourth point to make about this tax rebate relates to its complicated nature. The child-care tax rebate is available to those who pass a CCB activity testâthat is, the child-care benefit activity test. This test currently is one hour of work, study or training per week. The government has announced that the CCB activity test will be changed to 15 hours, effective from 1 July 2006. This means that suddenly those who pass the CCB test at one hour per week and therefore get the child-care tax rebate will become ineligible if their hours of work, study or training are fewer than 15 hours per week.</para>
<para>Once Labor had pointed this out to the Treasurer, he announced that he would introduce amendments to this bill to protect the one-hour test. I gather that these amendments will be introduced once the CCB activity test legislation has been changed. However, once and if all these changes are in place, we will have another layer of complication for parents to wade through. The test for the child-care benefit will be 15 hours per week and the test for the child-care tax rebate will be one hour per week.</para>
<para>Finally, there is the problem of not all child care being eligible for this rebate. You could forgive parents, listening to this proposal being made during the election campaign, for thinking that their child-care arrangements would be covered. This is now not the case for some households. To be eligible for the child-care tax rebate, the child care must be provided by an approved child-care provider. This definition covers most long day care, family day care and outside school hours care, but it does not cover care provided by nannies, family membersâfor instance, grandparentsâand friends, even when they are paid for providing that care. This is different from the arrangements under the child-care benefit, which is another complication. We are left with a situation where some parents are able to claim the rebate and others are not.</para>
<para>In summing up this discussion, I note that these measures for a child-care tax rebate do nothing to address the shortage of child-care places and that the measures before us today are different from the proposals put to the electorate during the election campaign. During the election campaign, the promise was for a rebate arrangement to be available in the 2004-05 tax year for child-care expenses met from 1 July 2005. We now have a rebate available two years after the expense has been met. I note that the long timelag between incurring the expense and finally getting the benefit of the rebate creates problems. It does not help parents who are struggling to meet child-care costs right now. It is cold comfort to these parents that they will get a tax rebate in a few years time. I note that this measure is a demonstration of how out of touch the government is.</para>
<para>The government thinks that a promise of a rebate in two years helps a family balance its budgets todayâand how muddled is that thinking? Once again, I am left trying to work out whether this government believes its own rhetoric or whether it is just riding roughshod over the people that it pretends to help. I also note that some parents miss out altogether on this rebate simply because their income is too small for the tax rebate to be of benefit and that the rules around eligibility for the rebate are complicated. Eligibility is determined by eligibility for the child-care benefit but with a twist, and this twist will or may come when the rules for the eligibility for the child-care benefit are changed.</para>
<para>We have a measure which is complicated and which does not help parents right here and now either to find child care or to pay for it and which is of no benefit or of limited benefit to those on low incomes. I support the amendments to this bill, which address some of these problems, and I urge the government to have another look at how child care is operating in this country and have a real go at addressing the problems that exist around access and affordability.</para>

<para>âThe <inline ref="R2405">Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005</inline> before us today seeks to implement a number of changes to the tax laws but in particular one very important tax change for families across the length and breadth of Australia, introducing a significant election commitment of the government. But in the bill the 30 per cent child-care rebate seems to be somewhat different from the promise that the coalition madeâor at least what they tried to sellâto Australian families during the last election campaign.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>What we have before us today is another example of how out of touch this government is. This is simply a desperate attempt to fix ill-considered policies in a hope that no-one will notice. But, unfortunately for the government, people have noticed. I refer of course to the mess that the government has managed to create in implementing the 30 per cent child-care tax rebate. Access to affordable child care is an issue close to the hearts of most parents and that is certainly not at the heart of this bill. Child care has become almost an essential condition for working families, and hardworking families will suffer from the governmentâs maladministration in the introduction of this electoral promise.</para>
<para>The typical Australian family has two working parents just to make ends meet. More often than not, two working parents are needed in modern Australian families to pay the mortgage, to pay the rising fuel costs, to pay the rising health costs and to pay the ever-increasing education costs that this government has allowed. Two working parents means that child-care is essential. Working parents will suffer and face financial hardship because they are going to have to wait up to 30 months after they have incurred child-care expenses to receive the tax offset. Let us not be fooled by this, because this is exactly what it is: a tax offset. It is certainly not a rebate. No matter how often the government chooses to use the term, it does not fit the definition of a rebate. It is an offset, because that is exactly how it works. If you do not have a tax liability that is greater than the amount you are entitled to receive, you will not receive the full value of the so-called rebate, so therefore it cannot be a rebate.</para>
<para>If you want to look at issues that could be considered barbecue stoppers in the community, I do not think you would have to look much beyond this particular issue. Child care is in the forefront of the minds of young families as they seek to keep their heads above financial waters. Many families are walking a tightrope when it comes to managing the household budget and they realise that, to achieve some semblance of financial security, both parents have to work, and in order to work they have to find someone to mind their young children. I have no doubt that many families who have both parents working and who are paying up to $90 a day in child-care costs would rather be doing things differently, but in many cases that is simply not possible.</para>
<para>In my electorate alone there are some 21,000 families with dependent children under the age of 15. Where isnât an electorate filled with young families? The 2001 census recorded that nearly 10 per cent of the population in the electorate were under the age of four. In the 2004 financial year nearly 9,000 children were using services approved for the payment of child-care benefits in some 40 community based child-care centres and in some 50 private service providers. At the end of June 2003 it was estimated that nearly 5,000 children in the electorate were under the age of two. The figures speak for themselves. Child care is a significant issue for families in Werriwa.</para>
<para>Families are under pressure every day when it comes to child care. They are certainly feeling the pinch when it comes to child-care fees, which continue to soar. The average child-care bill for a child using private long day care services is $208 a week. That is nearly $10,000 a year. Over last year alone the costs of child care have risen by 12.4 per centâof course, that is if the parents are lucky enough to find a place. The more the electors of Werriwa hear about the changes that the government is making to its election promise, the more concerned they become. Parents are concerned because every time they hear another announcement on this policy it is another policy reversal by this government. Quite legitimately, they are starting to question whether or not there is to be any real benefit at all for them under this policy. On any given Saturday or Sunday afternoon I bet we could stop many a barbecue in south-western Sydney by simply raising the child-care topic.</para>
<para>Parents making use of child-care services feel that they are being led up the garden path on this issue. When the policy was announced during the election campaign it was sold as a 30 per cent rebate on out-of-pocket child-care costs. I am sure that when the policy was announced a lot of people would have thought that it was quite simple. It could be understood. It appeared straightforward and, to me, it would have been seen as quite attractive. The government made no mention of the limitations in access to the rebate that it would soon impose on the electorate. The coalitionâs election policy document made no mention of caps or the long time between spending the money and when it would be able to be reclaimed. The coalition in its policy entitled âExtra assistance for familiesâ said quite clearly and plainly that a re-elected coalition government would provide âfamilies with extra assistance in meeting the cost of child care by introducing a 30 per cent child-care rebate on out-of-pocket costsâ. That is pretty straightforward and quite clear.</para>
<para>Only when the government began backing away from its promise in December last year did the cracks start to emerge in this policy. Under the guise of announcing a benefit to parents through a new early start for child-care rebate did the Treasurer set about breaking the coalitionâs promise. It was by press release that parents found out that the child rebate was going to be capped. It took another six months for parents to find out that the minimum number of hours that parents had to work to be eligible for the rebate would change.</para>
<para>But the hits keep coming for young working parents. As we examine the details of the bill, we find that parents will not be able to claim the child-care rebate for preschool fees and it does not stop there. I am certain that parents are not fully aware of what the rebate is all about and I am in no doubt that parents are not quite sure in their own minds what will constitute eligibility for this claim. In fact, I do not know whether the parents are aware that it is a tax offset. I am not sure that parents realise that they must keep receipts for out-of-pocket expenses and that, unless they do, they run the risk of missing out. One thing I am sure about is that low-income earners know that they will miss out altogether because they are not paying enough tax to gain the entire value of the offset.</para>
<para>It astounds me that the government can see no way of speeding up the process of parents receiving the offset. It is staggering that parents have to wait between 14 and 30 months after they spend the money to be able to claim it back. It is a most ridiculous situation that a child could be already at school when parents become eligible to submit their claim for the offset. A child may no longer require child care, but parents will be still clinging to their receipts patiently waiting for enough time to pass to be eligible to claim their offset. It is even more ridiculous that parents who are in need of child care, for whom the tax offset will make the difference between being able to afford it and not being able to afford it, may have to forgo child care altogether because they cannot afford to carry the cost burden until they are eligible to claim the offset long into the future. I cannot understand that there is not a means available for the government to enable parents to claim their out-of-pocket expenses when they complete their tax returns for the year in which the expense occurred. The government is relying on excuses about the provision of information, the provision of financial returns from child-care providers and the process taking too long for the tax office to verify rebate claims.</para>
<para>People are managing to get their private health insurance costs included in the calculation of their tax return immediately after they have been paid, so why should they not have a similar expectation that their out-of-pocket child-care costs will also be dealt with at that time? I do not think it is an unreasonable expectation. Accordingly, I find it easy to support the oppositionâs amendment that would require the offset to be claimable at the end of the financial year in which the expense was incurred. I have no doubt that eligible parents would be willing to hold off submitting their tax return for a short period if they were confident that that would enable their out-of-pocket child-care expenses to be claimed in that financial year.</para>
<para>It seems that the underlying philosophy of this government is that people should be able to look after themselves. It supports self-assessment for income tax and the return of business activity statements, yet when it comes to allowing parents to have returned to them some of the costs of child care it sets about introducing an administrative system that is more akin to one that we would have had some 50 years ago.</para>
<para>I also support the amendment that would guarantee parents will get the full rebate they are entitled to even if they do not have all of their receipts. You do not have to keep every receipt to claim the private health insurance rebate. That is because private health insurance providers can provide their customers with a summary that is adequate for tax calculations. So why, with the appropriate information technology and government support, cannot child-care service providers be equipped to do the same? The oppositionâs amendment that would enable either a self-assessment based on receipts or a tax office reconciliation upon receipt of the relevant data are sound administrative measures that would go a long way to making sure that the offset actually helps parents.</para>
<para>The fact that the government has not been able to come up with a better administrative system that would allow parents to claim the offset is because this is not a policy that would be classified as an article of faith. This government speaks often about its concern for families but, when it comes to the crunch, it fails them badly. Simply including a family impact statement when considering cabinet documents is not nearly good enough for Australian families. It is not adequate enough to dismiss the argument that each day this government is becoming more and more arrogant and increasingly out of touch with the needs and aspirations of suburban families.</para>
<para>There is no doubt that parents need assistance to meet the costs of child care. Without it, they face even greater difficulty in balancing the family budget. As I noted earlier, child care has become a necessary condition for most families as the financial pressure of paying the mortgage, facing increased petrol costs and paying more and more for health care means that both parents are required to work. With both parents in the work force, someone has to look after the kids. Because of the serious lack of child-care places, this responsibility is falling more and more to grandparents. In fact, a recent survey by the ABS found that grandparents provide around a third of all child care in Australia. Grandparents are being forced to make up for this governmentâs failings.</para>
<para>The statistics also show that more than half of all parents use informal child care, often grandparents and other relatives, so that their time can be freed up to either work or look for work. This is the manifestation of a supply shortage, not necessarily a reflection of cost. A 30 per cent rebate will do nothing for parents who are forced to leave their children in informal arrangements. A rebate does nothing about the problems of the affordability of child care or the supply of places. It is nothing more than a short-term fix. And this is not just the opinion of the opposition. In an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on 1 July this year titled âChild-care fees soarâif you can find itâ, it was reported that even operators have deep concerns about the appropriateness of the rebate as a policy response. The article reports:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Child-care operators warned fees will continue to rise in the new financial year, which marks the first year in which parents can receive the new 30 percent rebate.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It goes on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Operators say the rebate will create even greater demand while it will do nothing to address the lack of places ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Even the industry understands the simple economics at work here. Operators realise that if you do nothing about the supply side then demand will continue to grow and prices will ultimately have to rise, with the limited number of places going to the highest bidder. I can only presume that the government will expect that the unpaid child-care workers of Australian societyâthe grandparents, friends and relativesâwho so generously give up their time to help out, will once again take up the slack.</para>
<para>This is the market at work. This is a government that prides itself on understanding economics but it cannot see that the primary problem with child careâthe problem that is forcing up the cost to parentsâis supply. Trying to fiddle with the price and dressing it up as a solution to the problem does not help one bit. Australian parents understand the problem, so why does this government find it so difficult to comprehend? If this is the best solution that the self-appointed best friend of the Australian worker can come up with to assist working parents, then with friends like that I guess we do not need too many enemies.</para>
<para>This was policy on the run that has culminated in legislation and administration on the run. Working families in south-west Sydney, in fact all over Australia, need a break. They need the government to get serious about providing affordable child care so that parents can work and not have to worry about child-care places being available. This policy is not about affordability; it is about electoral success.</para>
<para>As I said earlier, parents have been led up the garden path, particularly on this issue. This is the policy of an arrogant and out-of-touch government that does not really have the concerns of working parents at the centre of its consideration. Parents need help today, not in 30 months time, so it is incumbent upon the members of this place to take the issue seriously and not try to hide behind a poorly thought-out bandaid solution. Australian parents need certainty and they need affordable child careâtwo significant elements missing from this policy and from this legislation. I support the oppositionâs amendment to the bill and encourage members opposite who really giveâ<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âin replyâI thank all the members who have contributed to todayâs debate on the <inline ref="R2405">Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005</inline>. Listening to some of the commentary from those opposite, you would think the government was actually adding a 30 per cent tax, not giving a 30 per cent tax rebate for child care. The fact is that this is an election commitment and it has been met. It is generous to families and recognises the important role of families, children and parents in the work force.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>To assist families with the cost of approved child careâand I say approved child care because that is significant to this debateâthe first measure of the bill introduces the child-care tax rebate as announced in the election campaign. It provides assistance by giving families a rebate of their tax of 30 per cent of out-of-pocket child-care expenses up to a maximum of $4,000 per child per year. The rebate will cover child-care expenses for taxpayers who used approved care and meet the child-care benefit work test or one of the equivalent child-care benefit limits. This rebate will provide additional child-care assistance to around 640,000 Australian families.</para>
<para>The rebate is non-refundable, meaning that taxpayers must have a tax liability to claim the offset. However, to ensure that families obtain the maximum benefit possible, taxpayers with insufficient tax liability to absorb the whole rebate will be able to transfer any unused portion of the rebate to their spouse. Simply put, if they do not have a tax liability of $4,000 and they are eligible for a $4,000 rebate they can wipe out the entire tax from one partner and pass the rest on to maximise that opportunity. The introduction of this rebate builds on the assistance already provided to families through child-care benefits and other initiatives such as the family tax benefits. Changes to the child-care benefit work, training and study test were announced in the 2005-06 budget as part of the Welfare to Work package. However, to ensure families with part-time workers remain eligible for the rebate, the current CCB work, training and study test will continue to apply for rebate purposes following the Welfare to Work changes.</para>
<para>As previously announced by the Treasurer, in his press release of 20 December 2004, families can claim a rebate in the income tax return for the year following the year in which they incurred the child-care expenses. I am well aware that this issue has been raised by both the opposition and the community. The timing of the rebate has been constructed to ensure families will receive the correct entitlement without adjustmentsâin other words, without having to make expensive and unfortunate adjustments to the tax office in the form of reconciliations because they have been overpaid. This will minimise taxpayersâ interaction with the ATO and Centrelink, and I am sure that will be appreciated by all.</para>
<para>In recognition that the payment will be made in a subsequent yearâs tax return, the start date for eligibility has been brought forward six months, which means that the coalition have gone beyond the commitment we provided in the election campaign. This will enable families to claim an extra six months of out-of-pocket costs.</para>
<para>The government recognises that accessible, affordable and high-quality child care is vital for families to participate effectively in the work force. The government has improved the accessibility of child care over its term. As part of the $206 million child-care package in the 2005-06 budget the government is boosting the number of child-care places. This includes an additional 84,300 outside school hour care places, an additional 2,500 family day care places and an additional 1,000 in-home care places. This builds on the additional 40,000 out of school hour places and 4,000 family day care places provided in the 2004-05 budget. Since coming to office the Howard government has almost doubled the number of child-care places from 306,500 in 1996 to around 600,000 by 1 July 2005.</para>
<para>There were a number of questions raised in the course of this debate by members opposite and I would like to take this opportunity to address those. I have already partially addressed one of those questions, and that was the allegation that this is targeted at the wealthy. As the member for Werriwa pointed out, some members of the community will not have a sufficient tax liability to receive the entire rebate. What that means, in plain English, is that they do not have a tax liability after this is taken into account. You cannot reduce someoneâs tax liability if it is already zero. And I point that out to the member for Werriwa and others on the other side.</para>
<para>It is also misleading to compare child-care tax rebate outcomes, as low-income families will receive more child-care benefit. Let us put this into context, because it is not one or the other; it is both in combination. In 2005-06 low-income earners receiving a maximum rate of child-care benefit will receive $144 per week per child. This equates to $7,344 of direct assistance for 50 hours a week, for 51 weeks a year. I will say that again: it means that the taxpayer, through the governmentâs child-care benefit, will receive $7,344 a year in direct assistance. Compare that to a high-income earner receiving the minimum rate of child-care benefit of $24.15 per week. This equates to $1,231 per year for 50 hours of child-care a week, for 51 weeks a year. My quick arithmetic tells me that that is quite a large disparity of $6,113. So there is a big difference between the twoâand the child-care rebate comes in over and above that.</para>
<para>There was also a distinction drawn between preschools, formal and informal care. The key distinction between preschools and approved child-care services is clear. Preschools are generally provided by the state and are funded by the state. As such, preschools would lose eligibility for state and territory government funding if there was direct federal government funding through this source. Given these funding arrangements, it is not appropriate for preschools to be eligible for the child-care tax rebate.</para>
<para>The member for Sydney and the member for Batman raised some issues about some debt provisions which a particular child-care provider has entered into. I simply point out to the members who sit opposite that these are private arrangements. These are not arrangements that have been entered into by the government, at all. As for any arrangement where someone enters into a loan agreement, we would suggest that they seek independent advice and be aware of what they are doing.</para>
<para>With respect to the communications campaign, a number of members have suggested that it would be better if this positive initiative was better understood. We will take that on board and the government will consider further communications with the general public after the passage of the legislation.</para>

<para>The member for Sydney also referred to the two work tests. This is a valid question which deserves a valid answer. Maintaining the current child-care benefit work training study test will ensure that part-time workers, a significant and important part of our work community, continue to be eligible for the child-care tax rebate. Workers with fewer than 15 hours per week will still be eligible for child-care benefit but only up to a maximum of 24 hours worth of child-care benefit per week. The government considers it appropriate to maintain two tests in order to ensure that part-time workers continue to be eligible for the rebate.</para>
<para>The member for Hotham raised an issue with respect to our election commitment, believing that the child-care rebate had not been independently costed by Finance during the campaign. I can inform the member for Hotham that, unlike most of the Labor Party policies, they were submitted during the election, as required by the Charter of Budget Honestyâand the commitments were costed.</para>
<para>The member for Hunter queried the amount of money that would be set aside by the ATO to administer the rebate. I can inform him that it will take approximately $10 million over four years to administerâessentially over the same period of timeâ$1,000 million worth of direct assistance to Australian families. So, contrary to the comments that have been made by those who sit opposite, this is a positive measure which is going to benefit over 600,000 families by making child care more affordable. By doing that it will relieve the pressure on many Australian families. It is an election commitment; it has been extended and it will be fully implemented by this legislation.</para>
<para>The second schedule of this bill amends the list of deductible gift recipients in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. Several organisations have been listed. Deductible gift recipient status will assist these organisations to attract public support for their activities. I take the opportunity to thank these organisations for the invaluable work they do in their communities.</para>
<para>The third measure of the bill will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to allow the disclosure of business income tax information between the Commissioner of Taxation and the Australian Statistician for the purposes of the Census and Statistic Act 1905. This will enable the Australian Bureau of Statistics to improve the quality and scope of information that can be provided to the public, and assist in fulfilling its mission of providing high-quality national statistical services.</para>
<para>Finally, the fourth measure of the bill provides New Zealand wine producers who export wine to Australia access to the wine equalisation tax producer rebate. New Zealand wine producers may claim the rebate in relation to wine that has had wine equalisation tax paid on it on or after 1 July 2005. The Australian government has decided to provide the rebate to New Zealand wine producers without the need for them to enter the Australian taxation system. New Zealand wine producers may apply to the Commissioner of Taxation to become approved New Zealand participants. If approved, they can then claim the rebate, provided they can demonstrate that the wine equalisation tax has been paid on their wine that has been exported to Australia.</para>
<para>This is an important measure, and it goes a long way towards the closer economic ties which we are establishing with our close neighbour New Zealand. It may be of interest to members on both sides of the House that in 2003 Australia exported to New Zealand about 10 times the volume of New Zealand imports to Australia in the form of wine. Some 3.5 million litres of wine were imported and some 30 million litres of wine exported. It is important that we maintain close economic ties with New Zealand and that we also support our wine industry.</para>
<para>The member for Hunter was interested in the implications of the wine tax rebate for trading partners such as China and New Zealand. As we mentioned off screen, so to speak, a little earlier, the bill provides separate administrative arrangements to facilitate claims by New Zealand wine producers, who would otherwise need to be registered under our systems. These arrangements are supported by our close administrative cooperation with the New Zealand tax authorities and by specific New Zealand legislation. The arrangements are based on the very close ties between Australia and New Zealand and are quite separate from free trade agreements that may be entered into or that have been entered into.</para>
<para>There was one question from the member for Hunter that I have neglected to mention, in regard to charities. He referred to a draft tax ruling by the Taxation Office and the effect this potentially could have on some charitable organisations. I would remind the member that it is just thatâa draft taxation ruling put out not by the government but by the ATO. The draft ruling sets out the commissionerâs view on the meaning of âcharitable institutionâ and a âfund established for public charitable purposesâ. It is a draft ruling for industry and professional comment. The ATO would welcome that comment before a final ruling is made.</para>
<para>The measures proposed in this bill continue the governmentâs program to implement a range of changes and improvements to the Australian taxation system. I again thank all members who participated in this debate. For the reasons I have outlined above, I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para class="block">The amendments that I have circulated give effect to the second part of the second reading amendment that I moved earlier today. They would make the tax offset claimable at the end of each financial year and give parents the option to either self-assess their entitlement to the offset and keep receipts as evidence of their self-assessed entitlement or, if they elect to do it another way, have the Australian Taxation Office assess their tax offset entitlement once the relevant data is received from child-care providers and then receive the offset after that. So they would receive the bulk of their tax return at one time and then, when the tax office had assessed their tax offset entitlement, they would receive the amount that they had been assessed as being entitled to from the rebate. So, in either circumstance, they would get the money much sooner. If they self-assess their entitlement, they would need to talk to their child-care provider or keep their receipts. They would have a pretty good idea of what they would be entitled to, and they would be able to claim that in their tax return along with the tax refund they are claiming for other items.</para>
<para>If parents were worried that they were not able to adequately assess what they were entitled to, if they were worried about overpayment or underpayment because of the terrible debacle that the family tax benefit has been, with hundreds of thousands of Australians being overpaid and ending up with a debt to the tax officeâif they were worried about that sort of circumstanceâthey could elect instead to have the ATO assess their entitlement. This would happen once the child-care providers gave the information to the Australian Taxation Office that would allow them to make a completely accurate assessment of what parents were entitled to.</para>
<para>I think it is fair to say that the delay that parents are going to experience when it comes to this offset is one of the major problems with the policy. There is no way that parents could have had any idea during the last election campaign that they would be waiting a minimum of 14 months to see any of this moneyâand they certainly were not told that they would be waiting up to 30 months to see the money. It is absolutely unreasonable on the part of the government to say: âWeâre going to help you out with child-care expenses. We know youâre under pressure. We know itâs a strain on the family budget. Weâre coming to the rescue. Weâre going to send you a cheque in 2Â½ years time.â Laborâs amendments are very reasonable. They follow existing practice in other areas. They avoid the problem of overpayment or underpayment, because they give parents the option to wait a few extra months and get exactly the right amount from the Australian Taxation Office. This means that parents will get their money much sooner than under the governmentâs proposal.</para>
<para>The Treasurer has been out there defending this muddle of a policy by saying, âPeople always knew that it was going to be delayed.â It is not true that this was made clear to parents during the election campaign. There has been a great deal of obfuscation between the election campaign period and now. Parents and child-care providers have been ringing the Australian Taxation Office, and the information they have been given has been extremely sketchy.</para>
<para>Earlier, the minister was saying that they are looking forward to spending many more millions of dollars of taxpayersâ funds on an advertising campaign. What is not needed is another advertising campaign. What is needed is adequate information that the Australian Taxation Office can tell child-care providers so that the child-care providers can tell the parents that they deal with, so that the operators on the end of the ATO information line actually know how to answer a question or two instead of saying: âThatâs all subject to the legislation. Weâll see what happens when the legislation passes.â It has been an abysmal information campaign up until now. The amendments that we are moving allow parents to get their money much sooner. If the government are interested in helping parents rather than in the convenience of the Australian Taxation Office, they will adopt Laborâs amendments.</para>

<para>âThe rebate is a non-refundable tax offset on assessment only. It cannot be claimed by reducing the amount of tax withheld from a personâs wages or salaries throughout the year. It cannot be paid through reducing tax withheld, because it would be very difficult to accurately determine a personâs entitlement in advance. Entitlement to the rebate is calculated using actual family taxable income: child-care costs and child-care benefit over the course of the entire year. Entitlement is only likely to vary from one year to the next. Rather, families will claim the rebate in the tax year after child-care expenses have been incurred. This means the family will lodge the child-care expenses for 2004-05 in their 2005-06 tax returns, and I know that is understood by the member opposite. The timing of the rebate has been constructed to ensure families will receive the correct entitlement without adjustments. It will also minimise taxpayersâ interaction with the Australian Taxation Office and Centrelink.</para>

<para class="block">The opposition is here to help the government. The government is clearly in breach of an election promise and Labor want to help bring it back to that election promise. The government said one thing during the election campaign and, today, by virtue of this legislation, it is saying something else. The government said nothing about a $4,000 cap during the election campaign, and it certainly did not say anything about families having to wait some two years to access the relief under this 30 per cent tax offset. The amendments I have moved remove the provision that would prevent taxpayers from applying to the Australian Taxation Office for authorisation of employers to withhold tax on their behalf under the PAYG systemâin other words, the government has now rejected the member for Sydneyâs very sensible amendment which would have allowed families to go down the path of self-assessment, as they do in every other aspect of their tax lives. The member for Sydneyâs amendment would have allowed Australian families to access this rebate in the way that it was promised during the last election campaign.</para>
<para>Although the government have rejected that amendment, I am giving them another opportunity to deliver as they said they would deliver during the election campaign. The opposition proposes to allow employees to go to the tax office and arrange for their employer to take less tax out of their pay each week or each fortnight in the expectation that they will be eligible for the 30 per cent tax offset at the end of the tax year. This is not without precedent; it has already been done under the senior Australian tax offset. Under this proposal, there is no reason why the government could not provide that same opportunity to Australians and, in doing so, deliver on their election promiseâwhich apparently they intend to break.</para>
<para>Before I finish, I will quickly expand on my question on the wine equalisation tax. The minister indicated that the relationship Australia enjoys with our New Zealand friends under the closer economic relations agreement is somewhat different from the prescriptive nature of the free trade agreement that we have with the United States and probably much different from the prescriptive approach we would take to a China free trade agreement. However, I will again make the point that, while ever this precedent is in place, there could be an opportunity for future trading partners to insist on the same sorts of arrangements that the New Zealanders now enjoy under the CER. So while it might be right to say that the CER and the current FTAs are quite different, in that one is prescriptive and one is not, this could give future trading partners some justification for arguing that they should be treated in a like manner.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Hunter for his contribution. He has offered to assist the government. The best way the member opposite could assist the government is to allow us to get our tax legislation and other measures through as rapidly as we would have liked in the previous parliamentâbefore 1 July. This measure will come into effect. Far be it from us to not honour a commitment; we have, in fact, extended the commitment. In respect of the member for Sydneyâs contribution, I have already given an explanation as to why the government has taken this path. It is to ensure that Australian families do not find themselves with an unfortunate debt.</para>

<para>âMinister, isnât it the case that approved child-care providers are already required to submit their child-care usage and fee data to Centrelink and that Family and Community Services, Centrelink and the tax office use the data to work out how much child-care benefit parents are entitled to? Under the governmentâs system, the ATO would work with Centrelink to assess how much money each taxpayer is entitled to from the rebate and that official assessment would be sent to the taxpayer, who would submit it back to the Australian Taxation Office at the end of the next financial year as part of their tax return. Can the minister explain why Family and Community Services and the ATO are asking for what they are calling âofficial receiptsâ for child care when the government is already getting the information from approved child-care providers who are required to submit their child-care usage and fee data to Centrelink? It is also true, isnât it, that child-care benefit is paid within or just after the financial year that parents pay for the child care on the basis of similar data? Isnât the data they need to get to work out their child-care tax rebate information the same data that has already been collected in order to pay their child-care benefit?</para>

<para>âThat is actually not correct. What they are providing in order that the rebates or money be paid from the child-care benefit is eligible hours. They are two separate amounts. There is no actual correlation between that and what would be required in order to determine someoneâs tax positionâtheir tax rebate. Whilst I grant you they are providing information, it is not the same information.</para>

<para>âIt could be a simple matter of asking the child-care centres to slightly amend the data that they are providing, thoughâit would not be a major difference in the data that they are providing from eligible hours to actual amounts of child-care benefit that parents are receiving. Given that a great deal of information is already being collected, would it not make more sense to just wait those few extra months for the information to be collected in one go so that, when families are having their child-care benefit amounts reconciled and their family tax benefits reconciled around November each year, you could simply also reconcile what they are entitled to with their child-care tax offset?</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I also want to raise with the minister the issue of receipts more specifically. Family and Community Services and the Australian Tax Office are asking for what they refer to as âofficial receiptsâ for child care. Isnât it simply doubling the workload for child-care centres that are already engaged in a process of collecting and supplying information to Centrelink for them to need to go back to parents once again with a separate form for how much the parents have paid in child care? Wouldnât it make much more sense to have the child-care centres collecting the information all in one go, submitting it to Centrelink and the ATO and using that as the basis for any decisions that are being made about how much parents are entitled to?</para>
<para>I also notice that the Assistant Treasurer has said in the past that he expects the tax office to look sympathetically upon claims made by parents who have not kept receipts. You would understand that there are parents who would not understand what âlook sympathetically uponâ means. The notion that such claims would be left to the discretion of individual tax office officers is probably not a good enough explanation for parents. They would want to have some very clear guidance between now and when they are submitting their tax returns about exactly what will be considered an official receipt and what will happen if they do not have receipts. Obviously at least three months of their receipts should have been gathered at a time before this policy was announced before the election campaign, because we have gone back to June 2004.</para>
<para>I would hope to be able to say confidently to parents that if they do not have receipts for that period they will still receive the rebate that they are entitled to. A notion that the tax office would have discretionary power over that is not at all reassuring for parents. Could you please clarify what exactly the situation will be? Will parents need to have paper receipts? What happens if their child-care provider does not have the resources to go back two years into their books? Will a self-assessment be accepted in these circumstances? Will individual tax office staff have discretion or will there be a blanket ruling that says that, for the period before this policy was announced, parents will be assumed to have paid the fees that they are claiming?</para>

<para>âI understand your concerns in regard to the receipts. Obviously, because the government has been generous and backdated thisâeven to before the electionâit is reasonable that people may not have made provision for that. The ATO has made it very clear, and I remind the House that the ATO is an independent statutory authority and as such the government cannot dictate how it administers itself. Obviously, it interprets the law. The ATO is looking at alternative forms of substantiation, and I am sure that it will be taking that into account, but it will be up to it, not the government, to provide that information. The commissioner has tried to make the community aware that the ATO is aware that this is a policy which has, if you like, retrospective implications of a positive nature and that the ATO will not be unreasonable if people have not kept the paper receipts, as you put it. So we can assure people that the ATO will take that into account in establishing that a child has in fact been in a formal child-care activity, which should be reasonably easy to ascertain.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The other question that you asked was about the holding back of assessments. There has been a lot of commentary of late about the complexity of the tax system, but individual families often have very complex arrangements as well. We stand in this place and talk about how, if this, this and this happened, they would all fall into line and it would be okay, and in many cases that may well be true. But you cannot actually determine an individualâs eligibility for child-care benefit until the incomes of both parentsâif they are a husband and wife or partnersâhave been reconciled and tax has been determined. That then determines the child-care benefit eligibility of both of them. Obviously that is an issue that quite often occurs at the end of the year. Why? Because a person has been receiving X amount of child-care benefit and that has to be reconciled with the child-care centreâand after that, of course, the rebate will take effect. So there are a number of different parts of this equation that have to fall into place. On balance, it has been determined this way so that we do not have some of the issues that this parliament has referred to in tax initiatives in the past.</para>

<para>âI thank the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer for that answer, but I point out that Labor are not proposing a one-size-fits-all approach to this. In the case of the second part of our amendment, we are proposing that parents who do have fairly straightforward tax arrangements be given the option of being able to ask the commissioner for this provision. In the case of the first parts of our amendment, we are proposing that they be given the option of electing to self-assess or having the Australian Taxation Office do the assessment for them.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We understand that some people have complicated taxation arrangements. Some people have complicated income arrangements. Particularly with the increasing casualisation of the work force, people often do take a little while to work out what they have earned in a year. They might be working two or more jobs. That applies for some people. But there are still a lot of people out there who could work this out for themselves or who could have a fairly straightforward proposition for the Australian tax office to determine or who could ask the tax office to have their fortnightly tax reduced because they can predict with some accuracy what they will be entitled to in the rebate. Those people should have the option of not having to wait up to 30 months to receive this money.</para>
<para>The other group that will miss out is that of sole parents on low incomesâsole parents who do not pay enough tax in a particular financial year to get the benefit of this 30 per cent rebate. I would like to ask the Assistant Treasurer what he intends to do for the people in that group. Many of them have paid out substantial amounts for child care already. An example of such a person might be a full-time student who needs to have their child in care for a significant number of hours per week. If they are studying more than 15 hours, they will get child-care benefit but, because this benefit is based on their tax liability, they will not be eligible for this 30 per cent rebate. It seems very unfair that this person, who is on a low income and is struggling to make ends meet and to better themselves and provide a better future for their children, misses out entirely, while someone in a family with a couple, where one partner is working full-time, for example, and the other person is working a couple of hours a week, will get the full benefit of the 30 per cent rebate.</para>
<para>Another example might be someone who is starting up their own business and who has young children under the age of five. They need a substantial number of hours of care every week. They are working very hard to establish a business. They want to provide for their children and themselves and for their family in the future. They are doing exactly what the government is asking them to do in the welfare changes and they will miss out on this 30 per cent rebate because the business does not collect enough money in its first year. It is a very common scenario that someone starting up a business does not make a big profit in the first year. They might have some other deductible start-up expenses for the business, but more likely than not they are just not going to earn enough money in that year. Because they have no partner to whom they can transfer the rebate, they miss out entirely. Why should someone studying full time or someone trying to start up a business miss out, in contrast to a high-income family with a second earner?</para>

<para>âIt is self-evident that a person who is paying no tax cannot get a tax rebate, but at the same time, as I said, you should not be looking at the tax rebate in isolation. This is the rebate along with the child-care benefit. The individuals that you referred to, whether they be small business people, single parents or students, who are very low income earners, are obviously going to attract the maximum child-care benefit, which equates to over $7,000, if one individual child is in care for 50 hours a week, 51 weeks of the year. So in fact that individual is already reaping the maximum benefitâas they should be. They are paying no tax, as you pointed out. We are not in a position to give back something that has not been paid, but the taxpayer has in fact made the largest contribution by assisting them to have the most affordable child care that the system can allow, comparing that to the higher income earner, who would have a child-care benefit in the order of $1,200.</para>

<para>âI welcome the Boeing employees and I have no doubt that they are very decent, patriotic Australians looking after their families. I am absolutely certain they are aware that over the last 9Â½ years their families have been better looked after than they were under a Labor government. They would be aware of that.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Let me turn to the issue. At present, so I am told, Boeing employs over 2,000 people across Australia, of which about 380 are doing similar work to those who are on strike. About 31 employees are on strike, which represents less than 10 per cent of the aircraft maintenance work force, and more than 90 per cent of workers doing similar work do not support the strike and have stayed at work. I also understand that, at present, people at Boeing are employed under common-law contracts. I further understand that even the president of the ACTU supports common-law contracts, because I saw her say it two nights ago on <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline>.</para>
<para>Insofar as the entitlement to negotiate a collective agreement is concerned, the existing law means that the company is within its rights in taking the position it is taking. It is fair and proper, under the existing law. I understand that the 31 employees can go back to work on their old terms or accept new terms that would see every one of them get a pay rise. It is their choice.</para>
<para>The AWU want a collective agreement that includes annual pay increases of 10 per cent, annual increases on all allowances of 10 per cent, and other changes which would allow the union to intervene in the way the business is run. I understand that the workers are accompanied in Canberra today by Mr Bill Shorten of the AWU. But we all know why Bill is here: he is checking out the office of the member for Maribyrnong to see if it would be suitable for his purposes. I simply say to the hardworking, patriotic, dedicated employees to whom the Leader of the Opposition refers that they are, on my advice, entitled to return to work at any time. They can either go back on their old terms or accept new terms under which every one of them would get a pay rise. Under the existing lawânot under the new law but under the existing lawâwhat the company is doing is entirely lawful and entirely within its rights.</para>

<para>âI thank the honourable member for McMillan for his question and I can inform the House that it is three months, to the day, since the budget was brought down on 10 May. The good news is that this morning legislation passed the Senate to give a tax cut to every Australianâthat is, Laborâs campaign to defeat the tax cuts, which they have been engaging in for the last three months, is finally ended. If you want an illustration of how important it is to have a coalition majority in the Senate it is this: without a coalition majority in the Senate, no Australian would have got a tax cut on 1 July. The Labor Party defeated these tax cuts in the Senate twice. This House insisted on the tax cuts yesterday, and when they returned to the Senate this morningâget a load of thisâthe Labor Party did not even call a division, because it knew that a coalition majority would deliver a tax cut to every Australian.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>But there is more good news. The first bill that passed the new Senate today cut income tax for every Australian. The second bill that passed the Senate today abolishes the superannuation surcharge. Again the Australian Labor Party, when it had a majority in the Senate, was able to defeat that. Can I make it clear to Australians that, notwithstanding the fact that the legislation did go through today, taxpayers have actually received their tax cut from 1 July 2005, because the commissioner published schedules instructing employers on how to pass it on and those schedules were not disallowed in the Senate. From the time of the budget until today, the Australian Labor Party had still determined not to determine its position in relation to those withholding schedules. But the good news is that Laborâs campaign to defeat the tax cuts has been defeated and the coalition has now delivered an income tax cut to every Australian.</para>

<para>âI know the Prime Minister has ignored the plight of the Boeing workers. Let me try another question on him. Does the Prime Minister recall saying to John Laws on 23 January 1996 that he would âguarantee people would not be worse offâit is an explicit, rock-solid, ironclad guaranteeâ? Prime Minister, is it not the case that on the John Laws program today the following exchange took place:</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Page for his question. Of course the member for Page, representing that seat on the north coast of New South Wales, understands full well the importance of a strong economy and good sound investment in infrastructure to underpin exports out of Australia. As I indicated yesterday, our strong economy has delivered a record level of exports in the last 12 monthsâover $162 billion worth of exports, a lot of them coming out of the electorate of the member for Page and, I might add, being carried to the ports on state highways that the federal government has had to invest money in, like the Pacific Highway on the east coast of New South Wales particularly in the member for Pageâs electorate.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>A strong domestic economy is of critical importance to the competitiveness of our export industries. We have continued to produce budget surpluses, keeping downward pressure on interest rates, we have unemployment down to five per cent and we have almost eliminated government debtâall key indicators in terms of the strength of our economy and of creating a much more competitive environment for our exporters to do well in the international marketplace. But most importantly, running a sound economy, running a good economy and getting rid of federal government debt enables the government to invest more in infrastructure and is a critical element of the competitive nature of our exports. For example, we have invested $12.7 billion in our road and rail infrastructure through the AusLink program, overseen by the former minister for transport; $260 million in the rail infrastructure of the Hunter Valley, rail infrastructure that had been totally ignored by the state Labor government of New South Wales; and $150 million in rail and port links in Melbourne, infrastructure that had been ignored by the state Labor government of Victoria. Since 1997 we have invested over a billion dollars in telecommunication servicesâvital for Australiaâs export industries to remain competitiveâparticularly $157 million in regional broadband services.</para>

<para>âtook a decision to switch off the analog phone service in regional Australia. They were going to switch it off with no replacement and leave no services in regional Australia. We had to step in and replace that with a CDMA network to give mobile telecommunications to regional Australia. We had to introduce CDMA after the Labor Party switched the analog service off. It just goes to show you that over the life of our government the reform agenda and all the ideas are coming from this side of the House and not the other side of the House.

<para>âI thank the honourable member for Kingston for his question. I informed the House yesterday of the prospects for the Australian economy as reported by the Reserve Bank of Australia in its statement on the conduct of monetary policy. Overnight the US Federal Reserve increased interest rates again by a quarter of one per cent. This is the 10th successive increase in official interest rates in the United States, taking its official cash rate from one per cent to 3Â½ per cent.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This is actually a good sign. It is a sign that authorities in the United States are confident that the United States economy is recovering from the disappointing recession that that country had in 2000 and 2001. That will underline global economic strength in the year to come, as will the expansion under way in China, which shows no sign of abating with the Chinese economy growing at around nine per cent. The Japanese economy is showing recovery and was much stronger in 2005 than in 2004. Taking all of these developments together, we have had the strongest two-year period of world economic growth in around 30 years. Of course, the expansion in China and Japan in particular has supported the demand for Australian commodities.</para>
<para>Also, the Westpac Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment was released today. It shows a very strong rebound in consumer sentiment in Australia. In August the index of consumer sentiment rose 7.6 per cent to be 115.7 per cent. This is well above the long-term average for consumer sentiment and there is no doubt that one of the things that have led the rebound in consumer sentiment in Australia is more certainty about the interest rate climate. There is also no doubt that consumer sentiment would have been boosted in the last month by tax cuts. The measures which took effect on 1 July have already delivered something like $350 million of tax cuts to Australian income tax payers.</para>
<para>Of course, they are the tax cuts that the Australian Labor Party opposed. If the Australian Labor Party had had its way, no Australian would have got a tax cut on 1 July. Because the Australian Labor Party was unsuccessful, every Australian got a tax cut on 1 July 2005. This supports hardworking Australian families. It will improve the incentive under the Australian taxation system. We have seen the rebound in relation to consumer sentiment. Whilst we expect growth to be solid in the coming year, it will be growth on a low-inflation basis, which will give certainty to families in the year that lies ahead.</para>

I refer the Deputy Prime Minister to his guarantee to the House yesterday that public holidays, meal breaks and smokos will be protected as part of the governmentâs minimum conditions standard. Will the Deputy Prime Minister now give a guarantee to the more than 11,000 families in his electorate of Lyne who are dependent upon the minimum wage for their livelihood that they will not be worse off under the governmentâs extreme industrial relations changes?</para>

</talker>
<para>âFirst, I thank the honourable member for his interest in this important issue. There is no doubt that Australian uranium resources make a significant contribution to our own national prosperity. We have an estimated 30 per cent of the worldâs medium-cost uranium resources, and last financial year our exports earned nearly $500 million. So this is a significant resource. Australian uranium exports account for around two per cent of the worldâs total electricity production, and countries using our uranium avoid carbon dioxide emissions. The emissions they avoid are roughly equivalent to Australiaâs entire annual CO emissions, so there is no doubt that our uranium exports make a significant contribution to mitigating the impact of human activity on climate change.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is obviously vital to ensure that our uranium exports are used exclusively for peaceful purposes and contribute, therefore, to the international non-proliferation regime. We have been able to do that for many years. I think it started during the term of the Fraser government, actually, which negotiated treaty level nuclear safeguard conditions. We currently have 19 nuclear agreements covering 36 countries, including four of the five nuclear weapons statesâthat is, the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Russia.</para>
<para>Yesterday I announced that Australia will formally commence negotiations on an agreement with the fifth nuclear weapons state, China. China is the worldâs second largest energy consumer and has a very high projected growth in electricity demand. Chinaâs demand for uranium by 2020 is estimated to increase fourfold. In fact, the total consumption by China in 2020 would be the equivalent of our total uranium exports this year. So diversifying from fossil fuels will result in lower greenhouse emissions in China, and that obviously will be very desirable. Our officials held exploratory talks in Beijing on the proposed agreement, and we will be having further talks. We hope that the agreement can be finalised before too long, and it will be referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties.</para>
<para>I will conclude by making the point that I can assure the Australian public that we will not, in the case of our negotiations with China, dilute our nuclear safeguards standards. The agreement we have with China must be an agreement which is comparable and commensurate with the agreements we have with other nuclear weapons states and with non-nuclear weapons states as well.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Forrest for his question, because it goes to the heart of the governmentâs proposed workplace relations reform. The government believes that it is time to have one single system of workplace relations in Australia. We believe that this will be to the advantage of the Australian economy, because it will help to drive increased wages and jobs for ordinary Australians. In addition to that, the removal of the duplication which currently exists would cut red tape for business and it would amount to a saving for the states of some $120 million annually. That is $120 million which could be better expended on health services, education and policeâessential services in the states. This is something which many of the state Labor leaders actually support. As long ago as 1990 the former long-serving Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, said:</para>

<para>âIf you would like to listen, I will let you know. These changes will come into operation after the legislation has passed through parliament. It is our intention, if the Labor Party would get out of the way, to have this legislation through by the end of the year and to have the system in operation from next year. Obviously there is a series of transitional issues, and the detail of that will be revealed when the legislation is tabled in parliament.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Ryan for his question and his obvious continued interest in this issue. Ninety per cent of all tourism businesses in this country are small businesses. They understand the need for industrial relations reformâin fact, they believe it is vitally important. The National Tourism Alliance represents over ninety per cent of all tourism industry operators representing businesses involved in accommodation, anything to do with airlines, car touring, retail travel agencies, any business tourism, the meetings industry, farm and country tourism, youth hostels, retail, adventure operators, the caravan and the camping industry, and restaurants and catering. So you can see that this is an organisation that represents the vast majority of all those small businesses operating in the tourism industry.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I think that we need to have a look at what Mr Col Hughes, who is the Chairman of the National Tourism Alliance, said. He said that he reaffirmed the tourism industryâs support for a continuing review of work practices that will deliver greater flexibility and greater productivity for both employees and employers in the tourism industry. He said, âThe NTA will continue to work closely with the Howard Government to ensure the legislation takes shape, that domestic tourism and the overall tourism industry benefit from the creation of a more flexible work environment.â</para>
<para>Mr Chris Brown, whom many opposite would be well aware of, and who is the Managing Director of the Tourism and Transport Forum, said that the tourism industry believes âcontinuing reform of the labour market has the capacity to deliver greater competitiveness, job creation and productivity growth for the tourism sector. âThe industry,â he said, âwill continue to work with government to develop labour market reforms that will generate growth in the Australian economy and in the tourism industry especiallyâ.</para>

I can assure the Leader of the Opposition that those in the tourist industry have taken great notice of what the Leader of the Opposition has said. To illustrate the sort of reform that the government is supporting and will ensure for small business, let us look at the example of a Lowenbrau chef who took five months leave and combined it with studying in Asia. His employer saw the value of this and the chef negotiated time without pay. The employer continued to pay his superannuation for the entire time he was away, and on his return the chef resumed full employment.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Jagajaga for the question. The government is determined to see that Australiaâs 715,000 university students will from next year be free to choose whether they will join a student union, guild or association or whether they will not join it. In fact, that is a principle that goes right across this government: that every Australian should be free to join and be represented by a union or, alternatively, to not join that union and to purchase services or seek representation wherever they like. That is the fundamental principle here, and this is why the Labor Party is so concerned: because it knows that come January next year, when this legislation will have been passed, when those Australians turn up at a university campus to get an education and they are given the choice of joining the union, guild or associationâwhether it is the toga club, the abseiling club or the rowing clubâmost of them will want to exercise the right to be free to choose.</para>

<para>The Labor Party is taking the arrogant position that says that young adult Australians in the 21st century are in some way incapable of making a decision as to what they will spend their hard-earned money on. I will tell the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition one thing I knowâin fact, I will tell you two facts. I would like to know how many people are sitting behind the Leader of the Opposition that do not support Laborâs opposition to tax cuts, and how many people are sitting behind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition who are totally opposed to Laborâs hit list on private schools? When you have sorted that out, then start asking us some questions.</para>

<para>âI do thank the member for Makin for her question. In response, let me remind the House that, as the Prime Minister and all the state Labor premiers and chief ministers declared just last month, Australia has one of the worldâs best health systems. Even the member for Lalor herself has woken up to this, saying yesterday that by world standards we have a good system. This is a government which does not just talk about Medicare but makes the adjustments necessary to make a good system even better.</para>

<para>We do not have enough doctors in this country, but there are five per cent more doctors in equivalent full-time work force terms now than in 1996, thanks to the policies of the Howard government. The health system is not just doctors. Doctors are important, but it is very important that all health professionals are working together rather than working in isolation from each other. Thanks to the policies of the Howard government, there are 1,100 nurses in country general practice. Thanks to the policies put in place under Strengthening Medicare, there are now 600 nurses in urban general practice. For the first time, there is a specific Medicare item that recognises the good work of nurses. For the first time, allied health professionalsâsuch as psychologists, physiotherapists, dieticians, podiatrists, occupational therapists and so onâhave been brought within the Medicare net.</para>
<para>In the first 12 months, the allied health professional measure has resulted in 248,000 allied health professional consultations being supported under Medicare. That is not as many as we would have liked, but under changes put in place from 1 July we expect 300,000 team care plans will be put in place each year in the futureâmore good news from the Howard government.

<para>âI thank the member for Moore. I know that he is a member who is concerned about the issue of climate change. He is one of many membersâprobably all members on this side of the Houseâwho is pleased with the announcement that we made, with a number of other countries, on 28 July in Vientiane of the formation of the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate. This brings together six of the key Asia Pacific countries that are going to pursue a technology focused pro-growth approach to addressing climate change. It seems to me that is just a commonsense thing to do.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The six countries are Australia itself, of course, the United States, Japan, China, India and Korea. We represent roughly 50 per cent of the global populationâs GDP, energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. I expect other countries to join down the track, given the support there has been around the world for this initiative. Mr Speaker, if you take the so-called annex 1 countries in the Kyoto protocolâthat is, the countries that have signed up to a so-called binding targetâthey account for only 13 per cent of the worldâs population, 36 per cent of the worldâs energy use and 32 per cent of emissions. That is pretty small beer compared with the Asia Pacific partnership. The partnership is designed not to replace but to complement the Kyoto protocol, but the government is realistic enough to know that Kyoto is not a perfect solution.</para>
<para>The Labor Party says that we should abandon the partnership and we should focus on Kyoto. This is the proposition. I do not think people know this but, if you take the period between 1990 and 2010, if it had not been for Kyoto and its targets, global emissions would have increased by 41 per cent. With Kyotoâs binding targets, global emissions will increase instead by 40 per cent. That is progress. Instead of emissions increasing by 41 per cent, they will increase by 40 per cent. It is progress, but it is not a lot of progress. And, what is more, that assumes that all of those countries that have signed up to those targets will meet those targets. That, if I may say so, is almost certainly not going to happen. The partnership is bringing together the worldâs biggest emitters, the United States, China and India, to address the issuesâ</para>

Is the minister considering establishing a taxpayer fund to prop up campus services that will otherwise collapse under his extreme antistudent service legislation? Will all universities be eligible for grants, including campuses in outer metropolitan and suburban areas like the University of Western Sydney, or will the fund just be provided for campuses in Nationals seats?</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Lindsay for her question. I know of her considerable interest in these matters. I would also like to take the opportunity of thanking the members of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee who are considering an exposure draft bill dealing with changes to the Family Law Act which will be complemented by the most significant changes to family law when we implement the new family relationship centres. These are the centrepiece, of course, of our initiatives and almost $400 million is committed in the budget over time to the implementation of those centres.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I was pleased last Sunday week to attend with the member for Lindsay in Penrith an event where I was able to announce the location of the first 15 centres to be established. They are Lismore, Sutherland, Wollongong, Penrith, Mildura, Sunshine, Frankston, Ringwood, Townsville, Strathpine, Joondalup, Salisbury, Darwin, Hobart and Canberra. I did spend last week in a number of those locations in meetings discussing the implementation arrangements for this substantial initiative of the government. I have to say that the very well-attended meetings organised in so many locations reinforced in me an appreciation of the depth of feeling in our community about this issue and of the fact that we have to have a very clear focus on resolving issues in relation to family law in the best interests of children and at times their fundamental rightâall other things being equalâto know both parents.</para>
<para>I notice the member for Gellibrand has had some comments to make about our selection of new centres. One of the observations she made that I saw in a statement she released was that any priority in the running of centres should be given to existing established services. While I think that many of those do provide very important services to the communities they serve, one should not see them as being the only groups who have the capacity to help in this area. We certainly value the work that they have undertaken and that is why we have dramatically expanded service delivery. But I think what the opposition fails to understand in relation to this matter is that we are not only about changing the system; we want to change the culture. That means you need to be prepared to be open enough to recognise that there is a range of people and organisations with skills that ought to also be drawn upon in this very difficult area. I would encouraging the Labor Party to put aside its sniping from the sidelines and to support the most significant reforms to the family law system that we have seen in over a generation.</para>

<para>âI wish to raise a matter of privilege. I refer to two incidents where fraudulent and inaccurate documents purportedly from my office were distributed to media outlets and to a recipient of government funding in my electorate in what amounts to a dirty campaign against me and the timber industry in Eden-Monaro. In early April my office was contacted by a number of media outlets in my electorate in reference to a media statement which was supposedly released by me. The statement was apparently on my letterhead and was drafted to appear to have been faxed from my electorate office fax machine. The statement was entitled âNew vision for timber industryâ with the content referring to my supposed change in attitude to the timber industry. This media statement was not issued by me, despite the fact that it appeared to be on my legitimate letterhead and the originating fax identification used my name and fax number. This was clearly a forgery.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Then a few days later my office received a phone call from a very distressed director of a Narooma based logging contractor, Bruce Mathie and Sons Pty Ltd. That company had received a letter supposedly from me informing them that a grant from the Australian government under the Forest Industry Structural Adjustment Package, FISAP, recently announced by me, was being rescinded. The grant was for a substantial amount of money, $165,400, and Mr Mathie was most distressed that it now appeared to him that it would no longer be coming to his company. There was no truth in the statement that the grant was being rescinded and I had no knowledge of such a letter. My office requested that a copy of the letter be faxed to me. It was clearly a forgery.</para>
<para>The letter was printed on what appeared to be my letterhead and it had arrived by post in one of my window-faced envelopes. The letter also carried what appeared to be my signature, although very slightly distorted. The envelope was postmarked at Bega. There are well-known anti-timber activists based in Bega and I would not be surprised to learn of their involvement in this. Mr Mathie informed my office and me that the letterhead was in greenâthe colour of my legitimate letterheadâand the signature was in blue ink. This is a very professional forgery with a clear and calculated intent to mislead Mr Mathie and to misrepresent my office. It would appear that this is a part of a campaign against a legitimate industry, an important industry in my electorate, and against one local company involved in that industry. It is interesting to note that a current protest taking place in the Wandella forest is also targeted against the legal operations of Mr Mathieâs company and his employees.</para>
<para>Mr Speaker, I am aware that matters of privilege should be raised at the earliest opportunity; however during April and May, you would be aware, I was somewhat constrained due to personal circumstances with the illness and subsequent passing of my wife and therefore limited in initially following this matter up. I have taken the course of contacting the Australian Federal Police, the AFP, as I believe it may be a criminal matter and I understand the AFP are still conducting their inquiries. Given the severity of the matter at hand, I subsequently followed this up with the Clerk of the House and, having done so, I believe this to be a serious contempt of the House and that privilege may have been breached. I ask that you refer this matter to the Privileges Committee. I table copies of the relevant documents.</para>

<para>âMr Speaker, early in question time the member for Hunter asked a question to the Leader of the National Party which you ruled out of order on the grounds that it did not cover areas relating to the Leader of the National Partyâs portfolio. I draw your attention to the fact that on many occasions in the past, from both sides of the parliament, questions have been addressed to the Leader of the National Partyâas was the case when it was Mr Anderson and indeed, before that, Mr Fischerâwith respect to matters not strictly within their portfolio, and those questions have been allowed. In one case, for example, the former leader, Mr Anderson, was asked about troops in Iraq, which clearly had nothing to do with his portfolio, and that question was allowed. I wonder if you could examine the record and reconsider your approach to that question and whether or not the position that has prevailed over many years where the Leader of the National Party has been asked questions in their capacity as Leader of the National Party will continue.</para>

<para>âThe Attorney-General referred to the fact that, as part of the deliberations on the proposed amendments to the Family Law Act 1975, the members of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs have been given a marked-up copy of the act showing deletions and amendments as a result of the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Bill 2005 exposure draft, 23 June 2005. It is the first time as a member that I have been provided with a marked-up copy of an act like this by a minister, and I thank the Attorney-General for it. The marked-up copy of the act has been an invaluable tool for committee members in assessing the impact of the bill. My question to you is: where there are significant amendments to an act proposed in bills, would it be possible for members of the House to have access to a limited number of marked-up copies of the act being amended? Would you initiate discussions on behalf of all honourable members of both sides of the chamber with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House?

<para>âDuring question time the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations accused me and my party of getting in the way of the industrial legislation before the House and said that we should get out of its way. That was the statement he made. It is quite untrue; there is no legislation before the Houseâit lies in six pieces on the floors of six legal offices around the country at the moment. But I guarantee the minister that when it does get in here we will get in its way.</para>

<para>âIf ever we needed evidence of this governmentâs extreme ideology we found it in their attack on university student services. They have only just got the key to the car and they are out for their first spin and they want to knock over and kill whatever university services they possibly can. One of the first orders of business in what would have to be called âHoward unpluggedâ is that we now see this minister, the Minister for Education, Science and Training, and John Howard out there determined to destroy university services in this country. Never mind that virtually no-one in Australia supports this governmentâs legislation aimed at destroying university services, except maybeâand I think a few of you have come across them in your lives at universityâsome of those old university politicians now sitting on the other side of the House who want to settle a few old scores. They are the only people left in Australia who think this legislation should go ahead. Nobody else thinks it should. Nobody else wants this legislation to go ahead but this minister is determined to plough on.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Never mind that this is going to hurt students, their families and universities that are dependent on international students. Never mind all the people who are going to be hurt by this governmentâs legislation. Never mind all of that, because this government is determined to pursue this extraordinary ideological view that it has. What we have from this minister and this government is a determination to pursue their newfound power, this power that has gone immediately to their heads. Because of this rusted-on, blinded ideology they just cannot cope with the word âunionâ. As Dominic Knight said in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> last month:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">With John Howard on the warpath, the only union thatâs safe is the Australian Rugby Union.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is the only union that is safe from this ministerâand even at Sydney uni the rugby club is most animated about this legislation. They too do not want this to go through the parliament.</para>
<para>There are many within the governmentâs own ranks who are now recognising that this is an ideological obsession of this minister. As a Nationals senator said this week, it is âcomplete ideological zealotry by the Liberals with no semblance of reasonâ. That just about sums this minister up. Do the Liberals care that we are going to see vital student services disappear right across the countryâin regional, suburban and city universities? Of course they do not care. Do they care that universities will be hardest hit in regional campuses? Of course they do not care. They do not care for one minute that all of these very important services on our regional campuses are now under threat because of this ministerâs ideological zealotry.</para>
<para>It is not just university students who are speaking; some extraordinary Australian heroes from the sporting arena and some wonderful actors and actressesâthe fabulous Cate Blanchettâare out there saying, âDonât do it, Brendan. Donât take away these university services, because we need to make sure that they continue.â We have heard the response from the minister that really sums up his view of all this. Let us listen today to find out whether he will continue with some of the language he has used over the last few months. He has said that it is a âtotemicâ issue for him and the Liberal Party. He has used the terms âiconicâ, âan article of faithâ and âlongstanding philosophical beliefâ. It is his longstanding philosophical belief that we should get rid of university services. I really love this quote though: he said that trying to talk the Liberals out of user-pays university services âwould be like trying to talk The Nationals out of drought reliefâ. How insulting is that to all of those farmers who are suffering in drought stricken Australia? This has nothing to do with policy solutions; it is all to do with this ideological itch that the education minister is determined to scratch.</para>
<para>Submission after submission to the Senate inquiry, especially those from our universities, have listed the full range of services that are going to be affected. We have heard of the big campaigns that have been run to protect sporting facilities, cultural services, theatre and music on our university campuses but the services are much broader than that. At James Cook University at Townsville they have free intercampus bus services, welfare advice and counselling services. At the University of Southern Queensland there are free phone and fax services for distance education students. Flinders University subsidises child care and there are other services at Curtin Universityâand so the list goes on. I am sure the minister knows that he has picked a huge fight against all of these services, a fight he cannot win.</para>
<para>Even the ministerâs colleagues now seem to know we have a very extreme piece of legislation which reflects this ministerâs ideology. Another thing that this minister quietly puts around is that it is not really him who believes in this; it is the people on his back bench who are pushing him into it. Another reason I suspect he continues with this battle is that he has to present himself as a Liberal hardheadâas someone who really knows that he now has his Liberal credentials front and centre. He has left his Labor Party past behind him; he is a Liberal hardhead and he can continue with this ideological zealotry on behalf of the tiny number of Liberal backbenchers who care about this issue.</para>
<para>We know that the minister has a very ideologically confused past. He is very confused, so it is no wonder that he is determined to push ahead with this issue. But never a day goes by when we do not have another member of the coalition backbench coming out and opposing what the minister is trying to do. Just yesterday we had the Queensland Nationals member for Hinklerânot someone who speaks out a lot on these sorts of issuesâcoming out and saying, very sensibly:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">If you donât have some form of compulsory levy for the basic facilitiesâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I hope the minister heard the member for Hinkler, because he certainly did not look as though he had taken any notice of him in question time todayâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">for catering, the campus dentist, things like that ... itâs going to limit the quality of campus life for kids at those regional universities.</para>
</quote>
<para>Let us not forget that we had some extraordinary statements quite a long time ago from leaders who are now very senior people in the government. The Treasurer, most famously, back when he was at Monash University, said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The funding and ... provision of the various student services would be impossible unless there was some requirement to make some contribution towards them ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Just so we know that University of Sydneyâs rugby club continues to have an advocate here in the parliament, it was none other than the Minister for Human Services who, when he was at Sydney university, said that âcurrent sporting facilitiesâ would be âsold off and Sydney University Rugby Club would close downâ. That is what Joe Hockey thinks about Brendan Nelsonâs approach to this legislation. There are pretty serious implications for what is just ideological zealotry on the part of this minister. But there are only a handful of people now who cannot see that there is a way through.</para>
<para>Labor has put forward a very reasonable proposition to the parliament and we could not get a straight answer from the minister as to whether or not he would support our very practical proposition. Laborâs proposal would salvage the vast majority of university services that students currently rely on. But today in the parliament we saw that the minister has no intention of looking at the reasonable proposal that Labor has put forward. We got the same rant and rave that we usually get from the minister, even though Laborâs proposition directly addresses the concerns that the minister has put forward. We have made it plain that fees would be collected from university students and administered by the universities. The universities would then fund the full range of services that they think are important for studentsâwhether they are child care, welfare, sporting facilities, cultural services or whatever else is on the list.</para>
<para>We have made it very plain in our amendment that students would not have to belong to their student organisations. We think that should be a matter of choice for students. And that is the system currently operating in Western Australia and Victoriaâa system that was established after the previous Liberal government in Western Australia set out to destroy student organisations. As a result, the student organisation at Edith Cowan University went into liquidation. We will see more and more university campus services go into liquidation if this ministerâs legislation gets through the parliament.</para>
<para>We want to make sure that all of these vital campus services continue. That is what our amendment is about. We want to make sure that students have the choice to join their student organisations if they want toâand, of course, if they do not want to, they do not have to. Our proposal is practical and reasonable. If this minister were not the ideological zealot he sets himself up to be, he would take it as a reasonable proposition. But, no, he has made it quite clear in the parliament today that he does not intend to do that.</para>
<para>Instead, it is blatantly obviousâbecause he refused to answer the member for Parramattaâs questionâthat theÂ  minister is considering a slush fund of grants for regional campuses to prop up some services. That would be typical of this minister. But this one really does take the cake. And we know that this minister is subject to extraordinary whims. I say to members of the National Party: do not be bought off by this. This minister may decide to support a cricket pitch here or there but not to support some other service which, for whatever reason, he decides he does not like the look of. We know what sort of minister he is. We know there will not be any long-term commitment to student services from this minister. So I certainly hope that National Party senators will stick up for university services and support Laborâs very reasonable proposition which will ensure that taxpayers do not pick up the tab.</para>
<para>The idea of taxpayers picking up the tab through a regional slush fund did not get much of a reception from some of the Liberal backbench, so the minister is getting it every which way. Every time some proposition is put forward, he is informed that he needs to come back to the sort of reasonable proposition that Labor has put forwardâwhich, I am pleased to say, the member for Hinkler has supported. New Senator Barnaby Joyce has proposed that there be an amenities levy so that student services can continue. It is time the minister took off his ideological straitjacket and recognised that student services have to be above his blind ambition to be represented as a true liberal. It is time for that to be put to one side, Minister. It is time to protect student services and to see reason. It is time for the minister to make sure services on our university campuses are protected.</para>
<para>We do not think it is reasonable for students to be told by this minister that they will have to pay every time they want to use a service on our university campuses. Students will not be able to afford to do so. They do not have the money to pay $600-odd just to join the gym at the University of Sydney. It is more than likely they might also want to use child care or join one of the clubs or societies. The ministerâs approach is that you can pay to go to the gym, you can pay for child care, you can pay to belong to the chess club and you can pay to belong to the debating clubâor maybe he does not believe in those sorts of clubs and societies; it is very hard to know. But we do know it is time for this ideology to end and for uni services to be protected. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âA very important principle is being debated hereâand I use the term âdebatedâ loosely. The principle is that students who enrol at university to gain an education should be free in the 21st century to make a decision as to whether or not they will join the student union, guild or association. They also need to be free to use their money, which they have worked hard for, to choose which services they will purchase and which services they will not. The current arrangements today are that every student who seeks to enrol at a university to get an education is required to pay a flat tax which is called a student union fee. Students who come from the poorest families in the country pay exactly the same as those who come from the wealthiest families. Distance education students never even set foot on a campus. There are 4Â½ thousand of them at Charles Sturt University and they never set foot on a campus. They are forced to pay $136 a year, and, if they do not, they will not be enrolled.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This is the third occasion on which this government has introduced this legislation. In fact, when the parliament was prorogued last year for the election, this legislation was in the parliament. Every Liberal Party and National Party candidate stood at last yearâs election on a platform of introducing this policy. It is fairly clear that Australians made a decision about whom they want to govern their country. The <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper, editorialising on this issue, today said:</para>
<quote>
<para>There are several clear principles involved here. The first is that nobody should he forced to belong to any union. The second is that, in the modern university, with its army of part-time and distance students, facilities such as gymnasiums and cafeterias are used by a minority: the majority should not be forced to pay their freight. And third, students are grown-ups and perfectly capable of choosing what they wish to spend their money on.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">A lot has been said about the potential impacts of this legislation when it is enacted. For example, when it was introduced in Western Australia in 1994, the services that were provided at universities continued. The universities were required to make structural changes in order to adjust to it. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition just told us that the university student guild at Edith Cowan University went into receivership. Yes, it did but not because of VSU. It went into receivership because the member for Fremantle and the then Premier of Western Australia, Brian Burke, had set up the Western Womenâs Bank and the poor students who had forcibly paid the student union fee had their money go down the drain hole through the Western Womenâs Bank.</para>
<para>The other point which is often made in this debate is that in some way giving Australian students choice as to whether or not they will join a union will have an adverse impact on international students. The first thing to say is that the experience in Western Australia was that we had 10 per cent year on year nominal growth in international students for each of the four years after the introduction of voluntary student unionism. The second point that I would make in relation to that is that last year Australian universities earned $1.7 billion directly in fees from educating 156,000 international university students. Surely it is possible for them to find just some of that money to provide the services that they are required to provide to those international students. I would be most concerned if Australian students, forced to pay these union fees, are subsidising services for international students.</para>
<para>The next point that I would like to make concerns the Deputy Leader of the Oppositionâs mention of the Sydney University Rugby Clubâindeed an institution not only at the university but also in rugby union throughout the country. Could I point out to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition two things. The first is that the University of Sydney has net assets of $2.6 billion. In the last accounts that were published it had an operating result of $44 million and it had revenues approaching $900 million. The University of Sydney has $921 million in cash and investments, which increased by $83 million last year alone. And the Labor Party people and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition are trying to tell me that a young personâa young woman who comes from Dubbo or western New South Wales, who enrols to study nursing or science or artsâ</para>

<para>âat the University of Sydney should subsidise people who want to play rugby or go abseiling! What kind of country are we living in in the 21st century when the poorest people who turn up at the University of Sydney to get an education are forced to pay $590 up frontâeither you pay it or you are not inâto subsidise people who want to play a variety of sports or participate in cultural, political and other activities? We on this side of the House believe that students should be encouraged to join and participate and pay their money to support a whole variety of services on campus but under no circumstances should they be forced to.</para>

<para>I come to the other point that I would make in relation to the University of Sydney. The student who pays those hard-earned union fees goes to the Manning refectory and pays $2 for a subsidised sausage.</para>

<para>âwhen the proprietor asks them if they are a student it goes to $1.30. So why does a student have no choice but to pay the compulsory union fee for a subsidised service that is more expensive than what they get in the normal world? I would also like to point out to those who are opposed to this that perhaps the best evidence of what is going to happen when this legislation is introduced comes from none other than the Vice-Chancellor of Monash University, Professor Richard Larkins. On 18 July this year Professor Larkins circulated the following email to all of his staff and students, which said in part:</para>

<para>âThe next point that needs to be made is that it is often saidâand it has just been said by the member oppositeâthat all of these services are cheaper. It is asserted that one of the these services is child care. I received a letter on 31 May from the member for Sydney which read in part:</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<quote>
<para>Dear Minister,</para>
<para>I am writing on behalf of several of my constituents who will have their child-care services affected by your proposed VSU legislation. The Magic Pudding is a child-care centre in my electorate located at the University of Technology of Sydney. The UTS union currently provides a grant of $90,000 per annum to the centre. These funds are used to provide a $9.45 per day subsidy for students and a $3.15 subsidy per day for staff.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Let me repeat that: the 14,000 students at UTS are compulsorily paying $420 up front to subsidise child care at The Magic Puddingâappropriately entitled for Labor people. They are forced to pay that to not only subsidise child care for those students who choose to use The Magic Pudding but also to subsidise staff. I might also point out to the members opposite that, should this legislation be passed, if a student at UTS were to use child care every day for the 28 academic weeks of the year, while keeping in mind that at the moment they have to pay $420 up front, they would be $124 better off by the time they have paid for their child care. But there is more: the cost to a UTS student for the subsidised child care at The Magic Pudding is $56 a day. In fact, if you go to the Inner City Child Care Centre, just around the corner in Ultimo, you find there is no student union subsidy and you pay $56 a day. Why is that? Why do you pay exactly the same amount for an unsubsidised service as you pay for the service at university, which is subsidised by the compulsory tax everybody else is paying? But if you then go to the Darling Harbour Long Day Care and Occasional Centre you will pay $50 a day.</para>
<para>I might also point out that in 2003 the University of New South Wales did a study of child care in Australian universitiesâvery interesting reading. At Sydney university there are six child-care services and three of them are subsidised by the student union. For example, if you go to Laurel Tree House, which is subsidised by the union, you pay $56.20 a day. But if you go to the Melanie Alexander Nursery School, which is not subsidised by the union, you pay $51 a day. In other words, the sausage roll, the child care and a whole range of services on campus confirm what any sane and educated student knows: they are subsidising a very dark and black economic science. I table the UNSW study.</para>
<para>A lot has been said about VSU and its impact on students. The reason there is so much opposition to this is that, when it is introduced and implemented, there will be a referendum. When students enrol in January and February next year in Australian universities there will be a referendum. For the first time in half a century, students who go to university will be given a choice, and the universities will have to get off their collective backsides and actually work at explaining to students why they should join clubs, societies, unions, guilds and associations and why they should be supported. I advise the House and the universities that I am very happy to work with universities and provide funding from existing programs to support them in developing marketing strategies to encourage membership of all of these organisations. We will also provide assistance for universities to adjust their financial arrangements in an environment where they are actually going to have to think about encouraging students in the 21st century to take up the benefits that are purported to be there through student membership and participation in all of these clubs.</para>
<para>Many things have been said, but I have the privilege to be this countryâs Minister for Education, Science and Training. I get a lot of mail and I end up reading pretty much all of it. I would like to read to the House a typical letter that I received. A lot of people in the gallery today have never seen the inside of a university. Their taxes pay for what goes on inside them and they do not resent that in any way, shape or form, but one thing their children want is choice. They do not want to be told they have to pay for something they do not want and may not need. Here is a typical letter:</para>
<quote>
<para>I also write as a concerned parent of a daughter who is doing her nursing degree at the University of Western Sydney. As a single parent pensioner with two children and a mortgage left by an adulterous husband she is finding the going pretty tough. However, always wanting to be a nurse from way back she took the opportunity. When enrolling this year she was asked for more than a $300 student union fee. When she objected due to lack of money she was told she would not get her exam results or be able to do her clinical training. Reluctantly she paid, although the benefits seemed very minimal. She canât even use the library books as they are too far out of date. It turned out that in the six universities in Sydney 3,000 students couldnât or wouldnât pay. They received notification if they did not pay their $300 plus, a $100 fine would be levied and they would be disenrolled from the university. This seems monstrous and I would like to know how a student union can dictate to the university.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The reason they can do it is that for a long period the Australian Labor Party has clung to this notion that every single student, irrespective of their circumstances, should pay a compulsory up-front fee. This government is determined to change it. It is time that there was choice.</para>
<para>In terms of financial management, let us not forget that, under the current arrangements in Australian universities, Melbourne universityâs student union went into receivershipâ$43 million was misappropriated and mismanaged there. There is a whole stack of stories about liquidators sacking the chief of the insolvent union at Melbourne university. That was $43 million down the drainpipe. Another troubled student union was wound up. There was theÂ  awarding of contracts without appropriate approval and falsification of records. There were conflicts of interest, universities were accused of misusing funds, there was a student protest bill of $11,000 and there were trashed public offices. And on it goes. As the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> says, in this country it is time that everyday Australian students have a choice. We will deliver that. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âIt is hard for me to say that I am pleased to second the matter of public importance put forward by the shadow minister for education, because there is little to be pleased about in the governmentâs attacks on student services. It also means that I have had to sit in silenceâsomething that is difficult for me to doâand listen to the nonsense spouted by the Minister for Education, Science and Training. The governmentâs ideological preoccupation with abolishing compulsory up-front student union fees is nothing more than an unhealthy obsessionâan obsession with destroying student organisations; an obsession with destroying any organisation that has dared to speak out against this government. It is an abuse of government power and shows how little the government respects students and the services that help to support them through university.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It shows just how desperate this minister is to get himself noticed amongst all the other Liberal leadership aspirants on the other side of the House. But I like to think of it, as our leader most aptly described it, as being a case of revenge of the nerdsâthe nerds fighting lost battles of 20 or 30 years ago. The reality of the governmentâs attacks on student services is that they are paybackânothing more than that. They are payback for students running a campaign against the governmentâs HECS fee hike, payback for the students campaign against Howardâs broken promise of no $100,000 university degrees and payback for the ministerâs own early political aspirations, so cruelly squashed within Labor student politics.</para>
<para>Australian people involved in the higher education system will be quick to tell you that this government has absolutely lost the plot, and students are paying the price. Students are now facing an inexcusable increase in HECS fees of over 25 per cent and we are now seeing full fee-paying courses costing over $200,000âsomething this minister mockingly claimed we would never see happen in this country. He is strangely silent about that now.</para>
<para>The attack on student services is no more starkly apparent that on our regional campuses. The University of Ballarat in my electorate greatly contributes to enhancing the social fabric of the Ballarat community. A large number of students who attend the university come from low socioeconomic backgrounds and rely heavily on services at the university such as child care, subsidised eating facilities and employment placement to make ends meet. These services are provided by the Ballarat university student association.</para>
<para>Additional services provided such as tax help, assistance for clubs and societies and provision of recreation and sporting options combine to assist students to relieve stress, help students more fully benefit from their educational experience and, more importantly, help reduce drop-out rates. Regional campuses are tightly woven into the surrounding community and have a large emphasis on supporting their local community. One of the key ways this is done is through nurturing students with their social and welfare needs. Students face a number of challenges when studying, and common challenges are social isolation from their normal support networks, particularly in regional universities. They face isolation from families and friends. When students fail a grade, where do they turn? They turn to university student associations to help provide advocacy and to navigate their way through complex university structures. Without this advocacy, students will drop out and not complete their studies.</para>
<para>How can the government be so out of touch with reality that they do not see the need for student associations at regional universities? Regional campus student organisations have no desire to be a political force. In fact, in the history of the University of Ballarat I have never seen our student association act as one. But I can tell you what you have managed to do, Minister; you have managed to politicise our student association. They want to fight with you over this issue. They now want to fight with you over VSU. They have never been a political force before, but you have now managed to make them exactly that. In many cases, it has been the first time that many student organisations have ever actively engaged in anything vaguely looking like a political campaign. I tell you what: they sure are in for a fight now. Student associations exist as a representative body for the students at the university and do this by providing services and support that enhance the entire university experience of students.</para>
<para>Regional universities such as mine also prosper as a result of the large emphasis on clubs and societies and sporting involvement. Over 40 per centâapproximately 2,060 out of the 5,500âof students at the University of Ballarat are involved in sporting and non-sporting clubs. Over 10 per centâapproximately 550 of that numberâhave taken advantage of subsided gym memberships. This involvement opens up opportunities for students to overcome isolation which subsequently results in a greater quality of academic life. The governmentâs ideological obsession jeopardises this interaction within the student body. Students need the support and other services that student organisations provide. But once again the Howard government is out of touch and believes students can afford user-pays servicesâon top of their massive HECS debts, on top of their study costs, on top of paying rent and on top of paying for food and other essential living expenses.</para>
<para>What will students lose as a result of this governmentâs ideological obsession and attack on student associations? To provide a snapshot, I need to look no further than my own university. The students at the University of Ballarat will lose subsidised gym memberships, which currently cost around $102 a year but the cost under this legislation would be $369 a year; attendance at university games, which currently cost $600 but under VSU would be $1,000; subsidised creche facilities; free student diaries; employment placement services; help in finding accommodation, which is a very difficult thing to do in Ballarat; clubs and societies; and activities and social events.</para>
<para>The government has increased university fees but does not adequately support students with their living or study costs. Now the Howard government is taking away the ability of students to socially interact with others at university through sport and recreation, and it is taking away the ability of students to have the support of other student services. Labor have proposed a way out for the government. Bailing the minister out of his own mess is not something we often like to do, but we thought we would provide some options for him. We have suggested that he should be able to allow student organisations to preserve child care, counselling services, sporting fields, gymnasiums and the representation provided by student associations, but the government seems set to press ahead. Now we are hearing that maybe it is wavering a bit in saying that it might provide a National Party slush fund. That might benefit a regional university like mine, but in my electorate students from Bacchus Marsh, which is still a rural area, go to VUT. How is it fair that students in Bacchus Marsh who go to VUT would still not be able to access student services, but if the same students living in Bacchus Marsh went to the University of Ballarat they would? It is complete and utter nonsense. You need to be very careful when you are negotiating a slush fund of what the impact will be on rural students such as those who live in rural areas on the outer fringes of metropolitan Melbourne, like Bacchus Marsh.</para>
<para>The university will still exist if this legislation goes through, but what is proposed will kill the social fabric of university life. The university will still exist, but at what cost? The possibility of enhanced retention rates will be a thing of the past; taking part in lunchtime activities will be a thing of the past; attending Australian university games will be a thing of the past; and the ability to seek assistance from student services will be a thing of the past. At what cost? It will be at the cost of the governmentâs ideological obsession.</para>
<para>The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee has said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... the Bill in its current form will place in jeopardy the services and amenities essential to university campuses and surrounding communities, and the thousands of jobs funded by the student services and amenities charge ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Fifteen jobs at the University of Ballarat alone are at risk because of this governmentâs ideological obsession. Why will the government listen to the vice-chancellors when it suits their agenda but refuse to be swayed by them when it does not? As my colleague the member for Lyons so aptly growls each question time, it is because of arrogance.</para>
<para>We have also recently seen almost 200 submissions to the Senate committee, and out of those 200 submissions it is very hard to find anyone who is in support of these changes. Students are clearly saying that they do not want this, and vice-chancellors are saying that they do not want this. The only people saying that they want this are the government, and even they are not singing from the same song sheet. Besides this blinded government, is anybody in Australia supportive of these inappropriate changes? Even members of the governmentâs coalition see how stupid these changes areâand they are stupid changes; it is the only way to describe them. It is not just some Nationals who have developed a bit of backbone on this issue; members of the Liberal Party itself are now telling you, Minister, that you have got this wrong.</para>
<para>Senator Alan Eggleston, the Liberal senator from Western Australia, put his finger on it exactly. Some of the ideologues in the Liberal Party are misusing the words âstudent unionismâ, failing to recognise their historic connection with Oxford debating societies. You have been obsessed with the notion of unions and crushing unions. That is what you have really been focused on in this legislation. Of course, if students do not want to belong to their student union at the moment, they do not have to. I think the government has really gone on this ideological rampage against student associations, against student unions, because of the name âstudent unionâ. This complete ideological zealotry by this minister has to end. You need to back down and look at sensible solutions to continue to provide student services. You have some proposals on the table, so have some backbone and have some courage to come into this place and change your mind on this issue. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThere was a time when all universities were sandstone and all university students were full-time undergraduate students. People studied at universities in their own state. They lived at home or they lived at residential colleges. But what happened in Australia? We saw a great expansion of universities under the Liberal Menzies government in the 1950s and the 1960s. Universities like the University of New South Wales and Monash University were establishedâand Flinders University, in my electorate of Boothby.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>If we look at the way higher education has changed over 20, 30 or 40 years, what do we find now? There are more students than ever before who are studying part time. There are more students who are re-entering higher education or entering for the first time after a period in the work force. There are more students studying externally. Deakin University in Geelong is a very large provider of external student services. Over the last 20 years we have seen a dramatic increase in the numbers of overseas students studying in Australia. For students in many countries in South-East Asia and for students in India, we are either No. 1 or No. 2 in terms of their preferred destination.</para>
<para>The problem is that the idea of a compulsory union fee dates back to the days when all students were undergraduates, when they were full time and when their life was primarily on campus. This does not cater for someone who is studying part time after work. The last thing they will want to do is get involved in clubs, societies, sporting clubs and so on. They should at least have a choice. Someone who has a family may not necessarily want to get involved in the whole range of extracurricular activities that are offered. You can come into parliament and wave around any number of surveys about what students actually want, but I believe most students want a choice and that is why the Labor Party is afraid of this. That is why the student unions themselves believe that next year people will not take up the student union option.</para>
<para>We have seen some movement on the issue, and I was quite encouraged when I heard that the Labor Party was supporting VSU. Then I looked at all the services that it would like protected. The list covers basically the full range of services. It is essentially the status quo.</para>
<para>Under voluntary student unionism there is the opportunity to bundle services. For example, people could get a package which would allow them to access sporting services. If they want to, people will be able to get a package where they can subscribe to the student association services, if that is what they want. They can get a package for club and society membership. There is a whole range of ways in which the unions can deliver these services. But it will be up to the unions to be more entrepreneurial and to look at how they are going to offer the services.</para>
<para>In March 2006, when the university year begins, students will still have the same amount of money in their pockets. They will have exactly the same amount of money in their pockets under voluntary student unionism. But, if the legislation is passed, they will have a choice about where they spend it. They will have a choice. If they want to take out a full union membership, they will have a choice. If they want to take out sporting memberships, they can actually go directly to the sporting club and take out membership there. Many of these clubs have a rate for a union member and a rate for a non-union member. There will still be the opportunity to take part in the same activities that they want to take part in.</para>
<para>The member for Casey, a colleague, a good friend and a long-time campaigner on this issue, gave a speech on this issue to Liberal students, followed by an opinion article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>. He said of 18-year-old students:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Students can be entrusted with buying every possible good or service in the global economy, with one exception: a student union membership.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I sometimes wonder why there is so much passion about this debate. I cannot remember exactly who it was, but someone once said that the reason student politics is so vicious is that there is absolutely nothing at stake. But this comes down to two very fundamentally different views of the world, on the government side and on the opposition side. We believe very strongly that individuals should have the freedom to choose. We believe that choice is important. People on the other side would like to see everything organisedâto see things directed. They would like students to have no choice and to just have to pay a fee.</para>
<para>Let us look at the sorts of things university services fund. One area is clubs and societies. A well-known lurk used to beâand it probably occurs nowâthat at university you formed your own club, your own society, and signed up as many people as you possibly could. Then you would get a grant from the university union. In one year, a number of my friends formed the âDays of Our Lives Societyâ. The idea was to get as many members as they possibly could; then they would be able to hold a party, get a grant and put on a keg. They got 600 members. It was the largest club on campus. The next year it was the Chocolate Appreciation Society. âSign up, pay $2, and, if we get enough members, weâll get a very large grant from the university union. Weâll have a party and provide as much chocolate as we can possibly provide.â When I was at university, I was lucky enough to be vice-president and president of the medical students society. It was a great society. It had a long tradition. We had a ball; we had a dinner; we had all sorts of functions. We were basically autonomous and self-reliant.</para>

<para>âThe great thing was that the left-wingers in the students association said: âYouâre holding a function. Send us an application. We would like to give you some money.â The way the Left sees the world is just different to the way this side of parliament sees the world.

<para>Sporting clubs are a very important issue. There is a great tradition of university sport in this country. When we actually have a look at the finances of the different sporting clubs, what we find is that the amount of money that they receive from university unions is very small. Clubs I am familiar with, which have turnovers of $100,000, receive in the order of $7,000 from their university unions. These clubs will be fine in a voluntary student unionism environment.</para>
<para>We have seen an enormous increase in the number of overseas students coming to Australia. That is increasing year on year. Yet what we see with overseas students is that higher education providers are required to provide many of the services for them anyway, so they should be fine.</para>
<para>When we actually have a look at how a student fee is distributed, of the $297 student fee of Adelaide universityâs union, the amount that goes to the sports association and the grounds is about $50âout of a $300 fee. The amount that goes to the students association is $41 of a $300 fee. My point is that students should be able to decide which services they actually want. We have heard a bit about the experience in Western Australia. About 30 to 35 per cent of students chose to join.</para>
<para>Child care, is actually subsidised by the Commonwealth government. We provide subsidies for people through the child-care benefit. At the University of Adelaide, 58 per cent of the child-care places are actually taken by staff. In my own electorate, there is a child-care centre on the Waite campus, which is principally a research facility. These places are not taken up by undergraduate students; they are actually taken up by full-time workers.</para>
<para>Lastly, in closing, we have heard a lot about all the student services that will go. One thing that we never hear defended is the money that is being spent by the National Union of Students in federal election campaignsâ$250,000 in last yearâs federal election campaign. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âIn fact, the minister headed up that union movement. To come in here and suggest that people have the right to choose, that this is about freedom of choice and associationâand the removal of freedom of choice and association for many people, although I will not get into that debate here todayâwhen you come from that background, indicates, to me at least, some degree of hypocrisy.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I do not believe the minister believes in what the government is attempting to do. In fact, prior to the election, towards the end of last yearâand after the election, into about JanuaryâI think the minister was trying to develop a plan not all that dissimilar to what Senator Joyce and others are trying to do in the Senate at the moment. He was then run over by the bus. That was the bus that said: âThis is the year of industrial relations. This is the year of being against unions. This has the word âunionâ in it. This is what weâre going to do.â</para>
<para>The minister is fully aware, as are the shadow minister and others in this House, of an amendment that I proposed on the second last day of parliament before the winter recess. I will be introducing that. I am pleased to see the Labor Party has a somewhat similar amendment. I think there are others of all persuasions in other places who are looking at trying to achieve the same goal. If the objective of the government is to remove the capacity to use some money from a student fee for political purposes, there are other ways of doing that. That can be done without going down this draconian track. There will be amendments before the parliament to do exactly that: to fund all the other functions of the university associations, guilds, unions and whatever you want to call themâand I think there are something like 49 at the University of New Englandâand not the political activities of a few. Personally, I would be quite happy to see that happen, because the Liberal Club at the University of New England has been an absolute disgrace. So I do not have a problem with that, and I do not think most people do.</para>
<para>I think there is a general acceptance within the parliament that there has been some useâminute as it may beâof the general fee for the political activities of a few. So the amendments that will be coming before the parliamentâwhich I would urge the minister to consider and give the tick toâdo have the capacity to remove that from the process and then to embrace all the other issues where you do need a pool of money. You never know whether your son or daughterâor grandson or granddaughter, in your case, Mr Deputy Speakerâwill need some accommodation advice, some welfare advice, some sporting advice, some legal advice or some international student advice. They may well need that.</para>
<para>That is not to suggest that they are all going to be trundling in those doors immediately on the first day they get to university. But they may need some form of help. If those doors are not there to go through, to suggest, as the minister does, that they will go back to that piggybank of $370 that they would require for a year at the University of New Englandâthat they will have it sitting over there for when they need a game of football or some sort of welfare advice or some assistanceâand that they will be able to access that money is laughable. That will not be the case at all. The economic impact on the universitiesâand on international students aloneâif we remove the student union activities other than the political ones is going to be incredibly significant. This change will have an impact particularly on regional universities but also on all universities. To suggest, as has been suggested by the two speakers previously, that thisâthe provision of sporting activities, the provision of jobs, the provision of advice and servicesâwill not have an impact on the University of New England is an insult to those people.</para>
<para>I am proud to stand here today and represent the views of those people at that university. I congratulate them for the work that they have put in, in a serious effortânot a political effortâto put some sanity into this debate. I congratulate the new Senator Barnaby Joyce, another ex-student of that same university, which I attended and my son attended, for standing up for that university and for understanding what it means. He was not a political activist at university and I was not, so we can understand the government maybe even suggesting that some of those activities should not be funded. But there are other activities that do need to be funded.</para>
<para>Until January the minister was serious about looking at ways and means of funding those activities that would not be funded through the general fee that currently stands. That has been railroaded over the last few months. Now we have got back to throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Everything goes with the bathwater. The people who will be most penalised by this will be the regional universities that do not have the choice that a lot of other urban communities have. But it will not only be the regional universities.</para>
<para>They have a piecemeal arrangementâand I agree with the shadow ministerâwhere the minister can have some sort of regional partnerships process of choosing winners: where do they live, who are they, who is the member? This sort of rationale in terms of the allocation of funds is a nonsense. The process that is there at the moment works. The surveys that I have seen of the student bodies and the information that has been relayed to me over a period of time indicate that the students, their parents and their communitiesâthe Armidale community, for instance, and the broader community of New England and the north-westâare watching this very closely, because it can have an impact on the welfare of their kids, their students, at their university and any other university they may choose to go to. It is those impacts that I am concerned about.</para>
<para>This is a parliament. The people who feel strongest about this have left their minds at university. They are still fighting these old trench warfare issues that they fought at university. I think it is an indictment of them as individuals that they have to take themselves back to their student days and beat up the Left or whoever else they did not particularly like then and see this as a major victoryâthat, 20 or 30 years on, they will be able to say, âWeâve had a major victory over those dreadful people who did those dreadful things at university against us when they were funded by the general fee to have their placards et cetera.â</para>
<para>In conclusion, I urge you, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, and others from regional communities to look at what is happening here. I urge you to support my amendmentâwhich I still intend to introduce, even though the Labor Party has a similar one nowâwhich supports the services that are required at all universities and removes the capacity for some of the general fee to be hived off into direct political activities. I ask the minister: rethink this. Travel back in your own mind about 12 months and think about the issues that were out there then, and listen to the Barnaby Joyces. If you, Minister, and your fellow speaker believe that people have the right to choose, those within the National Party should be at complete liberty to choose to support the people that they represent in the country and vote against the governmentâs move. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>That, in accordance with the provisions of the <inline font-style="italic">Public Works Committee Act 1969</inline>, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Fitout of new leased premises for AusAID at Block 20, Section 10, known as London 11, ACT.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">The Australian Agency for International Development, AusAID, proposes to fit out new leased premises in Civic in the Australian Capital Territory. The need for the new facility has been driven by the approaching expiry, in July 2007, of the current lease at 62 Northbourne Avenue and the numerous shortcomings of the existing premises.</para>
<para>The proposed building will provide approximately 9,000 square metres of lettable office space over six floors. The large floor plates will provide flexibilities and superior efficiencies. The building will be A-grade quality with leading-edge design and superior finishes. It will include many environmental initiatives, such as the use of low-embodied energy materials, the use of natural light distribution through the design of the building, very high efficiency lighting systems with individual photoelectric sensors, and waste water recycling. The provision of 120 car-parking spaces will be accommodated via two secure basement subfloors. A parents-carers room and staff amenities will be located within the building.</para>
<para>The proposed fit-out is estimated to cost $9.5 million. The developer is expected to commence construction of the building in January next year, and, subject to parliamentary approval, the proposed fit-out will be undertaken concurrently with the base building construction. Both are due for completion in May 2007. AusAID expects to occupy the building in June or July 2007. I commend the motion to the House.</para>

<para>âI am very grateful to the Assistant Treasurer for being available to answer some more questions that we have on the <inline ref="R2405">Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 4) Bill 2005</inline>. My next question is about parents whose children are cared for by services that are not approved child-care providers.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Assistant Treasurer said in his earlier response that it was an insurmountable problem because, if parents who had their kids in preschool got any help from the federal government, the state governments would stop helping them. I would like to ask him, first of all, what consideration was given to other services which are not approved care. For example, there are many families that make arrangements with neighbours, friends or grandparentsâand pay themâand are eligible, through that arrangement, for child-care benefit for registered child care. Do we know how many parents would be in such a situation? How many parents are receiving child-care benefit for registered care but will miss out, in any case, on this 30 per cent tax offset?</para>
<para>I also want to ask the Assistant Treasurer how he justifies that parents who are sending their children to preschool because there is no other approved child-care provider in the areaâsuch as in the Kangaroo Valley in New South Walesâmay be paying $20 or $30 a day for their children to attend preschool, but, simply because of an anomaly in the difference between state and federal funding for preschools, these parents will miss out on the help that the government in the election campaign promised all parents. I think it is fair to say that there was no distinction made during the election campaign and, in further discussion of this measure, it was not clear to parents. I have been contacted by many parents of preschool children who are very surprised indeed that they will not be eligible for this 30 per cent rebate.</para>

<para>âI will deal with that particular issue. We made a very clear distinction here between approved child care and that which is not approved. My recollection is that the Prime Minister did make reference to approved child care during the election campaign. Registered child care can provide for people such as grandparents et cetera or informal care in the form of people who have registered at the Family Assistance Officeânannies and the like. When you start drawing up legislation of the âwhoâs in and whoâs outâ type, you are going to find yourself challenged as to when an individual is being utilised for other than what their intended purpose was. Everybody understands what approved child care is. It is well contained and, therefore, we felt that this was the best way in which to ensure that this targeted and worthwhile initiative was directed at those who could be readily identified and could provide the best assistance to the individuals concerned.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I reiterate that preschool funding is the responsibility of the states and, as such, if a state government requires fees to be charged for children, that is something that quite rightly should be taken up at the state level, particularly with our moving to a uniform school starting age. I do not believe that is part of this debate, but perhaps it is being extended into this debate by way of trying to rectify a wrong being conducted in some state jurisdictions.</para>

<para>âI would like to clarify that last point. There are also kindergartens, private creches, private kindergartens, Montessori preschools and a number of other different sorts of preschools that are run not by state governments but by not-for-profit organisations or private schools.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I want to go to the issue of some private child-care providers offering $4,000 lines of credit to parents who may or may not be eligible for the tax offset or who may or may not be eligible for only part of the tax offset. These $4,000 lines of credit have an eight per cent penalty for parents who do not repay by the September immediately following the financial year in which the debt is raised. So parents who took that up in the last financial year would be facing a debt in September this year. Parents who take it up this year will be facing a debt in September next year. Those same parents, of course, will not see any money from the rebate for up to 2Â½ years after they have paid out the money to the child-care centre. Does the government have any concerns about parents taking on this debt in order to pay for child care? Would the Assistant Treasurer, using the wisdom that his office confers on him, advise parents to take on such a debt? Does the Assistant Treasurer have any concern about the value to the taxpayer of the 30 per cent rebate measure, given that multimillionaire Eddie Groves, the major shareholder of ABC child care, the largest private child-care provider, was boasting last week to the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> about offering loans in anticipation of parents getting the rebate. He said:</para>

<para>âI do not intend to go to particular comments made by businesspeople, suffice to say that any family that receives money from any form of borrowings, whether from a financial institution or from a week-to-week loan organisationâthe payday loan sort of crowdâshould be aware that they are entering into a private financial arrangement. They should avail themselves of the information that is available, they should protect themselves and they should do that with their eyes open.</para>

<para>This has nothing to do with this debate per se. This debate is about the federal government providing direct assistance to help over 600,000 Australian families with their child care. As to arrangements about what debts families take on, whilst the government is concerned about the macroeconomic policies that allow people to service debts, we are not going to get into micromanaging individual arrangements that people may enter into, whether they be through those that have been mentioned or through any other financial institution.</para>

<para>âCan the Assistant Treasurer tell us how many parents are likely to hit the $4,000 cap, both in this financial year and in the next financial year? The opposition asked Treasury officials at estimates hearings in February. They said that they had analysed the numbers and that they would take the question on notice, but we have not received any information back. We would like to know how many parents are likely to hit the cap. Is it not the case that someone who is paying $65 a day, five days a week for 48 weeks a year will hit the cap? Is it not also the case that there are a great number of parents who pay a lot more than $65 a day, particularly in capital cities, and that they often have children in care for more than 48 weeks in the year?</para>

<para>âI simply cannot answer the question directly. We have modelled that about 600,000 families will be assisted by this measure. How many will hit the cap and how many will fall below is not clear at the moment. The total expenditure will be in the order of a billion dollars over four years.</para>

<para>âI want to bring the Assistant Treasurer back to another issue raised in the debate today, to which he has not yet respondedâthat is, why the modelling for the cost of this measure has not been amended subsequent to the government announcing its welfare to work changes. These changes are estimated to bring another 109,000 people into the work force, many of whom are sole parents, many of whom have school age children or younger than school age children and many of whom have more than one child. Can the Assistant Treasurer tell us, firstly, why this will not cost more if there are more parents in the work force? Secondly, can the Assistant Treasurer confirm that the measure does absolutely nothing to increase child-care places for parents who want to move from welfare to work but who cannot because they cannot get child care?</para>

<para>âAs I outlined in my closing address to the main debate, since 1996 the federal government has increased the number of child-care places from about 306,000 to 600,000. That is a massive increase in a period of some nine years. That includes family day care, in-home care, outside school hours care and long day care places. In that combination, places have almost doubled from 306,000 to 600,000 places.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The welfare to work program encourages parents back into the work force once their youngest child is at school age. There are additional places as part of that package. That is part of what was outlined here from the 2004-05 budget and again as part of the $266 million child-care package in the 2005-06 budget. All of those things are aimed at having not only the environment for work but also the facilities so that people can get into work. This particular measure is about making child care more affordable, as opposed to there being more places. But it is not a policy that is operated in isolation; it is in with those other policies that have been outlined in the budget speech.</para>

<para>âThe Assistant Treasurer will be pleased to know I only have a couple of questions. My first follows on from the question of the member for Sydney to the minister about the difference between approved care and registered care with the child-care benefit and the child-care tax rebate. The ministerâs response was mainly to do with preschool and creche. I am also interested in why there is this difference, particularly with family care. I understand that grandparents who give care are eligible for the child-care benefit but not eligible for the child-care tax rebate. I would appreciate the minister explaining the reasons for that difference.</para>

<para>âWe did cover this in some detail before, and not just the preschool situation. The government decided to use understood and approved parameters to define âapproved careâ, and there are safeguards in place as well. It took this decision so that, in the range of child-care provisions that are available to eligible Australian families, people would know what is in and what is out.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>One of the things that the opposition raised earlier in the debate was the issue of nanniesâthat perhaps wealthy parents are going to be able to hire nannies. That is informal care, which could be registered. So what do we do? Do we pluck out that one and say, âYes, this oneâs registered, therefore they are okay, but we are drawing them out and this oneâs inâ? That would just make it messier and more complex, and we think this is the best compromise.</para>

<para>âMy next question is about the differenceâthe mismatch, as I am calling itâbetween the tax year in which the child-care expense is incurred or met and the tax year in which the rebate is claimed. I am thinking of the situation where the income of a family or a parent might well be taxable in the first year when the child is in care but in the next yearâand the next year is the year in which the rebate is offset against any taxâthat parent may have a different income. They may have a lower income for all sorts of reasonsâperhaps a new baby in the family, loss of a job or whatever.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I understand that, if a parent does not have enough tax assessed to cover the rebate, that rebate can be passed on to a spouse. However, there may well be a situation where the household is not able to take full advantage of that rebate in the year in which the rebate is claimed, but had they been able to claim that rebate in the year in which the child-care costs were incurred that rebate would have been a much bigger benefit. I wonder if the minister would consider steps to make sure a household does not miss out on this benefit, simply because its income has gone down in that second year.</para>

<para>âI just confirm that what you are suggesting is the correct formula. That is why we have allowed families to be able to use that rebate against both partners. As such, you gain the rebate for the child being in child care in the year in which you submit the tax return, not in the year in which the child is in care. We recognise that situations do change from time to time. If a family, in the situation the member for Sydney alluded to, has no taxable income, they do not pay any tax in that given year. I hear what she is sayingâthey may well have had one in the previous yearâbut this rebate is claimable in the year in which you submit your taxation, not in the year in which you have incurred the cost and gained the rebate.</para>

<para>âI have just one more question for the Assistant Treasurer. Can the Assistant Treasurer explain the exact difference between the information that is collected by Centrelink for child-care benefit purposes from child-care providers and the information that would be required to be provided by child-care centres to Centrelink and to the Australian Taxation Office to pay the child-care tax offset, as we suggested in our amendments. We said earlier that child-care providers are already collecting a degree of information that they need to provide to Centrelink and that Centrelink, the ATO and the Department of Family and Community Services confer on issues relating to child-care benefit entitlement. What specific additional information would need to be collected so that the child-care tax offset could be paid in the way we suggested?</para>

<para>âI am sure we would both agree that we do not want to delay the introduction of this measure and that we want to make sure that parents do receive this financial assistance. To clarify, as we pointed out earlier, the information that is to be provided to Centrelink is the eligible hours, not the total amount of money, which is of course the key question there. What follows this, you say, is the question: âWhy donât we get them to provide that information?â Obviously these are systems changes. There are a lot of issues around that which would involve more than just a quick change, and by all means that may be something that could be looked at. What is important is that we deliver this now.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, and being responsible for tax, superannuation and insurance, I am only too well aware that things do change from time to time and that we must try and improve systems as technology improves et cetera. So I would never say that the way in which we are setting out to administer the child-care rebate today will be the last way it is ever touched. What we will not move away from is our commitment to providing that assistance to families. Of course, as time goes on, if we find there is a better way of delivering that, which is cost-effective, then I am sure that we would not close our minds to it. We will always take the advice of the ATO and the child-care providers on such issues. It has been a delight to assist you with your questions.</para>

<para>âIf there are any unionists or workers who needed convincing of the pernicious and punitive intent of the Howard government to drive the boot into Australian workers, then they only need to read and understand what I term a rotten piece of legislation from the Howard government. This is a government that talks obscenely about legislating for honesty, integrity and good practice in the building and construction industry. It would do the Prime Minister well to straighten out his own political backyard.

<para>âI withdraw unconditionally that the Prime Minister is a political liar. However, the Australian people know their politics and so do the electors of Geelong. This is the stock in trade of a Prime Minister who leads a government that has told Geelong workers and their families on too many occasions one thing and then done another. This is the Prime Minister who said he would never, ever introduce the GST and he betrayed the trust of every Australian when he did. This is the Prime Minister who said that he would never, ever privatise Telstra. This is the Prime Minister who made certain statements about the Medicare safety net, the reasons for going to war in Iraq and a host of other policy promises where the deceit of the government has been there for every Australian to see. This is the Prime Minister who now wants Australian workers to believe that this legislation, as well as his announced industrial relations program, is in their economic interest. If any Australian worker believes this, then there really are fairies running around at the bottom of the garden.</para>
</talk.start>

<para>Let me tell this House something about the people that the Prime Minister and the coalition are now driving the boot into with this ugly piece of legislation: the workers you are having a go at here are the same workers who have resourced the breakfast program for disadvantaged kids from Whittington Primary School in my electorate. Today I hosted the children from Whittington Primary School in this House, and many of those young students, who came to Canberra to view the proceedings of this place, are here partly because of the good nature and work of members of the union movement in my electorateâunionists in the construction industry. I say to the minister: if he has the guts, he should come and front those kids in this House and explain to them how evil those unionists are who fed them throughout their primary education.</para>
<para>Let me put on the public record and tell this House some of the other things about workers and their families, in Geelong and elsewhere, that members opposite seek to denigrate in this debate and through the legislation that the government now has put before us and proposes to pass through the House. It is not only breakfast programs in schools with serial and serious disadvantage that have been supported by the workers in Geelong. There was another instance of a canteen at a primary school in Geelong that did not meet health standards. The building unions rebuilt and repainted that canteen to bring it up to health regulations so that those children could have the benefit of it. They are the people that you want to pillory in this place and in this debate. Two children died in a car accident and their school wanted to have a memorial garden and pergola built to honour them. Who stepped into the breach to do that for the school? It was the building unions in Geelong, at no cost to the school. And what about the worker who broke his back and whose house needed renovating to accommodate the new situation faced by him and his family? It was the Geelong building unions and the unionists who rebuilt that house for the benefit of the family.</para>
<para>I say to honourable members opposite: you were very quick to take the big lick from the taxation legislation that has just passed through the House. The Treasurer stood there telling Australian workers how well off they were with $6 in their pockets. While you have received the big lick from these taxation measures, the Geelong unionists in the construction industry every year have gone around collecting blueys and donating them to the Wesley Church for distribution to needy families. Perhaps members opposite are trying to denigrate Gerry Benstead, a local CFMEU organiser who puts his heart and soul into promoting and raising funds for the St Albans Football Clubâa club that, right through its junior sporting ranks, caters for 400 young footballers and netballers. These are the Australians you are attempting to have a go at in this legislation.</para>
<para>I have only one thing to say to members of the opposition: we have been through it all before. My father and my grandfathers have been through these struggles before. If you think that this little day in the sun comes without some substantial political cost, you had better think again. We have a very simple philosophy across the Labor movement: touch one, touch all. The great pleasure of this place will be that those bright young members who have come on to the coalition benches will have their careers cut short. Their careers will be cut short because of the Prime Ministerâs ideological obsessions that are dominating this debate and you weak-kneed nellies in the party room who will not stand up to him.</para>

</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>If we are to examine the detail of this bill, we can see that the case put by the New South Wales government when it analysed this legislation really homes in on the legislationâs significant deficiencies. I thought the House was in the business of constructing decent legislation in this place. This is not a decent piece of legislation by any stretch of the imagination. The New South Wales submission to the parliament opposing this bill says that this is âan industry specific bill rather than having broad applicationâ. The upshot is that this bill adds significant complexity to Australiaâs industrial relations system. The provisions are biased and extremely punitive. You can legislate until you are blue in the face but, at the end of the day, it is just another tory law. But, as I have said before: touch one, touch all. When you put this legislation through the parliament, do not think it will not come without a political price; do not believe that for one moment.</para>
<para>The provisions are biased and extremely punitive and, rather than simplify workplace relations in this industry, they will promote a culture of litigation. This is a bill that will create adversaries rather than engender cooperation. The argument often advanced by those on the opposite side is that this is an industry riddled with adversarial industrial relations. This bill will compound that problem. It is quite simple. In essence, it militates against good faith bargaining. Not only that, this is a piece of legislation that breaches international labour conventions relating to the rights of workers to organise and collectively bargain. Of course, we hear the sanctimonious hypocrisy on the floor of this place about choice. And when workers choose to collectively bargain you cannot cop it. The great party of choice, the Liberal Party, has abandoned its tradition and is now hostage to the National Party. The National Party is now running the Liberal Party on the major issues and, dare I say it, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would hope that the Liberal Party members get some stomach and stand up to the conservatives in the National Party on many of these issues.</para>
<para>But, having said that, I have to say that one of the major drawbacks of this legislation and one of the major criticisms of it is that it is a retrospective piece of legislation. It creates uncertainties and inequities and it has a simple bald aim: to prevent unions from achieving collective bargains. This bill, along with all the other IR bills the government has in the pipeline, represents a massive attack on the fundamental rights of workers, rights that are enshrined in international agreements and conventions and that 150 countries can agree onâbut, of course, the Howard government knows better. Those rights that I refer to are such things as freedom of association, the right to organise and the right to bargain collectively. The governmentâs industrial relations agenda, not only in this industry but in others, should be about developing the nationâs human capital, developing skills, improving occupational health and safety situations in the workplace, training for the future and improving the motivation and commitment of workers. But, sadly, this is a piece of legislation that does none of that.</para>
<para>This bill when it is passed will apply to everyone in the building industry except home builders. However, will it work for those firms that engage in work that is in both the non-home building sector and the home building sector? That is something that occurs a lot, especially in the regional community that I represent. The building industry under this bill has a very broad definition that includes elements of the manufacturing sector. The legislation is going to apply to anyone who works in the non-home building sector, no matter how small that activity is, and this will be a costly red tape nightmare for businesses in the construction industry.</para>
<para>The minister is obviously paranoid about closing every loophole. What really worries him is what his senior mates in government will say if this legislation does not achieve its aim despite the government having control in the Senate. Let me tell you this, Minister: you will not achieve your aims because the union movement and the ordinary workers and their families who comprise that movement, and other workers, are determined and they are very inventive when it comes to protecting their rights, their wages and their conditions. When you touch one, you touch all.</para>
<para>This is an industry-specific bill, which is an indication in itself of how vindictive and ideological the government is. With the passing of this bill, work to rule will be defined as industrial action and will be illegal. Everyone in workplaces recognises how annoying work to rule can be sometimes, but traditionally in all areas of work it has been seen as a first step, a low-key piece of industrial action that indicates to the employer that they have a problem and an issue that needs urgent attention. Trying to define work to rule action will be interesting. It will present the lawyers with plenty to get their teeth into and, of course, plenty of income.</para>
<para>In this bill the onus of proof for industrial action based on occupational health and safety issues has been reversed. The employee must provide proof of imminent risk to health and/or safety. Workers will face fines and they might possibly be sued if they take action over an issue that is proved not to be unsafe. All in this place know that the building and construction industry is very hazardous, with one death per week on average, not to mention the countless injuries that occur. The cost in personal terms and in dollars lost is very high, yet we always get a very shallow, insipid approach by those on the other side to issues of occupational health and safety. It would be a different matter if there were one person in the coalition who lost their life per month or per three months as a result of their industrial environment, wouldnât it? We would get a different response. I say to those members of the coalition: if you have not been on work sites and you do not know what dangerous work is, do not complain to workers who turn up to work of a morning and have a desire to get home to their families in the evening. There have been plenty of workers who have turned up on a Monday morning and have been dead by the Monday evening, not having seen their families again.</para>
<para>We know how coalition governments at state and federal level go soft on the issue of occupational health and safety. No doubt the minister will be ensuring that he makes his bureaucracy available to assist employers with their damages cases when an employee gets it wrong on an occupational health and safety issue. I would rather them get it wrong on an issue on a site and save a life somewhere along the line than lie down like mangy dogs and roll over on the occupational health and safety issue. Much has been said in the public arena about this piece of legislation. Go back to its source: $60 million on a royal commission to get at the union movement while the spivs in the corporate sector run riot with their rorting under this coalition government. All I can say is: game on. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI appreciate the opportunity to speak on the <inline ref="R2292">Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005</inline> and the <inline ref="R2293">Building and Construction Industry Improvement (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2005</inline>. I also appreciate the passion with which the previous speaker spoke; it is such a shame that it is somewhat misdirected. He spoke about the government putting the boots into the poor construction workers in the industry. Just a few weeks ago, there was an article in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> talking about lollipop men. Those lollipop men were earning something like $95,000 a year. Their role as lollipop men was to direct traffic into construction sites. Their base rate was $46,000 and the rest was made up of a range of different allowances et cetera. I bet they appreciated the tax cuts that they got last month.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Further, the member for Corio referred to his mates the Geelong construction unionists and said that this legislation was having a go at the Australian construction unionists. He also referred to the obsession of the PM. The reality is: the obsession is on that side of the House, in the seats of the opposition. Their obsession is with the union and working on their behalf rather than on behalf of the constituents of their electorates. That is why they are on the opposition benches. In an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper several weeks ago, Steve Lewis spoke of the deadwood on the opposition benches, the union hacks serving out their time. I suspect that in the not too distant future we will see the white ants having a field day over there.</para>
<para>As someone firmly committed to the fundamental principle of the rule of law, I was staggered today to see the front page of the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian.</inline> It says, âReynolds warns of class war over IRâ and he also made the comment that he preferred to see his members in jail than on the job. There is also a great picture of the two CFMEU unionists, Tweedledee and Tweedledum, who are causing havoc in the construction industry in Western Australia and creating huge costs to constituents in Western Australia because of their belief that they should be entitled to a place in the sun against all else. The member for Corio was talking about his union mates and the great job that they do and how hard done by they are. It has been reported that Mr Reynolds is the co-owner of a hotel in partnership with a director of a building company and he is a shareholder or part owner in racehorses, so these hard done by unionists seem to be doing fairly well. Certainly I have no objection to that. It just seems to me that they claim to be working on behalf of these poor, downtrodden workers in the construction industry.</para>
<para>I welcome the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005 as an appropriate and measured response from this government. It is needed to deter unlawful and corrupt practices within the building and construction sector. The bill increases penalties for unlawful industrial action and grants increased powers to the Building Industry Taskforce to fully prosecute illegal practices that are rife within the building and construction industry, particularly in WA.</para>
<para>The building and construction industry is worth over $50 billion to this nation. It is a vital part of the Australian economy that provides employment for tens of thousands. However, it is an industry in crisis, beset by industrial unrest instigated by what can best be described as bandit unions determined to hold construction companies, subcontractors and their employees to ransom. The fact that the building and construction industry is being held back from reaching its full potential by restrictive union practices is well illustrated by a study produced in March 2003 by independent economic researchers Econtech. The report, entitled <inline font-style="italic">An analysis of the building and construction sector</inline>, found that if productivity in the building and construction industry was to improve to the level of the more efficient home building sector, Australiaâs gross domestic product would rise significantly, by at least 1.1 per cent. That equates to a gain to our economy of over $2.3 billion. It is a very significant sum in anyoneâs terms, and the failure to attain such a productivity improvement cannot be ignored if Australia is to continue to prosper.</para>
<para>The building and construction industry is a sector of our economy failing to reach its full potential because of the determination of some unions to dominate the industry at everyone elseâs expense. Such an outmoded approach to workplace relations has no place in a modern economy and it is time for the union dinosaurs responsible to take their places in the museums where such fossils belong, or maybe on the benches on the other side. Unions such as the CFMEU and the CEPU are on record as saying that they will continue with their campaigns of industrial sabotage irrespective of the requirements of their respective enterprise bargaining agreements or the Workplace Relations Act. Without legislation such as this bill to protect them, employers, their businesses and their employees will be in a precarious and untenable position.</para>
<para>Employers have the right to expect that government will stand with them to put this industry in order, although the WA government do not think it is their problem and have, in effect, washed their hands of any responsibility for the CFMEUâs action on the job. Without support, employers will be left with little choice but to give in to the demands being made on them. It is not just the employers that will suffer should the unions go unchallenged but the economy and the people of Australia as a whole. The Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005 introduces new penalty provisions that will render unions and those taking part in unlawful industrial action liable to significant financial penalties of up to $110,000 for corporate bodies and up to $22,000 in other cases. Under the provisions of the bill, the Building Industry Taskforce and, once established, the Australian Building and Construction Commission will be empowered to take action for breaches of the billâs requirements.</para>
<para>The bill also contains a welcome provision allowing federal courts to render those responsible for engaging in unlawful strikes or other forms of illegal industrial action liable to pay uncapped compensation to those who suffer damage from such actionâand there are many. This provision gives the bill real teeth. Unlawful strike action is costing the industry hundreds of millions of dollars in lost productivity. In my state of Western Australia, the WA chamber of commerce, in an article that appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> on 7 October 2003, estimated that a single dayâs strike action in Perth by around 2,000 workers from the construction and building industry cost employers over $20 million. That is $20 million for one strike for one day in one state. In that same article the Director of Employee Relations of the WA Chamber of Commerce, Mr Bruce Williams, is quoted as saying:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Really, what is expected is that the State Government and its inspectors should be investigating these stoppages and prosecuting the Union ... it is a lack of political will that is allowing the Union to break the law.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Sadly, for an increasing number of people, such a lack of will from a state Labor government hardly comes as a surprise. Rather, it is recognised for what it is: gross mismanagement of the stateâs industrial relations and a lack of will in standing up to their CFMEU mates.</para>
<para>Many of my constituents in Hasluck find themselves bewildered by the industrial thuggery that has beset and plagued the construction industry over the last 18 months or more, particularly in Western Australia, where opportunistic industrial action seems to be absolutely rife and strikes under the guise of so-called âblue fluâ have reached pandemic proportions. Unions are currently hell-bent on locking employers into unrealistic agreements that will also lock out non-union workers from construction sites. Contractors and subcontractors are often forced with the threat of violence into union agreements. The Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry heard evidence of many contractors being forced into agreements, often involving violence or the threat of violence. Reform, therefore, is long overdue and is needed to meet the recommendations of the Cole royal commission, which found that the industry was beset by corruption and unlawful practices. The Cole royal commission produced over 200 recommendations to tackle the corruption and illegal activities the commission found in the industry. The government, to its great credit, has implemented around 170 of those measures, and this bill will build on that very commendable trend.</para>
<para>Unions continue their illegal and unlawful tactics, as well described in todayâs <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline>. They do so in the knowledge that Labor controlled state governments lack the will to act. Just last week in Perth the minister for employment protection, John Kobelke, following an outbreak of so called âblue fluâ, said that he would talk to the CFMEU and hoped they would have a change of heart. As for the national Labor Party, they will, at the union movements bidding, oppose any bill introduced by this government, even though it is designed to bring order to an industry so clearly in crisis. Many of my constituents, particularly those small business owners who act as subcontractors to major construction companies and who know what it is like to be targeted by rampant unionists, are asking why that should be. It is a reasonable question. In fact, to listen to the rhetoric of the Labor Party and the unions, it is the employers, contractors and business owners who are the problem.</para>
<para>Of the $47 million-plus that has gone into the Labor Partyâs coffers over the last 10 years from the ACTU, $4.94 million has come from the CFMEU and a further $3.3 million from the CEPU. The Labor Party therefore has a financial incentive to turn a blind eye to a real problem that has to be tackled with vigour and determination. The people of this country recognise that only this coalition government has the will and capacity to undertake that. That is demonstrated in newspapers in Western Australia which have shown that the Premier and the minister for employment protection have sat on their hands for several weeks, at a significant cost to the community of Western Australia.</para>
<para>The country is fed up with Laborâs white-flag union policy, particularly on overdue workplace relations reform that everyone, except Labor and its union mates, recognises is necessary for a modern economy to grow. In this regard, the people of this country seek firm direction from this government, rather than the âthereâs nothing more to be doneâ arguments of Laborâs leadership. The bullying, harassment and standover tactics employed on construction sites by unions such as the CFMEU are well documented. Indeed, these days it seems to me that senior union officials consider having at least one conviction for breaching industrial and workplace relations laws as a must for their resumes and an essential requirement for office holders. Again, that is demonstrated in todayâs <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline>, where they say they are more than happy to go to jail for breaking the law.</para>
<para>Their record across Australia and in Western Australia is shameful. The figures speak for themselves. In the first three months of this year nearly half of all days lost to industrial disputes across Australia were lost in WA. That is a massive 21,300 days, or 48 per cent of the national total. In the last three months of 2004, the industry in WA recorded the highest number of working days lost, at 567 days per 1,000 employees, due to industrial action of any state or territory. This is a shame.</para>
<para>An article that appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> on Friday, 29 July 2005 highlighted the inactionâit amounted to virtual paralysisâin the Labor WA state governmentâs response to this unacceptable situation. In the article, the WA Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Master Builders Association said the stateâs lack of leadership on this issue was now damaging WAâs reputation not only nationally but with overseas investors. The WA phenomena of âblue fluâ, whereby construction workers have been taking part in en masse sickies, and the refusal of the state Minister for Consumer and Employment Protection, John Kobelke, to acknowledge that such a union tactic exists is, frankly, farcical.</para>
<para>An article entitled âIndustrial relations threats cool WA growthâ that appeared on 22 March 2005 in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> further illustrates just how bad the situation has been and is becoming. The article describes the reluctance of several major developers to start on new construction projects in the heart of Perth because of the stoppages being experienced on other programs such as the Perth to Mandurah railway. It was announced by the state government recently that this projectâs budget has already blown out by a further $45 million, largely as a result of time lost in industrial action. That is a clear demonstration of the impact on communities and taxpayers when industrial lawlessness is left to its own. That particular state government construction project has been plagued by industrial strife from the very beginning.</para>
<para>A <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> newspaper article on 28 July 2005 entitled âAnother day... another strikeâ highlighted one of the key motivating factors behind these strikes: an attempt by the construction unions to subvert federal legislation aimed at reforming the industry. In the article, a Master Builders Association spokesperson is quoted as saying that the CFMEU wanted to force employers to sign up to an EBA because it would help to avoid many of the changes that would flow from the federal governmentâs industrial laws. And what was the state governmentâs response? The state employment protection minister, John Kobelke, claims he has no jurisdiction over the stateâs own project that is consuming $1.5 billion of WA taxpayersâ money.</para>
<para>One thing is sureâworkers in Australia under a Labor government would be a lot worse off. Labor would be forced by their union mates to agree to âno ticket, no startâ. This would lead to no choice for workers, and no jobs unless they belonged to unions. This would be Laborâs guarantee to workersâand that is Laborâs choice. In his April 2005 speech to the Melbourne Instituteâs Sustaining Prosperity conference, the Leader of the Opposition suggested that reform requires leadership and a government that puts the national interest firstâand ahead of its short-term political interests. He is absolutely right; it is a shame he does not do that. Unfortunately, by opposing this bill the federal Labor Party has shown that it lacks that leadership, the will and the âstomachââa word used by the member for Corioâto attain much needed workplace reform.</para>
<para>Workplace reforms epitomised by this bill really work. They pay real dividends for real people and lead to improved productivity, improved competitiveness, more job opportunities and increases in the standard of living and personal wealth enjoyed by Australians at all levels, whether they are low-, middle- or high-income earners. That is why this bill has my full support and I commend it strongly to the House.</para>

<para>âThe speech you have just heard from the member for Hasluckâthe harangueâis typical of the extremist approach that members of the government take to industrial relations considerations. It is the sort of mentality reflected in the Prime Ministerâs comments some time back about âstabbing them in the stomachâ. It reflects the almost obsessive, vile and vitriolic set of attitudes and is quite counterproductive and stupid in contemporary Australia. What we get as a substitute for debate are personalised attacks on people like Kevin Reynolds who, despite extraordinarily expensive royal commissions and other attempts to attack him, continues to enjoy the confidence of his membership in Western Australia.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This sort of approach also seems to totally ignore the reality that Australia in recent years has been undergoing an extraordinary construction boom, which the government pretends to take some credit for. We still have these tales of doom and extreme views about the need for change in the building industry despite the fact that the building industry has been booming over recent years.</para>
<para>As I said, the <inline ref="R2292">Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005</inline> and the <inline ref="R2293">Building and Construction Industry Improvement (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2005</inline> are part of an ideological crusade on the governmentâs part. It is an extreme crusade that is all about removing protection from workers not just in the building industry but in a whole range of industries. In fact, it is attempting to create a union free workplace. In some respects it is part of the forthcoming workplace relations package, which will include a whole variety of measures. It will abolish protections from unfair dismissal for four million workers. It will allow employers to put workers on individual contracts that cut take-home pay and reduce the employment conditions to only five minimum standards. Workers who refuse to sign such agreements face the prospect of being sacked.</para>
<para>The package will include changes to the way minimum wages are set to make them lower. It will effectively abolish the award safety net and will, as I said, replace it with just five conditions. Many workers will lose conditions like weekend, shift and public holiday rates, overtime, redundancy pay, and allowances for casual loadings.</para>

<para>âWell, get up and give some guarantees that it is wrong. This legislation will involve keeping unions out of workplaces to reduce the capacity of workers to bargain collectively and it will take away the powers of an independent industrial relations commission. This bill is part of the broad attack by the government on existing industrial relations practices. In some respects it is even more extreme. What has brought this legislation forward is the short-term political objective and fears that workers will achieve favourable conditions in advance of the government being able to ram their package through the Senate. In this process the government has created extraordinarily flawed legislationâand I will deal with some of that in a moment.</para>

<para>I was interested in the comment of the previous speaker that he is a great believer in the rule of law. There are some aspects of this bill that I believe ought to be seriously questioned in terms of what we Australians would regard as acceptable practices under the rule of law. The <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> talked about this particular bill in an article on 10 June. Among other things, the article says:</para>
<quote>
<para>Multiplex is one of a breakaway group of buildersâalong with Baulderstone Hornibrook, Bovis, Lend Lease, Mirvac, ProBuild and LU Simonâthat have negotiated a draft pattern agreement with the Victorian branch of the CFMEU. The government wants builders to delay negotiating new deals until they expire in October. The agreements would then be governed by the governmentâs new industrial relations legislation.</para>
<para>But builders negotiating with the CFMEU argue that they have work worth hundreds of millions of dollars under way and that they face the prospect of industrial action if they hold off signing new workplace deals until they expire in October.</para>
<para>Multiplex spokesman Mathew Chandler said yesterday that the company was âstriking a deal with Multiplex employees â¦â</para>
<para>The government has warned that builders will be excluded from federally funded construction work unless they have workplace agreements that comply with the national construction code and guidelines.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I am quite familiar with the standover tactics the Commonwealth government has been applying in the construction industry. In my part of Melbourne the building of a project that is very important for the security of Australiansâa new postal, Customs and quarantine facility at Tullamarine Airportâwas delayed for an inordinate amount of time because of the governmentâs objection to quite legitimate agreements that were being negotiated between construction companies and the unions. It is a reflection of the governmentâs ideological zeal on this matter that it was prepared to put the safety of Australians at risk by delaying an important project simply on the ideological ground that it was not happy about the context of the agreement, despite the fact that very major construction companies in Victoria were perfectly content with the agreement; they freely entered into it. So important infrastructure projectsâimportant skills development projects that will increase the future productivity of Australiansâare being held up because of this particular obsession of the government.</para>
<para>In a submission to the Senate inquiry into this bill, which was held some time back, the ACTU said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Right now, the CFMEU are engaging in negotiations to try and arrive at enterprise agreements which will roll over existing agreements for another three years.

</quote>
<para class="block">and as the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> article indicated, they have beenâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">it will add stability and security to the construction industry. But what it will also do is place those employers and those workers in settled industrial relations which will go far beyond August of this year, at which time this government will introduce into this parliament what in our view would be radical set of industrial laws, the essence of which is inciting and encouraging employers to exploit their work force.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Indeed, I think that is an accurate assessment of what has been afoot. What does this particular legislation provide? It seeks to stymie the negotiation of industrial agreements prior to expiry of the current round, as I said, by providing that industrial action is not protected where action is taken to advance claims prior to the nominal expiry date of agreements. The agreement provides penalties that will apply to a constitutional corporation, where it is involved, and will purport to override state legislation in this respect. The legislationâand I believe this is important in considering the rule of law aspects of thisâwill be retrospective to 9 March 2005. It relies on an extraordinarily wide definition of what is covered by the building and construction industry and, frankly, adds massively to the complexity of the industrial relations system.</para>
<para>I would like a deal with a couple of aspects of those provisions. In their report to the Senate, the Democratsâwith whom I do not always agree; they have in the past tended to support the government a little too often, much to their costâquite correctly deal with the question of retrospectivity, which is a crucial one. They say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Democrats are concerned that the bill seeks to put into effect a retrospective definition of unlawful action. There are four main types of retrospectivity, the first being practical and necessary, the next two being positive and the last negative. It is often practical or necessary for some tax law to take effect from the date of announcement, subsequently confirmed by legislationâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I think we would all agree with thatâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">remedial retrospectivity that corrects mistakes or that is technical is usually beneficial; retrospectivity that is benign or beneficial to individuals or entities should be supported; retrospectivity which is adverse to those affected should generally be opposed.</para>
<para class="block">As a general principle the Democrats do not support the use of retrospective legislation that acts to overturn existing contractual arrangementsâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">and that is what this legislation is seeking to doâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">makes previously lawful activity unlawfulâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">and once again, this legislation is purporting to do thatâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">or that acts to the detriment of individuals or organisations. This is not a party but a cross-party principle. It has long been a Senate and a parliamentary principle not to approve retrospectivity except in instances of fraud, illegality or exceptional circumstances.</para>
<para class="block">There are two elements of retrospectivity that the Democrats believe are important. The first is that there is the element of natural justice, where retrospective legislation offends against the principles of natural justice and trespasses upon the basic tenet of our legal system that those subject to the law are entitled to be treated according to what the law says at the relevant time and according to what the law means at the time, subject to the courtâs interpretation. The second area is that of uncertainty, where retrospective legislation brings uncertainty to the environment in which the community and business operate.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I do not think there is any doubt that on all those counts this particular legislation is indeed seriously flawed and in fact undermines some very important principles as to the rule of law. I think Australians are entitled to be concerned about this. A second fundamental objection to this legislation arises from its definitions, particularly as to what is building work. A submission to the Senate inquiry that I have been referring to said as follows:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Membersâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">these are members of a union that work in the rail industry, the transport industryâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">involved in infrastructure maintenance work include fettlers, track repair machine operators, gang protectors, track inspectors and gangers. It would come as a great surprise to them to suddenly discover that, by Federal Government fiat, they have been deemed, at least for the purposes of the BCII 2005, to perform building work as building workers as part of the building and construction industry. They would quite rightly respond that their work does not include building or construction work. The cynical distortion and/or manipulation of the English language by the Federal Government to enlarge the catchment area for the application of this legislation can hardly do the credibility of the process of government any good.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This concern about the breadth of definitions of what is covered by building and construction activity is a view that is also clearly shared by the Australian Industry Group, which is hardly a radical left-wing organisation. The AiG, as its submission to the Senate committee indicated, was properly concerned that the very broad definitions of the building and construction industry proposed by the bill would effectively rope in large segments of the manufacturing and services industries in the more onerous coverage of the bill and would, amongst other things, open them up to the union coverage and conditions that apply in the building industry. Very few employers, employees, unions or other parties in these industries are likely to be aware that the bill could cover these operations. As a consequence, we may well find in the definitions of building and construction in this bill that there are significant advances potentially in other peopleâs wages and conditions. They may find that they are regarded, by federal government fiat, as part of the building and construction industry. That could hardly be what the government intends. It clearly shows once again that, in rushing this legislation into the parliament, the government has not properly thought it through. Rather, it has been more concerned with the sorts of harangues that we have just heard from the previous speaker, the member for Hasluck, in relation to unions and industrial matters.</para>
<para>A further matter that is of concern are the implications for state laws and the impact on small businesses. We have a situation where the Commonwealth is purporting to use the corporations power to assert to itself a whole range of rights in relation to industrial relations in this particular industry, broadly defined as it is. In the ACTUâs submission to the Senate committee, which I referred to before, the ACTU asked the question:</para>

<para class="block">In summary, this legislation forms part of an ideological obsession of the government. It is legislation that is not well motivated. It is legislation that is not motivated by any rational attempt to solve the problems that inevitably occur in every industry, including the building and construction industry. The legislation has been put together because of some sort of obsession that the government has about this particular area. But in the process the government has introduced some very serious flaws. It has certainly dramatically expanded the application of the principles of retrospectivity in areas such as this, as I indicated.</para>
<para>I am sure that everyone in the parliament would agree that, in matters like taxation legislation, it is not inappropriate for the measure being announced to apply retrospectively to the date that the announcement was made. But in matters of contractual obligation and of criminality, it is a fundamental breach of our understanding of the way in which our legal system ought to operate to have a situation where people find retrospectively that things they have done and have entered into in good faith are suddenly rendered illegal and subject to draconian penalties. The definition of coverage of this legislation is very clumsily crafted and, frankly, extends way beyond what the government itself probably thought it would do. It also introduces extraordinary complexities particularly for small business operators in an environment where they will not know whether or not they are covered by the Commonwealth government purporting to exercise powers in this regard. Also related to that point, it introduces complexities between state legislation and Commonwealth legislation. I think that, all things considered, it is a bad bit of legislation and ought to be rejected by the parliament.</para>

<para>âWe have just heard a quite amazing speech on the <inline ref="R2292">Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005</inline> in support of Kevin Reynolds and what is going on in WA. I cannot believe that a responsible member of the House can condone what is happening in the Western Australian building industry with the âblue fluâ and the claims by the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union, given the reduction in productivity, the reduction in opportunity for future jobs and the work subcontractors are being denied. Just listen to the latest proposal. The honourable member may not be aware that, under the latest CFMEU enterprise bargaining agreement, employers would have no right to sack an employee affected by drugs or alcohol, regardless of how many times that reoccurred, if the employee agreed to get counselling. I cannot really think that any responsible individual in this House would encourage people to turn up to work affected by alcohol or drugs and for employers not to sack them for doing that repeatedly. Kevin Reynolds said the demands were ânot unreasonableâ. He thought that the 10 days of sick leave without being sick was a perfectly reasonable thing. He blamed it on discontent on the site and he used some colourful language to say that if people were unhappy where they were working they had every right to take a few days off to get over the problems they were confronting. In addition to the claims affecting the industry in WA, unions have demanded employees finishing work after 11 oâclock at night get a hot meal, a 12.5 per cent pay rise over three years and a $23.80 daily travel allowance even on rostered days off. They are extraordinary claims by the CFMEU and one of the reasons the government must move ahead.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>One has only to look at the record of the building industry to recognise that it is different from other industries in Australia, as Commissioner Cole found when he conducted the royal commission into the building industry. For instance, as a result of industrial action in the Australian building industry in 2004, 223.7 working days were lost per 1,000 employeesâalmost five times the overall national average of 45.5. So the productivity and time that is lost in the building industry in Australia is five times greater than in any other industry. That is an incredibly bad record, because generally we have great weather for building compared with most countries and we have a highly skilled work force. When one compares the building and construction industry with other industries, one realises that where commercial construction takes place it is 25 per cent more costly because union involvement is higher than in the home building industry.</para>
<para>The domestic housing construction industry is one of the most efficient in the world and produces great products in expedient time with a great many tradesmen and workers who are happy with those arrangements. When we move to the commercial construction industry there is a completely different sceneâit is 25 per cent more costly, and in addition to that small contractors are denied genuine freedoms to work. That is why the government is moving ahead with supplementary legislation around the role of contractors in Australia. That needs to be done and they need to be separated, because part of the Kevin Reynolds campaign in Western Australia has been to try to force private contractorsâself-employed individualsâto sign on to the union. Even if they do not have to turn up on the site, contractors are asked to pay their membership fees.</para>
<para>The building industry in Australia is worth $50 billion. Independent economic research conducted by Econtech concluded that, if productivity in the construction sector matched that in the more efficient residential building sector, the level of gross domestic product would rise by 1.1 per cent, CPI would fall by one per cent and consumers would benefit by $2.3 billion. We could make a massive impact just through a change that will have the general construction industry performing in the same manner as the residential construction industry. That is not too much to ask, but evidently the attitude in Western Australia and in the CFMEU Australia-wide is such that it is too much to askâas first identified by Commissioner Cole but subsequently demonstrated to be true in recent stoppages. The response of the Western Australian industrial relations minister, by the way, was that he would talk to the CFMEU and, âHopefully, they will have a change of heart.â The best he could do was to have a chat to them.</para>
<para>One of the rackets that the Cole royal commission identified was where, on one occasion on a Melbourne building site, a subcontractor paid $7,000 to the CFMEU so he could work on a particular site. The receipt he received was for T-shirts. He handed over $7,000 in order to get a start and the receipt came back saying that he had bought T-shirts. Of course, he never received any T-shirts, but that did not seem to worry the union. Another example, which was discovered by the building industry task force, involved an employer being forced to purchase $10,000 worth of raffle tickets in order to keep the building site open. And the opposition is arguing that this is harsh legislation. All we are doing is reintroducing legislation that was first introduced in 2003 but failed to pass through the Senate. This will effect the recommendations of the Cole commission. These are not a governmentâs harsh ideas; they are the recommendations of a royal commissioner.</para>
<para>Other employers have been forced to pay for temporary union membership for their employees, even when they only work for a short period on a site. Not surprisingly, in most instances the number of membership tickets they have to pay for is far in excess of the number of employees who actually have to turn up. That is another extortion racket.</para>
<para>Last year, under the giant front-page headline âRort cityâ, the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> ran a story outlining reported rorts, rackets and threats on Melbourne building sites, which I will outline. Some of the worst things in this industry happen in Melbourne. I do not know what is wrong with the Master Builders Association or the CFMEU in Melbourne or in Western Australia, but they cannot seem to get things right. At the Spencer Street Station redevelopment employers paid 23 union officials to supervise the site, even though none of them did any actual work on the siteâ23 phantom employees were being paid not to turn up. I would be very interested to hear whether subsequent speakers condone such practices and can mount any reasonable argument as to why the federal government should not go ahead and achieve for the Australian community a drop in CPI and an increase in overall productivity. The government aims to do nothing more than bring the general construction industry in line with the residential construction industryânothing more than that. It is the goal of this legislation and the goal of the government just to have an efficient building industry, which is already possible, as demonstrated in residential construction.</para>
<para>I continue with the litany of misbehaviour that caused the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> to call Melbourne ârort cityâ. Union officials extorted $500 to $10,000, or payment in beerâcalled a âbig drinkââfrom developers and subcontractors. They wanted payment in beer, not in dollars, but the total was between $500 and $10,000, depending on who the developer or subcontractor was. Furthermore, a glazier was threatened with all his glass on-site being smashed unless he agreed to union demands.</para>
<para>That is thuggery; that is criminal and it should be stopped. I would be really pleased to see the Australian Labor Party being honest enough to come out and say that they do not condone this conduct and that they will move to support the government in this legislation. Instead of the half-trumped up arguments they are using, they need to say, âLetâs get this fixed; letâs get this over with.â They do not need to stand with their hearts on their sleeves, their chests or anywhere else; they just need to move ahead and have reasonable behaviour in this industryânot extraordinary behaviour and not onerous behaviour, just reasonable behaviour.</para>
<para>Several union members working on the MCG were given free tickets to the 2005 grand final in return for not disrupting work. I do not know what they were worthâ$50 or $100âbut they were bribes not to disrupt work. Unions routinely use bogus claims of safety breaches to disrupt work. The unions in WA are saying that people can turn up under the influence of drugs or alcohol and it is not a worry. I cannot imagine anything being more damaging or more difficult for industrial occupational health and safety on a building site than being affected by drugs or alcohol, yet the unions routinely use bogus claims of safety breaches to disrupt work. What a dichotomy of attitudes. What a conflict of standards, values and ethics in a union that, on the one hand, can promote the use of drugs and alcohol on-site but, on the other, can claim bogus occupational health and safety issues.</para>
<para>In addition to this, CFMEU national secretary John Sutton admitted that organised crime elements were infiltrating his union. Despite the activities of the Senate to modify the legislation in 2003, this is enough to indicate that the legislation should pass without division, and I hope that it does pass without division. One only has to read the report of Commissioner Cole to understand that, in many instances, unions deserve to have some restrictions placed on their activities. They deserve special legislation and special attention so that the supervision of the general construction industry in Australia can be better dealt with than it has been in the past. We have tried all sorts of measures. Since I have been a member of this House the BWIU and its predecessor, the BLF, have consistently been a problem in Australia. This is one area where decent, honest, fair dinkum conduct would be beneficial to the whole nation.</para>

<para>âThe previous speaker, the member for Mitchell, spoke of extortion rackets and of the need to support decent people. I am somewhat concerned that some of the previous speakers on this side have been a bit unfair to the government. They have given a picture that there is no support for the governmentâs proposals in the building industry. That is very untrue, and I refer to Jim Marrâs book, <inline font-style="italic">First the Verdict</inline>. That goes to some of the star witnesses that the government nearly had in the Cole royal commission. There was, of course, a man described in that book as disgraced, convicted and imprisoned former detective Roger Rogerson. He decided that he wanted to enter the rigging business in New South Wales, and he was very supportive of the royal commission and intended to give spectacular evidence. He went on the record as saying that he would be happy to give evidence. He is quoted by the <inline font-style="italic">Sun-Herald</inline> as saying:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">Iâd give them a gobful. I hate the building industry, I hate unions and I hate the CFMEU.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He was one of the people who were really prepared to stand up with the government on the question of extortion rackets in this industry. He was not alone. Another well-known identity, Mr Tom Domican, was also entering the industry, was supportive of government intentions and thought that the royal commission was going in the right direction. The royal commission, of course, involved the exposure of the laundering of money to disgraced New South Wales officials of the union, Mr Bates and Mr Warner. Their approaches to opponents of the New South Wales leadership of the union to have money laundered through a number of companies, to give favours to particular companies in the industry and to penetrate the industry on behalf of organised crime were very effectively supported as a result of the direction in which the government was going.</para>
<para>The statutory declarations of Rees Ginns and the meetings that he had with Mr Domican and Mr Bates in an attempt to undermine the leadership of the union were very interesting. He detailed in evidence the processing of cheques, worth less than $10,000 originally, and the laundering of individual sums of up to $70,000 in a very long-term process to undermine the leadership of the union and using the royal commission to attack the leadership of the state branch. He also detailed to the commission 23 proactive consultant invoices dated between December 1998 and November 1999, along with deposit slips and bank statements.</para>
<para>When we start talking about rackets, extortion and corruption in this industry, it is very interesting to see who some of the supportive friends of the government and of the royal commission are. There has been less citation of the royal commission in recent weeks and months as to the governmentâs position, because it is an inquiry that has been somewhat discredited. When we look at the figures that have been supplied with regard to that inquiry, we find that 90 per cent of public hearing time was spent investigating anti-union claims, 3,484 minutes of public hearing time were devoted to topics virtually reflecting upon the CFMEU, 81 per cent of public hearing time was spent investigating anti-CFMEU topics and 93 per cent of time was spent by counsel delivering long statements, usually referred to as âopening statementsâ, on anti-union topics. So there is a degree of discredit around the way in which this inquiry operated, its purposes and the direction in which it went.</para>

<para class="block">There has been a fairly major exercise in union bashing going on for some months, calling itself a Royal Commission into the building industry. Remember, this is the same building industry that delivered the 2000 Olympic Games and all its infrastructure miles ahead of time.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Mr Jones went on to cite similar statistics, undermining the credibility of the leading counsel in this inquiry. Riding instructions were given to this inquiry: it was told the direction in which it should go and it was told the outcomes that it should reach. Although there were occasional references to minor issues, such as the death of one worker a week in the industry in this country and âmaybe we should have a few throwaway lines about doing something about occupational health and safetyâ, this was the facade of a broad agenda to assault the unions and to undermine the unions role in the industry.</para>
<para>The previous speaker said there is a need for the major building sector to be similar to the residential building sector. What characterises the residential sector? It is one facet, essentially: it is not unionised. There are very low proportions of unionisation in that industry, which is characterised by rampant unsafe work practices. If you go out to the region where I live in Western Sydney, you will find constant involvement by state government industrial safety groups. There are constant complaints to councils, and those complaints are usually supported by independent as well as Labor aldermen. There are accidents proliferating in that industry on a weekly basis. If they are the kinds of credentials the previous speaker thinks should categorise this industry, I for one have difficulty with that.</para>
<para>There have been a number of criticisms of this legislation: of course, it is retrospective; it comes at a time when thousands of agreements, EDOs, have been reached between employers and unions around the country without a dayâs stoppage; the situation is one the employers have chosen. Maybe the government do not like it, just as they did not like people not having private health insurance so incentives and disincentives were given to them to force them to do things. The previously Liberal philosophy of people having choice has been seriously undermined in this and other areas in recent years. But whether the government like it or not, a significant number of employers have signed up to these agreements. That is the whole motivation behind this assault: to overcome collective bargaining in the industry, to try to undermine the organisational ability of people to band together to try to get a better outcome for themselves and to drive people into situations where the individual essentially has to accept what they are given or basically go jump. That is the agenda here: to retrospectively intervene in the industry, to try to have a very wide definition of building and building work, to bring in very harsh penalties with this action and to cease protection for industrial action previously allowed et cetera.</para>
<para>As some previous speakers have said, significant building jobs are in train around this country and employers have chosen to negotiate with the unions. I stress again that there have been no industrial stoppages around these agreements in Melbourne and Sydney. We can cite the problems in the Western Australian industry and the stoppages there, but as I understand it they have not been around the issues being canvassed in this legislation. The situation has come at a time of a broader government agenda to destroy the independent arbitrator in the industry, an independent arbitrator they dislike. That has been heightened more particularly in recent days by the decision on paternity leave. It is also part of an attempt to pare back conditions in Australian awards. It is accompanied by the extreme liberalisation of skills entry into this country through migration. A record 97,000 people have entered this country this year as skilled migrants, bringing to 400,000-plus the number of people who have entered through skilled migration during the governmentâs term in office. That number was 25,000 a year when they first came to office. This is all part of the same pattern of undermining conditions through liberalising entry into the labour market.</para>
<para>The Cole inquiry decided to look selectively at one of the problems as they saw them in the industry. From the governmentâs legislative initiatives, one would think that this was the only problem that characterised the industry. However, that is not the case. To show the dimensions of the issues that really confront this industry the things that should be tackled are whether in addition to the need for some change there are even more important issues that the Cole inquiry somehow failed to look at, including of course the issue of safety. I have detailed that this industry loses a worker a week. It has hit locally in my area. I recently walked into the local laundromat and the owners told me about the death of their neighbour a few weeks previously. Andreia Viegas, the wife of that man, made this point on Sky Channel on 1 July 2005:</para>

<para class="block">The Howard Government has proved where their interest is. In the last three years they have spent over $100 million dollars on the Cole Royal Commission and the Building Industry Taskforce, yet not one cent of that money has been to improve safety ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Firstly, we have the most obvious and blatant question of safety. When the government talk about the proportion of industrial action in this industry as opposed to other industries in this country, they use an unreal figure. For instance, it does not reflect the degree of safety issues in those industries, it does not reflect the degree of unionisation in each industry and it does not reflect the industrial realities of each industry. So it is very misleading to say that this kind of legislation is justified because of the proportion of industrial action in the industry. We know the nature of this industry. We know the realities, even those opposite know them, and to say that this industry is comparable to other industries is ridiculous.</para>
<para>But there is not only the failure by the government to act on industrial occupational health and safety; there is also the question of phoenix companies in this industryâcompanies that flash in and out of the industry, leaving subcontractors unpaid. There has been no action on that front. There is the question of employeesâ right to benefits when those companies collapse. There is the question of the non-payment of employee entitlements, whether that be with regard to superannuation or workers compensation payments. Insurance companies should be subject to financial penalty where the certificates of currency they issue are based on obviously false wage and workplace estimates.</para>
<para>As I say, there are a variety of issues. There is no move by this government to do a national review of occupational health and safety issues. There is no attempt to strengthen workersâ rights to representation and involvement in workplace safety. In fact, there are attempts to undermine right of entry. This legislation is retrospective. It comes at the time when the industry is in reasonable shape. It has not come in here at the behest of the major building companies who themselves have chosen to negotiate with the unions. What is the contrast with the other side? They are preoccupied with the supposed standover tactics of the unions.</para>
<para>And what have we seen in Sydney in recent weeks? We saw a person who had worked for 26 years with Masterton Homesâa carpenter who was given a taste of the reality that faces everyone in this industry under the governmentâs agenda. He was told that, despite 26 years of loyal employment with this company, he could either take a contract offered by the company or get the sack. And he was terminated. He was not terminated because of his involvement in extortion or rackets. He was not terminated because of his failure to do his job properly. He was not terminated after 26 minutes; he was terminated after 26 years because of the agenda and the reality that will come from the legislative moves by this government. Of course, the contract that he was offered involved wage cuts, the end of flexi days, the end of overtime et cetera. But, fortunately, a community protestânot just a protest by a few union officials but a community protestâled to pressure on that company to reinstate him.</para>
<para>In conclusion, this is a move by the government to stymie negotiations, stymie collective bargaining and ensure that union organisational rights, and thereby the rights of the individual worker to resolve his or her industrial situation with other people, are undermined. All the scare stories, terror stories and extortion stories have to be seen in the context of a royal commission whose credibility was seriously eroded. It was not just conservative radio commentators like Alan Jones who questioned it; there was a broad questioning of the process, the agenda and the bias shown by the commission. We cited some of the figures earlier as to what percentage of the inquiry dealt with anti-union questions as opposed to other crisis issues in this industry.</para>

<para>âListening to the member for Reid deliver that speech reminded me of one of the most disturbing aspects of modern Australian politics: that the opposition party in this country is wholly bought, paid for and staffed by one particular section of societyâthe union movement. That means it has no freedom of action when it comes to assessing any policy that is brought before this parliament. So, when the government introduces a policy that aims to apply the rule of law to rogue unions that have been terrorising building sites in the home state of the member for Reid and in my home state of Western Australia, all the Labor Party can do is downplay those unlawful actions while attacking the people involved with the royal commission who sought to highlight them and eradicate them from the building industry in Australia. It is a terribly sad indictment of the Labor Party. It is prepared to justify breaches of the law because it has no freedom left to move when it comes to anything to do with the union movement. It cannot see anything but the union movementâs point of view, and I think that is extraordinarily sad.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I fully support the <inline ref="R2292">Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005</inline> to restore the rule of law to building sites and to make unions accountable for unlawful strike action. This bill goes a long way to providing the construction and building industry with the support it needs to get on with the job of building our nation and creating job opportunities for our community. It will protect many businesses around Australia, particularly in my home state of Western Australia and my electorate of Stirling, from becoming victims of unlawful strike action taken in an attempt to intimidate and cause financial harm. It will give those affected by such actions the opportunity to seek redress for their losses, and it will also punish those who incite these unlawful actions.</para>
<para>This bill is of particular relevance to the Western Australian community and Western Australian businesses, who have sadly received absolutely no support from the Western Australian state Labor government in tackling unlawful union action. It is saddening to note that as soon as the Labor Party gained power in Western Australia in 2001 âno ticket no startâ signs began to appear on building sites. The reaction of the Labor government was to completely ignore this evidence that the union movement was again preparing to flex its muscles in the Western Australian construction industry. It is a testament to the depth of the union movementâs control over work sites that the threat implied in this action went unchallenged.</para>
<para>But, of course, what can we expect from a political party that, as I said before, is completely bought, paid for and staffed by the union movement? That a union can openly display such contempt for freedom of association laws is nothing short of a disgrace. Freedom of association is something that governments at all levels should protect. It is something that as a society we should be prepared to protect also. But when it comes to the unions there are few in the Labor Party who are willing to champion basic, fundamental rights that underpin our democracy. One has only to look at Laborâs continuing opposition to voluntary student unionism to see that. The prospect of anyone being forced against their will to join a particular organisation in order to get a job or an education undermines the very foundation of our democratic system. Australians should be free to choose what organisations they do and do not want to become members of.</para>
<para>The atrocious state of affairs in the Western Australian building and construction industry was highlighted earlier this year. In February, the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> reported that the four quarters average of working days lost per 1,000 employees in Western Australia rose over a two-year period to September last year from 36Â½ days to 108 days. That represents almost a trebling of days lost.</para>
<para>And why were these days lost? For petty and ridiculous reasons that included demands that the Eureka flag be flown over the work site and complaints of inadequate television jacks at site accommodation. So the massive cost of these days lost not only to the employers but to the workers who were trying to earn a living and support their families can be attributed to such trivial mattersâmatters which, as common law dictates, surely could have been sorted out without having to stop work.</para>
<para>Those days lost figures for Western Australia were significantly worse than those for any other Australian state, although I do note in passing that in Victoria and in New South Wales, the home state of the member for Reid, there were also massive increases in the number of days lost. Recently we saw further days lost when workers called in sick en masse in Western Australiaâthe so-called blue flu. This is a situation that the Western Australian Labor government condone through their complete and utter inaction. Last week 200 CFMEU members on the Perth to Mandurah railway line all took sickies on the same day. This is a common tactic on Western Australian construction sites and it is an attempt to avoid the penalties for industrial action that would otherwise be unlawful. The response of the Western Australian IR minister was to say on radio that he would talk to the CFMEU and âhopefully they will have a change of heartâ, which, I think you will agree, Madam Deputy Speaker, is an extraordinarily weak response to unlawful action.</para>
<para>Despite this appalling record, the Western Australian state Labor government has repeatedly refused to act on the findings of the Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry, which found that the building industry was beset with corruption and unlawful practice. Some may think this unsurprising, given the union movement has donated over $47 million to the ALP since 1995. Of the major building unions, the CFMEU has donated almost $5 million. It might not be surprising when you examine the links between the CFMEU and the state Labor government: Shelley Archer, an upper house MP, is married to CFMEU boss, Kevin Reynolds; Norm Marlborough, the member for Peel, has such a close relationship with Reynolds that he was MC at the Reynolds-Archer wedding; Graham Giffard, another upper house MP, is a former BLF official; the Minister for Education and Training, Ljiljanna Ravlich, has links to the CFMEU and related associations, as does the member for Riverton, Tony McRae; Minister Bob Kuceraâs son is an industrial officer with the CFMEU; and Minister Ravlich and Minister Alan Carpenter have ministerial advisers with links to the BLF and the CFMEU.</para>
<para>We can see how deep these levels of influence go. Fortunately, we as a coalition are not beholden to particular interest groups and we have implemented 170 out of the 210 recommendations of the Cole royal commission. I say âfortunatelyâ not only because someone has to take a stand in support of people and businesses that go about their business in a lawful way but also because the building industry is worth about $46 billion to the Australian economy. Independent economic research undertaken by Econtech and outlined in its report <inline font-style="italic">An economic analysis of the building and construction sector</inline> found that if productivity in the construction sector matched the most efficient residential building sector GDP would rise by over one per cent. That is a gain to the Australian people of $2.3 billionâa gain that the ALP and its union masters deny the Australian people.</para>
<para>It is useful to reflect on some of the activities of the building industry task force in Western Australia which highlight why the federal government has been moved to implement this bill. The task force in Western Australia has completed a total of 605 site visits and notices to produce have been served on 63 occasionsâfigures that are very high. A recent task force case was against CFMEU organisers. It related to action taken by workers at the Barclay Mowlem railway station site at Thornlie, part of the Perth to Mandurah railway project. The strike occurred over four days in July and August 2004 and the hearing related to breaches of section 170 of the Workplace Relations Act for engaging in industrial action and a breach of the dispute settlement procedure under the relevant certified agreement.</para>
<para>The magistrate in charge of this case was moved to say in his findings that there were âno safety issues of any significanceâ associated with the strike and that the evidence did not support claims that the industrial action was based on a reasonable concern by the employees about an imminent safety risk. The magistrate rejected claims by the CFMEU that they had played no part in the action and decided:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">There is an irresistible inference that the union by its officers â¦ played a significant part in the activities which led to the withdrawal of labour and, in turn, the breach of the agreement.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This decision is an example of the task force assisting in the restoration of the rule of law. That ability will be further strengthened by the new penalty provisions contained in this bill. The bill reintroduces the penalty provisions of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003. When enacted, the penalty provisions will make unions and those taking unlawful action liable to pay penalties. The penalties include fines of up to $110,000 for a body corporate and $22,000 in other cases. It will provide for orders to pay substantial compensation to those affected by unlawful action. Both the Building Industry Taskforce and, once established, the Australian Building and Construction Commission inspectors will be able to act on breaches of these provisions. The Federal Court will be able to order uncapped compensation to any person who suffers damage as a result of unlawful industrial action.</para>
<para>I am also very pleased that this bill contains retrospectivity provisions that will see these new penalties apply from March of this year. It is vitally important that these provisions are available because building unions are currently menacing employers and placing enormous pressure on them to enter into a new round of enterprise bargaining agreements before any new industry legislation takes effect.</para>
<para>I thought I might take the opportunity to inform the House about the sorts of things that the union movement is pushing within this EBA. It makes claims that quite clearly are outrageous and unsustainable. For example, it is saying that you do not have to be actually sick to take sick days off and that you are entitled to 10 of those days a year. It is saying that if you do not take those 10 sick days then that sick leave can be converted into cash. It is saying that workers should have one rostered day off every second weekâthat is 26 days a year. It is saying that the standard working week should be reduced from 38 hours down to 36 hours per week but at the same time is demanding a 12Â½ per cent pay rise. It is saying that the employer will not have the right to sack an employee that is affected by drugs or alcohol, regardless of how many times the employee attends the work site affected by drugs or alcohol. It is saying that employees should be allowed to continue to work if they are affected by drugs and alcohol if they can demonstrate to a committee of their peers that they can work safely. It is saying that every subcontractor on siteâfor example, bricklayers, glaziers, carpenters, tilers et ceteraâneeds to employ a union imposed safety representative and that every single one needs to be issued with a fully fitted-out office. It is saying that employers need to grant to all workers additional paid leave to attend union training courses and that no limit should be put on the number of union training courses that employees can attend. Finally, it is saying that union officials need to be given unfettered rights of entry, without notice, on to a work site for no reason at all, even if not one union member is on that work site.</para>
<para>I think you will agree, Madam Deputy Speaker, that the EBAs that the union movement is trying to push at the momentâand, fortunately, which this legislation will stop them pushingâare just outrageous and totally unsustainable for the building industry around the country. Entering into these agreements before the current EBAs expire in October would mean that the unions would not have to comply with any legislative reforms until the new EBAs expire in about three years time, which would be some time towards the end of 2008. This effectively will lock in these outrageous work practices. In particular, unions are currently pursuing unprotected industrial action that is in breach of existing EBAs and is unlawful under the Workplace Relations Act. Employers, sadly, are in a weak position to resist and the powers of the current Building Industry Taskforce are insufficient to effectively protect them.</para>
<para>There is no credible argument against this retrospectivity. Crocodile tears from unions that may have breached these provisions between March of this year and the time that this legislation is passed will be seen for exactly what they are. The simple fact is that the building industry has had 12 months notice that the government intended to pass penalty provisions such as those contained in todayâs bill. Despite this awareness, unions have pursued actions that they knew would be unlawful. They are only pursuing such action now in an attempt to menace employers into the new EBAs before this bill is enacted. In doing so, however, they are acting unlawfully by taking actions before the expiry of the current EBAs, as industrial action during the term of an existing agreement is unlawful under the Industrial Relations Act. The passage of this bill will help to restore the rule of law to building sites around the country. No-one is above the law in Australia, and these measures will ensure that this applies just as rigorously to the building unions as it does to every other Australian.</para>

<para>âI am staggered by the content of the <inline ref="R2292">Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005</inline> and the <inline ref="R2293">Building and Construction Industry Improvement (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2005</inline> and I am staggered by the governmentâs attempt to take considered and deliberate action aimed at nothing more than destroying a union. This legislation is not aimed at improving the productivity of the construction industry; it is not aimed at strengthening such a vital part of our economy. This legislation is aimed at destroying the basic rights of a particular group of Australian workers.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The construction industry is an important sector in our economy. In 2002-03, the ABS reported that the construction industry contributed 6.3 per cent to Australiaâs gross domestic product. In addition, statistics released in May this year reported that, over the four quarters ending in March this year, the value of construction work done was estimated at nearly $80 billion. Analysis provided by the Greater Western Sydney Economic Development Board reported that, in 2003, the construction industry contributed 7.7 per cent to the gross regional product. This made the industry the fifth largest in its contribution to the economy of Greater Western Sydney. The construction industry is also a significant employer. In 2003-04, its average annual employment was almost 770,000. This includes some 60,000 workers in Greater Western Sydney, with nearly 5,000 living in my own electorate and two of them being my sons.</para>
<para>This is an industry that keeps growing. Recently, noted economic forecaster BIS Shrapnel released its expectation for the Australian building industry. While expecting a downturn in the residential sectorâno doubt a reflection of peopleâs concerns over the impact of the governmentâs industrial relations agenda on their financial futureâit expected that it would be offset by an increase in commercial construction. BIS Shrapnel forecasts that infrastructure investment by state governments will push the value of non-residential building commencements to almost $18 billion.</para>
<para>There is no doubt that this is an important and significant industry, and it is important that all our industries improve their productivity over time. However, there is little doubt about the means this government intends to employ to achieve this so-called productivity improvement. This government is determined to tear apart the building and construction industries as we know them. The provisions of this legislation are divisive and destructive. I am not about to stand before this House and say that everything is fine in the building industry. I am certainly not going to stand before the House and defend all actions of a small minority that may at times take the law into their own hands. However, I do wish to present some evidence that the members opposite may not have been privy to when they put their support behind this bill.</para>
<para>People in this industry are deeply concerned about the provisions of this legislation. They are deeply concerned because, once this legislation becomes law, they will become second-class citizens. People in the construction industry will become second-class citizens to the rest of the Australian work force. However, it is not only those in this industry and their families who are concerned. When people outside of this industry hear of what is going on, they too will be deeply concerned. Why? Because they will fear they could be the next industry to be targeted by this government.</para>
<para>The aim of the government in terms of the building industry is the same as it was on the waterfront. The only difference is that the media imagery is not of balaclavas and attack dogs. The government learned from their mistake in that regard. This time the government has replaced balaclavas with courtrooms and replaced the attack dogs with lawyers. The government spent $60 million of taxpayersâ money on a politically motivated royal commission to embarrass the Labor Party and attack the union movement, but it did not work. As the editorial in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> reported on 28 March 2003 after the release of the commission report:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Stripped of politics, the building industry inquiry might have been more productive.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The royal commission found 392 instances of unlawful conduct committed by individuals, employers and unions, including illegal strikes, breaches of the Trade Practices Act, misuse of health and safety laws, and intimidatory behaviour ... but a root-and-branch reorganisation of the industry was not proposed by Mr Cole.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The editorial also noted that evidence of the most serious forms of malfeasance, such as bribery and corruption, did not feature prominently in its hearings. So despite the Cole royal commission not being as definitive in its findings as the government may have hoped, we are debating a bill aimed at introducing, in the words of the minister, âall that is necessary to reform the building and construction industryâ.</para>
<para>This brings me to the issue at the heart of my own concerns. Opposition senators on the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee provided a reasonable summary of those concerns. In their report on the legislation, they concluded that:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Opposition senators regard this legislation as obsessively punitive and opportunistic.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is exactly what it is. While the bill does not reintroduce the full legislative response to the Cole royal commission previously before the parliament, it nevertheless goes a long way towards it. The provisions of this bill introduce the broader definition for building work. It introduces new definitions for unlawful action. It introduces onerous financial and civil penalties. It grants employers of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations considerable new powers and strays into state based industrial relations regimes. These are significant changes with significant impacts, and significant changes that will be introduced retrospectively.</para>
<para>I will return to the retrospectivity of this bill a little later, but I would like to consider the consequences of this bill and why the minister has made its passage one of the highest priorities upon the resumption of this parliament. While of course some might say it is a distraction for the opposition members in their campaign against the ministerâs industrial relations proposals, I know it is not. I think the reason is pretty simple. This bill has been introduced in a truncated form with one aim and one aim only: to try to discourage the building industry employers from signing the next round of wage agreements before the governmentâs new industrial relations agenda is finalised. Sadly, it has not worked and the government has resorted to its own form of persuasionâchanging the rules on government construction contracts. I can only assume that the government sees no hypocrisy in using its own economic strength to intimidate the building industry.</para>
<para>What lies at the heart of this bill that makes it so dangerous? I have said before in this place that the devil is in the detail and so it appears in many of the other legislative solutions introduced by this government. This bill is no exception. Considering the provisions of the bill in more detail, I would like to state my objection to the clause that is causing the most concern for my constituents. That is the introduction of considerable financial penalties. This bill provides for penalties up to $110,000 for organisations but up to $22,000 for individuals. That is 1,000 per cent more than the financial penalties prescribed under the Workplace Relations Actâ1,000 per cent. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported in 2002-03 that the average wage and salary per employee was around $40,000 per annum. Of course, wages and salaries have increased since then, but the government is nevertheless proposing to introduce penalties that are up to half the annual wage of a construction worker. I know that is certainly making construction workers in my electorate nervous. They are not nervous because they have something to hide; they are nervous for the financial security of their families.</para>
<para>Construction workers I have spoken to over the past few weeks are regular hardworking Australians and they do not expect, and certainly do not deserve, this kind of treatment. Nor do the other hundreds of thousands of hardworking construction workers throughout the country. My mind at this stage turns to one particular case. An employee of a very well-known building company in my area was recently asked to sign an AWA, an Australian workplace agreement. When he refused he found that he was made redundant. This employee had a job if he agreed to sign a contract that was cutting his wages and conditions, but if he remained under the award, as he wanted to, he did not have a job. So this fellow, who had been with the company for 26 years and had a dependent family, found himself sacked because he would not sign the agreement that the employer wanted him to sign to continue his employment.</para>
<para>Given the injustice of this, it naturally led to an industrial dispute and action that was actually taken on his behalf by the CFMEU. As a result of a rather public campaign, some weeks later this employee was reinstated. But, given the retrospective application of various clauses of this bill, I have to wonder whether or not this employee, his work colleagues who supported him in defending his rights and indeed the union who helped negotiate his reinstatement may all be subject to financial penalties. Now that he has been reinstated, will this employee be subject to the sanctions that apply in this bill?</para>
<para>But, of course, a massive increase in penalties is not the end of it. Clause 227 provides that the court may order compensation to be paid to any person who has suffered damage. Third parties who are not directly involved in the dispute can seek compensation through the courts and this compensation is uncapped. The worst part of it is that, as a result of the retrospectivity of the provisions of the bill, fines could be accumulating now and the workers might not even know it.</para>
<para>Again, I have to wonder about the financial position of the employee of the large building company that I referred to earlier. Has this employee, through his legitimate defence of his own position, now created a legal liability for himself? Has he, by standing by his own principles and convictions, opened himself up to third parties seeking to claim compensation under clause 227? I wonder whether this poor chap and his family even know that we are debating legislation tonight that may make his financial position even more precarious than he first thought.</para>
<para>I have yet to see the government launch a $20 million advertising blitz to inform the construction industry workers of the retrospective changes included in this bill. The creation of retrospective law, particularly when it comes to actions that may be subject to criminal sanctions, is a dangerous approach to law making. I am not aware of any forum, either in the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee hearings or in this place, in which the government has presented a reasonable defence of the use of retrospectivity in this bill. There is no reasonable argument that can be mounted for its use and that is why its use should be vigorously opposed.</para>
<para>I also have deep concerns about the governmentâs approach to the partial exclusion of state laws from the national industrial relations regime. The use of the bill to deem industrial action taken under some state and territory laws to be illegal is likely to lead to serious problems, most of which will be inflicted upon small businesses in the industry. As the NSW government submission to the Senate committee inquiry pointed out, this law breaches the International Labour Organisationâs conventions regarding the right to organise, the right to collective bargaining and the right to freedom of association.</para>
<para>Small businesses comprise the vast majority of businesses in the construction industry and I doubt that they have the time or the inclination to wade through the various laws to find out whether a particular set of circumstances is covered by state or federal law. The legal and financial situation that this may place employers and their employees in is near impossible to imagine. Placing hardworking Australians on a financial and legal precipice is no way to promote industry reform. The creation of a climate of fear is the least effective way to set about cultural change.</para>
<para>Setting about changing the rules and introducing a compliance regime of increased penalties, uncapped compensation and heavy-handed regulation of industrial action is nothing more than union busting. The provisions of this bill are clearly aimed at the construction unions and no-one else. If the government were truly making an attempt to promote industrial reform in the construction industry, this bill would include tougher sanctions on rogue employers. This bill should include provisions to crack down on employers who fail to provide adequate working conditions and fully implement all the requirements of occupational health and safety laws. The government should be cracking down on employers who fail to provide for entitlements for their employees. But, of course, this bill has nothing to do with the industry and everything to do with the union movement.</para>
<para>Unfortunately we have to wait until further legislation is introduced to see if the government is as concerned about rogue employers as the minister claimed he was in March last year in a speech in this place. It is easy for me to oppose this bill because I have doubts about the basic assumptions on which the government built their case. We have all read the findings of the Cole royal commission and the economic analysis of the sector, but recently I read another document that casts some doubt on the economic arguments. The Employment Studies Centre of the Newcastle Business School at the University of Newcastle has cast considerable doubt upon the intra-industry, interstate and international comparisons of productivity. The minister based much of his argument on the potential for productivity improvement. However, reasonable doubt has been cast on the potential for improvement to be realised. The Employment Studies Centre reported:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">On the basis of data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and research undertaken for the Cole Royal Commission Into the Building and Construction Industry it is evident that productivity performance of the Australian construction industry is at or close to international best practice.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Other research indicates that the most important factors in promoting competitiveness in the construction industry relate to lifting the level of consultation between management and labour; improving OH&amp;S; ensuring sufficient supply of skilled labour and regular upgrading of these skills and improving the technical skills of project management ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It concluded with the following:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Unfortunately, these drivers of productivity have been largely ignored under current policy settings.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I have never shied away from my own involvement in the trade union movement and my own experience in the benefit of negotiation over confrontation and I do not shy away from them now.</para>
<para>The 5,000 or so construction workers in my electorate do not appreciate being treated like industrial terrorists. If improvements in the building and construction industry really are the goal of this legislation, let us get it right. Let us get rid of the punitive measures being introduced through the bill and start a constructive dialogue between employers and employees. Let us get rid of the rogue elements in the industry through reasonable means, not through a legislative agenda that is so clearly stacked against Australian workers in the construction industry. The governmentâs own senators when considering this bill noted in their majority report:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Harassment and intimidation have no place in modern industrial relations.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So let us get it right. Let us reject this bill and everything it stands for.</para>

<para>âWhen one listens to the member for Werriwa one understands why many people say that the Australian Labor Party is a party of the unions, for the unions and governed by the unions. I was quite mesmerised by what he had to say. I was just astounded by the comments he made and his defence of what everybody else would consider to be entirely inappropriate industrial behaviour. Maybe the member for Werriwa ought to consider for a moment that the Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry found that the industry was beset with corruption and unlawful practices. In my own electorate I have been approached by numerous builders who have had horrendous experiences with building industry unions, and something simply had to be done. It was this government that was prepared to stand up and be counted. I find it amazing that the ALP is marching back to the past, trying to reintroduce the principles of the class warfare of the 1890s by opposing this very positive, forward-looking initiative, the <inline ref="R2292">Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005</inline>.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The member for Reid made a contribution. It is interesting to note that one of his brothers works for the CFMEU. The Labor Party is a party which seems to give preference to trade unions, and whenever anyone tries to point out the inappropriate actions of trade unions and the horrible effects on the Australian economy as a result of trade union excesses we get accused of trying to trample down the rights of workers.</para>
<para>The Cole royal commission brought down 210 recommendations. Let us just look for a moment at the value of the building and construction industry to Australia. In 2001-02 building and construction was worth some $59.7 billion to the economy. The industry accounted for 7.5 per cent of employment. It is an important factor in the daily lives of many thousands of Australian families. The building and construction industry accounted for 5.5 per cent of Australiaâs gross domestic product. This bill seeks to implement some 170 of the 210 recommendations of the Cole commission. When I read the provisions of that report, I thought there would have been a unanimous approach from all members in the parliament seeking to improve efficiencies in the building and construction industry.</para>
<para>The member for Werriwa seemed to spend a lot of time expressing concern about the legislative impact of the retrospective provisions contained in the bill. The government is not going to apologise for the fact that this legislation will have retrospective effect from March 2005, meaning that industrial action taken by building industry unions after the introduction of this bill is likely to be unlawful. I am someone who normally does not approve of retrospectivity, but this is a situation where the bill is introduced and everyone knows what the law is going to be. The unions, by placing excessive pressure on employers to enter into a new round of enterprise bargaining agreements before the legislation comes into effect, have been trying to circumvent what will be the law of Australia. Most EBAs expire in October this year and the unions are trying to put pressure on builders to enter into new agreements in order to escape for a further three-year period the very important impact of the reforms proposed in the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005.</para>
<para>What would be the ramifications of a successful union campaign? You will find that the processes, the inefficiencies, the lack of productivity and the sheer bloody-mindedness which brought about the Cole royal commission would continue for another three years. If this continues for another three years it means that the productivity increasesâand some of those were in fact identified by Commissioner Coleâwould not come into being for a period of three years. Recommendation No. 4 of the report said that if wages increased by 12 per cent over a three-year period ending this year, a productivity increase of 7.6 per cent would be required during that period to maintain the building and construction industryâs competitiveness. The Cole commission believed that if this were to occur all sectors of the economy would experience a flow-on benefit: the workers would benefit from the 12 per cent pay rise, the building industry would benefit from growth of 0.6 per cent by 2010, the nation as a whole would benefit from a compounded increase in real domestic product of $11.5 billion in the next five years, exports would grow and imports would fall. The report noted impediments to improved productivity and growth. This is one of the reasons Commissioner Cole made the 210 recommendations contained in his report and it is one of the reasons this government is not apologising for bringing in this very important initiative. The industry is incredibly valuable to the Australian economy and an efficient industry means more jobs.</para>
<para>Independent economic research undertaken by Econtech concluded that if productivity in the construction sector matched that of the more efficient residential building sector then gross domestic product would rise by 1.1 per cent, providing a gain to consumers of $2.3 billion. So while I understand that in politics we have different points of view, one has to ask oneself why the Labor Party in this matter appears to defend the indefensible. You really only have to go to the unionsâ connection with the Australian Labor Party. I believe the Australian Labor Party feels honour boundâif you can say honour bound; but they certainly feel boundâto oppose this legislation because of donations to the ALP from the union movement. Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, I suspect that you will be surprised to hear that since 1995-96 $47 million has been donated to the Australian Labor Party. Of the major building unions, the CFMEU has donated $4.9 million since 1995-96âI am pleased to see that the member for Werriwa is starting to look a little embarrassedâand the CEPU has donated over $3.3 million.</para>

<para>The member for Werriwa also referred to the penalties that would be imposed. He may have cited a penalty of $110,000 for a body corporate or $22,000 in other cases. He also referred to compensation. You have to appreciate that these penalties will apply only in the event that the law of Australia is breached. How on earth can anyone defend breaching the law of Australia after this legislation becomes part of the statute books?</para>
<para>The government is determined to make sure that the building industry becomes more efficient and more productive. Therefore, it was necessary for the government to introduce the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005 to bring about those very desirable social objectives. It is interesting that the building industry task forceâand, once established, the Australian Building and Construction Commission inspectorsâwill be able to take action under the provisions of this bill. Another very important provision in the bill is that the Federal Court of Australia will be able to order uncapped compensation to any person who suffers damage as a result of unlawful industrial action.</para>
<para>The member for Werriwa would know that this was one of the recommendations of Commissioner Cole in his report. For a long time I have felt that it is absolutely appalling that you can have unlawful industrial action which can impact greatly on financial outcomes, individuals and companies. Somehow there has been some form of alternative law applicable to unions and people breaking laws in this area have not been forced to bear the financial consequences of their illegal actions.</para>
<para>Because of the need to get this bill to the Senate, government members are not able to speak for 20 minutes. I had a lot more to say about the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005. It is an incredibly sensible piece of legislation. It is much overdue. I am sorry that the ALP is going back to the past and being industrial troglodytes but this legislation is important. It should pass as soon as possible and I am particularly happy to commend it to the House.</para>

<para>Some concerns have been raised on this side of the House about the way in which the Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry limited itself in order not to look at alleged malpractices and breaches of the law by employers. Therefore, even if we were to take some of the recommendations of the commission at face value, the concern for Labor and independent commentators about this piece of legislation, which reflects some of the recommendations of the report by the Cole royal commission, is that it has been set up purely to target quite a strong union in the building and construction industry.</para>
<para>Labor is concerned about the way in which the commission was established, the evidence that was sought and the particular witnesses who were called. For example, witnesses who wanted to make remarks about employer practices were not ultimately called. The whole tenor of the Cole royal commission, and now the tenor of the provisions in these bills, leads one to conclude that it has been an attempt to target an employee organisation registered under the Workplace Relations Actânamely, the CFMEU.</para>
<para>There are concerns in any industry when there are problems and unlawful activities, and I suggest that unlawful practices occur in all industries at some point. I would hope that there is no-one in this place who would condone breaches of law. It seems to me that the agenda of the Howard government is to target a strong union. We can all recall the efforts back in 1997 by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Peter Reith, to gather a work force to displace maritime employees at the docks across Australia. Anyone who was around at the time would certainly recall the bringing in of new labour to replace organised labour in those workplaces and they would recall the efforts by this government in that termâled by the then minister for workplace relations, Peter Reith, coupled with the efforts of the Prime Ministerâto target organised labour in that industry. There was a clear effort by this government to target what it saw as a strong union representing its members. That is why we saw attack dogs and people wearing balaclavas being sent to the docks to targetâunlawfully, as the High Court eventually foundâthose workers.</para>
<para>We have a government that shows enmity towards ordinary working people, particularly those who choose to be represented by a trade union. When we see the hatred and intrinsic enmity directed towards organised labour by this government, it is very difficult to trust its intentions when it looks to examine matters in a particular industry. It should not surprise members opposite that Labor members have great difficulty in accepting the way the commission was established and in accepting the bill which has emanated from the recommendations of the commission.</para>
<para>Some grave concerns were raised by a number of bodiesâand, indeed, governmentsâabout the way the commission was established. The New South Wales government was concerned that the original bill had industry specific application rather than broad application; would add unnecessary complexity to the Australian industrial relations framework; had punitive, heavy-handed and unbalanced provisions; would promote a litigious, adversarial and costly approach to industrial relations which would hinder rather than assist good faith bargaining; breached ILO conventions regarding the right to organise, collectively bargain and freedom of association; and was retrospective with no demonstrated justification for the retrospectivity of the bill other than an attempt to prevent further enterprise bargaining negotiations. This bill had raised concerns and the New South Wales government articulated six clear reasons why the original billâand now the 2005 billâwas not necessary.</para>
<para>It is also important to note that the Australian Democrat senatorsâ minority report referred to their previous report on the Building Industry Improvement Bill 2003. In that report they indicated that they were against the need for industry specific legislation. The Democrats also questioned how, if one of the key findings of the Cole royal commission was that there was a weakness in the current enforcement mechanisms, creating new workplace relations laws would resolve this problem. Their view differs from Labor, but they say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We support one central proposition behind the Bills, that greater regulation and enforcement of workplace relations is necessary. We do not support the second central proposition behind the Bills, that industry specific legislation and sweeping new Workplace Relations Act 1996 provisions are necessary to achieve this aim.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So even other parties in this placeâin the Senateâraised concerns about the way the government chose to specifically set up legislation to regulate a particular industry, which, they believed, there was no need to do. As I said earlier, if we want to find the motivation behind these bills it is that this is a government that seeks wherever possible to damage the capacity of organised labour to represent hardworking Australians in the workplace. Indeed, it is clear that if you show any capacity to effectively represent employees then it is likely you will be targeted in an intrusive and pernicious way by this government.</para>
<para>It was not surprising to see in the governmentâs first term its assault on maritime employees in which it sought to sack ordinary workers, displace them with a group of selected workers and effectively remove them from their workplace. The same government now proposes this legislation following on from a royal commission into the building industry whose terms of reference focused on employee and union activity but were not concerned about occupational health and safety, injury or death in the building industry and the way that some employers placed their employees, on occasions, in dangerous situations. There was no effort to uncover or to solve particular problems in what is quite a dangerous industry.</para>
<para>It is important to put this in historical context. For many decadesâand other speakers on this side of the House have raised this in the debateâbuilding workers did not have any security of employment and worked in very dangerous situations. That was the norm, not the exception. It really did take organised labour to bring about a change in the way employees were treated in terms of security of employment, superannuation benefitsâthey now have the very successful Cbus schemeâand portability of long service leave for long-term building workers who were not in receipt of such entitlements. Those things did not come about by accident or by some magical wave of a wand; they occurred as a result of employees coming together and realising that they had to negotiate with their employers collectively to bring about a safer and more secure workplace which would reward them for their hard work. Those changes, in the end, should be attributed to the working people and their organisations, the building unions, over the many decades.</para>
<para>I place that on record because, if you were to listen to those opposite, you would think that the CFMEUâs role in this industry was a destructive one, when in fact they have brought about those benefits to employees in this industry. And now, because of their efforts to organise and give some bargaining power to employees over the many yearsâand they have done so successfully, I might addâit is not surprising that this very anti-union, anti-worker government chooses to spend $60 million of taxpayersâ money on an inquiry which, in the end, effectively seeks to diminish the capacity of unions to go about their business and represent their workers in what is a relatively tough industry.</para>
<para>No-one pretends that the building industry is necessarily an easy industry in which to work. It is a tough job and it is certainly a tough life for those people involved. There are extraordinary commercial pressures and, as I raised earlier, there are some health and safety matters which I think are peculiar to that industry; therefore, you really need cooperation amongst the major parties. You have got an organised work force in the main in an industry with large employers and some small employers. It seems to me therefore it is important that there is some genuine effort at collaboration by employers, employees, unions and their respective members to actually work on those matters together. These bills attempt to do the opposite, to actually make out that the CFMEU is indeed a bad union, to make out that the CFMEU does not have a constructive role to play in the industry and, indeed, to limit its capacity to continue to perform its core objective of representing workers.</para>
<para>It is not surprising that we find ourselves debating this matter. We will of course receive more legislation in the area of industrial relations over the course of the next few months. The Prime Minister made that very clear on 26 May 2005 when he made a statement about his intentions to reform workplace relations and the industrial laws of this country. It is interesting that the Prime Minister now seems to be running away from what he said on 26 May. He seems to be trying to qualify what he said. I accept the point that has been made that we have yet to see the detail of the legislation that is proposed, but I would like to make some reference, in the context of the bills that we have before us today, to a number of things that were put on the record and raised at the dispatch box by the Prime Minister in late May this year about his intentions to change workplace relations in this country radically. That is my word, not his, but they were certainly radical changes that were proposed by the Prime Minister</para>
<para>Firstly, he made it clear that he wanted to remove the capacity of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to determine minimum wages in this country. He wanted to remove the independent statutory authority of the commission to determine what is a reasonable minimum rate of pay and to set up instead, in that lovely Orwellian language that the government is getting so used to using now, the Australian Fair Pay Commissionâa body that the government can control, a body which has no capacity to be at armâs length from the government and which has no independence. The Australian Fair Pay Commission would be allowed to determine the minimum rates of pay for Australian workers.</para>
<para>The only commitment that the Prime Minister was willing to give on that day was that there would not be a reduction in the rate that would be determined by the 2005 safety net review. That is all very well and good, but the question remains whether there is indeed a commitment to protect that rate. There is of course no reason why that rate will not fall in real terms over the coming years. There were no commitments to providing any indexing to either the CPI or any other benchmark that may assure workersâthe two million or so that have to live off the minimum rateâthat they will actually be able to keep their living standards secure as they would know that there might be increases in the future. Indeed, if that were to be the case, why take it from the Industrial Relations Commission? If indeed the government wants it to be determined and wants to ensure a reasonable agreement, why take it away from the commission? We know why the Prime Minister wanted to take it away. He wanted to take it away because, if the submissions of the government that were put forward to the commission since 1996 were accepted by the commission, the actual minimum rate would be $50 less than the rate is today. If the submissions by the Commonwealth were adopted by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, workers on the minimum rate would be exactly $50 a weekâor $2Â½ thousand or thereabouts a yearâworse off. So we know exactly what the view of the current government is on that.</para>
<para>From the Prime Ministerâs explanation we also know, amongst other things, the only provisions that he is willing to protect under the law. Let me say this to the Prime Minister: federal awards are indeed orders determined by a statutory authority and have the power of law; they are determined under the Commonwealth law and they are there to provide protection now. Let us remember this in the context of what is going on with the governmentâs changes: the government is proposing to unilaterally remove provisions from effectively the terms of contracts of millions of Australian workers. It is proposing to remove by law terms of contractsâthat is, award provisionsâwithout any involvement of the parties to those contracts, those awards. Instead, the Prime Minister has saidâand he has got himself into a whole lot of trouble over his failure to commit himself to decent conditions for the working people of this countryâthat the conditions that he will protect under law now, as a result of the changes being proposed, will be annual leave, personal leave, parental leave and a maximum number of ordinary working hours. What about penalty rates? No mention of penalty rates. What about overtime? No mention of overtime. What about long service leave? We know that in many instances long service leave is regulated by state acts, so that does not provide the Commonwealth with the capacity to assure anything. We know that there are long service leave provisionsâfor example, for nurses in Victoria, as we have heard about over the weekâthat exceed statutory protections, but there has been no assurance to protect those.</para>
<para>What we know, and it was outlined in the Prime Ministerâs ministerial statement of 26 May this year, is that the government has a plan to remove the entitlements of Australian workers. The government has a plan to remove the umpire from the playing field. The government has a plan to limit the capacity of unions to represent working people in this country. The government has a plan to take away smokos, meal breaks, penalty rates and overtime. That is the plan; we will wait and see whether it sticks with that plan, but I think the Australian people are waking up to this government and its desire to remove entitlements from hardworking Australians. The backbone of this economy is the Australian workers who built this country. What is their reward for that? They have a government that wants to attack them and strip away their entitlements and conditions of employment. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThe member for Gorton could not help himself. He had to start talking about balaclavas and dogs in the waterfront dispute. He did not want to mention that the then minister of the Crown, a member of this parliament, had to have 24-hour-a-day police protection to save his life. He did not mention that. He did not think that the fellow behind the fence might have needed the dog to protect himself from the union heavies. He did not bother to tell this House that when that big blue was all overâthe one that Bob Hawke as Prime Minister had spent $400 million of taxpayersâ money trying to fix: the overstaffing and all the rorts of the waterfrontâwhat was the outcome? The wharfies sat down and voted half of their number out of a job, and the other half doubled productivity.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>You do not have to be Albert Einstein or have a masterâs degree in arithmetic to work out from that simple sum the level of abuse that had been orchestrated by a union whose one-time leader said, âI only have to pick up the phone to close down Australia.â And that phone call was probably going to made from his winery in the hills outside Sydneyâa working-class man battling away, like the leading CFMEU trade unionist in Perth who has just sold his entitlement to a unit in the Raffles development that he probably never paid for in the first place. Do not tell me about dogs and balaclavas. Do not tell me about people getting beaten up because they could not get onto a site to unload their truckâtheir only asset other than their family home.</para>
<para>Of course, this legislation is the response to a royal commission. The retirees from the trade union movement who portray themselves in this place as the Labor Party know who they are protecting. They are protecting the union bureaucracy, which has consequently attacked that royal commissioner, who did no more than his job, and his counsel assisting, and the people who made the various inquiries and the huge list of misdemeanours and crimes that were brought to their attention. And it is being suggested in this place that there should not be a response to that royal commission by this parliament. That is the argument that we hear from Labor Party members on the other side of this Houseâthat the royal commissioner made it all up. Of course, that is not the case.</para>
<para>There are issues that affect every sector of the Australian community in this regard. I have written in my notes that the biggest single employer of people in Australia are probably its taxpayersânot these captains of industry who are so often portrayed as getting out of bed every morning wondering who they can sack today, but taxpayers. One example, which is being published in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> nearly every day, involves a taxpayer funded passenger railway line that people would like to see finished, if only so they could use it. But, of course, the whole thing is in the grip of the CFMEU and a couple of related unions, and we find one of their leaders saying that he is going to pull all the blokes out. As we have already heard in this House, âblue fluâ was reported the other dayâ200 bronzed Aussies in the construction industry so sick that they all had to knock off on the same day. That is a known rort and it should be addressed through legislation.</para>
<para>What did this CFMEU union bloke tell us? He was going to call a strike because some companies, relatively small businesses, had received a contract to do part of the work andâhorror of horrors!âtheir members were not members of Mr Reynoldsâs union. That was the reason to shut the job down. But he said he was doing it with his hand on his heart because, of course, they were getting paid $300 a week less than his members. Who was paying the $300? Was he talking about the difference between $200 and $500, or $500 and $800, or $800 and $1,100 a week? Was this the sort of money we were talking about? I thought it might be of that order, but what did I discover? Out comes the story of the lollipop man. How much was he getting on these jobs? Ninety thousand dollars a year. What do those with genuine skills get paid?</para>
<para>The issue, therefore, is: how much was the Western Australian taxpayer paying above the odds? Just how much were they being screwed, remembering there were huge borrowings associated with this project and that they and their kids not only have to pay it off but also have to pay the associated interest charges? I am sure that, now that he is retired, the one-time Premier of New South Wales, Mr Carr, would have no trouble whatsoever admitting that he ended up with virtually no railway line at all because he and his government could not afford the costâand that is these public services. The first thing we are told by the opposition when people are getting bullied, forced and virtually denied a living unless they kowtow to a trade union leader is that that is okay because somehow or other the workers are being protected. If you are a worker and you have to catch the train to work every morning, and you would like the fare to be as low as possible and you do not want a backdoor charge through your state taxes, how do you benefit from excessive claims, excessive strikes and excessive costs?</para>
<para>Then you could be an office worker wanting a job. You have just qualified at university and you would like to work for one of the big international companies which was thinking of building an office in, say, Perth because of its proximity to all the great resources of the north-west of Western Australia. So you think, âIâll be looking forward to a job.â The company calls tenders for an office building and the building contractors factor in the CFMEU bribes, problems and strikes and tell this major organisation the price, and they say: âNo thanks; we can have our head office in Singapore, no trouble. We can have our head office nearly anywhere.â I recently told the House of a lady running a Sydney legal practice from Sri Lanka. So where do the jobs go? They go with the building. Two or three Aussies may get a job, but for all the lesser peopleâthe young graduates and the other clerksâthere is no building, no head office; it is in another country.</para>
<para>This has become obvious in other areas. It was the Labor governments of Whitlam and Hawke that took to the trade union movement with the only weapon they were game to use. It was called massive cuts in tariffs, and that sure sorted out a lot of industries in Australiaâthey shipped overseas in minutes, and today we buy those products. Just try to pick up a shirt or something else that is made in Australia these days. They just destroyed all those jobs.</para>
<para>It is a bit harder to float in a building, but do not think it is not happening. A gas train in the north-west of WA costs $2 billion. A number of them installed to date were built by Australian labourâwe have the expertise. I think the fifth one announced the other day by Woodside will not be manufactured in Australia. It just got too expensive; it got to be too much trouble. It is better to bring it in in units, take it off the barge and slide it into place. Look around at oil production in the ocean and what do you get? You get ships; you do not get platforms. And why are they ships? Because you can build them in Korea; you can build them in all parts of the worldâsail them in, hook them up and produce oil.</para>
<para>These fellows tell us that everything they do is for the worker, but just check the jobs. In my electorate two hospitals were to be rebuilt. But a Labor government was elected, and they changed all the industrial laws and found they could afford only one. It became a scandal. People were meeting the premier of the state wherever he went from the other poor townâMooraâand giving him bricks as bricks fell out of the old hospital. Eventually they found out how much GST money they were getting from us and they decided they could afford the second hospital, but it cost them double because of the industrial problems and industrial policy they implemented.</para>
<para>Mr Speaker, I am very sad to have to discontinue my remarks at this stage, but it has been drawn to my attention that you have a matter of considerable importance that you would like to address before the 7.30 adjournment, and I naturally concede to you. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para>

<para>âEarlier today the member for Eden-Monaro raised with me a complaint of breach of privilege relating to two incidents where alleged fraudulent and inaccurate documents purportedly from his office were distributed to media outlets and to a recipient of government funding in his electorate. In a case reported on by the Committee of Privileges in 1974, the committee found that a letter that was fraudulently written in a memberâs name and sent to the editor of a newspaper was a serious contempt of the House, although the committee had not been able to identify the writer.</para>

<para>I have examined the remarks made by the member and the documents that he has presented to the House. I am satisfied, on the basis of the memberâs remarks and the documents he has presented, that there is evidence of a prima facie case of breach of privilege. I have also considered the issue of whether the matter has been raised at the earliest opportunity. Whilst there clearly has been some delay in the member raising this matter in the House, having regard to the personal circumstances referred to by the member I consider the matter has been raised by him at the earliest possible opportunity. Accordingly, I am prepared to allow precedence to a motion on this matter to refer it to the Committee of Privileges.</para>

<para>âNext Monday, 15 August, we will celebrate VP Day, the end 60 years ago of the war in the Pacific against Japan. Daily in our newspapers we read stories of individual servicemen and their life experiences during the war in the Pacific. We cannot help but be moved to tears to read of their exploits, their trials and tribulations and their suffering, and of the trauma experienced by their loved ones back home in Australia. Having been born in 1941 I can remember something of the sights and sounds of this time, as I lived in suburban Melbourne as a young child. My young Aunt May, married as a teenage war bride to my Uncle Bill, an American marine serving in the Pacific theatre, springs immediately to mind.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>On Monday in our respective electorates we will be joining our veterans and war widows in celebrations at the Cenotaph, with church services and the dedications of memorials. These surviving veterans and war widows are now in their 80s and 90s, yet the memories of that six-year period during the darkest period in our nationâs history is still fresh in their minds. My late father, Vern, was a survivor of the First World War, and in April our nation remembered the 90th anniversary of the first Anzac Day. We have but three surviving veterans from that conflict.</para>
<para>It is a sad fact that, despite these national celebrations, when the fireworks cease and the crowds depart, these veterans and war widows are soon forgotten by those of us in positions of responsibility and power. Many would argue with me on this point and say that the Department of Veteransâ Affairs is doing a wonderful job in looking after the needs and requirements of these veterans. The department does do a good job, but it does not do the very best job by these veterans and war widows. I saw first-hand the battles my father had with DVA to acquire the TPI, and as a member of parliament I have gone before the Veterans Review Board to argue the toss for veterans. Veterans and war widows are receiving a second-rate service from DVA, and it is about time that these people were properly looked after.</para>
<para>These veterans and war widows are also receiving a second-rate service from our specialist medical profession who, to my mind, are a greedy bunch of bloodsuckers. Weary Dunlop, were he alive today, would be so angry at the attitude of his fellow medical practitioners. I would like to cite one example among so many in my electorate to support my argument. I have received a letter which says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">At 10.30 last Friday morning (1st July) my mother, at the time an in-patient at the New Norfolk District Hospital, suffered a fall, fracturing her left hip and wrist. Her GP was called and attempted to arrange for her urgent admission to a Hobart private hospital, however was informed that for financial reasons the orthopaedic surgeon on call would not accept DVA gold card holders as patients.</para>
<para class="block">So, it was into the public system. On arrival at the Royal Hobart Hospitalâs Department of Emergency Medicine my mother was forced to spend two hours lying on the ambulance stretcher in a corridor, as there was no DEM bed available. This effectively kept the ambulance and crew tied up, as they obviously could not leave without their stretcher. From then on, I have watched the unfolding scenario with stunned disbelief and growing anger. In the time since her admission on Friday afternoon, my mother has been fasted for periods in excess of 20 hours, only to then be told that her surgery has been cancelled, as it is not considered to be an emergency! Just what does constitute an emergency? She finally went into surgery at 1 p.m. today (Monday), well over 72 hours since the fractures occurred.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">â¦Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â¦Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â¦</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It has always been my understanding that the DVA gold cards were issued by a grateful nation, and relevant health costs would be met by the Government, in recognition of the part these gold card holders played in keeping Australia free. Was this why my fatherâand thousands like himâwent to war, and died years before his time of war related conditions, so that his now frail 92 year old widow (who incidentally has a war service record in her own right) could be treated so callously? Did so many of his generation give their health and their lives for a free and fair Australia, only to see my defenceless mother left to endure more than 72 hours of totally unnecessary pain and suffering ...</para>
<para class="block">In conclusion, I find it incredible that these medical practitioners (who, I assume, at some point in the past have had some fleeting contact with the Hippocratic Oath) now have the absolute gall to refuse treatment to the very veterans who are in part responsible for the fact that these practitioners are able to freely practice medicine in a free country.</para>

<para>âTonight I rise to address an issue of great importance to the people of Greenway and, indeed, all of Western Sydney. Greenwayâs community is one of action. The people in my community are keen to interact with decision makers and to ensure that their voices are heard on all issues. Unfortunately, the people of Greenway, Mitchell, Lindsay and Macarthur have not been heard in recent times by the New South Wales state government. Instead, the state Labor government has made a reckless decision that will affect the quality of life of thousands of residents in Western Sydney.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Department of Infrastructure, Planning and Natural Resources has released draft guidelines that would rezone thousands of properties under the creative title of âLandscape and rural lifestyle zoneâ. In practical terms this means that landowners can never subdivide their properties and that they will be required to revegetate. In particular, in Greenway this decision affects the people of Rouse Hill, Riverstone, Schofields and Marsden Park.</para>
<para>This decision was made with no consultation with landowners and residents. It was made with no consultation with the relevant planning authorities at a local government level. Instead, the Labor state government announced the proposed changes on their web site. A letter then arrived in the mailbox for some, but not all. This is a style that the people of Western Sydney have come to expect from the Labor state government. It is just not good enough. It is not good enough because this is a state government that is all about restriction. The residents of Greenway have worked hard to build a life for themselves and their families. Now they are to be restricted in the way that they may choose to use their own land. Not all of these families may ever want to subdivide their land, and some of them may have no intention of selling their properties. But that is not the point. The point is that the power to choose what they do with their own assets has been removed with little explanation and little warning. That is a pretty basic right. These are people who have paid their rates, paid their taxes and maintained their land in a responsible fashion. They have the right to be free from interference without explanation or compensation.</para>
<para>What is particularly concerning about the decision is the sheer lack of attention paid to expert advice regarding the planning status and environmental status of the area. Departmental urban planners advised against restricting development options for this area. The planning minister ignored this advice. An environmental study commissioned by Blacktown City Council suggests that the area should be incorporated into future town planning. Again, this advice was ignored. Provisions for the north-west rail link, a basic form of infrastructure, have been ignored. The areas of Cumberland Plain Woodland that are of the greatest conservational valueâthe areas around Vineyard train station and Baulkham Hillsâhave been left completely unprotected. Even worse, areas that actually are slated for development fall on a flood plain. Of course, this means that no development can actually take place. The flaws in this planning strategy are numerous, and they are hurting the people of Western Sydney. To borrow the words of the leader of the New South Wales alternative government, John Brogden, it is as though someone has taken a green crayon to the map with little rhyme or reason. Nobody wins under this strategy.</para>
<para>On Sunday nearly 3,000 people gathered at the Connie Lowe Reserve to voice their anger and frustration. I want to especially thank the Rouse Hill Heights Action Group, led by Colleen Abela, for their efforts on this issue. Communities are built by people. Colleen, Jonathan OâBrien and Mario Pace are the strength of that community and have demonstrated their commitment to their local area. They have delivered a message to the new Premier of New South Wales that the people of New South Wales deserve to be consulted on decisions that profoundly affect their community. These are people who do not deserve to have their property values more than halved overnight with no valid explanation and no offer of compensation for the loss incurred.</para>
<para>I want to commend John Brogden for his support of this issue. On Sunday he gave an undertaking to lift the green zones when he is elected in 2007 and to give the people of north-west Sydney their land. This is the right thing to do; it is the responsible thing to do. The only fair thing for the New South Wales Labor government to do is to repeal the green zones, go back to the drawing board, re-evaluate their metro strategy and implement a planning strategy that will be effective and that includes consultation with both local government and residents.</para>

<para>âMarion Maddox, who teaches religious studies at Victoria University in Wellington, is the author of the book <inline font-style="italic">God under Howard: The Rise of the Religious Right in Australian Politics</inline>. I have not read the book, but after reading her article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> on Tuesday I will certainly bring it forward onto my required reading list. Marion Maddox writes that members of the Parliamentary Prayer Network are meeting, I bet today, in the Great Hall of Parliament House. Provocatively, she states that we can expect to hear that Australian democracyâs days are numbered yet the mood of the meeting is unlikely to be gloomy.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Marion Maddox points out that the keynote speaker, Cindy Jacobs from Texas, prophesises on her web site that Australia will soon be ruled by Godâs law. According to Maddox, Cindy Jacobs has declared:</para>
<quote>
<para>The Holy Spirit will so cause a governmental shift in this land that other nations all over the world will want to study the Government of Australia ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is a very big call indeed. Brochures for the weekâs conference âPrayer, Nations and Governmentâ advertise the participation of members and senators but conveniently omit their names. I collected a brochure from the Great Hall yesterday and asked your office, Mr Speaker, on Tuesday evening who had sponsored the use of the Great Hall for this event. They promised to get back to me, and I am sure they will.</para>
<para>Keynote speaker Cindy Jacobsâs name is prominently displayed on the front cover of the brochure. According to Maddox, Jacobs heads Generals International, whose mission is to âsee Godâs kingdom established in the nationsâ. Again, quoting Maddox:</para>
<quote>
<para>She has close associations with the World Prayer Centre in Colorado Springs, whose leaders preach âDominionâ or âKingdom Nowâ theology, which holds that Christians must take over the world through its governments.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">And here Maddox states the real concern:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Democratic structures will give way to âapostolic governmentâ.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Maddox continues:</para>
<quote>
<para>âThe churchâor, in some interpretations, elite âovercomersââis the biblically foretold âman childâ who, through apostles and prophets (such as Jacobs), will ârule the nations with a rod of ironâ (Revelations chapter 12, verse 5).</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">If Maddox is correct in her interpretation of what Cindy Jacobs proselytises, and I have no reason to think otherwise, then, as she states at the conclusion of her article, âThere is particular irony in an overseas religious leader entering the heart of Australian democracy to hail its imminent endâ. I have no problem allowing events that support Australian democracy using the prestige of the national parliament to convene their special activities. However, I do have a big problem with an organisation that invites as its key speaker a person who wishes to replace democracy with a so-called âapostolic governmentâ.</para>
<para>I have been in this parliament for 17 years. You pick up a few things in that time. On the positive side, I am forever impressed by the intrinsic good qualities of parliamentarians on all sides. However, we all know that there is a dark side in some people, and some people operate at no better than a charlatan level. They almost always have some common characteristics and strategies. They use religion, ethnicity, race, culture, gender, nationality and socioeconomic status as a means to attack, divide and disparage while pretending to do the opposite.</para>
<para>The rise of religious fundamentalism, notwithstanding the religion itself, is a growing and dangerous trend in the world. I believe in the separation of church and state, for that is the way the very best and continuing democracies operate and survive. I do not want Australia to become a country where people who believe that religion can trump science are in power or influential positions.</para>
<para>I do not want Australia to become a country in which religious groups have control over womenâs bodies or take account of peopleâs sexuality. Australiaâs fine democratic traditions protect a personâs rights to believe in whatever religion or cult they decide. However, those same traditions do not give people the right to undermine democracy for antidemocratic aims a particular group may believe in. Most Australians want matters decided on their merit, not because of race, religion, gender or ethnicity. I believe that still to be the case and if the private good of religion becomes enmeshed with the public good of politics, as is now happening, Australian democracy as we know it will be the loser. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âOn Monday, 11 July the recently retired Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, announced that his government had selected a location for the worldâs largest desalination plant. Of all the locations in Sydney, he chose to site this enormous plant on the already damaged and degraded Kurnell Peninsula. Kurnell is of unparalleled significance in Australia as the site of Captain James Cookâs landfall in Australia and the site of the first meeting of Indigenous and European cultures.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As members would be aware, there has been a near universal outcry over the New South Wales Labor governmentâs latest attempt to destroy Kurnell. Already, the New South Wales Labor government has allowed sandmining to continue and expand, has allowed widespread industrial developments to occur and is currently wrestling with how to make the approval of a massive housing development politically saleable.</para>

<para>âOn Sunday, 17 July I organised a community rally at Wanda, which is near the neck of the peninsula. According to police estimates, more than 1,500 people attended this rally to voice their displeasure over Laborâs latest plans. The opposition of this shire community and of a vocal portion of Sydney to this plan is not merely a case of nimbyism, although certainly we all love the shire and particularly Kurnell and we want to see it preserved and protected from government excess. But, more importantly, it is opposition to Laborâs arrogance in continuing to force unpopular and unnecessary developments on an area that has borne more than enough of the industries required to support Sydney.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The New South Wales government minister responsible, Frank Sartor, has been on the hustings in the weeks since the announcement, trying to tell us all the good points. What he has failed to own up to is that desalination is massively expensive and grossly inefficient. Desalination relies on pushing water under great pressure through semipermeable membranes to remove fresh water via reverse osmosis. The amount of energy required to produce the necessary pressure is staggering. The plant that Labor are pushing would consume 906 gigawatt hours per annum. To put that in perspective, it is the equivalent of placing 265,000 new cars on the road each and every year.</para>
<para>Desalination is so inefficient that, according to the Australia Institute, water prices in Sydney will rise from around $1 currently to a staggering $2.44 per kilolitre after the desalination plant is built. There are not many families in my electorate or across Sydney who could easily absorb a price rise of this magnitude. Even the minister then responsible, Frank Sartor, has stated:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">â¦ recycling is far cheaper than desalination â¦ no question.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">There are also grave environmental concerns over this plan. The environmental impacts of a plant of this size are unknown and there is no comparable plant anywhere in the world. The plant, when built, will draw 1,250 megalitres of water from the ocean off Cronulla each day. The effect of this on the protected weedy sea dragons and other species which inhabit the waters of Kurnell will be dire. Of even greater concern is the fact that the plant will discharge 750 megalitres per day of heated superconcentrated brine into the ocean. The sheer quantity of this discharge would irreversibly damage the ocean off Cronulla.</para>
<para>Given the vast ramifications of a proposal of this size, you would imagine that complex environmental studies and community consultation would be a large part of the governmentâs move. Not in this case. The New South Wales Labor government have announced that their desalination plant will be designated as critical infrastructure, which essentially means that their own development will be subject to no environmental impacts and no review. They will not even be required to complete the most basic environmental study into this plantâs effect. The New South Wales government should be looking at stormwater harvesting and waste water recycling. In Sydney currently just three per cent of water is recycled.</para>
<para>The New South Wales governmentâs then Minister for Planning told concerned residents that this issue is âbeyond debateâ. This is a sign of absolute arrogance. The New South Wales government is not prepared to debate or discuss, just demolish and build. A proposal of this magnitude, a proposal for the future of Sydney, should be subject to fulsome debate and discussion, not the subject of grubby backroom deals in Macquarie Street. Frank Sartorâs line is that people object to the idea of water recycling. That is a big claim, given that he and his government have not even paused to ask what we want.</para>
<para>This is an act by a government on the run. It has known for more than 10 years of a looming water crisis and it has sat on its hands. Like nearly all infrastructure in Sydney, our potable water supplies are under pressure from massive residential expansion and resultant demand, while the government has failed to plan any new infrastructure whatsoever. There is no doubt that Sydney needs a solution to its water crisis. A thriving city of more than four million needs a supply of water, but why desalination? It is expensive, it is inefficient and it will pollute and degrade the ocean and our nationâs birthplace. I ask that we see an end to this proposal. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âStrong families are vital to Australiaâs future. Strong families help children to develop into self-reliant contributors to our community and they are the most important social institution we have. Many in this place could not be here without the active support, encouragement and belief in us of our families. In that context it is vital that government policy is put under scrutiny for its impact on Australian familiesâfamilies of all types and of all different incomes throughout their many life stages.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The government made a commitment to the newly emerging Family First Party in the context of preference deals in the last election campaign. The Prime Minister was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> on 7 October 2004 as having undertaken to provide in all cabinet submissions a family impact statement. There seems to have been some watering down of this promise, with the Treasurer now claiming that these family impact statements really will not be needed in every instance and in fact will be needed only in very narrow instancesâonly for legislation directly relating to families. The Howard government has been quick to forget its promise to Family First and to Australian families in the wake of its holding a majority in the Senate in its own right.</para>
<para>Labor has initiated its own âfamily watchâ, which examines government legislation in statements as well as policy and looks at income expenditure data to paint a more realistic picture of what has been happening to families under this government. The governmentâs rhetoric on families has not matched its actions. Just this week alone, we have had the governmentâs refusal to guarantee new rights won by families in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission; the debate on legislation that has watered down the governmentâs election commitment of a 30 per cent rebate of out-of-pocket child-care costs, introducing a system that is likely to encourage families into debt; ongoing media debate about the impact that the loss of student services such as child care will have on parents struggling to upgrade their qualifications; continued chest beating about the governmentâs determination to privatise Telstra and let off the regulatory leash a company that is determined to increase its prices and ditch the universal service obligation; and tax cuts of $6 that have already been eroded by petrol prices and interest rate increases for the bulk of working families while higher income earners such as me get the highest tax cuts.</para>
<para>Tomorrow, with the release of the most important part of the household surveyâthe expenditure part of the equationâwe will see the real picture of how families have fared under this government. The governmentâs proposed IR reforms are a perfect example of its failure to provide back-up on its rhetoric on families. Families deserve to know right now where they stand with this governmentâwhether the barbecue stopper of work and family will be reflected in the governmentâs extreme IR reforms or be sacrificed in them. In question time yesterday, the Prime Minister was asked whether he would give Australian parents a fairer deal by following the Australian Industrial Relations Commissionâs decision to allow parents the right to request up to two years unpaid leave to care for a new baby, up to eight weeks paid leave for new parents and part-time work until the child goes to school. He absolutely refused to do so.</para>
<para>The government claims that its proposed industrial relations reforms are sensible. This could not be further from the truth, considering that Australian families will soon lose job security, a good ability to balance work and family, financial stability and the ability to secure a solid basis from which to raise their children. Today the legislation introducing the governmentâs watered down election commitment on the 30 per cent out-of-pocket child-care expenses rebate passed through this House. The watering down of that promise means that the rebate will not be delivered for some 14 to 30 months and a debt trap has been created for many families. The out-of-touch Howard government also lacks consideration for families struggling with children who are attending university that are now faced with the real expectation that the flourishing existence of student services of today, including subsidised child care, may not exist next year. VSU will take away many of the opportunities for battling families attending university and many of the services they need to continue to do so.</para>
<para>Next week will undoubtedly prove no different for families. Families in rural and regional Australia will have to live with the fact that âjust call me Solâ, the new Telstra CEO, wants to dump Telstraâs universal service obligation to provide a basic phone service to Australians in rural and regional Australia; and the government, in its determination to privatise Telstra, will be powerless to stop it doing so. What impact will the governmentâs decision to fully privatise Telstra have on the cost of telecommunications for families? Will some families who choose, as I do, to live and work in regional and rural communities be left behind in this highly competitive economy when we see the digital divide widen?</para>
<para>It has been a bad week for families when you look at the decisions that this government is making. Tomorrow the ABS expenditure data will be released. Unusually, it is being released in two parts, the income side having been released last week and the expenditure side being released this week. It has been a bad week for familiesâand things are only likely to get worse under this government. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI rise tonight to acknowledge and commend the work of Warwick Marsh and the Fatherhood Foundation. Mr Marsh and the foundation achieved a remarkable event this week, bringing together in one venue and working for one purpose feminists, people from various churches, people from the IT industry, policemen, ex-brothel madams, counsellors, paediatricians, and coalition and opposition members of this parliament. It was called the Sexual Integrity Forum. I must confess that the initial response most people have to that title is to think of a bunch of wowsers getting together and condemning things that some people would consider entertaining or good fun.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>But I think the tone for the forum was set by the front page of the handbook, which said that the forum was dedicated to the memory of nine-year-old Ebony Simpson, who in 1992 was sexually assaulted and, despite pleading for her life, was murdered by being drowned in a dam on her way home from school. There is a painting hanging in the New South Wales parliament to remind law-makers of their responsibility to the innocentânot just in sentencing but in preventing underlying causes. The question is: are there, in fact, links between this kind of behaviour and underlying causes?</para>
<para>Richard Read, a Victorian Queenâs Counsel, in 1988 stated that he was faced with the appalling consequences of violent crime in his state every day of the week. He was quite convinced that a significant proportion of violent crimes, in particular violent sex crimes, were inspired by the accused person acting out what had been seen on television and video or read in pornographic literature. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">My knowledge is derived from nearly 20 years experience as a barrister in this State, the last 9 years as a Prosecutor for the Queen. In the very limited time I have had available to research this topic, I have already located 5 files in the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in Victoria which clearly support my assessment of the situation. Given more time, and an appropriate research backup, I believe that I could locate numerous other examples of serious crime inspired by pornographic or violent material whether in films, videos or literature.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Mr Read could not have known that the research he was looking to have done has been done and that link has been established. When you look at the outcomes of the excessive use of that sort of materialâthe facts that in Australia, since 1999, the sexual assault rate has increased by almost 30 per cent; that the number of men in prison for sexual assault has doubled since 1988; that the risk of sexual violence doubles in adulthood for women who were abused as a child; that 84 per cent of boys and 60 per cent of girls have had exposure to internet pornography; that 73 per cent of boys and 11 per cent of girls have watched X-rated videos; and that two-thirds of sex crimes in Australia are committed against our childrenâthis was far from a forum for wowsers. This was a forum for people concerned about our society, about our families and about our children.</para>
<para>One of the keynote speakers in the forum was Dr Mary Anne Layden, a respected commentator on the effects of pornography and prostitution and the international trafficking of women for prostitution. She is working to reduce the sexual exploitation of women and children. She has a professional background as a psychotherapist and is the Director of Education at the Centre for Cognitive Therapy at the University of Pennsylvania. She is a world expert on this theme. She drew together a number of peopleâas I said before, counsellors, paediatricians, policemenâin a very effective forum that did not just look at the problems but also identified potential areas where we can make inroads into this field to protect our children.</para>
<para>Â I commend Warwick Marsh and his organisation for their efforts in bringing together this forum and for highlighting the need for action. For the sake of the women, men and families in our society and for the children of our societyâfuture Ebonysâwe can no longer be silent. I thank Mr Marsh for his work.</para>

<para>âBallarat has recently been reminded of the cruel and tragic cost that comes from losing a loved one in a roadside accident. Unfortunately this type of tragedy is not an unfamiliar occurrence for families in my electorate. Last year in the state of Victoria, drivers between the ages of 18 and 25 represented about 14 per cent of all licensed drivers yet 25 per cent of those killed on our roads. Of those 47 young lives lost, just over half were killed on country roads and over 80 per cent were males. Today I want to speak specifically on the Midland Highway, which has claimed the lives of many young people in my electorate. The Midland Highway is a stretch of road between Ballarat and Geelong. Increasingly it is used by students travelling to and from university and by commuters and tourists. It is a major freight route for businesses accessing Adelaide from Geelong and vice versa. It has been called âthe corridor of deathâ by local police. Since 2000, 16 people have been killed, 68 seriously injured and 103 taken to hospital. These kinds of figures are simply not acceptable. Regardless of state and federal responsibilities, governments need to work together to prevent further loss of life on this road.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Last month Sergeant Peter Anderson, from Buninyong Police; Sergeant Peter Murray, from the Motor Traffic Unit; and Mick Rooney, from Meredith Police Station, took me along the Midland Highway so that I could see first-hand the problems motorists face along that stretch of road. I would like to take this opportunity to thank them for sharing with me their many years of experience on this matter. It has given me a much clearer understanding of where the problems are on this road.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Not long after my meeting with Peter, Mick and Peter, I received an email from a concerned mother whose son was recently involved in an accident on the highway. She said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">As a family we frequently travel on the Midland Highway. I have three teenage children, one who is studying Architecture at Deakin University in Geelong, and travels home to Ballarat most weekends to work in his part-time job. My husband constantly travels on the highway for work as well. Recently my son was involved in an accident where he had to move off the road as an oncoming car was overtaking, causing him to hit the gravel and to run off the road into a tree. Fortunately he was not injured ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Had there been a passenger in the vehicle, that passenger would have died. My constituentâs son was extremely lucky.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The road is characterised by a large number of dips where oncoming cars completely disappear from sight. There are no overtaking lanes other than at the start of the road in Ballarat and at the end of the road in Geelong. It is a major freight route, so cars get extremely frustrated when they are caught behind slow-moving vehicles. Many drivers are frustrated because there are limited overtaking opportunities.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The traffic flow along the Midland Highway will grow as Ballarat and Geelong expand, which means that, unless action is taken, the problem of the Midland Highway will only get worse. When I return to Ballarat from parliament, I will set up a meeting of local, state and federal resources to address this matter. If we do not take action on the Midland Highway, the result will be the further loss of our children, parents and partners. As a community, that is not something we can stand by and let happen. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âHearing impairment affects about 400 of the 250,000 newborns in Australia each year, and worldwide an estimated 20,000 babies are born each year with hearing impairments. The consequences of hearing loss can include learning difficulties, impaired speech development and behavioural problems. Literacy and numeracy problems are commonplace when hearing loss is undiagnosed. In many cases, the harm caused by this hearing loss is lifelong. The cost to the individual and to society is high. We know that early screening of newborns is simple and cost-effective and that, upon diagnosis, intervention is critical to enable babies in our country to reach their fullest potential.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I applaud the state of New South Wales, which has had a universal newborn screening program for more than three years. Queensland have just announced a comprehensive universal scheme for testing the hearing of their newborns, along with some excellent protocols for treatment if a diagnosis is made. South Australia and Tasmania, likewise, have just announced their statesâ intentions to introduce universal hearing testing for all newborns. You can imagine then how disgusted I am with the Victorian government, which has decided to introduce metropolitan onlyâand then only at a few hospitalsâscreening for the hearing of newborns. It is too bad if you are born at Echuca, Cohuna or in the Malleeâyou will not be screened. It is too bad if you are born in outer metropolitan areas like those in the electorate of the member for Caseyâyou will not be screened.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I think this is absolutely appalling. Why is it that other states in Australia have universal screening? New South Wales has had screening for three years now. When Victoria began in 2003 with a very limited program just for babies in neonatal special care nurseries, they picked up 40 babies in the two years of that very specific testing. They know that there are undiagnosed babies who were in neonatal care at other places. We know that, in the few months since a few Melbourne hospitals have been offering testing to all newborns, seven babies have been diagnosed with hearing loss.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I am also concerned that the government in Victoria has introduced this very limited and discriminatory testing for babiesâ hearing without adequate protocols in place for the treatment or support of parents with counselling and ongoing baby support. I am afraid that Mr Bracks has a lot to answer for. He claims that he governs for the whole of this state. I strongly suggest that he look again at this program, because all newborns need screening across Australia, particularly in rural and regional areas, and we are not getting it in Victoria.</para>

<para>âToday I would like to speak about trees. More specifically, I would like to talk about children and trees and the importance of our young people learning about the significance of trees to our environment. I got to see all of this first-hand on a recent visit to Parkside Primary School. On Sunday, 31 July, the 10th annual National Tree Day, organised by Planet Ark in association with Toyota and the AMP Foundation, was held across Australia. National Tree Day is Australiaâs biggest community tree-planting event. In 2004, Australians planted over 1.2 million trees at nearly 3,200 sites around the nation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">National Tree Day also incorporates Schools Tree Day, held this year on Friday, 29 July. This is a day dedicated to educating kids about the importance of planting and maintaining native trees. Schools that care enough to get involved with environmental projects like Schools Tree Day are wonderful places for young people to learn about helping and respecting the environment. It is heartening to see children, parents and teachers getting involved as school communities in such a worthwhile cause. Schools Tree Day is not just about planting new trees but about learning to look after young saplings. It is a fantastic opportunity for young people to learn about responsibility and commitment. When young people are encouraged to learn the value of native trees, we have some hope of fixing some of the many environmental issues affecting our planet.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I had the pleasure of being involved in Schools Tree Day at Parkside Primary School, which is situated in my electorate. I was met by the Principal, Mr Dennis Harris, and after speaking with staff I attended and spoke at a school assembly that was held to discuss the importance of trees. The children were all extremely keen to partake in the planting of the trees. Eight trees were donated for the day by the Unley City Council. The children divided into groups to plant their trees. There were a few minor dramas and mishapsâlots of dirt and mud, and some very creative ways of getting trees into the groundâbut eventually the trees were all planted and watered in. There was definitely a sense of accomplishment and achievement. I know that they will care for those trees for many years to come.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I congratulate Parkside Primary School, the Principal Dennis Harris, the teachers, the students and the parents for their involvement in Schools Tree Day. It was a great morning and I really enjoyed being part of the excitement and fun. I would also like to congratulate Planet Ark on the success of National Tree Day and Schools Tree Dayâit is a wonderful opportunity for all Australians to get involved. Unley City Council should also be recognised for its contribution. I hope that we will continue to find many endeavours to teach our young people the importance of looking after the environment.</para>

<para>âI rise in the Main Committee today to discuss the very important issue of transport infrastructure on the North Coast of New South Wales. Certainly, we have very strong population growth along that coast and in the cities of Brisbane and Sydney, which results in ever-increasing transport loads for both passengers and freight.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I was delighted to be able recently to announce a federal commitment of some $5 million to assist the Coffs Harbour City Council in the construction of the Hogbin Drive extensionâa vital project that will take up to 15,000 cars a day off the Pacific Highway and provide an alternative route to local traffic, as opposed to having to travel through the centre of town. One of the delightful things about this project is that it is to be completed as a result of a combined effort between federal, local and state governments, each contributing some $5 million to the project costs.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is going to be a great project for Coffs Harbour. It is going to greatly reduce congestion in the main street area, and it will provide superior amenity around the area of the Coffs Harbour jetty, which is an excellent tourist location but currently suffers from the problems of a high degree of through traffic. A large proportion of this through traffic will be taken on Hogbin Drive.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Another major problem which our region faces is the notorious black spot known as Pine Creek. I have certainly been lobbying for quite some time to see the completion of the Bonville Deviation, which will eliminate one of the worst black spots on the Pacific Highway. There have been some 12 deaths in the past two years. It really is a problem. We have seen that improvements to the Pacific Highway have resulted in a shift in the fatigue zones, moving the fatigue zones further north. We have seen improvements closer to Brisbane, we have seen improvements closer to Sydney, but there is a largely unimproved section of the highway in the region of Coffs Harbour and Ballina which is in drastic need of an upgrade. I have certainly been lobbying for the upgrade of the Pacific Highway. I have certainly been very keenly focused on the issue of Pine Creek. That transfer of fatigue zones is a major problem. We see that when it rains and when drivers are fatigued they often come to grief on the notorious set of corners in the Pine Creek area.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Unfortunately, the state government, which had responsibility for construction of these works, has continued to delay them. They were included in the 1998 budget at a cost of some $85 million but, due to delays in getting the work started, the project cost is now estimated to be in the order of $153 million.</para>

<para>âI rise to speak on a matter which has been raised with me by members of the community on a number of occasions and which I am personally very concerned aboutâthat is, the Gulf St Vincent. Gulf St Vincent is the smaller of South Australiaâs two gulfs, and Adelaide is sited on its eastern side. Because of the shape of the gulf and the fact that Kangaroo Island is located at the mouth of it, water flows are slow and pollutants tend to sit in the gulf for quite some time. Gulf St Vincent is host to some of the most diverse plant and animal species that live in temperate climates around the world. It contains some of the most extensive areas of mangrove forests and sea grasses in Australia.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">In 2000, the Senate inquiry into the Gulf St Vincent released its detailed report on the future of the gulf, including 15 recommendations calling for greater coordination amongst the levels of government responsible for the gulf, greater resources for the protection of the gulf and reform of the legislation with regard to coastal protection. Five long years later and the reaction of many is to say, âWhat Senate inquiry?â The recommendations in the report have been ignored by the federal government, and it is time the Minister for the Environment and Heritage dusted off his copy of the report and read it. For his convenience, I am quite happy to quote from the report to highlight the need for immediate action. The report says:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">It is obvious that if the degradation is not addressed today it will be future generations who will be paying for a loss of amenity, a loss of resources and for further remedial works.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I am pleased to say that, luckily for the Gulf St Vincent, a number of the recommendations called on the state government to take action because at least those recommendations are being acted on.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It took a Labor government to come to power in South Australia in 2002 before things started moving. Since then they have allocated $5 million over four years to coastal protection initiatives. They have also strengthened the Environment Protection Authorityâwhich, for the ministerâs reference, was recommendation 10 in the report. They are in the process of overhauling natural resource management, including coastal protection. That was recommendation 11. They have improved the management of and liaison between water catchment management boards, local councils and the relevant state government agencies. That was recommendation 13. The state government has also progressed changes in relation to the use of wells and bores. That was recommendation 2. The Port Adelaide Wastewater Treatment Plant is being upgradedârecommendation 6.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Meanwhile, five years down the track the Commonwealth has done nothing to respond to its responsibility and the recommendations relating to its role in protecting the future of the gulf. The problems of the Gulf St Vincent have not suddenly vanished, and the people who live along the coast have not suddenly forgotten how important it is to care for our coast and our coastal waters. The Friends of Gulf St Vincent, a wonderfully active community group, still meet regularly and their membership and commitment remains strong. So, if the environment minister hopes that the needs of the Gulf St Vincent will be ignored or that the recommendations of the Senate inquiry into the Gulf St Vincent have been forgotten, he is sadly mistaken. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI am pleased to rise in the Main Committee today to laud the sinking of the ex-HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> as a dive wreck off the Sunshine Coast, bringing about a four-year dream. A few years ago I went to see Minister Reith, who gifted the ship to the state of Queensland. For the first time ever, the Australian government placed a proviso that the ship had to be sunk off a certain location, namely the Sunshine Coast.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Over the succeeding years there were a number of altercations between the state and Commonwealth governments with respect to various minutiae concerning the sinking of the ship, but I am pleased that at the end there was a great level of cooperation between the state government and my office and we were able to see the ex-HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> sunk as a dive wreck. In addition to the 34 years of military service she has seen, she will serve her nation as an underwater reef for some 500 years, bringing $22 million into the Queensland economy and 10,000 dive tourists to the Sunshine Coast and also creating 100 new jobs. This really is a win for our local economy and a win for the local marine environment because fish stocks will be boosted. Also, it means that a very fine ship which served her nation on three tours of active duty will continue to serve her nation in another capacity.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I was privileged to go out on the big cat <inline font-style="italic">Verity</inline>, which was the Premierâs boat. A wide cross-section of the Sunshine Coast community was present. I have honestly never seen such a variety and quantity of watercraft as when the ship was being ringed by large numbers of watercraft. When the ship was about five minutes away from sinking, the flares went up and I felt a tinge of sadness because she was a fine ship and we knew that she had just five minutes more above the water. When the detonation occurred and she slowly sank beneath the wavesâit took about 2Â½ minutes for this to occurâshe sank with a great sense of majesty and dignity. While there was a sense of sadness, I think everyone had a great sense of pride that she was going to a new role as a dive wreck and joining a number of other ships off the Australian coastline serving divers, local communities, the marine environment and the economy.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I was very pleased to help bring about the sinking of the ex-HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> off the Sunshine Coast. It has been a long, hard battle. I want to commend former Minister Reith and also Minister Hill. I was pleased to be able to work with the Premier to iron out any difficulties. It proves that cooperation is much better than confrontation. The fact is that the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> is now on the seabed off the Sunshine Coast, boosting our local economy. It is bringing $22 million into the Queensland economy, 10,000 dive tourists and 100 new jobs. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âMy concern today is that poor Indigenous communities and families are being denied access to tens of thousands of dollars to which they are properly entitled by the continuing failure of the Howard government to take action which they acknowledge they should take. Over the years many of us have campaigned for the introduction into Australia of a scheme of resale royalties for visual artists. This would mean that artists would share in the increased value of the art they have created. But the government will not act.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">In recent years the government have received a recommendation that they should introduce such a scheme. But the Howard government have failed to act. It is a great disappointment that once again the governmentâs legislative wish list for this session does not include this important proposal. In the last term the government commissioned a report by Rupert Myer into the visual arts, and this issue was on his agenda. No Australian would be more aware of the interests of those who purchase art than Rupert Myer. Having assessed the evidence, Rupert Myer recommended in a very good report the introduction of such a scheme. But still the government will not act. They are putting out discussion papers but they will not act.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In principle the case is clear, but clear examples have not been easy to establish. In recent times two stark examples have been illustratedâfirst, the case of the late Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri. His work <inline font-style="italic">Emu Corroboree</inline> sold in July for $411,750. This was his very first painting for the Pupunya Tula movement. When first sold, its great significance as a precursor of Australiaâs greatest contemporary art movement was not appreciated. Therefore, I am advised that it originally sold for $100. Now it has resold for over $411,000 and his family and estate get no benefit from that increased value.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Similarly, reports suggest that the Rover Thomas painting <inline font-style="italic">Barramundi Dreaming</inline> is expected to sell later this month for more than $1 million. It was originally purchased for just $1,500. The people who bought that art in the first place did nothing wrong, and in selling it now they are doing nothing wrongâthey bought at the market price and they are selling at the market price. The failure is of the Howard government not to join the majority of other developed countries in the world and have a resale royalty scheme so that not just Indigenous artistsâit is not just Indigenous artists; they are just the starkest examplesâbut all Australian visual artists can share in the increased value that their art creates. Other artists get that benefit through copyright. We need that sort of benefit for visual artists. These two stark examples show that tens of thousands of dollars of earned income could have flowed to these families. We complain about a culture of dependency, but when they earn money we do not create the framework for them to get the benefit. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI rise today to talk about regional communities, particularly the pioneering spirit that exists in them and has throughout their history. I speak in particular of the community of Roseworthy in the electorate of Wakefield. Roseworthy is about eight kilometres north of the township of Gawler. It is a small township built on land originally purchased by Mr Gartrell in 1855. Although he died soon afterwards, his wife, Grace, decided that this would be a good spot to lay out a township. She did that in the expectation that it would grow. Unfortunately, in her lifetime she never saw the township grow beyond a small settlement. Subsequent to that, there was the establishment of things like the agricultural college, and now, many years later, the township is taking off and her dream is being fulfilled. Likewise, the dreams of many people in regional areas to have similar services to those we see in metropolitan areas are being fulfilled; I am talking here particularly of banking.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">One of the things that the Howard government promised during the last election campaign was that it would extend the contracts with Australia Post to provide electronic banking services to small regional communities. I am pleased to say that Mrs Elaine Kenny, who is the postmaster in Roseworthy, has successfully bid for the giroPost services approved for the township of Roseworthy. She put out a petition to see how many people need this service. In two weeks, 273 people from this township came to the post office and recorded the fact that they wanted, needed and would use this service, as one of the regional communities in Wakefield. I am pleased that, under the program of bank and post initiatives that the Howard government has put in place, Roseworthy and about four other townships in Wakefield will receive electronic banking services via the contract with the post office.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The government is providing some $9.7 million over four years to make these services available to an extra 266 post offices. For Roseworthy, this is a good step forward. It is an initiative that is in keeping with the history of the town, a town where John Ridley invented the Ridley Stripper, which transformed the wheat industry in South Australia. I believe that this initiative of the Howard government will transform the ability of people in regional Australia to be able to access online or electronic banking services.</para>

Broadband was not.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">We are online with Customs all day every day of the working week and the connections are so slow that we can wait 10 to 15 minutes just to log on. To move from one screen to the next can take up to two minutes. I have had to filter out all emails over 500 kilobits because, if an email arrives, the Customs programme just stops operating. Unfortunately, some business related emails do not get downloaded until I can take a computer home and use my broadband connection in Hilton to receive the dayâs business.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">As Mr Watkins said, it is a deplorable situation that in mid-2005 a business within 400 metres of an international airport is denied access to broadband. Unfortunately, this is far from the only complaint I have had in my electorate from businesses and households who cannot access basic broadband services from Telstra. Often the situation is just as farcical as that related by Mr Watkins. I have had many complaints from people in Swan about Telstraâs often-used tactic of promising residents access to broadband on a trial basis, delivering that service for the period of the trial and then informing customersâlo and beholdâthat, despite being able to provide broadband, the service is not available on a permanent basis. In many cases, residents have actually changed internet providers to take advantage of the Telstra trial, only to find that the service is not available in the long term.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I can understand why there is much concern in the context of the sale of Telstra about services in rural and regional Australia. Having been a farmer myself for some six years in Western Australia, I sympathise with the need to ensure that services in rural Australia are up to scratch, but I think that the political preoccupation of the Howard government with services in the bush has overshadowed the needs of those who live in the cities, as was pointed out yesterday by the member for Lindsay. Telstraâs failure to deliver adequate broadband to my electorate is an indictment of its infrastructure investment program.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">You would expect that, at present, when Telstra is under the spotlight given its proposed sale, the company would be moving heaven and earth to improve its services throughout Australia. You would expect Telstra to be currently demonstrating its corporate âbest behaviourâ. If this is best behaviour, the only conclusion that can be drawn is that it is far from good enough. It is vital that the government undertake to deliver broadband to all Australians. That should be the overriding objective of the government in the debate about telecommunications. At the end of the day, if the only way to ensure that this objective is met is to require a minimum broadband service under the universal service obligation, then so be it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para pgwide="yes">Townsville has been put in the spotlight by media outlets across Australia in the past few weeks, but for the wrong reasons. Once again, the Townsville Hospital has made the headlines. The Morris inquiry was held in Townsville last week and uncovered even more disturbing issues. The inquiry exposed the fact that a psychiatrist with forged qualifications was able to work at the hospitalâs mental health unit and treat patients. Just as disturbing was the fact that Queensland Health covered it up. I ask the question: is this the only thing that it has covered up? Of course not. However, I was just as disappointed to hear that the Morris inquiry highlighted the ongoing issue of workplace bullying, increased workloads and low morale in the Townsville Hospital. But it appears that Townsville Hospital is just one of the many hospitals around Queensland suffering from underfunding and understaffing by the Beattie government.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I must say, I was disappointed that the allegations of Medicare fraud occurring at the Townsville Hospital were not brought up at the Morris inquiry. If these allegations are true, then it is not just fraud on the Australian government; it is also fraud on the patients involved. Now the hospital is being investigated by the Australian government, Queensland Health, CMC and the Health Insurance Commission into Medicare fraud claims. Just yesterday, the new Queensland health minister was unable to answer a straightforward question about his policy on secret waiting lists or what advice he would give to waiting patients. He could not give an answer to the Liberalsâ question. The Liberal shadow minister for health, Dr Bruce Flegg, tabled documents showing that the Queensland government had introduced a second secret waiting list for some categories of surgeryâanother example of Mr Beattie putting the dollar at the top of his list of priorities, rather than patientsâ lives.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Townsville Hospital differs from other hospitals around the state because it delivers care to patients from all over North Queensland and as far away as Papua New Guinea. For some time the hospital has been 100 per cent full, 100 per cent of the time. Last month, the hospital was forced to cancel surgery cases. I put the blame squarely on the shoulders of the Beattie government for letting down the people of North Queensland. An extra $23 million is needed now to address the overcrowding at the Townsville Hospital. Despite this desperate need for the hospital to be provided with proper funding, the state government provided no funding in their latest budget. Once again, Townsville was overlooked in favour of the south-east corner.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The list of the problems with the stateâs health system continues to grow, while the people of North Queensland continue to suffer from inadequate public health care. However, instead of taking up the challenge, Mr Beattie continues to concentrate on the wrong priorities. This week Mr Beattie attempted to take the spotlight off the stateâs health crisis in another of his media stunts and instead put the focus on the Australian governmentâs proposed industrial relations reforms. I call on Mr Beattie to step up to the challenge and concentrate on fixing the real problems facing his constituents. These latest incidents strengthen the argument that it is perhaps time for the Australian government to take over the Queensland hospital system.</para>

</talker>
<para>âLabor supports the <inline ref="R2323">Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Protection of Submarine Cables and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline>. This bill is the product of extensive consultation and addresses a pressing need to better protect critically important submarine fibre optic telecommunications cables. As was noted by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources during earlier debate on this bill, the overseas voice and data traffic that travels over these cables is worth more than $5 billion a year to the Australian economy.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Around 99 per cent of international data and voice traffic entering and leaving Australia is transported on submarine optical fibre cables. On top of this, the majority of this traffic is carried on just a handful of these submarine telecommunications cables. As such, any damage to one of these major submarine cables that prevented the cable from being able to carry traffic would cause dramatic disruption and delays to data and voice transmissions into and out of Australia. Such disruptions and delays would have a dramatic impact not only on the cable owners but also on the productivity of all Australian businesses relying on international data transmission.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In todayâs information economy, this would include almost every business in Australia, whether directly affected immediately by any sort of damage or indirectly, because they are associated with some other business which is affected. In summary, these cables are so important to the Australian economy that not even a fully privatised Telstra would be silly enough to allow them to fall into disrepairâat least, we hope that would be the case.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Despite their importance, these submarine cables are currently not adequately protected by the Australian telecommunications regulatory regime. Submarine telecommunications cables in Australian waters are currently vulnerable to damage from a multitude of activities, including trawling, anchoring and dredging. While the locations of these submarine telecommunications cables are well known and are marked on most maritime maps, accidents causing damage to cables have occurred in the past. The fact that these cables have been damaged on a number of occasions, despite their critical importance to the Australian economy, indicates that the existing regulatory regime is not up to the job of protecting these important pieces of national infrastructure.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The existing Submarine Cables and Pipelines Protection Act 1963 provides only nominal deterrence to the public engaging in activities that might risk damaging such a cable. The current penalties for causing damage to this critical infrastructure are a maximum fine of just $2,000 or imprisonment for just 12 months. When you consider just how important this critical infrastructure is to Australiaâs economy, these paltry sums and sentences seem woefully inadequate. These penalties are clearly not in proportion to the consequences of causing damage to these cables.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The existing legislation is also limited to retrospective sanctions for damage to cables and does not include any substantive prospective arrangements for prevention of damage in the first instance. The Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Protection of Submarine Cables and Other Measures) Bill 2005 attempts to remedy this situation. The bill increases the level of protection provided for submarine cables, by allowing the Australian Communications and Media Authority to declare protection zones around cables of national significance.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The bill further prohibits certain activities within protection zones that are likely to damage the relevant cables, such as trawling, dredging, mining and any work done around those critical areas. The bill permits other activities that pose a lesser threat to the integrity of these cablesâsuch as mid-sea fishing; the installation of wharves, jetties and boat ramps; and the laying of electricity cables, gas pipelines and suchâaccording to conditions prescribed by the ACMA.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Australian Federal Police will be responsible for policing the prohibitions, which is a vast improvement on the current state of affairs under which the owners of these submarine cables support advisory patrols of the areas surrounding the cables to attempt to head off any activities that may cause damage. That is a situation which is untenable in the long term and does not provide the sort of protection that is necessary in the current environment to protect this critical infrastructure for Australia.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The creation of protection zones, as opposed to simply imposing fines for causing damage, has the added benefit of encouraging the builders of smaller cables to co-locate their cables in the protection zones to enjoy the protection provided by that area and that zoning. This co-location will produce further benefits in the future by increasing the coordination of the laying of submarine fibre-optic cables in Australia. It is likely that, once a protection zone is established for the benefit of a cable of national significance, other cable owners will see the benefits of installing their submarine cables within the boundaries of the protection zone in order to piggyback on the benefits of protection provided by those zones. This effect will, hopefully, avoid the spaghetti bowl style installations of these cables that have emerged in countries like the United States. It is unlikely that the creation of these protection zones will have a substantial impact on coastal communities and those who use the sea and seabed in affected areas.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Protection zones can only be created around cables of national significance. As such, very few areas will be affected by this legislation: possibly as few as 10 cables of national significance will be covered by the legislation. Further, before a protection zone may be declared by the ACMA, the ACMA is required to consult with users of the sea and seabed in the affected area through an advisory committee that will include representation from affected parties. Before declaring a protection zone, ACMA will have to develop and publish a protection zone proposal and invite and consider public comment on that proposal. Labor considers that the bill makes adequate provision for ensuring that affected parties are consulted about the establishment of protection zones.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The bill includes heavy penalties for engaging in prohibited activities within the protection zones. These penalties are broadly in line with those that apply in Australia for damaging analogous submarine infrastructureâfor example, penalties for damaging submarine gas pipelines or electricity lines. Bringing these penalties into line in this way is appropriate, as telecommunications infrastructure is just as important to the Australian economy as resources infrastructure is. Australiaâs telecommunications and IT industries are two of the most important sectors of the Australian economy. These cables are their connection to the international marketâif you like, their lifeline to those marketsâalthough, given Australiaâs current $19 billion information technology trade deficit, there is clearly far more information coming into Australia through these pipes than is going out.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The bill provides that the owners of the submarine cables will be able to seek compensation for any loss caused by a person damaging a submarine cable. This statutory right of compensation will clear up some existing jurisdictional uncertainties with respect to the rights of submarine cable owners and provide increased certainty of investment for these operators.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In summary, this bill is a sensible approach to addressing a longstanding risk to the Australian telecommunications sector. The Labor Party would be happy if the government protected all Australian telecommunications infrastructure this well instead of allowing Telstra to run down its rural network in a bid to maximise the governmentâs return from its efforts to force through the sale of Telstra. Unfortunately, we in the Australian Labor Party realise that this is far too much to ask of this government, which is out of touch on this issue. It is something that we see not only daily out in the community but also now in the Senate when we see the sort of bullying tactics of people such as Senator Heffernanâ</para>

</talker>
<para>âI rise today to support the <inline ref="R2323">Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Protection of Submarine Cables and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline>, an important piece of legislation proposed by this government. I say âimportantâ because at this stage we are concerned about the lack of security for submarine fibre-optic telecommunications cables. There has been extensive consultation with and broad support from stakeholders for this bill, and a number of internal regulatory models have been examined.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">This bill establishes for the first time a regulatory regime to protect submarine telecommunications cables that link Australia to global networks which are vital to the national economy. It also changes the arrangements for payment of compensation in the event of an acquisition of property under provisions of the Telecommunications Act 1997. It will provide benefits to the fishing industry and other users of the sea and seabed by clarifying the responsibilities of both carriers and users, and by encouraging co-location of telecommunications cables.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There are nine submarine cables landing in Australia which carry almost all of our international voice and data traffic and are worth more than $5 billion a year to the economy. There are currently three cables which may satisfy requirements to be designated âcables of national significanceâ. They are: the Australia-Japan cable, which links Sydney to Japan and then the US; the Southern Cross cable network, which links Sydney with New Zealand and Fiji and then the US; and the SEA-ME-WE3 cable that links Perth with Jakarta, Singapore and then Europe.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">A protection zone will reach from the shore to the limit of Australiaâs exclusive economic zone or to the edge of the continental shelf, whichever is further. This will span state-controlled coastal waters, up to three nautical miles from shore; Commonwealth-controlled territorial seas, up to 12 nautical miles; and the economic exclusive zone, up to 200 nautical miles. A nominal location is used as it may not be possible to specify exactly the location of a submarine cable over its full length. In the case of a single cable of national significance, a protection zone area consists of an area not more than one nautical mile either side of the cable. In the case of more than one cable of national significance, a protection zone area will consist of the area between each cable and not more than one nautical mile from the outside edge of each of the outermost cables.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The cables are easily damaged by ships anchoring and trawling operations. They are expensive and time consuming to repair. Submarine cables have been damaged several times in recent years. This causes enormous disruption and we need this legislation to effectively protect against that. This legislation allows the Australian Communications and Media Authority, ACMA, to determine protection zones. The zones would extend a nautical mile either side of the cables and run to the edge of the Australian exclusive economic zone.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The legislation restricts or prohibits marine activities in protection zones, with heavy penalties applying for damaging submarine cables or engaging in any prohibited activities in those areas. Under the bill, the penalty for damaging cables in a protection zone can be up to 600 penalty units and 10 years imprisonment. The current penalties are very limited and minimal. The prohibited activities include fishing where equipment operates near the seabed, anchoring, dredging and mining.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The final component of this legislation is to make it clear that carriers are liable to pay any just term compensation arising as a result of a successful claim of acquisition of property. It will be an offence in a protected zone to damage a submarine cable, to negligently damage a submarine cable or to engage in any of those prohibited or restricted activities as specified by ACMA in the protection zone declaration. As the volume of international voice and data traffic increases, and as Australian businesses become ever more globalised, the need for reliable international communications links will increase. It is right that the government proposes this bill, as it is a matter of national importance. We must be involved in the protection of these cables, which are literally our links to our international partners.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This contrasts markedly, however, with the need for government to be involved in the provision of domestic infrastructure for telecommunications, except perhaps where there is not a commercial market. There is no place for government in a developed country in the telecommunications market. We ought to remove ourselves from the telecommunications industry and allow for true competition to improve services and move the technology forward. The introduction of new technology into the more remote locations of Australia has in recent times been improved markedly by the introduction of direct-tendering processesâa transparent system whereby the taxpayers of this country have provided for those additional services in remote Australia. The latest experience in that regard, of course, in 2001 saw the introduction, for the first time, of untimed local calls to some 38,000 subscribers in the most remote parts of Australia. That was a service introduced by this government in a transparent process. Tenders were called, and for the sum of $150 million those 38,000 remote area telephone clients had untimed local calls for the first time.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Thus, when it comes to the provision of improved technology for communications in Australia, it will not be at the behest of or as a result of some charitable act by a telco in Australia. It will be because backbenchers will consider that their constituents require the most updated communication processes available, will argue their case through the proper process and will convince ministers and colleagues that taxpayersâ funds ought to be spent.</para>

<para>âWe of course are discussing a different topic here today. That is, as a good government, our concern for the protection of very important international communications infrastructure that, quite rightly, ought to be the responsibility of good governance. We propose this legislation, then, to secure this vital infrastructure and to protect it in such a way that all those participating in the area will know beforehand exactly what the exclusion zone is and what the penalties might be for breaching that exclusion zone, so that we create a more informed industry when it comes to marine operations, fishing, mining et cetera. All will be forewarned as to the significance of this vital infrastructure and the penalties for breaching such exclusion zones. It gives me a great deal of pleasure to strongly support this bill today.</para>

<para>âIt is my pleasure to sum up the debate on the <inline ref="R2323">Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Protection of Submarine Cables and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline> this morning. At the outset, I want to thank those members who have contributed to this debate. This bill creates a regulatory scheme to enable the Australian Communications and Media Authority, otherwise known as the ACMA, to establish protection zones over submarine telecommunications cables that link Australia to global networks and that are vital to our national economy.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I would like to briefly reiterate the importance of this bill and emphasise why the government is committed to protecting this vital infrastructure. Nine submarine telecommunications cables carry almost all of Australiaâs overseas voice and data traffic and are worth more than $5 billion a year to the Australian economy. Three of these cablesâtwo landing in Sydney and one in Perthâare currently of particular significance to the Australian economy because of their high capacity.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">These cables are vulnerable to damage by operations such as the anchoring of ships, certain types of fishing, the dumping of materials at sea, dredging and other activities that take place on the seabed where these cables are laid. Submarine cables have been damaged several times in recent years. Repairing broken or damaged cables is an expensive and time-consuming exercise. Cable damage or breakage impedes information flow, which affects the capacity of Australians and particularly Australian businesses to conduct international transactions and affairs.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The volume of overseas communicationsâvoice and data, both business and personalâis increasing and will continue to do so in the future. Thus any disruption of Australiaâs communication links with the world can cause delays, disruptions and unnecessary costs, not only to the owners of the cables but to the many people who rely on them for their daily business affairs.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Under this bill, the ACMA will be authorised to declare protection zones over submarine cables of national significance. Within these protection zones, activities that are particularly dangerous to submarine cables will be prohibited. Other, less dangerous activities will be restricted. Passage of this bill will establish a protection regime for telecommunications submarine cables that will provide a comprehensive and transparent process for the protection of these nationally significant cables.</para>

<para>Notes to the Statistics</para>
<para>The statistics relate to services that were rendered on a âfee-for-serviceâ basis for which benefits were processed by the Health Insurance Commission in 2002, 2003 and 2004.</para>
<para>Since the statistics sought relate to (services provided) âin â¦â the statistics were compiled from Medicare data by servicing provider postcode. Medicare statistics by electorate published on the Department of Health and Ageing web site were compiled from patient enrolment postcode data.</para>
<para>In compiling the statistics, where a postcode overlapped electoral boundaries, the data were allocated to electorate using a concordance file derived from population census data. This can result in some data being erroneously allocated to an adjoining electorate. Data have been excluded if postcodes were not present on the concordance file.</para>
<para>Caution should be exercised in interpreting Medicare statistics by region of provider. Electorates containing major hospitals and health facilities and electorates that encompass major regional centres will have higher rates of service provision.</para>

<para>The most recently published statistics on individuals and families who have reached Extended Medicare Safety Net thresholds, and on Extended Medicare Safety Net benefits, have regard to claims processed by the Health Insurance Commission (HIC) up to and including 31 July 2004. Statistics relating to families registered are as at 29 August 2004.</para>
<para>The statistics were compiled from postcode level data (postcode of the head of the household, otherwise postcode of the oldest member of the family) and are based on 2001 electorate boundaries.</para>
<para>Where a postcode overlapped electorate boundaries, statistics were allocated to electorate using a concordance file derived from population census data. This can result in some data being erroneously allocated to an adjoining electorate. Data for people using post office boxes or private mail bags are excluded from electorate reporting as this cannot be appropriately allocated. Data have also been excluded if postcodes were not present on the concordance files.</para>
<para>The statistics on families and individuals who appear to have reached the Safety Net thresholds, include families and individuals who need to verify that they have paid the full fee charged, where claims have been lodged with the HIC prior to paying the treating practitioner (unsubstantiated claims).</para>

<para>Notes to the Tables:</para>
<para>The most recently published statistics on individuals and families who have reached Extended Medicare Safety Net thresholds, have regard to claims processed by the Health Insurance Commission (HIC) up to and including 31 July 2004.</para>
<para>The statistics were compiled from postcode level data (postcode of the head of the household, otherwise postcode of the oldest member of the family) and are based on 2001 electorate boundaries.</para>
<para>Where a postcode overlapped electorate boundaries, statistics were allocated to electorate using a concordance file derived from population census data. This can result in some data being erroneously allocated to an adjoining electorate. Data for people using post office boxes or private mail bags are excluded from electorate reporting as this cannot be appropriately allocated. Data have also been excluded if postcodes were not present on the concordance files.</para>
<para>The statistics include families and individuals who appear to have reached the Safety Net threshold, but who need to verify that they have paid the full fee charged, where claims have been lodged with the HIC prior to paying the treating practitioner (unsubstantiated claims).</para>

<para>Notes to the Tables:</para>
<para>The most recently published statistics on individuals and families who have reached Extended Medicare Safety Net thresholds, and on Extended Medicare Safety Net benefits, have regard to claims processed by the Health Insurance Commission (HIC) up to and including 31 July 2004. Statistics relating to families registered are as at 29 August 2004.</para>
<para>The statistics were compiled from postcode level data (postcode of the head of the household, otherwise postcode of the oldest member of the family) and are based on 2001 electorate boundaries.</para>
<para>Where a postcode overlapped electorate boundaries, statistics were allocated to electorate using a concordance file derived from population census data. This can result in some data being erroneously allocated to an adjoining electorate. Data for people using post office boxes or private mail bags are excluded from electorate reporting as this cannot be appropriately allocated. Data have also been excluded if postcodes were not present on the concordance files.</para>
<para>The statistics on families and individuals who appear to have reached the Safety Net thresholds, include families and individuals who need to verify that they have paid the full fee charged, where claims have been lodged with the HIC prior to paying the treating practitioner (unsubstantiated claims).</para>

<para>Since the statistics sought relate to âservices provided in â¦â the statistics were compiled from Medicare data by servicing provider postcode. Medicare statistics by electorate published on the Department of Health and Ageing web site were compiled from patient enrolment postcode data.</para>
<para>In compiling the statistics, where a postcode overlapped electoral boundaries, the data were allocated to electorate using a concordance file derived from population census data. This can result in some data being erroneously allocated to an adjoining electorate. Data have been excluded if postcodes were not present on the concordance file.</para>
<para>Caution should be exercised in interpreting Medicare statistics by region of provider. Electorates containing major hospitals and health facilities and electorates that encompass major regional centres will have higher rates of service provision.</para>
<para>Services per capita statistics were compiled using ABS population estimates at 30 June of the respective years. Since ABS population estimates by electorate are not yet available for 2004, the per capita estimates for 2004 were based on population estimates for 2003.</para>

<para>Statistical Notes</para>
<para>These statistics relate to all providers of at least one service on a âfee-for-serviceâ basis and for which Medicare benefits were processed by the Health Insurance Commission in the years in question. Excluded are details of services to public patients in hospital, to Department of Veteransâ Affairs patients and some compensation cases.</para>
<para>The simple headcounts given above do not account for differences in the number of services claimed and will include a high proportion of casual and part-time practitioners. Therefore it will not accurately represent the supply of doctors.</para>
<para>It is for this reason that Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) practitioner is the statistic used in the population ratios given above. FTE is a standardised measure to estimate the number of full-time doctors which adjusts for the partial contribution of casual and part-time doctors. FTE is calculated by dividing each doctorâs Medicare billing by the average billing of full-time doctors for the reference period. Where the doctorâs Medicare billing is greater than or equal to the mean billing of full-time doctors, then the FTE is capped at one.</para>
<para>In general terms, General Practitioners are those practitioners with at least 50% of Schedule fee income from non-referred (GP) attendances in the June quarter of the years in question.</para>
<para>These statistics were compiled from Medicare data on the basis of servicing provider postcode. In compiling statistics for federal electoral division boundaries, statistics by servicing provider postcode were mapped to electorate according to the proportion of the population of each postcode in each federal electoral division.</para>
<para>State-level statistics were compiled by allocating each postcode to a single state only. National statistics are the aggregate of all providers.</para>
<para>Electorate information is based on boundaries for the 2004 Commonwealth Electorate Divisions (CED) and, where possible, the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) for each CED as at June 30 for each year, as calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). Significant changes to the CED boundaries and population occurred in a number of states. Data in this report should not be compared to previous data published at an electorate level which uses superseded CED boundaries and population figures. These figures can not be aggregated to state and national totals.</para>
<para>State and national information for each financial year is based on the mean ERP for each reference period and is derived from ABS Australian Demographic Statistics 3101.0 Table 4.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The authoritative source of information on specialists is the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) which both receives registration renewal data from each state and territory medical board, and conducts regular surveys. AIHW data is free and can be accessed on their website www.aihw.gov.au. This information is not broken down by region. Specialists are a mobile workforce, with many areas receiving specialist services from visiting specialists based in other areas. Neither AIHW nor the Department of Health and Ageing have any data which would enable this to be quantified.</para>

<para>Statistical Notes</para>
<para>These statistics relate to all providers of at least one service on a âfee-for-serviceâ basis and for which Medicare benefits were processed by the Health Insurance Commission in the years in question. Excluded are details of services to public patients in hospital, to Department of Veteransâ Affairs patients and some compensation cases.</para>
<para>The simple headcounts given above do not account for differences in the number of services claimed and will include a high proportion of casual and part-time practitioners. Therefore it will not accurately represent the supply of doctors.</para>
<para>It is for this reason that âFull-Time Equivalentâ (FTE) practitioner is the statistic used in the population ratios given above. FTE is a standardised measure to estimate the number of full-time doctors which adjusts for the partial contribution of casual and part-time doctors. FTE is calculated by dividing each doctorâs Medicare billing by the average billing of full-time doctors for the reference period. Where the doctorâs Medicare billing is greater than or equal to the mean billing of full-time doctors, then the FTE is capped at one.</para>
<para>In general terms, General Practitioners are those practitioners with at least 50% of Schedule fee income from non-referred (GP) attendances in the June quarter of the years in question.</para>
<para>These statistics were compiled from Medicare data on the basis of servicing provider postcode. In compiling statistics for federal electoral division boundaries, statistics by servicing provider postcode were mapped to electorate according to the proportion of the population of each postcode in each federal electoral division.</para>
<para>State-level statistics were compiled by allocating each postcode to a single state only. National statistics are the aggregate of all providers.</para>
<para>Electorate information is based on boundaries for the 2004 Commonwealth Electorate Divisions (CED) and, where possible, the Estimated Resident Population (ERP) for each CED as at June 30 for each year, as calculated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). Significant changes to the CED boundaries and population occurred in a number of states. Data in this report should not be compared to previous data published at an electorate level which uses superseded CED boundaries and population figures. These figures can not be aggregated to state and national totals.</para>
<para>State and national information for each financial year is based on the mean ERP for each reference period and is derived from ABS Australian Demographic Statistics 3101.0 Table 4.</para>

<para>Yes. Throughout the recall process, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) required suppliers of unregistered ionisers to include instructions to pool owners to use the ioniser system in conjunction with chlorine. Based on the information before it, the APVMA considered this necessary to ensure adequate sanitation of the pools to protect users from human pathogens.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>Yes. The Commonwealth Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) directed the APVMA to issue the permits that recommend the use of chlorine. That direction was in respect of two particular ioniser systems, a component of which is a peroxygen oxidiser. The AAT considered that there was limited evidence that the copper/silver ions together with this peroxygen oxidiser might have some degree of sanitising effect. Only a few ioniser systems on the market rely upon this combination of chemicals.</para>

<para>The APVMA has a number of stakeholder consultative committees. These are not decision-making committees, but provide a forum for liaison between the APVMA and its various stakeholder groups â the community and rural organisations, the industry, and State/Commonwealth agencies involved in the National Registration Scheme. Its key industry consultative committee is the Industry Liaison Committee (ILC), a technical sub-group of which is the Industry Technical Committee (ITC). The key purpose of the ILC/ITC is to provide a forum for consultation between the APVMA and peak industry bodies â it does not make regulatory decisions. The following industry associations are represented â Avcare Ltd, Aerosol Association of Australia Ltd, ACCORD Australasia Ltd, Nursery and Garden Industry Association, Pet Industry Association of Australia Ltd, Plastics and Chemicals Industries Association, Swimming Pool and Spa Association of Australia, Veterinary Manufacturers and Distributors Association, and Generic Agricultural Chemical Association.</para>

At the time of their establishment, each of these music services created a new offering within the radio market.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">dig, the ABCâs first internet radio station, launched in July 2002, was established because ABC Radio recognised there was a considerable segment of the radio audience not well served - people over 30 who want an interesting, eclectic and alternative mix of music that they cannot get from existing radio services, either ABC, commercial or community stations on a consistent basis.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The ABC is keen to explore opportunities to provide services to meet the needs of audiences that are not adequately served by existing national or commercial stations.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">While the ABC would prefer dig to be available as an FM network, there is a shortage of FM frequencies. There is no FM spectrum available in the major capital cities and other large centres. Consequently, the ABC is focusing on digital radio and the potential for new services.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">dig offers a stream of diverse music, the latest in music news, audio features on demand including reviews, concerts and interviews and engaging interactive content. Two new music streams have been added to the original service: digJAZZ (from November 2004) and digCOUNTRY (from January 2005).</para>

<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>The Minister for Trade, the Hon Mark Vaile MP, represented Australia at the OECD Ministerial Council Meeting on 3-4 May 2005.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>The OECD Ministerial Council Meeting issued a Chairâs Summary, OECD Statement to the Follow-up of the UN Millennium Declaration and Monterrey Consensus, in lieu of a communiquÃ©. The OECD Statement is consistent with the Monterrey Consensus and the UN Millennium Declaration which Australia supports. This Statement reaffirms the importance of resources and the need to use aid more effectively, including the importance of stable and predictable financial flows, the need for policy coherence, the importance of dialogue and a well-functioning multilateral system, and the need for the OECD to strengthen its partnership with developing countries and other international organisations.</para>
<para>Australia supports the UN target of 0.7 per cent ratio of Official Development Assistance to Gross National Income (ODA/GNI). The Australian Government endeavours to maintain our ODA at the highest level consistent with the needs of partner countries, Australiaâs capacity to assist and other priorities for Australian Government expenditure.</para>
<para>In 2005-06, the Australian Government will provide an estimated $2.491 billion in ODA. This is an increase of $358 million - almost 12 per cent - over the 2004-05 budget figure and a real increase of 5.8 per cent over the 2004-05 expected outcome of $2.235 billion. This represents the fifth successive annual increase in the real value of Australiaâs ODA, and brings Australiaâs ODA in 2005-06 to an estimated 24 per cent greater in real terms than was provided in 1995-96. Australiaâs ODA/GNI ratio for 2005-06 is estimated at 0.28 per cent, placing Australia above the latest available weighted OECD Development Assistance Committee donor average of 0.25 per cent for 2004.</para>

</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Since 1996-97, this Government has been responsible for the repayment of around $90 billion of debt, strengthening the Governmentâs financial position and contributing to the strong performance of the Australian economy. The interest saving from not having to service that debt is around $5.7Â billion every year; money that can now be used in important areas like health, education, national security and infrastructure.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Maintaining low debt and good management of the Budget have allowed the Government to invest significantly in infrastructure. InÂ JuneÂ 2004, the Government announced its strategic longâterm land transport policy, AusLink, a massive investment in Australiaâs road and rail infrastructure. Under AusLink, the Australian Government will spend $12 billion on land transport infrastructure between 2004-05 and 2008-09. However, the vast majority of responsibility for infrastructure lies with the state and territory governments, who are financially well placed to deal with infrastructure needs. In 2005â06, the Australian Government will provide an estimated $64.8Â billion to the states and territories, including GST revenue.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">In March 2005, the Government established an infrastructure taskforce to identify any bottlenecks of a physical or regulatory kind in the operation of Australiaâs infrastructure which may impede the full realisation of our export opportunities. The Taskforce found there were localised capacity constraints, particularly for coal export infrastructure, but that there was no infrastructure crisis. At its meeting on 3Â June 2005, the Council of Australian Governments agreed with this conclusion.</para>

<para>Yes, it was registered in 2003 as being similar to other products that were registered in the early 1980s prior to the formation of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) - then the National Registration Authority (NRA).</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>The regulator for these products in the European Union (EU) has recently confirmed to the APVMA that the active ingredient in Aquacadabra, polihexanide, has not been banned in any of the member states of the EU. It is scheduled for review in the EU in 2007 with a report due in 2008. The principal manufacturer of this chemical, headquartered in the United Kingdom, has advised that it has not been banned anywhere in the world.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>The APVMA is not aware of any reports of anaphylactic shock arising from the use of Aquacadabra in swimming pools or of any adverse reactions in Australia to products containing polihexanide. The United States Environment Protection Agency (US EPA) has not raised anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock as issues of concern in its most recent overview of potential health effects of polihexanide on humans. No reports of anaphylaxis were found in its extensive databases.</para>
<para>In November 2004, the Office of Chemical Safety (OCS) in the Department of Human Health and Ageing conducted an evaluation of the scientific evidence and literature regarding anaphylaxis in humans associated with exposure to polihexanide in response to a request from the APVMA. The OCS evaluation found that anaphylaxis related to polihexanide is very rare with only two cases being identified internationally. These related to the application of a medical disinfectant containing 0.02% (200 mg/L) polihexanide to damaged skin.</para>
<para>The Therapeutic Goods Administrationâs Adverse Drug Reaction Section and Medical Devices Section have not received any reports of adverse reactions in Australia associated with the medical disinfectant and the APVMA is not aware of any adverse experience reports relating to the use of the chemical in swimming pools or other products.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>The original product on which the registration of Lo-Chlor Aquacadabra Pool Sanitiser was granted was first registered prior to the foundation of the APVMA (originally known as the NRA) and therefore originally was assessed under the previous State and Territory registration systems. Products containing this active ingredient have been in use in Australia since the early 1980âs.</para>
<para>Further to the initial evaluation in relation to anaphylaxis conducted in 2004, the APVMA is currently undertaking a review of potential public health risks that might be associated with the uses of polihexanide, the active ingredient in Aquacadabra. This review follows a draft report from the US EPA of a potential carcinogenic effect in laboratory animals exposed to extremely high doses of polihexanide.</para>

<para>The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) does not provide specific registration guidelines for each individual active. An active is the substance in a formulated chemical product that is primarily responsible for the biological or other effects that make the product an agricultural or veterinary product. However, the APVMA released new guidelines for demonstrating the efficacy of swimming and spa pool sanitiser products in July 2004. In addition, the APVMA examined its criteria for other aspects of registration of pool sanitisers, including chlorine, and incorporated that outcome into the recent revision of the APVMA Manual of Requirements and Guidelines.</para>
<para>The APVMA (and the agencies that provide advice to it) regularly monitor international developments on chemicals that are contained in registered products. Additionally, registrants are required to advise the APVMA when they become aware of any adverse information on currently registered products. If information of concern comes to the APVMAâs attention, the APVMA has the power to reconsider and modify a productâs registration including stopping the use of a product or its active ingredient entirely if necessary. The APVMA is not aware of any recent information that would indicate a reconsideration of chlorine or stabilised chlorine products is necessary.</para>

<item label="(2)">
<para>Prior to the formation of the APVMA, agreement was reached to exclude products that contain cyanuric acid as a chlorine stabiliser; that is, such products were declared not to be âagricultural chemical productsâ by the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Regulations. This agreement followed historical precedent set by the previous individual State and Territory systems of registration. Therefore, the APVMA does not regulate these products and does not have a database of their label information.</para>
<para>The APVMA, however, is aware that cyanuric acid is a schedule 5 poison in the Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Drugs and Poisons (SUSDP). The Statesâ poisons legislation therefore requires the words âCAUTIONâ and âKEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDRENâ to be shown prominently on the top of the front panel of the label of any products containing this substance.</para>
