<para>âAs Chair of the Trade Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present this report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Expanding Australiaâs trade and investment relations with the Gulf States.</inline> It is a report that you would be familiar with, Mr Speaker, having been part of that very esteemed delegation. The report is the product of an inquiry conducted by the trade subcommittee through 2003-04. It follows a report of the delegationâs visit to the region which was tabled on 21 June 2004. The terms of reference for the inquiry were referred to the committee by the Minister for Trade on 14 August 2003.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Over the last decade Australiaâs exports to the Middle East have been growing dramatically. Traditionally a strong primary producer export destination, Australiaâs exports of elaborately transformed manufactures to the Gulf grew significantly in the 1990s. Australian produced cars are one outstanding example. It is quite common in visiting the Middle East to find cars that have been rebadged from Commodores, which we have here in Australia, to Chevrolets. One of the key features of our visit was noticing the extent to which Australian car exports had been successful in the gulf.</para>
<para>The dramatic growth in Australiaâs exports to the gulf has created fresh interest in the region. Consequently, in mid-2003, the Trade Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade decided to inquire into Australiaâs trade and investment relations with the Gulf States, to better understand the reasons for success and how Australia might build on its achievements in the region. During the course of the inquiry a delegation of committee members travelled to the region and later tabled a visit report in June 2004.</para>
<para>The committee found that the Gulf Statesâ special role within the world economy, in combination with their young population, has placed them in a unique position. In fact, as you would be aware, Mr Speaker, Dubai is now one of the fastest growing cities in the world. We have seen a phenomenal growth rate in areas such as Shanghai but Dubai is rivalling it. We have about 22 per cent of the population of the Emirates; the rest are drawn from all over the world. There are some 5,000 Australians in Dubai alone.</para>
<para>The committee believes that resource wealth and young populations are the twin drivers of development of the Gulf States. To accommodate these large young majorities, gulf governments have committed to rapid economic development. In some areas of these countries we discovered that 70 per cent of the population is under 30. Of course we would like to have some of those demographics in Australia. There are incredible growth rates and incredible youth demographics. The governments are committed to providing employment opportunities for their young populations and therefore stability and prosperity in the longer term. Unlike many other countries, however, the Gulf States have the financial means to fully fund such rapid development. This is partly driven by the oil revenues which have been flowing significantly for some time. As part of the stimulus of places such as Dubai, as oil revenues for the Dubai area of the Emirates are being depleted, the Emirates is looking for a new orientation, including the development of Emirates airlines and the development of Dubai as a tourist destination.</para>
<para>In light of the dramatic growth of the region and the development plans of gulf governments, the committee found several sectors to be particularly promising for Australia. These include building and constructionâmany high-rise developments are taking place, including those using the major Australian company, Multiplex, in the construction of some of the buildings which are 40-plus storeys tallâengineering and related consulting; agriculture, including food and beverages; health care and pharmaceutical services; education and training; tourism and tourism training; a large range of consumables; information and communication technology products and services; and financial services. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> They are part of the recommendations that we have developed from that visit. In addressing obstacles to the growth of Australiaâs trade and investment relations with the region, this report makes 10 recommendations. The recommendations can be divided into two categories: those relating to government policy and those relating to the deployment of government resources.</para>
<para>In the first category, the committee recommends a range of measures to improve the trade and investment environment between Australia and the Gulf States. These include arranging strategic high-level visits to the region by Australian government and industry. The response to our committeeâs visit was such that we were encouraged to see other missions coming through the region. Some significant visits by key ministers to the area would encourage our overall trade and investment agenda. We know that the Minister for Trade has been there several times and was well received.</para>
<para>The first category of measures also recommends the pursuit of memoranda of understanding and other arrangements to create predictability and stability in the trading relationships and the holding of high level symposia with Iran to develop potential in key sectors. This was at their encouragement as they felt that they would have much to learn from Australia in dry land farming and many of our agricultural techniques. It is very interesting that the man in charge of a key area of the agriculture ministry actually did his PhD training in Australia. He wanted to initiate such symposia so that we could learn from one another in the development of dry land farming in particular. That is obviously a key part of our recommendation.</para>
<para>A further recommendation was the investigation of defence export related opportunities in the region. I recall that there was the opportunity in Kuwait to talk about our exports of defence patrol boats into Yemen. In the discussions in Kuwait, there was a lot of interest from the Minister for Defence in investigating the availability of supplies from Australia.</para>
<para>The committee also recommends that the government re-examine its interpretation of section 23AF of the Income Tax Assessment Act with regard to tax exemptions for income earned overseas. This, of course, relates to all those many Australians in works throughout the gulf area, particularly in Saudi Arabia, where their tax exempt status is being brought into question. The committee believes the advantages and disadvantages of the 2002 change in interpretation need to be examined more closely and need to be more exhaustively weighed up. We believe there are considerable advantages in having a number of Australians working in this area in terms of their potential to order Australian equipment and supplies and to bring in other Australians and develop a close relationship that can lead into tourism and other joint ventures.</para>
<para>In the second category of recommendations, the committee recommends a number of changes to strategically position Australia in the region in order to capitalise on available opportunities. These include a realignment of trade representation in Kuwait and Bahrain, which sees a strengthening of our trade position in Kuwait and the presence of representation in Bahrain. Gulf Air highlighted the fact that it was difficult to service the number of people travelling through the area without an effective representation in Bahrain. A further recommendation is increased DIMIA representation across the region for faster visa processing. The complaints that it was taking up to 10 days for visas to be processed obviously retard the amount of tourism business when visas for travel to European countries can be given instantly.</para>
<para>Lastly, the committee recommended that consideration be given to placing representation in the region for the Australian Tourist Commission and Invest Australia. There is a large interest from people in the Gulf States in coming to Australiaâat this stage particularly to the Gold Coast but, on a wider basis, to the whole of Australiaâand we need to encourage that with greater representation and greater advertising by Tourism Australia. In conclusion, the committee believes strongly that there is no time like the present to be pursuing export and investment opportunities in the Gulf region. The window of opportunity is open, and Australia is well placed to build on its successes in the region and make the most of new opportunities. I commend this report to the House.</para>

<para>âMr Speaker, on behalf of the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, I would like to make some brief comments on the report I have just tabled. This report concerns long-term strategies to address the ageing of the Australian population over the next 40 years. In the 40th Parliament, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Ageing prepared a draft report. The election was called in 2004 before the report was completed for tabling. In this 41st Parliament, the newly formed House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing resolved to table the draft report from the inquiry without amendment or reopening the inquiry. Consequently, recommendations are not made in this publication, and thus a government response is not anticipated. To aid readers and future researchers, the committee inquiry process details are summarised and some conclusions are shared.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>During the 40th Parliament inquiry a total of 192 submissions and 88 exhibits were received. The committee held 18 public hearings across the countryâin Adelaide, Alice Springs, Brisbane, Broken Hill, Canberra, the Central Coast, Coffs Harbour, Darwin, Dubbo, Lake Macquarie, Melbourne, Perth, Sydney, and Western Sydneyâand undertook six site inspections to aged care facilities, a respite centre, the University of the Third Age, and four organisations at Tullamore, New South Wales involved in work with aged people. From the public hearing program, the committee took evidence from 100 witnesses representing 88 organisations or themselves. To maximise community opportunities for contributions to the inquiry, the committee also held six community forums associated with five of the public hearingsâat the Gold Coast, Norah Head, Charlestown, Coffs Harbour, Alice Springs and Broken Hill. A total of 127 statements were made. The committee also received 17 private briefings. A report was drafted.</para>
<para>Since the report was drafted last parliament and the election announced in August 2004, there have been a number of government policy announcements. The new committee acknowledges that these initiatives might supersede some of the conclusions made in the earlier draft inquiry report. These are detailed in my foreword to the report, together with government announcements made in the Governor-Generalâs speech at the opening of the parliament.</para>
<para>You would all agree that parliamentary committee members are challenged throughout an inquiry process, balancing electorate demands with burning parliamentary committee inquiry processes. Also, the work of many staff on the committee secretariat is acknowledged. It is evident that the previous committee members were committed to producing outcomes to vexed issues that all Australians will eventually face in the future. Thus, central to future progress is the need to make public their pertinent explorations. My committee in the 41st Parliament considers it important to share with the community the collective evidence, developments and conclusions of the previous committee in the 40th Parliament. I commend the draft report and research deliberations to the House.</para>

<para>âI rise today with a feeling of disappointment and sadness at the tabling of the draft report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Future ageing</inline>. The report does not include specific recommendations and it has been tabled without the scrutiny of either the previous House of Representative Standing Committee on Ageing or the current House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing. The report tabled today was completed on the eve of the last federal election. With the dissolution of the parliament, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Ageing was unable to consider the report.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The problems with this report were further compounded by changes of staff. This necessitated the committee having to employ a person to write the report. Unfortunately, I believe the report was written by a person who had not been part of the inquiry. Consequently, the report and its conclusions do not adequately address the issues raised; nor do they fully reflect the evidence that was received by the committee. As the only member of the previous committee who is a member of the new committee, I must express my disappointment at this report.</para>
<para>The committee received evidence on a wide range of issues. At the top of the list were issues relating to the frail aged, residential care, funding, red tape, the approval process, workers and training of staff. The committee looked at factors such as isolation, planning, the approval process and the need for aged care to be person-centred as opposed to paper-centred. It looked at issues surrounding psycho-geriatric needs, waiting times, communication between acute care and residential care, and staff expertise. It looked at medical factors such as doctors and allied health. It also looked at the delivery of services to the community. The committee identified shortages and duplication. It looked at things like the Veterans Home Care program, HACC, and waiting timesâissues that are very specific to rural, remote and regional areas. Service providers shared with the committee a number of issues that were of great concern to them. The committee looked at ACATs. Some very big issues here concerned access, equity and carers.</para>
<para>In the area of income support, the issues of superannuation, taxation, poverty and pensions were discussed, along with a number of other related issues. A considerable amount of time was spent on mature age employment, looking at barriers and stereotypes. There were some very good examples of this from organisations such as Westpac. The committee also heard of the many positive contributions that older people make to our community in relation to voluntary work, the economic advantages they provide to us and the benefits of an active aged population.</para>
<para>As I mentioned, the greatest number of submissions addressed residential aged care, and I do not think that was reflected in the recommendations or the body of the report. The committee received overwhelming evidence of a care sector that is drowning under red tape and bureaucracy. This was not addressed in the report. Unless the government does address this issue, there will be a negative impact on providers to provide aged care into the future.</para>
<para>The report further demonstrated its inadequacy by highlighting nutrition while ignoring issues surrounding medication. This was raised on numerous occasions and was of enormous concern to members on both sides of this House. The report also does not deal adequately with issues relating to work force shortages.</para>
<para>We have before us today half a report. It is a report with no recommendations, yet the inquiry ran for the whole term of the last parliament. I would like to express my apologies to all those people who contributed to this inquiry. I learnt a lot from them and I intend to pursue the issues that they raised. The committee, as outlined by the chair of the new committee, received numerous submissions and evidence from a variety of people. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talker>
<para>âLast June the committee presented its first report under this act: <inline font-style="italic">Review of the listing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad</inline>. In this report, the committee has reviewed the relisting of six organisations previously listed as terrorist organisations under part 5.3 of the Criminal Code as amended by the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2002. Under that legislation, 13 groups were listed. All had previously been listed by the United Nations Security Council.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>In its first report, the committee established procedures for reviewing terrorist listings. These procedures included following normal parliamentary practices in the committeeâs reviews of the listingsâadvertising the inquiry, seeking submissions and holding hearings, albeit in camera. This procedure has been followed in this review. The committee received a number of submissions from members of the public for this inquiry, and it is grateful for these contributions to its deliberations.</para>
<para>In addition, so that its review would be both meaningful and expeditious, the committee requested that the government accompany its notification of a regulation with additional explanatory information, including details of the required consultation between the government and the states and territories on the regulation; details on the consultations with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on any foreign policy implications in relation to the listings; and details of the procedures followed in making the regulations.</para>
<para>The committee was disappointed that the information supplied to it did not contain more substantial details of the consultations held between the Commonwealth and the states and territories. The time frame set for this process was so short that it rendered it almost impossible for the states and territories to make any response, as is their right.</para>
<para>In their submission, the Attorney-Generalâs Department informed the committee of dates when they had consulted with the department of foreign affairs but supplied no details of the departmentâs view. The department of foreign affairs itself appeared at the private hearing but gave no assessment on the specific listings either at the hearing or in the subsequent answers to questions on notice. In future it would be valuable for the committee to receive these details at the time it receives the submissions on the listings from the Attorney-General.</para>
<para>The committee is grateful for the additional comments on ASIOâs evaluation processes. That is a valuable addition to its understanding of the methods by which ASIO selects organisations for listing. It is, however, not clear whether an organisation to be listed has to meet all the criteria or just one of them. Judging by the information supplied on the individual listings, it must be just one of them. If this is the case, then some of the criteria in ASIOâs list of factors for consideration are so broad that they make the others in the list meaningless. Nevertheless, the committee is pleased to see the inclusion of Australian links in the factors ASIO considers in evaluating organisations for listing. However, the committee would like to see this applied consistently. In this review, it was clear that the actual Australian links to some of the organisations were very tenuous or non-existent.</para>
<para>The committee wishes to reiterate that it is important to include an organisationâs links to Australia and Australians because, despite the lack of a legislative requirement for this, the listing will have little practical effect without it. Successful application of these powers under the geographical extraterritoriality provisions of the Criminal Code appears to be an unlikely prospect. Prosecution of Australians, or foreigners acting in Australia, has a greater prospect of success. Therefore, emphasis on listing terrorist organisations which Australians support through financial contributions, or by providing personnel, makes sense in the fight against international terrorism. As well, listing those organisations that have a presence and operatives in Australia, where there is an immediacy of threat to the Australian community, also makes sense.</para>
<para>The committee is also pleased to note that engagement in a peace process would be considered as a reason not to list an organisation. This makes some sense of what seemed to be inconsistencies in the application of the provision: some organisations, with a presence in Australia and listed by the UN as terrorist organisations, had not been proscribed by this country, while others with no connection to Australia had been. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline>
</para>
<para>In reviews to date, the information, both on the processing of the regulations and on the listed entities themselves, could be deemed to be inadequate for the committee to judge the case for proscription with confidence. It is of some concern to the committee that there does not appear to be clarity, coherence and consistency in the process. In this review there continued to be much debate between the committee and government officials on these selection processes. It is hoped that this will be a continuing and constructive dialogue. However, taking all the abovementioned issues into consideration, the committee does not recommend to the parliament that any of these regulations be disallowed. I commend the report to the House.</para>

<para>âI am sure it is on behalf of all members that I pass on our hopes that the Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD, the member for Fadden, makes a full recovery from whatever it is he has the leave of the House for. I, as the newest member of this committee, acknowledge that I am not in a position to do more than make some very brief comments in relation to the first report in which I participated. The committee has undertaken very careful examination of these listings. It has made two recommendations, the first being that where a listing is made there be an extensive public campaign to make certain the consequences of that listing are fully drawn to the attention of those who may be affected and the second being that we do not recommend disallowance of the recommendations on the six listings.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The points that have been made very well by the member for Corangamite have concerned committee members. I think every committee member would have some reservations about aspects of the way in which these listings were completed. The consultation with the states plainly was not done in a timely and effective way. The consultations with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade were obviously done in a very tight time frame and the details of those consultations were made known to the committee only at a very late point in time. There do seem to be some quite striking inconsistencies between public record information with reputable organisations like Janeâs and some of the information supplied to the committee, particularly relating to the armed Islamic group GIA.</para>
<para>We have drawn attention to all of those matters, and we would hope that, in future, such difficulties do not arise. We have indicated that issues about proscription power will be considered again in 2007. We were not looking at whether proscription should exist or otherwise but looking at the specifics of these six listings. However, we do make the point in our report that there is a considerable amount of substance to the critique that was made in a very thoughtful submission by Mr Patrick Emerton that the listing criteria does need to be clarified. We have made some suggestions in a direction that will assist in clarification to make sure that we focus on those organisations that present particular threats to Australiaâs national strategic and security interests and do not extend into areas where we would not wish proscription to existâthat is, recognised, for example, by ASIO in areas where organisations are resolving civil conflict and, more importantly, where they are also engaged in efforts to obtain peaceful resolutions to those civil conflicts.</para>
<para>So there are some significant reservations about our conclusions that are noted in this report. The report should be read in full. Rather than simply being dealt with by the House as a two-paragraph set of recommendations, we have treated our responsibilities seriously. As the committee says, the power to prosecute somebody as an associate in a democracy is difficult. It is antithetical to democratic principles and too abstract to allow for a successful prosecution in courts of law with traditions of expectations of concrete evidence for actions committed.</para>

<para class="block">The issue of maritime salvage is an important issue in terms of safety, security, environmental protection and economic considerations. In June last year, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport and Regional Services tabled an important report into the issue of ship salvage. This inquiry was undertaken in response to a Productivity Commission report which recommended that the provision of salvage services at Australian ports be opened up to market forces. Evidence presented to the committee suggested that such an arrangement is likely to lead to an overall reduction in salvage capability. I believe that Australia cannot take that risk.</para>
<para>The committee made a number of key recommendations. The problem is that the government has failed as yet to respond to the committeeâs report, and I believe that the recommendations in the report must be taken up as a matter of urgency. Only last week, for example, the MSC <inline font-style="italic">Denisse</inline> was left drifting near Christmas Island after engine trouble. We were fortunate that two Navy frigates were in the area and able to go to its aid until salvage vessels could be dispatched from Western Australia. The House should just imagine the consequences to Christmas Island and the marine environmentânot to mention the safety of the crewâif no assistance had been available to this vessel. We may well have found ourselves in the situation of having to rely on our nearest neighbour, Indonesia, for assistance. I think it is fair to say that the government has now commenced a process of working with the industry and the states to address the problem. It has announced an interim funding package to ensure that services remain in place at least for the next 12 months. It is therefore appropriate for the opposition this afternoon to call on the government to expedite a long-term solution, as suggested by the problems related to the MSC <inline font-style="italic">Denisse</inline> near Christmas Island last week.</para>
<para>Salvage operators require certainty. They must know what environment they are going to be operating in so that they can make appropriate investment decisions as to the vessels required for salvage activities. Further, the shipping industry must have certainty that there will be services available should they be required. Importantly, people working in this often dangerous industry must be confident that their safety and security is protected. Finally, the Australian people must be confident that our pristine Australian coastline is being protected and that any unforeseen incidents on the high seas will not result in unnecessary damage to our marine environment. Just imagine the consequences of a ship running aground near the Great Barrier Reef and not having access to a quick and efficient salvage response.</para>
<para>We must also acknowledge that the worldwide shipping task is growing at an exponential rate and we, as a major user of shipping services both for international and domestic trade, depend on an appropriate salvage capacity. The growth in trade will continue and we will be a beneficiary with more and more ships plying Australian waters. It is an irony, therefore, that worldwide improvements to ship safety and quality have seen the demand for salvage services decline over recent years. This is something that we should be grateful for. However, this means that we need to adopt innovative solutions to ensure that salvage services remain in place. You could almost describe it as a national insurance policy for both our shipping activities and protecting our pristine coast, which is also important for employment in another major Australian industryâthe tourism industry. One shipping disaster would cost much more to the Australian economy than the cost of subsidising salvage capability in key locations around our vast coastline.</para>
<para>I therefore commend the report and excellent recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport and Regional Servicesâthe committee chaired by the member for Hinkler, who also will speak on this motion. It is important, therefore, that the government expedites both a response to that report and a long-term solution to ensure that salvage capacity is maintained around our coastline. It requires cooperation between state and territory governments, the Commonwealth and also the shipping industry. Investment in salvage capacity by state, territory and Commonwealth governments and the shipping industry is an investment in Australiaâs future in our shipping requirements, our growing export potential and also in protecting our pristine coastline with its importance to the growth of tourism in the future. I commend the motion to the House, and I ask that the minister respond as matter of urgency. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talker>
<para>âI thank the member for Batman for bringing this motion on maritime salvage before the House. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport and Regional Services, of which I am chair, looked into this issue and Australia should treat it with the utmost concern. Australia is the worldâs only island continent and, as such, needs a world-class maritime salvage sector to protect the economic and environmental resources of 17,000 kilometres of coastline. The Great Barrier Reef, Tasmaniaâs fishing grounds and the Western Australian coastline are just a few of the at-risk sectors that could suffer if Australia does not have a sufficient salvage sector. Thankfully, salvage incidents are few and far between, partly due to the fact that ships coming to Australian waters are in better condition than they have been in the past.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We can be thankful for the surveillance that has occurred since an earlier report of the committee, <inline font-style="italic">Ships of shame</inline>, but we should not rest easy on this issue. We cannot afford to let our maritime salvage sector develop in an ad hoc way. There is a thought that market forces can deliver a world-class maritime salvage sector for Australia. However, I do not subscribe to that theory. It simply will not happen. The cherry-picking of port functions by harbour tugs leaves us dangerously exposed. The protection of our coastline, our borders and crews requires something more than the laws of supply and demand. As it stands, Australia has 15 ocean-going salvage capable tugs, all of which are normally engaged in harbour towage duties. In fact, there are currently no vessels engaged exclusively in salvage services in Australian waters. We have already lost two salvage capable tugs due to economic pressures. A further reduction in numbers could have serious implications for safety, environmental integrity and even security.</para>
<para>This motion calls on the government to provide interim funding to maintain the salvage capability. I am pleased to note that the government will provide one-off funding of up to $2 million to United Salvage to maintain an emergency towage and salvage capability in Australia until 30 April 2005. The plain facts are that, if Australia does not maintain its own fleet of salvage capable tugs, we could have to wait up to 10 days for a suitable vessel to come from a neighbouring country: for example, Singapore. A major step forward in protecting our natural resources and our borders would be the development of a national salvage plan. This can occur only if salvage tugs are mandated as part of certain portsâ tender arrangements. Alternatively, we must strategically locate subsidised salvage capable tugs and equipment around our coastline, with particular emphasis on regions with heavy shipping activity such as Sydney, Melbourne and Port Hedland.</para>
<para>Another harbour which would warrant a base is Gladstone, home of the Central Queensland Port Authority in my electorate of Hinkler. This port currently has a throughput of 50 million tonnes a year, dispatches 12 per cent of Australiaâs exports by volume and is predicted to have a throughput of 135 million tonnes by the year 2050. Gladstoneâs proximity to the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef makes it a logical choice for a base for salvage operations. I acknowledge that the establishment of such bases would come at some cost, but a tripartite funding arrangement between the Commonwealth, the states and ship owners using Australiaâs international and state waters would ameliorate that somewhat. We need also to have across-the-board cooperation from the states to achieve a functional maritime sector. States must be prepared to invest in supporting infrastructure to ensure there are no unnecessary backlogs of shipping such as the 40-ship queue that snakes in and out of Dalrymple Bay in Queensland at this very momentâa maritime disaster just waiting to happen. I commend the government which, through the Australian Maritime Group, is already getting the consultation process under way. Like the member for Batman, I commend this motion to the House.</para>

<para>âI rise to support the motion by the member for Batman and spoken to by the member for Hinkler. I draw the attention of the House to the failure of the government to respond in a timely manner to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport and Regional Services report <inline font-style="italic">Ship salvage</inline>, tabled some nine months ago in this House. Notwithstanding the decision to provide one-off funding for emergency salvage and towing capability and the establishment of the working party referred to on this matter, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive response by the government to all the recommendations of the <inline font-style="italic">Ship salvage</inline> report.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Ours is a maritime nation where the great majority of exported and imported goods are transported by sea. As the member for Batman noted, the number and size of vessels will continue to increase. New supertankers are expected in the port of Botany Bay, within the Kingsford Smith electorate. These huge vessels pose real challenges for salvage capacity in the event of any accident or mishap, particularly as salvage capacity and expertise in general is diminishing Australia wide. Risks to the environment, such as an accident at sea and pollution to the coastline, have been highlighted. These are of special concern not only to members but to all Australians. The Great Barrier Reef sees substantial numbers of vessels travelling too close to the reefâs precious environment, and jurisdictional and logistical logjams may delay speedy action in the case of an accident. There are vast stretches of Australiaâs coastline with high environment valuesâfor example, Victoriaâs Wilsonâs Promontory, a national park where a stricken vessel needed to be recovered recently. This all makes a thorough national response to this issue necessary. The government needs to exercise its responsibility for intergenerational solutions. It is critical that the government now specifically address the key recommendations of the <inline font-style="italic">Ship salvage</inline> report and not simply fold its responsibility into considering recommendations that derive from the working party of the Australian Maritime Group, which has been charged with considering this issue in accordance with the reportâs recommendations.</para>
<para>Of note, committee recommendations to be addressed are that articles 9 and 11 of the International Convention on Salvage 1989 be enshrined in Australian law, making more clear the federal governmentâs primary responsibility in this area; that the government develop a national salvage plan; that, in order to address the issue of maritime skills shortages identified in evidence to the committee as crucial, the government subsidise provision of training courses in marine salvage related subjects, including greater use of Australiaâs maritime educational resources. The question now is: will the government commit to reinforcing and enhancing our maritime capacity in the crucial area of salvage?</para>
<para>Of real concern is the possibility that in the longer term most salvage expertise would reside overseas. This issue has been raised in evidence to the committee, was considered, and needs a response from the minister. Labor has strongly put the view that Australian ports should have access to Australian salvage services. We do not believe, as suggested by the Productivity Commission, that market forces alone will provide for sufficiency of service in salvage. In the light of the changed regional security environment and the vulnerability of our ports to marine terrorismâalso addressed in <inline font-style="italic">Ship salvage</inline>âthe requirement for adequate Australian salvage and emergency towing capability is essential on national security grounds. <inline font-style="italic">Ship salvage</inline> was a very solid report on a very important issue and the government now needs to respond to its recommendations. The future of our marine environment and marine capacity is at stake.</para>

<para>âIt is with pleasure I rise to support the member for Batman, the member for Kingsford Smith and the member for Hinkler on this important motion about maritime salvage. This issue was brought to prominence by the <inline font-style="italic">Ships of shame</inline> report. As the member for Hinkler has pointed out, the former minister, Peter Morris, was very actively involved in this issue, and that is part of the reason we are blessed in not having an excess of events which would warrant even greater attention. The government is endeavouring to address the issue through considerable consultation with the states and territories and the Australian Maritime Group. The AMG is a group of officials that reports to the Australian Transport Council. It is anticipated that the ATC will have considered this work by the end of April 2005. It is also envisaged that the ATC will provide the basis of a response to the Neville report.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As the member for Hinkler has highlighted, in January this year the Commonwealth announced that it will be providing one-off funding of up to $2 million to United Salvage, a subsidiary of Adsteam Marine Ltd to maintain its emergency towage and salvage capability in Australia until 30 April 2005. I have not measured it, I confess, but I estimate that the coastline of my electorate would be in excess of 1,000 kilometres of the total 17,000 kilometres of Australiaâs coastline. So I can admit to a vested interest in this very important issue. I was recently reminded of the oil drilling activity in the Great Australian Bight, which is testing the frontiers of this sort of work.</para>

<para>âThat is quite right. As the member for Batman says, it is a very high-risk business. Nevertheless, it highlights the need for this very important issue to be considered by the House today. By April, I am sure all of us in this parliament will be looking for a response from government which is long term, picks up the very important environmental issues and gives us a much stronger approach. Let us face it, we live in a relatively isolated part of the world. As has been pointed out, there would be 10 days to wait for help from Singapore or another port if we did not have the capacity here. This vital issue highlights the importance of the cooperation that is needed in this industryâthat is, the partnerships between the states, territories, industry and the national government. As I said, the national government has responded with an interim measure but this motion reminds us that the matter is urgent and important. I appreciate the contribution of the three members who have spoken earlier today highlighting this fact.</para>

</motion>
<para class="block">I rise today because I strongly believe that adoption is such an important part of our social fabric and presents this nationâs families with an opportunity to change the world and make it better. I know that we are well aware that the purpose of adoption is not to find children for parents; it is to give parents to children. It is about love, care and compassion. Overseas adoption is a solution for children who are unable to live a happy life in their home country. It gives a man and a woman the chance to reach out to the lives of such children and give them a new future. In the financial year 2003-04, there were 370 overseas adoptions in Australia. For many parents, the satisfaction of helping a child in need as well as the natural joy in enlarging their families far outweigh the financial pain. However, I fear large costs contribute to a relatively low number of adoptions.</para>
<para>In this country, overseas adoption is strictly controlled by each state and territory under adoption legislation. It is right that it is governed so carefully. When we look at the eight state and territory jurisdictions in Australia, we find that the average fees and taxes associated with the first intercountry adoption add up to more than $5,000. New South Wales slugs people with the biggest cost at $9,700; South Australia, $8,200; Victoria, $6,250; the Northern Territory, $6,053; the Australian Capital Territory, $4,154; Western Australia, $2,236; and Queensland, $2,053. I am happy to say that my home state of Tasmania imposes the lowest cost at $2,052, but it is still too much. I cannot see how such iniquitous taxes can be justified.</para>
<para>Today I call on all state and territory governments to abolish these costs. The least that the states could do is provide screening and processing services at no charge to parents, who will still be faced with international airfares, communications costs and the emotional strain that goes hand in hand with adopting from overseas.</para>
<para>The Commonwealth Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs also charges families. A child migration visa for a young boy or girl taken in by a family through an intercountry adoption attracts an application fee of $1,245. This afternoon, I call on the Commonwealth to review this application fee. I believe it is unnecessary and that its abolition would show real support for adoptive parents. It needs to be made financially easier for families who want to adopt a child from overseas. This is all about the children. Making overseas adoption less expensiveâfor example, by abolishing these chargesâwill make it easier for people wanting to provide a safe, loving home for children who are, for whatever reason, orphaned.</para>
<para>Today I also call on the federal government to show good faith and consider the Commonwealthâs maternity payment system as it relates to overseas adoption. Currently the maternity payment is payable when a child born on or after July 2004 is placed with adoptive parents before it is 26 weeks of age. Figures show, and logic suggests, that the majority of overseas adoptions involve children older than six months, so currently adoptive parents cannot claim the paymentâin effect, yet another disincentive for parents wanting to invite an overseas child into their family.</para>
<para>In the eyes of the law, an adopted child is regarded as if he or she had been born to the adoptive parents. There is no difference in rights or status. The adopted child even receives a new birth certificate. So it is clearly reasonable that the maternity payment should be paid in the same way.</para>
<para>This private memberâs motion is about recognition, and today I take this opportunity to say thank you to all of those people, from all parts of Australia, who have opened their homes and hearts to a dear child to let them grow into happy young Aussies. This private memberâs motion is also about fairness, and I have clearly shown that there is more work to be done by the Commonwealth, the states and the territories.</para>
<para>My motivation in moving this motion is not really about saving or making money, but we must all accept that greater government support is right and proper. If an Australian couple makes a decision to provide a loving family for a child who may otherwise miss out, then we as lawmakers need to support them and not get in the way. We in this wealthy, compassionate and Christian nation should not only support overseas adoption but strongly encourage it.</para>

<para>âI congratulate the member for Bass for bringing this motion before the House. He has shown a close interest in family matters in his short time in the parliament. As the motion points out, the number of overseas adoptions to Australia is quite small. There were only 370 adoptions in 2003-04, and this is the highest number recorded. As the member for Bass will find as the wide variety of cases come through the door of his electorate office, the adoptions that involve only a few people are often the hardest in which to assist. Too often the response from ministers and departments is that there is no point in making costly changes when only a handful of people will benefit. But, as the member for Bass would realise, hardship and injustice are just as real whether they affect the many or the few.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The process of overseas adoption is complex to say the least. Prospective parents must satisfy the strict criteria for adoption applying in their state of residence. In turn, they must satisfy the requirements of the childâs country of origin and international conventions. There are also immigration processes to be completed. So it is not surprising that prospective adopting parents face a nightmare of red tape in the long and frustrating process of completing the adoption of a child from overseas.</para>
<para>The motion also raises the concern of the high costs imposed by state governments to process an intercountry adoption. As the member for Bass has just stated to the House, the costs vary greatly: from the lowest fee of $2,053 in the memberâs home state of Tasmania to $9,700 in New South Wales. The costs in the other states are $8,200 in South Australia, $6,250 in Victoria, $6,053 in the Northern Territory, $4,154 in the ACT and $2,236 in Western Australia. When you add to this the expense of travel and accommodation in the childâs country of origin, you can see that overseas adoption is very expensive.</para>
<para>The issue can be complicated in a very small number of cases when adopting parents move to another state at some stage in the adoption process. If this move takes place during the first stage, where information is being gathered, it may be necessary for the parents to start all over again. Where the adopting parents have reached the assessment stage, it may be possible for some of the information to be transferred, although differences in legislation may cause further information to be required. At the placement stage, where the application has been sent to the sending country, the post-placement supervision can usually be transferred to the new state.</para>
<para>I should point out that even the larger states would experience only one or two cases of interstate transfer each year. That is no comfort to the adopting parents, but I understand that all states do try to assist, as far as possible, when dealing with parents who have transferred from another state and even where parents are posted overseas during the process.</para>
<para>While the motion calls on the states to review what are described as excessive financial charges, it should be understood that these same agencies also have responsibility for child protection services, which are rightly given a higher priority. As with many Commonwealth agencies, such as those dealing with immigration, full cost recovery for processing applications is widespread.</para>
<para>Australia is a party to the Hague convention which establishes uniform standards between countries. I note, however, that only about one-tenth of intercountry adoptions are with Hague convention countries, although Australia has bilateral agreements with countries, such as China, which apply similar arrangements to the Hague convention. In recent years, China and South Korea have accounted for over 60 per cent of overseas adoptions to Australia.</para>
<para>I also note that the majority of adopting parents are in their late thirties at the time of application. Delays in processing can often exclude applicants on the grounds of age. A more flexible approach in these cases would be welcome. I look forward to further discussion of this issue in the parliament and in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Human Services, of which I am a member. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI am delighted to have seconded this motion on adoption today, moved by my friend the honourable member for Bass. The Boxing Day tsunami tragedy brought to the forefront of many Australiansâ minds the plight of orphans from other countries. Seeing nightly images of terrified and screaming children seemed to shock the numbed sensibilities of many in our peaceful community. Predictably, these images aroused an enormous compassionate outpouring, with hundreds of Australians offering to adopt the so-called âtsunami orphansâ.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is sometimes inappropriate for children affected by war and natural disaster to leave their country and be adopted by couples overseas. There is a strong view put by the Adoptive Families Association and other organisations that, if possible, orphans should be placed with families within the country of origin. However, that is simply not possible in many cases. There are hundreds of thousands of displaced children around the world, many of whom have a small chance of survival, let alone of leading happy and healthy lives.</para>
<para>For example, the number of children left orphaned by HIV-AIDS alone is estimated at 13.4 million. UNICEF believes that at any given time there are millions of children around the world who are without primary caregivers and in institutions including hospitals, orphanages, psychiatric units and prisons. The number of intercountry adoptions finalised in New South Wales in 2003-04, however, was only 66. When we consider both the moral view that Australia is a country with much, sharing in a worldwide responsibility to care for those children who would otherwise struggle to survive, and the practical view that our birthrate is currently 1.7 children per coupleâwell below the self-sustaining rate of 2.1 children per coupleâoverseas adoption is clearly an option that needs to be embraced.</para>
<para>The Hague convention, which came into force in Australia in December 1998, provides an excellent set of overarching principles which the adoption legislation of the states and territories follows. The vast majority of those wanting to adopt do so out of a heartfelt desire to provide a new start in life for an orphaned child, but there are a tiny minority who would be inappropriate to adopt a child. The system of rigorous assessment in Australia is excellent and succeeds in ruling out inappropriate placements.</para>
<para>Hundreds of couples in Australia have expressed an interest in adopting a child from overseas. In New South Wales alone, approximately 10 phone calls a day are received from people asking for information about adoption programs. It is apparent though that these couples, who only want to provide a peaceful and loving home for an orphaned child, have to contend with a barrage of red tape, numerous inconsistencies and sometimes insufficient support during and after the process.</para>
<para>The costs of adopting a child from overseas are significant. It can cost up to $50,000 from a coupleâs first expression of interest to actually bringing the child home to Australia. However, there is no consistency in what states charge the couple through the process. In New South Wales for example, the first application costs imposed by the Department of Community Services are $9,700, although this can be discounted for low-income households. In Victoria, however, a similar process through the Department of Human Services costs $6,250. This amount falls to $2,052 for an application made in Tasmania. Other states have their own individual pricing structures. When this is added to other sometimes unnecessarily restrictive practices, couples can be more disinclined to adopt from overseas. We should be doing all we can to encourage overseas adoption for the long-term benefit of both the child and childless couples in Australia.</para>
<para>There are also a number of other challenges that require a greater focus. For example, older children, three years of age and above, can often suffer substantial trauma and can struggle with learning and self-regulation. There needs to be a greater focus on post-adoption support provided by agencies in a genuine and ongoing way. There also needs to be further investigation into what assistance governments can and should provide to those who adopt children who are over six months old, particularly since the majority of adopted children are older than 26 weeks. It is time that we, as a community, seriously embraced and encouraged the concept of intercountry adoption. I both advocate and hope that this motion produces further community discussion, inquiry and debate for the good of the children and Australia.</para>

<para>âI support the member for Bassâs motion on the overseas adoption of children, particularly since the Asian tsunami. The tsunami devastated hundreds of thousands of lives. I have met and spoken to many families in my electorate who have lost loved ones as a result of this terrible disaster. Even my own family has been touched. My husband, Craig, worked as a volunteer teacher in Sri Lanka. We still have not been able to contact some of his former students and friends, and fear we never will hear from them again. Fortunately, we received information from one of his close friends that he and his family had survived. But I know that so many others were not so fortunate.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Perhaps the most devastating part of this tragedy is the thousands and thousands of children who have been orphaned. It is so important that the plight of these children is not forgotten. That is why I am pleased that the member for Bass has raised this issue. The children left homeless by the tsunami deserve to have a home and family to love them, just like any child. As with any overseas adoption, cultural sensitivities have to be observed. The safety and happiness of these children must be the top priority. The government need to ensure that proper security measures are, of course, in place for these children. They also need to provide adequate support for the children and their new parents.</para>
<para>There is no doubt that this has been an incredibly traumatic time for these thousands of children. Surely they deserve the opportunity that many Australian couples want to give themâcouples like Bill and Emma, who live in Banora Point in my electorate. Emma has survived a bilateral lung transplant and is now healthy. Now, like many young couples, she and her husband desperately want to start a family. Unfortunately, she is unable to have children, so they have investigated adopting a child from overseas. Everyone I speak with tells me that Bill and Emma are both upstanding members of our community who would make ideal parents. They both have solid employment and are caring people who would provide a good home for any child. As well, they have an extensive network of very supportive family and friends, all of whom are willing to attest to their ability to be good parents. It seems to me that the real tragedy would be to leave orphaned children without a family, particularly when couples like Bill and Emma are so desperate to be parents.</para>
<para>I know the strain that Emma and Bill have been put under during the course of their application for an overseas adoption. I join with the member moving this motion in urging the government to provide better support to people attempting an overseas adoption. Apart from the cost, there is the emotional toll. Emma and Bill, for example, have been going through the process for four long years. I agree that people applying for an overseas adoption should be rigorously scrutinised. For the safety of the children involved, this is an absolute must. But there need to be better support mechanisms for genuine applicants like Emma and Bill. This is certainly something that the federal government should look at closely. I join with the member in urging the government to look at better ways of supporting people like Emma and Bill. This is an opportunity to provide homes for children who are destined to grow up in an orphanage. I hope for the sake of these children and for the Australian couples who want to adopt them that the federal government makes sensible decisions regarding this very important issue.</para>

</talker>
<para>âI rise to support the motion tabled by the member for Bass. I have spoken in this place before about the need to see Australiaâs population and skilled work force increase in numbers. But this is not a new message. In 1945 Arthur Calwell, a minister in the Chifley government, announced that Australia needed to âpopulate or perishâ, as he introduced the first large-scale immigration program for Australia. That has familiar echoes for us today as we look at our ageing population and the reports discussed by the Treasurer, Mr Costello, concerning our need to increase our working population. Targeted immigration programs, such as that for an additional 20,000 skilled workers announced recently, are a short-term supplement to the case for increasing the birth rate as a longer term solution. But not all couples have the option to help raise the birth rate. Some choose not to. And some who already have biological children choose to extend their families by blessing and helping other needy children from around the world or, indeed, Australia. So adoption remains one of our smaller and less discussed targeted immigration programs.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>So what is the need that justifies us spending time on improving this program? At a personal level, there is the desire of Australian families to open their homes to children in needânot just parents who cannot have their own children but also many established families who see the opportunity to reach out and bless others. At a national level, there is the need for Australia to boost its population to achieve a long-term balance of ageing and working citizens. Finally, and probably most importantly, there is the desperate need of children, many of whom have no parents and who are caught up in a cycle of poverty, exploitation of all kinds and, ultimately, death. In one country alone, Kenya, the United Nations have just revised their estimate of the number of orphans to in excess of one million. Despite the numerous aid programs run by the Kenyan government and NGOs, the majority of these children live on the streets and are subjected to unthinkable extremes of abuse.</para>
<para>Given that national and international needs are numbered in tens of thousands, why is it that fewer than 400 children a year are adopted? This low number speaks not of low demand or inadequate need but of a bureaucracy that is disconnected from the nature and scale of the need. The motion tabled by the member for Bass highlights just some of the practical barriers that exist. A quick review of the published procedures by each of the states and territories, as discussed by the former speakers, highlights the lengthy processâmeasured in years; the high costsâmeasured in tens of thousands of dollars; and the limited choices available to families. And this is only during the application stage! Subsequent issues of leave, health and welfare benefits also form a significant barrier for adoptive families.</para>
<para>Importantly, underlying the presence of these barriers are attitudes. Parents I have spoken to in my electorate who are involved in the process of adopting a child from overseas report negative attitudes in parts of the bureaucracies affecting them. These negative attitudes appear to be formed in response to the publicity surrounding the minority of cases where there has been some inappropriate conduct on the part of the relinquishing parent, the agencies involved or the adoptive parents. Yes, there have been cases of poverty stricken mothers being paid for leaving a child with an agency for adoption; but these few occurrences should not close the door to the hundreds of thousands of orphans urgently needing care. Yes, some children may wonder, in years to come, about their birth parents and consider questions of their cultural identity; but for the vast majority, such as the street children of Kenya, at least they will be alive to consider these issues.</para>
<para>I am blessed to know families who have adopted children ranging from babies to primary school age children who are now adult Australians. The adults in question are well qualified, successful in their chosen fieldsâone married and enjoying parenthoodâand, importantly, both of them are proud and happy Australians. They are at least as well assimilated, if not far more so, as many of the migrant workers that the various levels of government actively look to assist to this country. Given the immense and immediate needs of so many children, the needs of our nation and the desires of families to bless those in need, I support this motion. I welcome the inquiry into adoption that has commenced and I call on this government to provide the leadership that is required to get the states and territories to work together to minimise the barriers to overseas adoption, to minimise the discrepancies between the states and territories and to remove the inequities in the levels of support provided to biological and adoptive families.</para>

<para>âI want to put on the record the sale of a huge lot of defence land at Wacol in my electorate of Oxley. It is some 600 acres in size and is situated directly on the Ipswich Motorway. As we all know, in this place and in the community, the Ipswich Motorway is extremely congested. It is one of the worst roads in Queensland. The government are complete hypocrites on this issue and, once again, they are dodging their responsibilities in terms of providing road infrastructure for my region. And that is the case not just for my electorate but for all of south-east Queensland. There are 600 acres for sale, which is proposed to be industrial land, which would go to the highest bidder and would put some hundreds if not thousands of new trucks and traffic on an already completely congested roadway. This is after the federal government blamed the state and local governments for allowing growth and population along the Ipswich Motorway corridor causing the problems that we have there now.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In fact the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Campbell, the minister responsible, told a Senate estimates hearing on 14 February this year that the Ipswich Motorway was now âstuffed as a major corridorâ because of poor planning from state and local governments. Here is the hypocrisy: we have the federal government allowing the sale of 600 acres of defence land, their land, for industrial use on a motorway corridor that is, in their own words, completely âstuffedâ. If you can imagine the hundreds and thousands of trucks that will be going in and out of this corridor, it is completelyâ<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI wish to advise the House of great news for the people of my electorate. Over the weekend, the Mayor of Sutherland Shire Council, Councillor Kevin Schreiber, informed me that his council team have secured the rights to host the 2006 New South Wales Surf Life Saving Championships. It has been some 36 years since the shire last hosted this important event and, with the longstanding success of the shireâs surf lifesaving teams, the community has great hopes for the results next year with a home ground advantage.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The annual New South Wales Surf Life Saving Championships are one of Australiaâs most exciting sporting events. With more than 9,000 competitors each year, it has become one of the major fixtures on the New South Wales sporting calendar. Along with the competitors, tens of thousands of spectators as well as family and friends of the competitors will come to Cronulla to watch the various events.</para>
<para>I wish to congratulate the mayor, Councillor Kevin Schreiber, and his team of councillors, in bringing this event back to the Sutherland shire. The event will be a huge boost to the local economy and will provide the shire with an opportunity to market itself as a tourism destination for intrastate and interstate domestic tourism. With the Sutherland shireâs beautiful beaches and bays as a backdrop, it promises to be a great event in the Sutherland shire next year, and I very much look forward to seeing it.</para>

<para>âI rise today to highlight growing concerns within the community about the services provided by Telstra. Recently a gentleman from my electorate who is on an age pension visited my office after being told by Telstra that he was not entitled to receive a pensioner concession under their policy. One would assume that he was not entitled because his income was too high or he owned too many assets. That would be perhaps a reasonable basis for refusing the concession rate, but, no, Telstra told him it was because he chose to use a different telco for his long distance calls.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As he is a pensioner on a low fixed income, it makes sense to use the cheapest services available. However, Telstra told this gentleman to bring his custom back to them or receive no concession whatsoever. Apparently, there is no capacity for a portion of the concession to be paid according to the portion of business provided by Telstra. For example, it would seem to me that at least 80 per cent of the telco services required by this constituent continue to be provided through Telstra and yet there has been no offer to give him 80 per cent of the concession. The unwillingness of Telstra to entertain such a policy is an alarming indicator of what will happen when the company is fully privatised. With this behaviour now, it seems certain that the pensioner discount will disappear entirely once Telstra is privatised.</para>

These people have recently taken advantage of the governmentâs Regional Partnerships program to pull together community effort to look at how they can maximise the business and community growth opportunities within the Adelaide Plains region. Making use of a grant from Regional Partnerships they doubled the amount of money that was made through that grant through involving local councils, local business and community groups. This last week has seen a celebration of the launch of their marketing plan as well as a number of activities to highlight the growth and the potential in the communities. Not only has it resulted in a round of activities but, importantly, this activity on behalf of the leaders in that community has seen a rebirth and a reinvigoration of business and community and the growth of towns in that region. I congratulate the people of the Adelaide Plains for their hard work and their innovation to bring about this rebirth for their area.</para>

<para>âI rise today to highlight an appalling contraction in state policing to my community of Redland Bay in the electorate of Bowman. As of today all general policing and all water policing activities in the Redland Bay police station will cease and those officers will be transferred to Capalaba, 15 minutes response time away. It is unbelievable that a southern bay island community and the area of Redland Bay will have no police station.</para>

<para>There are many school students in the gallery. I ask them to consider the impact of a boarded-up police station in their community and what would happen to hooning and other law enforcement issues for individuals of all ages around the area of Redland Bay. During my visits to Redland Bay just last week there was great concern from community leaders. They were appalled at the fact that the police station will close for eight to 12 months while a new police station is constructed in the area. We need continuity of essential services. I commend our local police officers on the magnificent job they do at the moment, but they cannot do it from 20 minutes away. I call on Mr Beattie and state Labor to immediately investigate setting up a âmall postâ arrangement where there can be a shopfront for continued policing. You cannot short-change the bayside community. Its essential services are just that and they need to continue in a thriving community like Redland Bay.</para>

It was also the occasion of the 100th test match of our Australian captain, Liz Ellis. Liz is a fantastic netball player and a great ambassador for the game. She has been a representative for Australia for many years and has done a great job. It was great to see at the end of the match much of the crowd staying around in order to celebrate a special presentation to Liz for her champion work. One hundred tests has, I think, been done only once before. She has been a great ambassador. The Australian team is certainly well set up now in the lead-up to the Commonwealth Games next year when, I hope, we will be happily celebrating a gold medal in netball for the Australian netball team.</para>

<para>âOn Thursday, 17 February 2005, the member for Playford in South Australia, Mr Jack Snelling, rose in the state parliament to speak about the Christmas break-up of the Valleyview Neighbourhood Watch that he, I and the member for Florey, Frances Bedford, had attended. He said that none of us had been invited to speak. However, that did not stop me. I promptly invited myself to speak about the imminent release of the French arthouse film <inline font-style="italic">Anatomy of Hell</inline> with which I disagree. He said that he was not of the opinion that adults should be able to watch whatever they want, and he thought that the government had a role in censoring films that offend public decency.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>However, he went on to say that I made an extraordinary attack on the state government and on the Attorney-General in particular for not using his powers to ban the film. He was saying that I was behaving in a political manner at a neighbourhood watch meeting, which is not true. I asked if I could address the meeting about something that is of great importance and concern to my constituents in my electorate. Jack Snelling does not understand that South Australia have maintained their own state based classification board and the South Australian Attorney-General can at any time refer a matter to the review board. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âOnce again we have seen, in the last few days, what is really happening with the Howard government. What we have seen in relation to interest rates and what we have seen in relation to Iraq is the exposure of what this government was about at the election. We have seen the establishment of a position on Iraq which shows that the government went to the last election misleading the Australian people. What we have seen with respect to interest rates is the proposal that they will be lower, that they will not go up. That was said in the campaign. It was said in Aston, it was said in Boothby, it was said in Deakin; it was said all over the country by those opposite. They made it clear and they allowed that argument to go right out there in the community. Now what have we seen? We have seen that change. We can see that that has been exposed. The Reserve Bank has now acted and rates are on the way up. Frankly, this government ought to have a good hard look at the way it is handling the economy. Sixty-six billion dollars in expenditure in the lead-up to the election is a great big bankcard bill!</para>

Can I gently point out to the Leader of the Opposition that, although I would have to very carefully check every example that he has cited, I would have thought over the last few years the growth performance of the Australian economy far outstripped that of just about every country in the example that he has quoted.</para>

<para>The Leader of the Opposition has promised a more sophisticated debate on the economy. One of the things that the Leader of the Opposition ought to understand is that over the last five yearsâand you can even go back over the last 10 yearsâthe growth performance of the Australian economy, the reductions in unemployment that we have achieved, the business investment levels that we have achieved and the fiscal strength that we have achieved have far outstripped that of every country with which it is reasonable to make comparisons.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Mitchell for what is a very important question about a very encouraging series of developments. I would be the first to agree that one should greet with some caution the announcement made over the weekend about a phased Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon. But the very fact that that announcement has been made is a remarkable thing in itself, and it is the latest in a series of very encouraging developments. As I will mention to the House later when I make a statement about the sending of an Australian task group to southern Iraq, one of the most inspiring images of recent years has been that of brave Iraqi men and women holding their ink-stained fingers aloft after they have participated in an exercise in democracy. That particular event is of a piece with other encouraging events in the Middle East: the democratic process that led to the election of Mahmoud Abbas, who is showing a strength and a dignity in leading the Palestinian people that was absent in earlier years, and the hopeful developments towards a more democratic approach in even Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Taking all of these events together, there is reason to have both hope and some belief that things may be taking a turn for the better.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I do not want to overstate it, and in all likelihood some of the advances that have been made over the last few months will go into reverse in the future, but it was almost unthinkable six months ago that people could be talking about the sort of successful election that took place in Iraq, it was almost unthinkable six months ago that people could be even talking about a Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon and it was unthinkable six months ago that we could be talking about the possibility of some kind of settlement between the Israelis and the Palestinians.</para>
<para>There are obligations on everyone in this. That is my view, and I am speaking as somebody who has always been a close and unapologetic supporter of the state of Israel. That is a view that I conveyed to the Israeli President when I saw him last week: that there are obligations on Israel as there are obligations on the Palestinians. It remains one of the great missed opportunities of modern times that the offer made by Ehud Barak in the year 2000 was not taken up by Yasser Arafat. But that is five years ago; it is in the past. What we are concerned about is the opportunities of the present.</para>
<para>Can I say to the honourable member for Mitchell that there are some signs of real hope, but we do need to have further dialogue to bring about an immediate withdrawal of the Syrian forces, the end of external support for terrorist groups such as Hezbollah and the disbanding of the militias. The announcement made by the Syrian leader is only a beginning, but one hopes there is progress made on that. If indeed we do see further progress, history may well record that the toppling of Saddam Hussein from his position of brutal dictatorship was one of the more significant events in the Middle East in long years.</para>

<para>âI stand by everything that I said in relation to the matter raised by the Leader of the Opposition. Can I simply make the pointâhe keeps talking about broken commitmentsâthat the commitment that, above all, I made to the Australian people at the time of the last election was to maintain the strength of the Australian economy. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition, to try and bring him back to a little sense of realityâand I know he does not really like to hear thisâthat this country has the lowest unemployment level in 30 years. It still has historically low interest rates, infinitely lower interest rates than Labor was ever able to manage in the years that it was in government. It has a budget surplus which, in the words of the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia when he was giving testimony to the House of Representatives committee a couple of weeks ago, is the envy of reserve bank governors, central bank governors and governments around the world.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This government have given the Australian economy a strong fiscal position. We have reduced unemployment, we have brought forth business investment and, desperate though the Leader of the Opposition may be to try and build a case of economic calamity off the back of an adjustment of a quarter of one per cent in interest rates, nothing can gainsay the fact that, on any comparison, over the last five to 10 years the Australian economy has had a stellar performance. No sort of twisting and turning by the Leader of the Opposition can alter that fact. I remind the Leader of the Opposition of an answer I gave on 23 September last year when being interviewed on the Neil Mitchell program. When asked:</para>

<para>âI thank the honourable member for Goldstein for his question. Although it is a public document I can again table the intergovernmental agreement between the Commonwealth and the states which has as its objective the abolition of inefficient state taxes. It details the taxes that the states pledged to abolish in response to receiving GST revenue. Some of them, such as debits tax, they pledged to abolish by 2001 and the remainder they promised to review in 2005 in the light of collections to ascertain whether those collections would justify and fund the removal of the remaining taxes.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Since 1 July 2000, when the GST came in, the collections have exceeded expectations. In 2004-05, on the latest estimates given to heads of Treasury, New South Wales will get a windfall of $124 million, Victoria will get a windfall of $272 million, Western Australia will get a windfall of $252 million, South Australia will get a windfall of $160 million, Tasmania will get a windfall of $100 million and Queensland will get a windfall the dimensions of which would be embarrassing if I read it out to the House.</para>

<para>âNo, it is embarrassingâno, no I cannot do it in all conscience! In response to those rising GST collections, there is now no excuse for the state governments not to abolish those taxes which were outlined for abolition in 1999. We will be holding state governments to the agreement that they signed in 1999 because we are going to stand up for the taxpayers and the consumers of Australia. The critical question, of course, is whether the other side of politics will stand up for the consumers and businesses of Australia. In an otherwise embarrassing interview on the <inline font-style="italic">Insiders</inline> on Sunday, the member for Lilley actually did say thisâand I compliment him for saying it:</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<quote>
<para class="block">I think the states should adhere to the principles they signed up to in the GST agreement.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is fair enough. There is the agreement. A few phone calls must have been made on Sunday night because on Sunday he said, âThe states should adhere to the signed GST agreement.â On his way into parliament this morning he was asked the very same question. Listen to his answer from this morning. Question: âWhat is your view on these state taxes, Wayne? Should they be reduced?â His answer: âMy view on the state taxes is the Commonwealth and the states ought to sit down and renegotiate their agreement.â</para>
<para>Why would you renegotiate the agreement? It is a written, signed agreement. The signed agreement requires the states, as they receive GST revenue, to abolish those state taxes. There is nothing to renegotiate. What there is to do is to hold the states to their agreement. That is what has to be done, and that is what this government will defend. One of Laborâs so-called statesmen was quoted as saying: âWhen the state Labor premiers joined forces to bring down the member for Werriwa as Leader of the Opposition and to install the now member for Brand, it would have been a bad day for the Labor Party because the new leader of federal Labor, having been placed there by state premiers, would be incapable of ever standing up to state Labor premiers.â They wanted a patsy as leader and they found a patsy as leaderâthe patsy from Brand. Within 24 hours, the signed agreementâwhich federal Labor said the states had to agreeâhas to be renegotiated. Let me make it clear: there is nothing to renegotiate. The only thing that has to be done is to uphold this agreement.</para>

<para>âI thank the honourable member for her question and appreciate her interest in this issue. Let me make it clear to start with that the government does welcome the decision of the Indonesian South Jakarta District Court to convict Abu Bakar Bashir for his involvement in the Bali bombings. Bashir was convicted by the court for conspiracy to cause an explosion. It also has to be said that the government is disappointed about the length of the sentence. The sentence handed down was for 30 months, with the 10 months that Abu Bakar Bashir has been in prison already to be taken into account. Given that Abu Bakar Bashir has been convicted of the involvement of a conspiracy in relation to the Bali bombings in which 88 of our fellow citizens died, we believe that that sentence is too light. On the day the sentence was handed down, I instructed our ambassador to make contact with Indonesian authorities and to let it be known that we regard that sentence as too short and hope that the prosecution may consider lodging an appeal so that the sentence through the appeals process can be lengthened.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I do not want people to make the mistake of thinking that today Indonesiaâs legal system is the same as it was under President Suharto. It is not. This is an independent legal system and we respect the independence of the Indonesian courts. So we hope that the prosecution will consider appealing to a higher court. Let me also say that Indonesia does have a strong track record on arresting and prosecuting terrorists and that we appreciate enormously the cooperation of the Indonesian governmentâPresident Megawati and President Bambang Yudhoyono, other ministers and officials in Indonesiaâsince the Bali bombings in countering terrorism.</para>
<para>Remember that all 33 prosecuted in the Denpasar courts for their role in the Bali bombings have been found guilty. Three of those have been sentenced to death and four of them have been sentenced to life imprisonment. Since December 2000, Indonesian authorities have detained 178 individuals on terrorist related charges. The government will continue to assist Indonesia to combat terrorism. We appreciate enormously what the Indonesian government has done to fight terrorism. That should not be underestimated, but we do hope that an appeal can be lodged and successfully achieved to extend the sentence handed down to Abu Bakar Bashir.</para>

<para>âI am always happy to check the transcripts of what anybody says in contributing to the economic debate. I certainly find when I look at the Treasurerâs transcripts that his is always a very constructive and intelligent contribution to the economic debate. My recollection of the last few days is that when the Treasurer has talked about comparative interest rates he has talked about interest rates moving between six and eight per cent. My recollection is that that has been during the time that we have been in government. He has also mentioned a movement between 10Â½ and 17 per cent. I wonder who was in government when we had that movement!</para>

Whether or not you are a borrower, nobody likes interest rates to go upâthat is never welcomeâbut the reality is that a 25 basis point movement in interest rates does not of itself in any way undermine the basic strength of the Australian economy. It is important we preserve a sense of proportion. The last great interest rate movement that really occupied the attention of this parliament was in fact the interest rate movement totalling some two per cent in an upward direction that occurred during the last two years of the Keating government. I think it brought forth an observation from me that this country had enjoyed just five minutes of economic sunshine before the interest rates had begun to rise.</para>
<para>I have got disappointing news for the Leader of the Opposition: you cannot run a negative scare campaign of doom and gloom off the back of a 25 basis point increase in interest rates, particularly when you have such an appalling heritage as a member of a former government that presided over interest rates of 17 per cent for home owners, 20 per cent for small business and 21 per cent for Australian farmers.</para>

<para>âI thank the honourable member for Hasluck for his question. I am sure he as a new member in this place, especially as he comes from Western Australia, has a great deal of interest in our relationships with our near neighbours in South-East Asia. In recent years the relationship with Malaysiaâeconomically and otherwiseâhas been significantly improving. We welcome the announcement made by the Prime Minister yesterday that Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi will visit Australia in April. It is interesting to note that this will be the first official visit to Australia by a Malaysian Prime Minister since 1984. It is over 20 years since a Malaysian Prime Minister has visited Australia.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This visit provides an opportunity for both Australia and Malaysia to explore ways that we can further strengthen the already substantial economic relationship that exists between our two countries. Malaysia is now our ninth largest trading partner, with two-way trade last year worth about $9.6 billion. In July last year I agreed with my Malaysian counterpart, Minister Rafidah Aziz, that we would conduct parallel scoping studies for a free trade agreement between Australia and Malaysia. Those studies are now substantially complete and both sides are close to deciding the next step in this process. Obviously the benefits from an FTA would include further reductions of tariff barriers to agricultural exports; greater flows, both direct and indirect; investment; and better access for our services sector, particularly educational institutions and legal firms.</para>
<para>It is interesting to note the substantial size of the trading relationship that exists between the two countries today. In 1993, the year that Prime Minister Keating made that infamous ârecalcitrantâ comment, two-way trade between the two countries was worth $3.9 billion. This yearâ2005, the year that the Howard government welcomes and hosts a visit by Prime Minister Abdullah Badawiâtwo-way trade will be worth over $10 billion. Our objective is to continue to strengthen this important regional relationship.</para>

<para class="block">Of course the Japanese, the British and the Americans have also strongly welcomed our decision to provide an additional deployment to the al-Muthana province. This is also a decision that was made under the United Nations Security Council resolution 1546, so those who believe we should act under United Nations Security Council resolutions will be pleased to know that this is indeed under one of those resolutions.</para>
<para>Iraq is at a critical point, and any responsible political partyâany responsible governmentâwould want to see the new Iraq succeed. It does not matter what views you once had about whether Saddam Hussein should have been removed or notâand I know some in this House criticised the government for the role we played in removing Saddam Husseinâbut you would think all people today would think that the important thing is to make sure that the new, democratic Iraq is a success. Australia is not just a small, regional player; Australia is a significant country with a significant contribution to make to the world, not just its region. With that in mind, why would we turn our backs on the people of Iraq at this critical time?</para>
<para>The ALP, under their revived Leader of the Oppositionânot surprisingly, as is characteristic of the Leader of the Opposition in years gone byâwant to walk both sides of the street. The Leader of the Opposition said in a doorstop on 22 February on this issue: âThe troopsâ presence is a two-edged sword. It helps on the one front and it doesnât help on the other.â That is classic Beazley.</para>
<para>At one point the Labor Party were accusing the government of misleading the public, that we had misled the public back in October 2004 on the troop deployments, and the next moment they say we are making policy on the run. You cannot be doing both. We cannot have been making a decision back before October 2004 and be making policy on the run today.</para>
<para>The Labor Party says we should bring our troops back from Iraq because we have a need for them in South-East Asia. Who has invited our troops into South-East Asia at the moment? The Leader of the Opposition says we need to put investment into maritime security in South-East Asia but that we should leave the Navy in the Persian Gulf and bring the troops backâwhat, for maritime security in South-East Asia? If I may say so, the argument of the Leader of the Opposition is deeply confusing. The opposition says we should provide more humanitarian assistance to Iraqâin other words, that we should send more civilians into Iraq unarmed but that we should not be providing support to the Japanese, who are doing humanitarian work in Iraq.</para>
<para>The Leader of the Opposition claims to be some sort of global expert on international security issues. He has managed to convince some people on the political Left in this country of the truth of that but, when it comes to a significant issue like this, he is unable to put together a single coherent argument. The Labor Party have had, since March last year, 17 different policies on the issue of Iraq. They went into the Christmas period saying that over Christmas they would consultâthey would consult with the United Nations, they would consult with the Iraqis and they would consult with the Americansâand then when they came back after Christmas they would have a new policy. It is 121 days since the member for Griffith said he would consult, and he has not consultedâor, if he has consulted, we would be delighted to hear the conclusions of those consultations. But, ultimately, what is the most fascinating political aspect of this issueânot the greatest issue of substance but the most interesting political issueâis that on this issue the Leader of the Opposition characteristically cannot make up his mind.</para>

<para>âLet me start by saying that, after our almost nine years in office, the Australian people had an opportunity only a few months ago to make a judgment about who they would trust with the stewardship of their economic future, and I might remind the Leader of the Opposition that on that occasion they did choose the government. Whether they choose the government in the future will be a matter of the governmentâs performance and also the performance of the opposition. But let me go directly to the substance of the first part of the Leader of the Oppositionâs question: yes, it is true that foreign debt is higher now than it was in 1995âof course it is. It is also true that in 1995 this country had a huge budget deficit, something that the then Minister for Finance denied. The then finance minister is now, of course, the Leader of the Opposition. The country had higher interest rates than it has now, it had much higher unemployment, it had lower levels of business investment; and the overall international assessment of the Australian economy in September 1995 was much gloomier than the assessments that have recently been made by bodies such as the IMF and the OECD.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Also let me say that the government in 1995âbecause it was a borrower, because it was running large deficitsâwas making a contribution to the savings difficulties that the country had whereas now it is a net public saver because we run budget surpluses. The government is in fact acting to ameliorate the situation. Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition that every attempt that the newly elected government in 1996 made to correct the economic difficulties we inherited he tried to block. I cannot think of a single corrective measure for the fiscal position of this country that the Leader of the Opposition supported when he was previously the Leader of the Opposition. He was perfectly happy to leave us with the double whammy: he was perfectly happy as finance minister to leave us with a huge deficit and he was perfectly happy as the Leader of the Opposition to then do everything in his power to prevent us correcting that deficit.</para>
<para>The Leader of the Opposition can ask any questions he likes about what was said in 1995. I remember 1995 very well and so do 19 million to 20 million Australians. At that time, we had a government that 19 million Australians were desperate to get rid of, and they gave effect to their passion on 2 March 1996. They threw out the Keating-Beazley government in 1996, and I believe that, if his performance to date is any guide, they will throw out the Beazley opposition at the next available opportunity.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Bonner for his very good question. I can confirm to the House that this government will provide free chickenpox vaccine to infants turning 18 months, and there will be a free catch-up program for children under 13 who have not yet had this illness. I can inform the House that in the past two years for which we have figures some 19 people died and some 3,300 people were hospitalised from chickenpox. The initiative announced today will save many parents the $70 that it costs to have their children privately vaccinated.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I am very proud to defend the governmentâs record on vaccination. In 1996, the Commonwealth government spent just $13 million on vaccines. As a result of the measures announced today, it is estimated that in the next financial year the Howard government will spend $286 million on vaccinesâa 22-fold increase on the 1996 figure. Thanks to the policies of this government, childhood immunisation rates, which were languishing at just 50 per cent in the early 1990s, are now well above 90 per cent and are the envy of the world. These initiatives demonstrate that you can trust the Howard government with the health system of this country. You can rely on the Howard government to make a very good system even better.</para>

<para>âThe answer to the last part of the member for Hothamâs question is no. Obviously the premise he bases the earlier assertion on is the fact that, if Labor were still in office, the Australian economy would be nowhere near as strong as it is now; therefore, not requiring the inputs and the investments in business that have taken place in recent years. I also point out to the member for Hotham that exports rose $11.7 billion in 2004 to $152.5 billion. In 1996, when we took office from Labor, it was $99 billion. We should also recognise the significant growth in the economy that has taken place over those eight or nine years. The economy of Australia is much larger today than it was then. It is interesting to note that, a couple of years ago, we had a major drought in Australia that had a significant effect on our productive capability and therefore our export effort as far as our agricultural exports were concerned.</para>

<para>âAt the same time the advent of the SARS epidemic in East Asia had an impact on demand for our exports in that region, and our exports dipped a little to $147 billion. They are now back up to $152Â½ billion. Only once before in the history of Australia have they been higher than that. That was in 2000-01, when they were $153 billion. The forecasts are that they will grow during the next couple of years. The government is maintaining a strong economic base in Australia that puts our export producers in a much better shape to compete with the world. Over those eight years, we have implemented policies of industrial relations reforms in this country, with more to come, that make our producers, our manufacturers and our exporters more efficient and more competitive. We have embarked upon an external trade policy of opening up markets, where we can and when we can, to provide more opportunities for Australiaâs exporters.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Bowman for his question. I can inform him and honourable members that the governmentâs reforms of the workplace relations system, particularly through the Workplace Relations Act 1996, have led to real benefits for Australian peopleâfor example, increases in real wages since 1996 are at 12.2 per cent compared to just 1.2 per cent between 1983 and 1996. We have the lowest unemployment rate in Australia for some 28 years and we have the lowest levels of industrial disputes since records were first kept, which was at the time of the First World War. The changes to the workplace relations laws and to the system in Australia have been crucial to these outcomes for Australian people, yet every major reform in this area since 1996 has been staunchly opposed by the Australian Labor Party. I was surprised therefore today to read a piece by the Leader of the Opposition in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper in which he said:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>

<para class="block">There are two conclusions one can draw from what the Leader of the Opposition said.

Secondly, if the Leader of the Opposition is saying that the system does not need radical changeâas he is quoted in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> as sayingâwill he now update his partyâs industrial relations platform, because the Labor Partyâs industrial relations platform effectively calls for the dismantling of the reforms that have been put in place since 1996?

She also neglects to acknowledge the contributions that private health insurance makes to taking the load off the public hospital sector. Professor Ian Harper of the University of Melbourne has found that every dollar spent on the 30 per cent rebate saves $2 in government health spending.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The member for Lalor is concerned about the impact on typical families. If a 30 per cent rebate were removedâwhich was certainly Laborâs policy in 1998 when it was introduced, because they voted against it and, if it had not been for the courageous support of Senator Harradine in the other place, the measure would never have got throughâthere would be an increase of $800 a year to maintain private health insurance by typical families. I remind the House, while I am on the subject of rebates, that the Labor Partyâs negative response to the proposal to increase the premium for people over the ages of 65 and 70 is another reminder of how the Labor Party in practice is pursuing policies that would add to the cost of private health insurance for elderly Australians.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Hinkler not only for his question but for his great hospitality last Friday when I accompanied him to the opening of one of Australiaâs great resource projects, the $1.5 billion project in Gladstone for Comalcoâs alumina refinery, for which the federal government provided assistance to Comalco to build a cogeneration plant. That is another example of federal government support for infrastructure, bringing home the bacon.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>That is not the only example of resource development and expansion in Australia. In 2004-05 the resource sectorâs exports are expected to increase by 20 per cent, or around $12 billion. Three commodities alone will lead the way: iron ore, up 35 per cent; metallurgical coal, up 52 per cent; thermal coal, up 43 per cent. But the best news is still to come. If we look out to 2005-06 we will see increases in exports of some 22 per cent, or the value of resource exports being worth some $82 billion. Again, coal will lead the way. Export earnings from coking coal are expected to increase 70 per cent to $18 billion in 2005-06, and thermal coal will increase 19 per cent to $7.4 billion.</para>
<para>I have been asked about threats. It will be no surprise to this House that the threats to export growth come from the Labor Party. In this case the threat to the growth comes from the Beattie government, which has made a complete bungle of the Dalrymple Bay lease. I know that the Leader of the Opposition thinks that the solution for the Labor Partyâperhaps he owes Premier Beattie yet another favourâis for the federal government to throw in some $400 million. In fact he said so the other day. But this government does not run deficit budgets the way the Labor Party ran deficit budgets when the Leader of the Opposition was finance minister. We believe that the people who make the mistakes should fix the mistakes.</para>
<para>I thought to myself that perhaps I should check with the state Labor Treasurer who ran surplus budgets at about the same time as the Leader of the Opposition, then finance minister, was involved in a government that was running deficit budgets. I checked to see what the former Treasurer for Queensland, Keith De Lacy, said of the company of which he is chairmanâMacarthur Coal. He said:</para>

<para>âThe assertion on which that question is based is wrongâthat is, the claim, which was echoed by the Leader of the Opposition this morning, that the federal government has not matched state increases in funding for vocational education between 1997 and 2003. That is just wrong. Overall, the states increased VET funding by 21.3 per cent over this periodâand I am using the figures of the Leader of the Opposition. The Commonwealth government has increased overall vocational education and training funding by 35.5 per cent over the same period. Can I remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that new apprentices in training have increased from 143,000 in 1995 to 393,800 in September 2004. Can I also remind the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who is so fond of trumpeting the virtues of state Labor governments, that the most notorious blow that has been struck to the prospects of young trainees in Australia was the 200 per cent to 300 per cent increase in TAFE fees implemented by a large number of state governments.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The coalition has allocated over $1 billion in new funding for vocational education and training over the next three years, one of the most significant boosts by any government in years. This year the federal government will spend $2.1 billion on vocational education and training. By contrast, the states and territories have been cutting their training budgets. I repeat: they have been cutting their training budgetsâNew South Wales by 2.4 per cent in real terms, Western Australia by 2.1 per cent and the Northern Territory by 5.2 per cent. In real terms, the Commonwealth government has lifted funding for training by 22 per cent since 1995. Figures released last week by the National Centre for Vocational Education Research show that commencements in traditional trades increased by 19 per cent in the 12 months to September 2004, completions are up 11 per cent on the previous year and school based new apprenticeship commencements rose by 52 per cent in the year to September 2004. When the current Leader of the Opposition was Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the number of new apprentices in training fell to an all-time low of 122,700 compared to 393,800 today.</para>
<para>Skills shortages are a product of a strong economy and low unemployment. Let me repeat something that I said in an interview yesterday. We are paying the price now for, I think, a generation of attitudes in this country which basically said that if you wanted to get ahead in life you should go to year 12 and go on to university. Going into a trade was denigrated by too many people, including parents. This is not the fault of one or the other side of politics; it is a judgment on attitudes that existed. But one criticism that I certainly will not wear, and which cannot be sustained by any kind of objective analysis, is that this government, in the years it has been in office, has neglected training. The figures that I have just given to the House give the lie to that.</para>

<para>âThe noisy interjections from the other side vindicate the accuracy of the figures that I have quoted. We have not cut funding; we have lifted funding. We have more than matched the states. We have presided over a dramatic increase in the number of apprentices in this country, and the figures we have today, compared to the figures presided over by the Leader of the Opposition when he was the minister, should leave that gentleman hanging his head in shame.</para>

<para>âI thank the honourable member for Lindsay for the question, because I think many members are aware of the importance of volunteers. I know in the member for Lindsayâs electorate, as in mine, we often face the hazard of bushfires and we rely very heavily upon the rural fire services as well as organisations like the state emergency services. We do rely very heavily on the commitment of volunteers right around Australia. We know that something of the order of half a million people are involved in volunteering their services in some form of emergency management capacity and 350,000 of those are involved in emergency first response. We need to keep this commitment going. We need to ensure that the all-hazards approach that we take to deal with emergencies is ably supported by a band of willing and well-supported volunteers.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Last week, I chaired the inaugural meeting of all state and territory ministers who have responsibility for emergency services, and it was an opportunity to progress some of the initiatives that the Commonwealth is pursuing. In particular, it focused on tangible ways of enhancing the emergency service volunteer base and underscored the importance of the commitment made by the coalition of $49 million over time in its Working Together to Manage Emergencies policy announced at the last election. When implemented, that will provide an opportunity for local authorities to obtain grants to directly assist volunteer organisations.</para>
<para>I am very interested in alternative policies in relation to these matters, particularly where volunteers are concerned, and I have looked closely to see where alternative policies might come from. I must say during the course of the last election I could not find any alternative policies being presented by the opposition, which made me interested in a statement from the member for Barton that, when the coalition was dealing with these issues, he seemed to become aware of the importance of volunteers. But his approach was to simply encourage the Commonwealth to endorse a proposal from the states for a national taxation rebate for emergency service volunteers. I have not asked the Treasurer whether he would like to cost such an item but, if the opposition are going to find policies in this area, let them also recognise what resources are involved and argue tangibly what policies they have in mind and the costs that they are prepared to attach to them.</para>

<para>âby leaveâThe House will be aware that on 22 February I announced the governmentâs decision to send an Australian task group to Iraq. The task group will go to Al Muthanna province in southern Iraq. It will work closely with the Japanese Iraq Reconstruction Support Group, which is making a valuable humanitarian contribution to the rebuilding process in that province. It will also work closely with British forces who maintain operational control of southern Iraq. The Australian task group will have two roles. First, it will provide a secure environment for the Japanese Iraq Reconstruction Support Group, which is currently building roads and schools, ensuring a clean water supply and delivering incidental health services to the people of that province. Second, the task group will be involved in the further training of Iraqi security forces. That training is essential if Iraqis are to assume responsibility for their own security.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This deployment involved a difficult decision taken by the government after careful consideration of Australiaâs interests and our global and regional responsibilities. It is a sign of Australiaâs commitment to the people of Iraq in their struggle for a better future. It is also a sign of the importance the government places on working with Japan, a close friend and regional partner, on global security issues.</para>
<para>Iraq today is at a critical juncture; I have called it a âtilting pointââone where the balance between success and failure turns on a test of wills. Terrorists and insurgents have set themselves the goal of thwarting the emergence of a secure and democratic Iraq. The international community must join and deny them this objective. Australia shares an opportunity and an obligation to help build a secure and democratic Iraq, an opportunity given new force by the magnificent expression of Iraqi democracy that we all witnessed at the end of January. A failure of will now would be an abrogation of our nationâs interests and values. It would see Australia shun our closest friends, reward our avowed enemies and turn away from a courageous people who have chosen the path of our deepest convictions.</para>
<para>The task group will total approximately 450 men and women of the ADF, the bulk drawn from the Darwin based 1st Brigade. It will include some 40 ASLAV armoured vehicles. The period from my announcement of the task group through to deployment will be approximately 10 weeks. The task group will add to approximately 920 ADF personnel currently deployed to the Middle East area of operations. At present, some 50 to 70 Australian personnel are engaged in training Iraqi security forces north of Baghdad. This contingent will be rolled into the Al Muthanna Task Group when their current assignment is completed. The task group will operate under the national command of Australiaâs joint task force in the Middle East area of operations, while being under operational control of the United Kingdom Multi-National Division in southern Iraq. ADF units and personnel deployed in Iraq remain under Australian national command and in all their operations will abide by Australian law.</para>
<para>The precise length of the deployment will be determined by circumstances as they emerge, bearing in mind that the central goal of the coalition in Iraq is to ensure the earliest practicable transfer of internal and external security to the Iraqis themselves. Initially, the task group deployment will be for a period of 12 months, based on two rotations of six months each. If the Japanese presence were to end prior to the conclusion of the initial 12-month deployment, the government would then review the operation. The interim Iraqi government warmly welcomes and endorses the Australian task group deployment. The continued presence of our forces in Iraq will be conditional on the continuing support of the incoming Iraqi transitional government.</para>
<para>While I have stated consistently that we keep the level and composition of our forces in Iraq under review, I have not sought to disguise the fact that this deployment represents a change in the governmentâs previously stated position that we did not plan any major increase in our commitment. This change reflects the convergence of some new circumstances on the ground. As I have said before, from time to time since the end of combat operations in March 2003 there have been informal requests from the Americans and the British for a greater Australian presence in Iraq. So far as the decision I announced on 22 February is concerned, the trigger for discussions within the coalition involving Australia was the final confirmation by the Dutch in mid-November 2004 of their decision not to renew their deployment to Iraq.</para>
<para>For the past two years the Dutch have maintained some 1,400 troops in Al Muthanna province, providing security for the Japanese forces. Under Japanâs constitution, that countryâs military can only operate in a non-combat zone and can only be involved in humanitarian and reconstruction activities, and the use of force by the Japanese is limited to self-defence only. Unless additional security could be provided to replace the Dutch, there was a real possibility the Japanese could no longer remain in Iraq and therefore no longer continue their rehabilitation and humanitarian work. This would have been a serious blow to the coalitionâs reconstruction effort and to the broader credibility of the coalition in Iraq.</para>
<para>The House will, of course, in considering the governmentâs decision, be aware of the very heavy burden being carried in Iraq by the United States in particular and also by a significant contribution of British forces. Japanâs presence in Iraq as part of the coalition is very important, both in substance and through its symbolism. Japan is a significant Asian power, a great Pacific democracy and a global economic power. Its presence in Iraq indicates the broad range of nations working to assist that country to consolidate a democratic future.</para>
<para>The other factor weighing heavily on the Australian governmentâs decision making was the success of the Iraqi national electionsâan outcome far more inspiring and impressive than anybody was entitled to expect. Nothing better illustrates what is at stake in Iraq than the memorable images of brave Iraqi men and women holding aloft their ink-stained fingers to record their first ever act of democratic freedom.</para>
<para>We should not underestimate the positive force that thisâthe first genuine experiment in Arab democracyâcan have in bringing a more hopeful future to the Middle East. Indeed, recent months have seen a number of very positive developments in that troubled region. As well as the success of the Iraqi elections, we have seen new steps towards peace between Israel and the Palestinians. We have seen moves towards multicandidate presidential elections in Egypt and greater democracy at a municipal level in Saudi Arabia. And just last week there was a dramatic expression of people power in Lebanon which has led to an announcement of a phased Syrian withdrawal from that country. The importance to all these events of the ousting of Saddam Husseinâopening the way to democracy in Iraqâshould not be underestimated. It may yet prove an historic turning point for the Middle Eastâone that can profoundly alter the outlook for freedom and democracy in that part of the world.</para>
<para>For the benefit of the House, I put on record the key exchanges between the Australian, British and Japanese governments leading up to my announcement of the task group.</para>
<para>Confirmation in mid-November 2004 of the Dutch governmentâs decision not to renew their Iraq deployment led to discussions between coalition partners on the need to maintain an appropriate security force in Al Muthanna province. On 20 January 2005 the United Kingdom Defence Secretary, Mr Geoffrey Hoon, conveyed a request to Senator Hill for an Australian contribution in the province. The United Kingdom Foreign Secretary, Mr Jack Straw, wrote to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 4 February 2005 requesting Australian support.</para>
<para>The National Security Committee of cabinet met on 16 February 2005 and considered the matter very carefullyâon the basis of advice from the Chief of the Defence Force, the Chief of Army and assessments from relevant intelligence agencies. The Prime Minister of Japan, Mr Junichiro Koizumi, telephoned me on 18 February and requested Australiaâs contribution. The British Prime Minister, Mr Tony Blair, telephoned me in Auckland on 21 February to reinforce the requests that had previously been conveyed by Mr Hoon and Mr Straw to Senator Hill and to the foreign minister.</para>
<para>I want to repeat that this deployment was not an easy decision for the government. I know it will be unpopular with a good number of Australians. But a government, acting in the national interest, must have a capacity to respond to new circumstances as they arise. The military deployment does involve a risk of Australian casualties. The security situation in this part of Iraq, however, is different from that in other areas, particularly the Sunni triangle. Al Muthanna province has a small population and, relatively speaking, has seen a low level of violence. Nevertheless, Iraq remains a dangerous place and the ADF constantly reviews the threat environment and adjusts its force protection measures accordingly.</para>
<para>The government has ensured that the ADF personnel are well trained and have the right type of equipment for their mission. All 40 ASLAVs will be fitted with enhanced protective measures to ensure multiple layers of protection for each vehicle. In some cases, enhanced protection will be fitted on arrival in theatre prior to operations commencing. We will not discuss exact details of enhancements to individual vehicles for operational security reasons.</para>
<para>There has been some commentary relating to the fact that the size of the Australian task group is substantially less than the Dutch contingent it is replacing. This largely reflects the different tasks of the two forces. Whereas the Dutch contingent assumed broad security responsibilities, the Australian task group will have a narrower mission working in collaboration with British forces that will have overall responsibility for the security of the province. The size of the task group also reflects an updated assessment of the enhanced capabilities of Iraqi security forces. In the end, the figure of 450 personnel reflected advice provided to the cabinet by the Australian Defence Force, following consultations with military officials from Britain, Japan and the United States.</para>
<para>This latest commitment to Iraq will not affect Australiaâs ability to support current operations or to respond to our other national and regional tasks. Our forces will continue to discharge their other responsibilities to their normal high standard, whether in the Solomon Islands, in East Timor, or continuing their important humanitarian work in Operation Sumatra Assist. The ADF is prepared, equipped and structured to face all these challenges. In a world more interconnected than ever before, Australia must maintain a global perspective on the security threats we face in the 21st century. Australiaâs capacity to hold such a perspective, necessarily influenced by regional interests and responsibilities, is a measure of our strategic maturity as a nation.</para>
<para>In closing, I know I speak for all members of the House, irrespective of their views on this deployment, in paying tribute to the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. Under tough conditions they are performing magnificent work to secure their country and to extend the reach of peace and freedom. This decision and this deployment are consistent with Australiaâs strategic interests and with the best traditions of our forces. I know that the thoughts and the prayers of all Australians will be with them when they embark on their mission. I thank the House. I present a copy of my ministerial statement.</para>

<para>âThis parliament today debates the most serious of government decisions: the decision to deploy Australian troops overseas. When the Prime Minister announced on 22 February that his government would more than double the number of Australian Defence Force personnel in country in Iraq my first thoughts, and the first thoughts of us all in the Australian Labor Party, were for the safety and wellbeing of our troops. As I said on that day, a large number of young Australians are about to be sent into harms way and those young Australians have our total support. Though we oppose this decision by the government they will continue to have our total support and we will devote ourselves in this parliament to ensuring that, whilst ever they are there, they want for nothing in circumstances in which they may well find themselves inadequately provided for. The Labor Party that I lead demands that the Australian government meet all their needs and requirements. We have been very vocal in the parliament to support the security needs of those troops who are in Iraq already, and we will continue to speak up for the interests of the troops who go now. We will hold the government accountable for the effectiveness with which they pursue the safety of those soldiers. We want all our troops to come back safely. They are important to us and their families are important to us. Just as much as every Australian soldier throughout our history has been one of us, just as much as the unknown Australian soldier who looks down Anzac Parade over our deliberations today was one of us, so the troops who go to Iraq in coming weeks are each one of us, each one an Australian. They go with our best wishes and they go with my prayers among the prayers of millions of other Australians. We hope to see all of them home again and soon.</para>

<para>Sixty years ago one of my predecessors, then Labor leader Ben Chifley, speaking as opposition spokesman on defence, said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Labor opposition would not be doing its duty if it allowed the government to stride blunderingly into error in seven-league boots and then to seek to hide behind a smokescreen of patriotism or to seek to deflect criticism from themselves by talking of the gallantry of our soldiers.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I take the same view. There have been many occasions in the course of the past two years when our British and American allies have wanted and needed much greater levels of support from their friends in Iraq than they were obtaining at that point. The government defends itself in the statements that it has made now that somehow or other a new situation has been created that requires even more support than the government has given to this point. Throughout that period when they needed a great deal more support than they were given, the government turned them down. They were facing simultaneous revolts in the Shiah and Sunni areas. They were under hostile attack, and so were their supporters in that region, in a multiplicity of locations well outside the current Sunni triangle. We find out today that the answer this government gave them when they put their request to us for assistance in those circumstances of dire need was: no, we will not help you.</para>
<para>The Prime Minister said in the remarks that he made today that âat low levels requests were being made to us throughout that period of time by our allies to give them more supportâ. In fact, when these issues were raised with you in previous years, you denied that was happening. You hid behind the fact that you kept at that low level a barrier against raising those requests to you up to a level where your ministers would have to consider them, so you would be in a position where you could not say the Americans have asked us for the assistance that they desperately need in the circumstances that now confront them. Right through that period of time you maintained a firm position that our involvement had concluded with the conclusion of the first phase of hostilities. Now with Iraq much quieter, arguably less of a requirement for any additional participation and an election safely out of the way, the Prime Minister has backed away from a firm position with the United States and Britain which represented a substantial and reasonable strategic judgment at that time and now.</para>
<para>I did not agree with the commitment of this government to the war in Iraq. I thought the position of the Australian government was rife with miscalculation. One thing that is very much missing from the Prime Ministerâs remarks here today justifying his position in relation to sending additional Australians to Iraqâone thing that we do not hear from the Prime Minister todayâis any discussion of the elimination of and the stockpiling of weapons of mass destructionâchemical, biological and nuclear. We hear nothing about that. We hear very little from the Prime Minister about the alleged al-Qaeda associations of the previous Iraqi regime, which was also part of the rationale. What was not part of the Prime Ministerâs rationale was the removal of the then government of Iraq which the Prime Minister explicitly eschewed when he was invited to comment on that matter during the course of the debates over the initial commitment of forces to Iraq. We have not heard any of that justification here.</para>
<para>I disagreed with that commitment to the war but I gave him this credit: I respected the hardness of mind that went with informing our allies that we had other interests which would time limit our involvement. I respected that hardness of mind in the Prime Minister. A similar judgment was made by this government in relation to Afghanistanâearlier than I would have made it, but nevertheless reasonablyâand reflected a hardness of mind. That was in a case where engagement with al-Qaeda Central and global terrorism was a much more clear-cut issue. You decided then you would put no troops into Afghanistan, they had an election in Afghanistan, the Afghanistan government invited you to assist them while they were having that election campaign, we were inspired by the election results in Afghanistan and you have had nothing to do with it since then, despite the fact that in Afghanistan they confront al-Qaeda Central in dealing with those problems. So do not come here and wave around this sort of mock flag about the commitments that you are prepared to step up for to democracy in the Middle East when you have a record as flawed as yours.</para>
<para>I thought it was a hardness of mind because I do not think it is an unreasonable position: even though I disagreed on Iraq, I agreed on Afghanistan. In areas outside our immediate region of strategic importance of South-East Asia and East Asiaâwhich actually happened to be called âLittle Australiaâ by our foreign minister; that is a very big ambition for âLittle Australiaâ, I might say, all of South-East Asia and East Asiaâit is not an unreasonable thing for Australia to consider support for its ally from time to time when our mutual interests are engaged or some value or purpose that ought to be served by assisting our ally requires an Australian flag at that point in time. We have not thought it an unreasonable thing, given the relationship with that part of the struggle in Iraq and with the other struggle against international terrorism, to maintain a strong position in the Persian Gulf; we do not think that an unreasonable thing on a more long-term basis. But we have said we have other responsibilities, and those other responsibilities require a hard-headed attitude so that when we sit down with our allies we say to themâand we mean it when we say it to themââWe will be there occasionally for you outside those areas because you have plenty of help outside those areas, but in Australiaâs area of immediate strategic interest, South-East Asia and East Asia, there virtually is only us, and we confront a terrorist threat in this region, we operate within a major field of jihad in our region, we require expertise in handling that in our region, we require engagement and involvement in that region, we require a capacity to stand by to be of further assistance in that region and we require a capacity to deal with other related problems or unrelated problemsâbe it in New Guinea or the South Pacific or whateverâin that region. Therefore, our friends, we do not commit ourselves permanently outside that area. We are occasionally prepared to provide you with a flag. We have other priorities on which in a hard-headed way we will engage with you, not in a wet-headed way, dancing around whenever you want a little bit extra for your support.â</para>
<para>As for the problem that we are dealing with here, we saw the foreign minister stand up in this place and criticise me for somehow or other walking on both sides of the street. Why did he say I walked on both sides of the street? Apparently it was because I noted the fact that, on one hand, this seemed to have been planned since November and, on the other hand, the Prime Minister said that he had made a decision about it a couple of weeks agoâtherefore he is making policy on the run. That was âwalking both sides of the streetâ. I will tell you what is walking both sides of the street: walking both sides of the street is telling the Australian people repeatedly that you have made a sound strategic judgment, that you have calculated all the issues related to the affairs of Iraq and that you have determined that this is all that you are doing, give or take the odd one or two troopsâand you say it not once but dozens of times.</para>
<para>You have said it dozens of times, at least to the extent that I believed you. I believed that you had come to a sound political and strategic judgment on all of that and that you were not in fact in the business of a light-headed, half-baked, wishy-washy, âweâll keep you at armâs length, friends, but once the electionâs out of the way weâll be back in there for youâ approach. I thought you were serious people and I thought you would take a serious stand on these issues. We now know differently: the flip-flop, walking both sides of the street job, as far as this is concerned, has been done 100 per cent on the other side. We are now left with many questions about this particular commitment. We hope and pray that this is a commitment made in a peaceful environment and that the troops that go will be home by the end of the year unharmed. That will occur if there is a successful agreement by the Sunni and Shiite populations in the aftermath of the election and a civil war does not break out that spreads the current insurgency beyond the area of the Sunni triangle well into the regions with which we are now engaged.</para>
<para>That outcome will produce a safe deployment for our troops and no requirement for additional troopsâit will do that. If that outcome does not occur, the fat will be in the fire not only for us but of course for many others as well. There are many questions now that ought to be asked of the Prime Minister about where he stands on that. This is not South-East Asia and this is not a jungle environment; this is a hot and heavy military environment. What that means is that it is a highly armoured environment. Troops which operate in this environment must have tanks, they must have armoured fighting vehicles, they must have artillery, they must have appropriate air support and they must have helicopters to transport the troops. When we last engaged in a hot and heavy environment like this it was in Vietnam. In Vietnam were Australian tanks, Australian armoured fighting vehicles, Australian helicoptersâ</para>

<para>âWe had all of those things. They were Australian troops who were manning those tanks, those armoured fighting vehicles, those helicopters and that artillery. There are no Australians doing that in Iraq. We are protecting the Japanese, it is said, and I have a question mark over how that invitation got arranged, but more important than us protecting the Japanese is that the British are protecting us. Our troops are protected by British tanks, British armoured fighting vehicles, British helicopters and British artillery. However, if British armoured fighting vehicles, tanks and helicopters become engaged in a civil war and become preoccupied in fighting that war, they will not be there to provide us with that protection and, in those circumstances, the request for more troops will come in and what will you do? In those circumstancesâand remember they will be circumstances in which the Poles and the Ukrainians have also left because they are pulling out over the course of the next six monthsâwe will be in a situation where the same request will come to the Prime Ministerâ</para>

<para>âAnd what will the Prime Minister say then? Will the Prime Minister say there will be additional Australian troops? Will the Prime Minister say that we will provide additional capabilities to those troops? Will the Prime Minister say that we are prepared to pick up not only what were the Dutch obligations but the Polish and Ukrainian ones as well? Will the Prime Minister say that, as those forces become tired fighting the battles against this insurgency, Australian troops will be rotated into that environment? These are questions it is now reasonable to ask. It is reasonable to ask these questions because the Prime Minister has so gravely misled the Australian people on this matter in the period up to our general election, because there were no qualifications in the Prime Ministerâs position.</para>

<para>The Prime Minister did not say, âIf the foreshadowed election turns out to be successful, we will be there.â The Prime Minister did not say, âIf the foreshadowed Dutch departure goes ahead, we will be there.â The Prime Minister did not say, âIf strategic circumstances change, we will be there.â The Prime Minister could have said we would be there or at least allow a qualification, because all those things were known prior to the last federal election as circumstances which might occur. The Prime Minister said to all of that, âNo more.â The Prime Ministerâs judgment was a hard-headed judgment, but this one is a soft-headed judgment: probably inadequately supported forces in circumstances of very great uncertainty. The Australian people expected better of you in this regard, Mr Prime Minister. The troops were owed better from you in this regard and they are owed better from you in the sort of support that they go away with and the operations that they do there. Prime Minister, this was not a sensible idea of yours. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>recognises that Australia needs to elevate the recognition of the importance of language as a skill and resource, both for individuals and as a nation in domestic and international domains.</para>
</item>
</list>
</motion>
<para class="block">Australia has a very proud heritage as a multilingual nation. Although this language resource is not always apparent or, indeed, always acknowledged by all, it is nevertheless the case that here in Australia we are uniquely placed to communicate with the entire world. Our language inheritance began with Australiaâs traditional owners, who endowed us with hundreds of rich and ancient languages, and it continues many years later with waves of immigrants, bringing with them languages from around the world.</para>
<para>This motion recognises that together as a people we are united through our common language, English; but, moreover, this motion recognises and supports immigrants and Indigenous Australians who speak languages other than English and encourages them to retain these languages as they acquire English. In addition to recognising the importance of learning English, this motion also recognises the profound and lasting benefits of second language learning to individuals and to the nation. These benefits include intellectual development, with extensive scientific studies demonstrating that bilingual skills attained by young children can contribute to enhancing their cognitive functioning. Further studies show that language competence can improve cultural vitality and sensitivity through enhanced cultural insight, awareness, understanding and tolerance. In addition, benefits can be derived in trade and commerce through understanding, penetrating and servicing new markets.</para>
<para>In recent years, in both the United Kingdom and the United States, national evaluations of language competence of the populations have been conducted. In both cases, it is recognised that a more unstable and insecure international environment makes it imperative for more citizens to learn more languages. To that end, it is now recognised by the education system of both those countries that they must mount a serious and continuous learning program so that a wide range of languages are encouraged and supported as part of a long-term approach to language planning.</para>
<para>Similar arguments apply to the Australian situation. Australia has a good tradition of teaching languages and developing resources. We also have a reputation internationally for expertise in this area. For decades now, languages other than English have been included in school curriculum, and the variety of languages around us has also broadened greatlyâfrom traditional European languages, such as French and Latin, to the languages of immigrant communities, such as Greek and Italian, and to the languages of our neighbours and business partners, such as Indonesian and Japanese.</para>
<para>The motion recognises that, despite successive government policies on language learning, we have not really succeeded in reaping the maximum benefits of the multilingual resource of the Australian people. Had we seen bilingualism and multilingualism as our greatest tools for enhancing democracy, cultural awareness, intellectual development, and trade and diplomacy, and had we recognised that young children were capable of absorbing several languages at any one time, we would be in the same situation as Europe, where learning several languages is a central aspect of education, providing young Europeans with vast opportunities.</para>
<para>In comparison to Europe and other nations, Australiaâs multilingual language skills rate very poorly. Although there are many Australians, like me, who are capable of conversing in a second language, many other Australians never get the opportunity or support to learn a language to a fluent level, because language learning is seen as an issue for ethnic communities only. We still see ourselves as a predominantly monolingual society, despite our multilingual inheritance. It has not always been easy to gain government support and funding in relation to language learning. In recent years, no new funding has been given to language programs or institutions; instead, there have been many cutbacks and we have seen the abolition of existing and highly successful programs, such as the National Asian Languages Program and the National Language Institute of Australia.</para>
<para>It is imperative that we improve our efforts on language learning. We need to do this through a well-funded, comprehensive policy that strengthens English skills and that actively builds skills in languages other than English. As such, this motion recognises that Australia should develop a national policy on languages based on the principles of âEnglish Plusâ, which can be best expressed as achieving the four Eâs: enrichment, economics, equality and external gain. A committed language policy would see languages other than English become core subjects and no longer be the subject of curriculum cuts.</para>

<para>âI welcome the opportunity to speak on this private memberâs motion. I congratulate the member for Calwell on bringing it forward. We are fortunate that our English language is the most widely spoken language in the world. Today, it is without peer as the language of international business and governance. There are few places in the world where the local people do not possess some basic English. A confident and thorough grasp of English is a real asset for Australians and it strengthens the process of travelling and doing business overseas.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I do not disagree with the first part of this motion, which recognises the common and unifying power of English in Australia. Like all young migrant boys settling into a foreign landâand I know that the member for Calwell will understand this exampleâI learnt quickly that a great deal of our identity and colloquial distinctiveness was tied to our Australian version of English. In no time, a whole community of migrants from across the world were learning all about being âfair dinkumâ. If you look at a migrant-English dictionary, you will see words there that are neither in the English dictionary nor in a personâs native language dictionary.</para>
<para>I recall accompanying my parents in those early days to Beaconsfield Primary School, in Western Australia, for evening English classes. It was my role as a very experienced linguist at the age of 10 to act as an interpreter between my Italian-speaking parents and their English-speaking teacher. This is a far cry from today, where languages are taught by qualified LOTE teachers who can confidently converse with students in both languages. This enables students to develop a finer grasp of what they are learning.</para>
<para>Despite the harmony and diversity of cultures in Australia, multiculturalism has not bred a multilingual society. English has been and remains our unchallenged, dominant language. This may be due to our historical links to the United Kingdom, our geographic isolation, the fact it is the language of business or a combination of these factors.</para>
<para>While we lie on the fringe of South-East Asia, our history has not developed a society where people learn more than one language out of necessity. Multilingual societies are becoming more prevalent overseas, but not here in Australia. It is not unusual to find students in European countries fluent in their language as well as one if not two or three other languages, such as English and French. As just one of thousands of examples that I am sure members can draw on, a friend of mine grew up in such a multilingual society in Istanbul, Turkey, of all places. As a member of the cityâs sizeable Christian community, he was required to develop a fluent grasp of Turkish, French, Italian and Greek to enable him to communicate effectively and to be a contributor to the Turkish society.</para>
<para>While the status of the English language is without question, I disagree with the argument of the member for Calwell that this government is not committed to supporting languages other than English. LOTE is one of the eight key learning areas in the national goals for schooling in the 21st century. As a priority, the government is committed to helping coordinate and plan LOTE programs throughout Australia. As with the general secondary school curriculum, the learning of languages is the responsibility of the state and territory governments.</para>
<para>The government takes its role seriously. It is important that the state and territory Labor governments properly fund language programs in their schools. Over the next four years the Commonwealth has committed around $114 million to support the teaching of Asian, European and Indigenous languages. This support also extends to teaching the vital Auslan sign language, which is critical in my electorate where we have a deaf-specific aged care facility where they are constantly searching for Auslan interpreters. As well, we will be funding community language programs in ethnic schools. The next two years should also see the strong development of future federal LOTE policy. A key plank of this is $4.6 million of seed funding to establish a national language centre, near Redfern in Sydney.</para>
<para>Being from an ethnic background, I believe that communities are better placed than bureaucrats to instil a love of language into young students. The limited time available does not allow me to go through a full description of the governmentâs assistance to these groups, but one example is the $1.3 million annual core grant to the Asia Foundation to support studies of Asia across all curriculum areas. I congratulate the member for Calwell for bringing this debate on. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âAs the first monolinguist to enter this debate, I rise to support the motion moved by the member for Calwell. Some would argue that I am even having trouble with one language, but can I say that I use the only language which I can speak fluently to indicate my support for this motion and also, in the broader sense, to highlight the importance of language and knowledge generally. I, along with a number of members of this House, represent a constituency that is very ethnically diverse. In my electorate there are over 100 different recognised ethnicitiesâthere are people from many European countries and increasingly from countries in Asia, Africa and beyond. I am blessed with a constituency that is rich in both culture and language. I enjoy learning bits and pieces in all of those languages as often as I can. I recognise the importance that the richness of a language can bring to a society and the assets that such languages contribute to a society.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I as a migrant believe that most, if not all, migrants bring something to a society. One would hope that migration generally leads to enrichment of the nationâs assets in social, economic and cultural terms. I believe language does that, and therefore I agree with the proposition by the member for Calwell that we should not discourageâindeed, we should encourageâcitizens or permanent residents to maintain their culture and to maintain their language. I think it actually adds to our society.</para>
<para>As I indicated earlier, I am a migrant, and I think it is important that when you enter a society like Australiaâs you make a commitment to enter it fully, to become a full member of the community and, wherever possible, to become a citizen of that countryâas I have. I think that is a good step in the right direction, towards really showing your bona fides as part of the community. I also think it is important that society as a whole recognises that these skills that people bring when they come to Australia are assets that should be recognised formally.</para>
<para>I am aware of workers who are bilingual or multilingual who use these skills in the workplace and are not formally recognised. I can point to examples where home care workers look after elderly people who need people to speak in languages other than English. I am aware of situations in which people are employed because of their multilingual skills but are actually not recognisedâin other words, not recognised in a remunerative sense in their employment conditions. That is one of those examples where you see a sort of recognition but not real recognitionânot identifying the person as having skills that they bring to this country and to the community at large.</para>
<para>I think this motion is a significant motion. I support the comments made by the member for Calwell. I do consider the fact that we are isolated from what we perhaps once saw as home. We are not close to Europe, which people perhaps predominantly believed was where we had the closest tie. It is unfortunate that we are not as ready to learn languages as people in Europe and Asia. I think there has been a general recognition that more should be done to encourage people to commit to learning other languages. I can only say that that would lead not only to an enrichment of the country but to a greater tolerance amongst community members and a greater understanding amongst community members in our own society. I wholeheartedly support the motion moved by the member for Calwell, endorse many of the comments made by the member for Deakin and support the motion generally. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI also congratulate the member for Calwell on bringing this motion to the House and raising language as a very important national issue. Certainly the government sees it that way by making language other than English one of its eight key learning areas in the National Goals for Schooling in the Twenty-First Century, which our colleague the member for Deakin has also highlighted. I thank the member for Deakin for the insights and perspective of a 10-year-old migrant boy in Australia who became a language expert at a very young age.</para>

<para>It is a pleasure to be able to speak on this issue today, and it is timely, because when I opened my emails this morning I had an email from a teacher by the name of James Pollard in one of my country towns. He is a Japanese teacher at the Toodyay District High School. He said in his email that he has:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... just returned from an âIn countryâ Japanese Language Endeavour Fellowship program sponsored through DEST and organised through the Asia Education Foundation at the University of Melbourneâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">which I am sure the member for Calwell would be familiar with.</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The programme was aimed at improving the proficiency of the participants in Japanese and included a week of in country travel and two weeks of intensive language study.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He said he was:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... one of two Japanese teachers chosen from Western Australia. The other 20 came from NSW, Victoria, Canberra, Queensland and South Australia. From now, I will be focussing on developing a curriculum project formulated while participating in the programme. This will be developed for the benefit of students at TDHS.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I congratulate Mr Pollard both for being selected to be part of this delegation and for his commitment to coming back with the determination to produce good curriculum. He goes on to say that he began his teaching career:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... as an ESL teacher in Melbourne and could see first hand the importance of mastery of a second language both personally and economically. Now, as a Japanese teacher in Australia and having lived in Japan for six years, I can see how important the mastery of a second language can be to English speaking Australians who are interested in or intend to become involved with other countries. Any government initiative that can help to improve the proficiency and level of cultural understanding of Australian language teachers can only be beneficial to fostering positive and productive relationships with other countries in the long run.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">As I said, I am pleased that his skill and ability will be put to good use producing curriculum for teaching in schools. A study was done which outlines some trends and issues for language education in school. I would just like to take up a couple of these, as there is not sufficient time to go through them in depth. If we could address some of these trends, we would perhaps elevate the teaching of languages other than English to a much higher plateau and perhaps convince people that need to be convinced to continue to put some energy into this area. One of those trends was:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Teacher supply is affected by factors such as limited opportunities for language training in pre-service teacher education courses (particularly for primary school) ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I raise this because I know from my own grandchildren that learning a language when you are a very young child is a very good idea. The mind is fertile. You will see young childrenâs eyes light up with a curiosity and an interest when they hear people speaking in another language. I think it is really important that teachers are prepared so that they can undertake this work at primary school level. The report talks about:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... low rates of retention of language teachers in schools ... often caused by unsatisfactory work arrangements, such as having to teach hundreds of students across a number of schools.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I thought there were two other points that were relevant:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Some schools report that languages programmes are unpopular with parents, with a perception too that language learning interferes with literacy development, though the evidence is to the contrary.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Certainly my own experience in my own family has been that it actually enhances your literacy development. I think that there is clearly some well-founded evidence to support that. I would like to see us continue to debate this issue and to encourage the teaching of languages other than English in our schools. I once again congratulate the member for Calwell. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThis is a very important motion that has been moved by the member for Calwell. Although it is necessary to ensure all our citizens have a good control of English for their health and wellbeing, understanding the law and all those sorts of things, second language skills are becoming more and more important as we seek to trade with other nations, particularly those in Asia. With language comes an understanding of culture, and this is vital if one is to succeed in developing relationships with other countries and preparing for trade demands.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I have been told of many problems in businesses due to misunderstandings of the nuances of certain languages. I recently visited China and watched some of our diplomats at work, and I was very impressed with how many of them were able to joke and explain in some detail what we were trying to achieve. To encourage nationals from non-English-speaking backgrounds, I think it would be useful to have language skills going both ways. This motion highlights the fact that we have not reaped the maximum benefits of the multilingual resources of the Australian people.</para>
<para>It is a very Anglo-centric and lazy approach to expect everyone to speak English to us, when English is a very hard language for many to master. Even native speakers of English find it difficult. I know only too well what it was like to learn and to relearn English as a language, and I have never spoken anything else. To be literate in English is pretty hard, even in Australia, so I can only guess what it must be like to learn it as a second language. It must be pretty daunting. People have to learn not only English but Australian English. They have to learn about our icons and about the people we believe to be important. Australian slangâAussie slang or âStrineâ as it is sometimes calledâis a reflection of the harsh Australian land and the âno-nonsense, letâs get on with itâ attitude of the Australian people. A lot of corners are cut both with what we say and how we say it, and it is pretty incomprehensible to outsidersâeven to the English.</para>
<para>My experience includes being asked to explain the system of government in Tasmania. You tell them there are three, and you have to go right through it. âWho on earth are Snugglepot and Cuddlepie?â Unless you know the culture, how do you understand them? How can it rain cats and dogs? It is difficult, yes. Many of the skills relating to language development are also useful in other areas. Migrants who have been here for some time and who have become bilingual are often used to assist in welfare areas by interpreting not only the words but the cultural background to the words. Interpreting is a very high skill in itself as you have to process the information and spit it out again in an accurate stream of words. There are many functions that I have been to that would benefit from having had more interpreters on the ground that knew both countries well enough to ensure that you got the thinking behind the words.</para>
<para>Japanese and Chinese are both very formal languages and have to be carefully understood; otherwise, it can cause at least some embarrassment and at worst a diplomatic incident. Fortunately, these people are much more tolerant of us than we are of them, but sometimes there must be some awful faux pas involved. Aboriginal languages should be respected too. After all, these were Australiaâs first languages. We could probably learn a lot about the land and the culture that was and is now if we understood how their languages have changed and been modified. Yet we seem to give scant attention to language when we talk on issues of welfare and wellbeing.</para>
<para>I am really pleased that this motion has been moved. During the last period of Labor government we started to address what it means to be a multicultural nation. This government has now turned this nation into a fearful one. We do not appear to want to know about other nations or cultures. It is not high on its agenda. If we are to succeed in free trade policies and expect economic advantage, those other languages will be more than just important; they will be vital. We have a huge resource to draw upon. Congratulations to the member for Calwell for raising this very important question. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI thank the member for Calwell for raising this issue of language. It has been a very enjoyable part of the day to listen to the previous five speakers. The issue is the English language, the most common and unifying language amongst Australians and, we could say, across the world as well. When one travels a little, one becomes familiar with the dominance of the English language in many countries. I will never forget my experience when I was in Brussels two or three years ago. As we were walking through a thoroughfare, I said to my wife, âEnglish is quite dominant here.â A fellow sitting on the pavement, whose outstretched legs I had to walk around, said, âYou are not English, you are Australian.â I was quite confounded that he not only picked my language but also my accent.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is important, in this international community we live in, that we have this sort of discussion. We need to recognise the importance of communication at a range of levels and that this should be developed and improved upon. In the few minutes available I will talk a little about the importance of Aboriginal Indigenous language. I must say how much in awe I was when I first went to the Pitjantjara lands, which is part of my electorate, and how the Aboriginal people went in and out of English and Pitjantjara with an ease I was overwhelmed by. They spoke very good English and Pitjantjara, which I can report to the House I subsequently tried to learn for a brief periodâand not with great success. It is something that requires practice. Once I go over to Palya, Watipulka or Kulli-kulli I am very much limited, but it is very impressive to listen to Aboriginal people as they come in and out of English and Pitjantjara. The issue that the member for Pearce touched on, and others may have as well, of enhancing literacy by having two languages is something I would like to pick up in our report. I am the Chair of the House of Representatives Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs Committee, and the Indigenous committee report picks up on that. Mr Richard Trudgen is well known for his expertise in this matter. He emphasised the importance of understanding how to communicate:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">â¦ miscommunication is occurring on both sidesâ¦ That is not the fault of the teachers, doctors, sisters and support staff who go to Indigenous communities. It is not the fault of the Indigenous people. In a sense it is the fault of a society that is not approaching the transfer of knowledge in an intellectual way and not using good theory to say that if you need to understand something you probably need to understand it in your first language, which you think and construct knowledge in.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Mr Trudgen was further quoted in the report as saying:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The argument is clearly that the best acquisition of English occurs when you teach as long as you possibly can in the first language. The literature is completeâit is irrefutableâin that the longer you teach in their first language, the better the acquisition of English is going to be.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is something that I would not have even thought about. It is quite revealing that there is an important contribution to be made, not only to being fluent in a second language but to being fluent in English.</para>
<para>There is much in this discussion and I am rather grateful, in the time available, to have contributed briefly to it. In terms of cultural development, there are many billions of people all over this planet. There always seem to be troubled times but it comes to a focus from time to time that there is nothing more important than the effective use of language. We need to be fluent and accurate in English or other languages to be able to communicate effectively. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para class="block">It is a great pleasure for me to speak in the federal parliament today on this important motion. I believe it is significant, for this country as well as for China, that a free trade agreement be concluded in the weeks and months aheadâand I want to speak in relation to trade generally, as well.</para>
<para>Free trade agreements are being negotiated by this governmentâand very successfully so. The Malaysian Prime Minister is coming to visit Australia next month, and Australia is looking to conclude a free trade agreement with Malaysia. Last year the Prime Minister, in Laos, committed Australia to the consideration of free trade agreements with ASEAN countries, and this is another good sign, further to Australiaâs already concluded negotiations with the United States, Thailand and Singapore.</para>
<para>Free trade agreements are good for the world and for this country because they contribute very substantially to international stability and to international economic prosperity. One of the key reasons for this country moving along with free trade agreements is that it can do so not at the expense of our commitments to multilateral agreements. We are equally committed to those agreements but, as all members of the parliament know, the Doha Round has stalled. I look forward to that round being re-engaged in the months ahead.</para>
<para>This motion is about the opportunities for this country in trade and commerce with China. As everyone knows, China is a nation on the economic rise and is an enormous market for us to tap into. It is the worldâs seventh largest and fastest growing economy. In particular, it is the largest recipient of foreign direct investment. Of course, a nation of $1.3 billion offers great opportunities but we must remember that size alone is not the critical factor. Most importantly, China is a country of people who are very dynamic and creative, and above them is a government that is very committed to opening the market in that country.</para>
<para>I believe it is in Australiaâs national interest that we create opportunities for Australian businesses to sell our products and services in China. This is something that is going to make a big difference to this countryâs future economic prosperity. Not only is Australia drawn to making an FTA with this emerging power; many of our competitors are already engaging with China on the commercial front. If we do not do this it will be to our national detriment. So it is very important that we continue to engage commercially with the Chinese people and the Chinese government.</para>
<para>This week the Minister for Trade, the honourable Mark Vaile, is going to Beijing to put the finishing touches to the scoping study and hopefully the Prime Minister will be able to announce a more formal arrangement in terms of the free trade discussions in April when he visits Beijing and speaks to the President of the Peopleâs Republic of China, President Hu Jintao. It is some 18 months now since the president of China came to the national capital of this country and spoke in this parliament. It was a great honour for us that we were able to host, very successfully, the Chinese president the day after we hosted US President George Bush.</para>
<para>I am very pleased to speak on this motion because it is very important that we are able to produce opportunities abroad for Australian businesses. Let me give an example of one Australian business that is doing remarkably wellâand has a great history of doing well. It is a Sydney business and it has been awarded the contract to design the swimming stadium at the Beijing Olympics. I had the opportunity, only this week, to visit the complex that is being constructed. In fact, I was in China yesterday and returned just this morning. It was a great opportunity for me to have a look at that complex. I had the opportunity to lead a small business delegation to China and to return home to speak on this in parliament. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âLaborâs trade policy priority is the multilateral forum of the Doha Round of trade negotiations. The reason we support the Doha Round is that it stands to provide the biggest gains for Australia and the largest stimulus to world economic growth. The government says that the World Trade Organisation is also its priority, but in truth it has concentrated on preferential trading arrangements that discriminate against other countries. Labor will support bilateral trade deals if they contribute to our multilateral liberalisation objectives, if they generate real market access and if they simplify, rather than make more complex, the trading rules that govern Australian and global trade.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>When the joint study into a possible free trade agreement between Australia and China is released in March, it is expected that both governments will announce agreement to begin formal negotiations. Laborâs trade policy priority remains the WTO Doha Round, but we have strong political, economic and trade links with China. We were a key advocate of Chinaâs accession to the World Trade Organisation, and China would hope for and expect bipartisan support for the negotiations towards a trade deal with China.</para>
<para>Unlike the US free trade agreement, a free trade agreement with China would not extend to sensitive social policy issues such as the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and local media content rules. However, there will be sensitive issues in negotiating a free trade agreement with China. In particular, Chinaâs demand that trade negotiations can only occur if Australia recognises China as a market economy has implications for Australiaâs antidumping regime and for our manufacturing sector. Granting China market economy status will not necessarily undermine legitimate antidumping claims, but we need to be careful in this regard.</para>
<para>Australian industry would continue to be protected by our rights under the World Trade Organisationâs antidumping regime. Those rights include the right to utilise price information from a third countryâthis is called âsurrogacyââin circumstances where there is no reliable Chinese information to enable Customs to investigate a dumping complaint. The difficult part of the use of surrogacy is that China will claimâin many circumstances, correctlyâthat the use of a third countryâs costs does not reflect the competitive advantage that China has gained in the production of those particular manufactured goods. That creates the difficulty of establishing the legitimacy of antidumping cases. Nevertheless, the government has already agreed that, as a precondition for negotiating a trade deal with China, it will grant China market economy status. We need to be careful about that, but, as I have indicated, it does not necessarily mean that legitimate antidumping claims would have no proper hearing, because the World Trade Organisation rules provide for legitimate antidumping action.</para>
<para>Any free trade agreement with China should be non-discriminatory. This is a very important point. Better access to Australian markets granted to China by the Australian government should also be extended to other countries. This is the most favoured nation principle and it is the bedrock of the world trading rules. Australia should not be seeking preferred access to Chinese marketsâjust an opportunity to compete. A nondiscriminatory trade deal with China could support the overall liberalisation of trade.</para>
<para>This Labor formula of nondiscrimination in trade negotiations contributed to the strongest export expansion in Australiaâs history. But all of that came to a shuddering halt in 2000, and since then volumes have remained flat and Australiaâs share of world exports has fallen to its lowest level since at least 1948.</para>
<para>A return to the principle of nondiscrimination in negotiating agreements such as the proposed Australia-China FTA would ensure that such deals contribute to rather than detract from the objective of global trade liberalisation. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI am happy to have seconded this motion, and I support the governmentâs progress towards a China-Australia free trade agreement, which obviously means reducing tariffs to zero and the removal of other non-tariff trade barriers such as import quotas and other local practices which restrict market access. There is enormous potential in the striking of this dealâin agriculture, services, financial, education and training; in the rapidly growing sectors of minerals and resources and tourism; and in the various other areas where we have an enormous market advantage and comparative advantage, such as legal, architectural and educational services.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Let us not forget that underpinning this debate is the fact that one in five Australian jobs is linked to the generation of exportsâ1.7 million Australian jobs. It is one in four jobs in regional and remote areasâand obviously the coalition has a strong focus on a policy that helps regional and remote Australia. While only five per cent of Australian businesses export, they are responsible for 20 per cent of Australiaâs jobs. It is among Australiaâs fastest-growing sectors; it is the most competitive and it pays the highest salaries. So there is every reason to give great attention to a free trade agreement with China.</para>
<para>This government has a very strong heritage of free trade agreements, as the member for Ryan has already elucidated. In contrast, the opposition, having signed only one free trade agreement and never having negotiated any, is in a terribly weak position to equivocate about the benefits of a free trade agreement today. We are talking about a $27.3 billion two-way trade arrangementânine per cent of our total exports go to China and 10 per cent of all our imports come from China.</para>
<para>Today I want to highlight the difference between our approach to trade and that of the opposition. We, on this side of the House, are well aware that quite often the oppositionâs approach is cobbled together from various academics of their own political persuasion. So, when I read this month that an ANU economics professor was concerned that âmultiple bilateral deals result <inline font-size="11pt">in</inline> a spaghetti bowl of crisscrossing FTAs that donât meld,â I thought, âHere is an opposition with a definite affection for spaghetti.â</para>
<para>Would they support an FTA? It does not appear so. First they were split on the US free trade agreement. Then they believed that there should be a Senate committee set up to investigate the agreement. Then, of course, we had the Werriwa wriggle when they realised they were going to have to pass it, support it and find, desperately, two conditions on which they could move the debate. Ultimately, today, we have heard from the member for Rankin a series of conditionsâa little more wriggle room for the opposition to equivocate once again on free trade.</para>
<para>Let us go back in history to the Grayndler economic forum, hosted by the member for Grayndler who, in his first speech to this parliament, bemoaned:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... cut public services such as the Commonwealth Employment Service. If the government presses ahead with its ill-advised attempt to cut up to 20,000 public sector jobs, these are exactly the services that will be most in demand.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Unemployment would run out of control, presumably, by the cutting the CESâwhat could be further from the truth! At the Grayndler economic forum you would expect the most brilliant economic minds to be presentâI see the smirks on the other side. Yes, Senator Conroy was present! With the $11 trillion US economy up for access to this government, Conroy said on the PBS:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Labor will not support any agreement that undermines the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and results in any increase in the cost of essential medicines.</para>
</quote>
<para>â¦Â Â Â Â  â¦Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â¦</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">My concern is that US pharmaceutical companies will be pushing for increased returns ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Surprise, surprise! They have never done that before, have they! He went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">If successful, this would mean higher prices of essential medicines for all Australians.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Never mind that we are striking the cheapest deals for drugs in the developed world and OECD economies, with drugs 47 per cent cheaper than they are in the United States. Never mind that the PBS is a last dollar insurance system that means that the government bears all of the negotiating responsibility. It was just needy Australians that had so much to lose from a free trade agreement, wasnât it?</para>
<para>The opposition tend to put politics well over the priorities of trade. That is at the very heart of the Labor Partyâs approach. They have every reason to equivocate about this motionâthis equivocation is something to which Australians have become accustomed. Our government is working to promote the Export Market Development Grants program, appoint new export facilitators, create export hubs by co-locating Austrade and AusIndustry, establish new export hubs and also promote the Cairns Group to drive a quick and successful outcome for the current round of trade negotiations with the WTO. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talker>
<para>âI welcome this opportunity to speak in this debate on Australia-China trade, particularly to follow the honourable member for Bowman and his very interesting contribution. There are a number of points which he made which I would like to take him up on. He talked about Laborâs record on trade and said that we did not negotiate any free trade agreements. I remind the honourable member for Bowman that the Hawke and Keating Labor governments founded the Cairns Group of nations, which represents nations of similar economic backgrounds in multilateral trade agreements.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Every recognised trade expert in the world says that multilateral agreements have more benefits than bilateral agreements. That is the view of every recognised expert in the world not just, as the honourable member for Bowman said, academics who happen to come from a Labor point of view. He seems to think that those people, despite their eminent qualifications, are not entitled to a point of view.</para>
<para>I found it interesting that he condemned the Labor Partyâs history on trade when his government has presided over the biggest current account deficit in this nationâs historyâseven per cent of gross domestic product. It is not the banana republic; it is the big banana republic because this government has mismanaged our trade relations and our economic growth and has overseen the biggest current account deficit in our history. I also remind the honourable member for Bowman that it was a Labor government which reduced tariffs in this nation for the first time since the early 1970s. I do not recall the Fraser government reducing one tariffânot oneâbut the Hawke and Keating governments reduced tariffs across the board.</para>
<para>Honourable members opposite say that Labor are equivocating. No, what Labor are saying is that, in principle, a free trade agreement with China may well be a good thing, but we want to see the agreement. They may be willing to sign off any agreement, which may or may not produce results for Australia and may or may not be in Australiaâs best interests. Our position is: show us the agreement and we will make an assessment about whether it is in Australiaâs best interests.</para>
<para>I do agree with the honourable members opposite that any government has a responsibility to ensure that everything possible is done to gain the best access for Australian exporters into the Chinese market, because the Chinese market is the fastest growing in the world. The Chinese economy is in many respects the engine room of world economic growth. The increase in Chinese economic activity is one of the things driving the increase in Australiaâs terms of trade. So, of course, it is incumbent on any Australian government to do whatever is possible to gain the best access for Australian exporters into China. We are all in agreement on that.</para>
<para>Where we differ with the honourable member for Bowman and the honourable member for Ryan is in their saying that any free trade agreement with China is a good thing. No, it will have to meet certain conditions and it will have to be in Australiaâs national interest. For example, there are some signs coming from Beijing that Beijing is going to play very hard to get in this agreement. They are going to negotiate hard ball, and you would expect them to.</para>
<para>We would want to see access for Australian agricultural products, as Australian agricultural products face cascading tariffs in China. On rice, wheat and a range of agricultural products there are tariffs which are very high indeed, when exporters seek access to China. We would want to see some benefits for Australian agricultural producers in an Australia-China free trade agreement. We saw sugar farmersâand I know this is something close to your heart, Mr Deputy Speaker Causleyâget no benefit from the US free trade agreement and, if we see a result like that in the China free trade agreement, then, yes, the Labor Party will be pointing out the obvious pitfalls.</para>
<para>Perhaps even more important than access for agricultural producers is access for Australian service providers. If Australian service providers can get in at the ground floor of this growing economy, there are potentially very real benefits for the Australian economy. Unfortunately, at the moment China places many licensing and approval restrictions on Australian service providers. Education is a great potential area for exports, and hopefully we will see some improvement and the freeing of access through this agreement.</para>
<para>I would like to refer briefly to some comments I read in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> last year by an official of the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, Dr Mei Xinyu, who set out some of the things that China would like to see out of the Australia-China free trade agreement. Because time is pressing, there are two I will refer to: the repatriation of corrupt Chinese officials to China from Australia; and Australia ceasing to comply with corrupt American ideology and then trying to impose that ideology on Asia. The only ideology that Australia seeks to promote is democracy. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThis is an excellent motion. I congratulate the member for Ryan for bringing it to the attention of the House. There is no doubt that this new trade agreement, when it is formulated and when we see the detail, is going to provide a tremendous ongoing stimulus, particularly for rural Australia. I am disappointed by the contributions of the other members who know precisely that but who, as always, convert everything into a political football. The member for Prospect brags about the introduction of tariff reform by the Hawke government. I mention and respond to that in particular because the Hawke government did that with very little protection for the industries that so affect the constituents where I live, in particular the citrus industry. So I do not expect opposition members to come in here and convince the people who support me that what they did was a good thing for them.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Despite that, the citrus industry has fought back and, even with the trepidation they feel about establishing market access into China and the prospect that counterseasonal navels from China will arrive in Australia, they say to me, âMake sure Mark Vaile achieves access into China for us.â It is exactly the same for table grapes. I am pleased to see that the Minister for Trade has been in the chamber after returning from Africa and in less than 24 hours will head off to China, tomorrow morning. That industry in particular badly needs restoration of what they used to have by an informal arrangement: access for table grapes and citrus into China. Since the introduction of the multilateral approach, which the opposition have bragged about in here this afternoon, they have seen that access constrained, and that is hurting them badly. There is a record navel crop hanging on citrus trees through the Murray Valley at the moment. The pressure is on for the government to at least enter into some agreement that creates that market for citrus.</para>
<para>The growers are grateful that over the years they have managed to survive in a sustainable way, despite what was done to them by the Hawke government. The secret to that success has been changing the emphasis from concentrate and orange juice to fresh product into the United States. It is export markets that are going to help rural industries. My industries are waiting for this agreement to be established and put firmly in placeâbut not at their expense. Of course we will all be interested in the detail. As one who, like the member for Ryan, has been to China a number of times and tried to deal professionally in a former life with Asian nations, I know it will take some time. They will be quite canny about establishing an arrangement that is in their interests, the same as we will be focusing on our national interests.</para>
<para>I am looking forward to the establishment of a free trade agreement with China. I hope we can go beyond the political exercise we saw over the agreement with the United States. It is all about providing market opportunity for massively expanding industries, particularly in the agricultural sector right across rural Australia and, in particular, in the Murray Valley. There, the changes to water policy have seen massive growth in the expansion of tree products, vegetables, table grapes and wine grapes. There are not enough people in Australia to consume the excellent products they are producing. It is access to export markets that will ensure that that development is sustainable. China is the next export opportunity. I will be looking for, and encouraging at every opportunity, the government and particularly the minister to pull it off. I am delighted to have had the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate and congratulate the member for Ryan for bringing the motion to the attention of the parliament.</para>

</talker>
<para>âI commend the honourable member for Ryan for introducing this motion which gives us an opportunity to discuss the general proposition of an Australia-China free trade agreement. This is a discussion which this House needs to have before the government commits us to this particular agreement with the Peopleâs Republic of China. As speakers on this side of the House, and the opposition generally, have pointed out it is a discussion on an agreement that we have not seen. I am not opposed in principle to a free trade agreement between Australia and China. Those on this side of the House, including me, are free traders, and Labor is a free trade party. Furthermore, as the member for Prospect just pointed out, they were recent Labor governments that produced the most marked free trade reforms in the Australian economy. China is an emerging economy that is entitled to have access to Western markets. If such a free trade agreement might be of benefit to both countries then that would be an agreement this side of the House would support.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Chinaâs economy is obviously growing rapidly and Chinese living standards are rising steadily, although I notice that the Chinese government is concerned about the equity of that rise in living standards. The 1.2 billion people in China are the worldâs largest emerging market for goods and services. Australia is well placed to become a major supplier of a wide range of products and services in the future in education and, as we are now, in energy such as natural gas or LPG and coal. That does not mean, however, that Labor will or should blindly endorse any free trade agreement that comes before this House. It is perfectly legitimate for this parliament to carefully scrutinise any proposed free trade agreement to see whether Australian industries, workers, consumers and, indeed, our environment will be adversely affected by such an agreement. Any trade agreement involves both benefits and costs to both partners. This parliament will need to know what the benefits and costs of such an Australia-China agreement will be and to make an informed decision about whether it is in Australiaâs national interests.</para>
<para>Today, however, I want to talk not so much about Australia as about China. Economic progress in China, since the shift to a market economy began under Deng Xiaoping in 1979, has been remarkable, but it has come at a high cost. This is mainly because of the radical and far-reaching economic reforms that have taken place in the absence of political democracy in a country which unfortunately still has no free press, no free trade unions and no genuine civil society able to scrutinise and criticise government decisions.</para>
<para>China is not a genuine market economy. There is the recent experience of Fosterâs Brewing in China. Worse is McDonaldâs, which recently had a bustling operation in the centre of Beijing and had it cancelled after a two-year operation, despite the fact that they had allegedly a 50-year lease, because the local Beijing Communist Party decided a high-rise Taiwanese hotel would make them more money by arbitrarily abolishing McDonaldâs contract. It is this country where some economic decisions are still made for political reasons. In China loss-making state industries are propped up by soft loans from state banks whose funds come from high taxes on the peasantry. It is a country where environmental laws are not enforced and where official corruption seems strange to advanced industrialised countries.</para>
<para>It is also a country where millions of people are kept in forced labour camps, the Laogai, from where much production that comes to Western countries is obviously emanating. People who are imprisoned without trial for political or religious reasons produce goods which are sold into Western markets under false labels to conceal their origins. It is a country where thousands of workers in the mining and transport industries, particularly coalmining workers, are killed every year in industrial accidents, as the member for Batman pointed out in a very important speech in an adjournment debate in the last session of parliament. These accidents are caused by pressure to maximise production in industries which have no effective state scrutiny</para>
<para>I have repeatedly raised these matters of human rights in China with the government, which I believe has not been active enough in pursuing such matters. Like other members of this House, I will keep an open mind on this free trade agreement, but I want to see it in detail. I think we should make a bigger effort to see that this agreement does not include production from forced labour camps. We want to see that China moves towards a more open situation where the civil society and trade unions can guarantee that their products are made under the same circumstances that ours are. The comments, drawn to our attention by the member for Prospect, that were made by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce are very worrying when the Chinese spokesman says that what they want to come out of this agreement is a certain kind of ideology being imposed on Australia. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âTodayâs grievance debate provides the opportunity to expose the Howard governmentâs double standards in the provision of dental care. The recent expose by the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of the alarming state of dental care in the public system has brought this very important issue to national attention once again. The articles revealed a state of serious neglect, with patients in New South Wales waiting up to eight years for attention and the number of children needing hospital treatment for problems with their teeth doubling over the past decade.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I was appalled to read that four children a month undergo what is referred to as a âfull clearanceââmeaning that all their teeth are extracted in hospitalâand that more than 100 children a month in New South Wales are anaesthetised in hospital for dental treatment. Since this government axed the former Commonwealth dental program, waiting lists around the nation have exploded. It is estimated that 500,000 Australians are on waiting lists for treatment, with only around 11 per cent of them treated annually.</para>
<para>These waiting lists are causing unnecessary suffering. In the Illawarra, for example, one can only get a speedy appointment at a public dental clinic if the patient exhibits bleeding, swelling and severe pain. Even then, a wait of three weeks with an abscess and excruciating pain is quite commonplace. One constituent advised me that she waited for five years for a filling that was not to be as, in the end, the tooth crumbled away. Is it any wonder, as the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> reported, that people are forced to pull out their own teeth with pliers, douse abscesses in battery acid and deaden the pain of toothache with alcohol? Is it any wonder that Australia is now recorded as having the second worst adult oral health of all the OECD countries? This is surely an untenable situation in a country as wealthy as ours.</para>
<para>The Howard government wants to wash its hands of responsibility for this appalling situation, arguing that the solution lies with state governments. But dental care is a national responsibility. That is what the Australian Constitution says, even if John Howard lies about it.</para>

<para>âThat is what the Australian Constitution says, even if John Howard fails to recognise this truth. The Constitution clearly gives the Commonwealth responsibility to make laws for the provision of hospital benefits, medical and dental services. On the one hand, the federal government wants to absolve itself of any responsibility for the dental care needs of the nation. But, on the other hand, the truth is that indirectly the government continues to subsidise dental care for people but only those who can afford private health insurance.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The government is spending in the order of $430 million a year subsidising dental care for people with private health insurance but at the same time turning its back on those most in need. As funding cuts take their toll on public patients, subsidies for the oral health of privately insured Australians continue to grow. This lack of federal funding for public dental health has created a huge divide between rich and poor in our society. Low-income earners without private dental insurance are 25 times more likely to have had all their teeth extracted than high-income earners with insurance. Professor Spencer from Adelaide University describes the situation in the public dental system in the following words:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Youâre mopping up advanced level decay and people with considerable pain and serious infections. What these people go through is repeated cycles of emergency care with teeth extracted.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">And yet it is these people, the ones who are in greatest need but cannot afford private insurance, who are unable to access any Commonwealth assistance at all.</para>
<para>Last year federal Labor announced that it would reintroduce the national public dental scheme and provide $300 million over a four-year period to do so. That proposal was warmly received by the community and lobby groups like the one in my area, the Illawarra Dental Health Action Group, who had worked tirelessly to bring these matters to public attention. I want to place on record my thanks to local constituents like Alice Scott and Tom Ward among many who have lobbied and campaigned hard on this critical issue, including the tendering of petitions to parliament.</para>
<para>We all know how successful Laborâs national program had been. Even recently the minister for health acknowledged that the program had led to a substantial reduction in waiting lists. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare reported in 1997 that in the first two years of the program eligible Australians who received public funding dental care under the program visited more frequently for dental care, reported less frequent experience of toothaches, received fewer extractions and were more satisfied with the dental care they received. Waiting times were substantially reduced. Patients waiting for 12 or more months decreased from 21.1 per cent to 11.3 per cent, while those waiting for less than one month increased from 47.5 per cent to 61.5 per cent.</para>
<para>Yet despite these obvious successes the Howard government axed the Labor dental health care program back in 1996. Is it any wonder that dental decay rates and tooth loss in children and adults in our country are on the increase? The situation, I fear, can only get worse. Already we are desperate for dentists in the Illawarra public dental system and across the nation, particularly in rural and country regions. As I said earlier, half a million Australians are on the waiting list for public dental care and attention. Most alarmingly, a recent study by the University of Adelaide predicts a shortage of about 1,500 dental workers by 2010. Restrictions on the availability of services and capacity to pay will result in even greater access problems for disadvantaged groups, for the aged and the poor in our community. As subsidies for the oral health of privately insured Australians continue to increase, the aged and the poor are waiting for up to eight years to get treatment through a rundown public system.</para>
<para>Tooth disease is indeed becoming a silent epidemic in our community. This government must be held to account about this appalling situation. If the Howard government was able to find $66 billion to get itself re-elected at the last election, why then canât it find $100 million to reinstate Laborâs dental health program, a program that looked after the needs of those without capacity to pay, a program that bridged the divide between the wealthy and the poor, and a program that addressed the real needs of citizens in our community?</para>

<para>âToday I rise to speak on a grievance relating to the trucking industry. There is a definite need for a national articulated truck registration and database system with the aim of improving safety on the roads for all motorists. We have the states moving to a national heavy vehicle reform program, but we need more. What brings this to notice today is the fact that in October last year on Mooney Mooney bridge there was a horrific accident resulting in the death of a motorist. Some 35 cars and a semitrailer were involved. Investigations into the accident found that the truck involved was both unregistered and uninsured, yet it had gone through the Mount White weighing station only minutes before. An articulated truck registration and database scheme would enable information on all trucks and trailers to be available at all of the weigh stations. It would involve the removal of the current registration restrictions where articulated trucks are fined for interstate runs and it would mean a much greater national approach to safety on our roads.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This is not a dollar-grabbing exercise, as the registration money collected under a national articulated truck registration system should go back to the states to help improve the roads and bridges. The urgency behind this is a matter of national safety. On Friday, 22 October there was a minor accident on the F3 Freeway which turned into a major disaster. As cars waited to be able to pass the minor accident near the Mooney Mooney bridge an 18-tonne prime mover hit the waiting vehicles, causing what rescue workers described at the time as nothing short of a war zone. Thirty-four cars in total were involved in the pile-up. It is very sad that Ann Parker from the Central Coast was driving one of those vehicles. She was waiting to pass the minor accident and was tragically killed in the subsequent pile-up. Mrs Parker was driving a Hyundai Excel and the impact of the accident caused her car to explode. It took salvage crews 12 hours to clear the area.</para>
<para>The investigation results following the accident showed that the driver of the semitrailer, David Lawler, was charged with driving an unregistered and uninsured vehicle. He was actually charged on 11 November with a total of 11 offences relating to the Mooney Mooney crash, including: driving a vehicle while tax was not paid; driving a vehicle with a number plate not issued for the vehicle; having two registration plates in his possession suspected of being stolen; and displaying a misleading plate. In addition Mr Lawler was also charged at Maitland police station on 27 November with driving an unregistered and uninsured truck in Stanford Street at Pelaw Main on 3 September.</para>
<para>The question to be raised is: why do we need articulated truck registration and what would it do? The registration would provide a common user database in all states of all details relating to each articulated vehicle on the road and the drivers. It would enable the efficient checking of load weights, registration details and travelling times through the camera systems which are currently on a lot of our overpasses. For those who are not aware of them, they are the little cameras that flash red as the trucks go through. They photograph the registration plates and, as the truck then goes through a subsequent overpass, a camera registers and measures the time takenâand there are allowed times between those two distances.</para>
<para>I see a national articulated truck registration system being of benefit to our community. The question that we have to ask concerns why, only moments before the accident, the Mount White station did not pick up the fact that this was an unregistered and uninsured vehicle on the road.</para>
<para>The current registration problems for articulated vehicles include the fact that, if you take on national registration, you can do only interstate runs, not intrastate runs. Penalties for noncompliance can result in hefty fines. As you would know from your electorate up north near the Queensland border, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, the load on a truck coming down from Queensland can be as much as 45.5 tonnes on an articulated vehicle but that same truck in New South Wales can carry only 42.5 tonnes. If a driver, in order to gain efficiency, loads up with 45.5 tonnes in, say, North Queensland and tries to unload three tonnes before crossing the New South Wales border, they will be fined about $3,000 for using national registration plates to do an intrastate delivery.</para>
<para>In addition to looking at a national system for registration of articulated vehicles, we need uniform systems for measuring truck length and measuring the load weights that trucks can carry. The truck drivers are the people who carry this country on their backs as they move around.</para>
<para>An additional issue, and it is a key issue, concerns the liability of freight and transport operators who knowingly or unknowingly use unlicensed, unregistered and uninsured vehicles for transporting freight. This issue is being addressed by the Victorian and New South Wales governments. At the moment, the price of freight has been driven down so low that most operators, particularly small operators, are operating at a loss. Unfortunately, some people take short cuts in maintenance, registration or insurance, but at the end of the day the person who pays the price is the driver trying to compete and stay in business. If a company that organises and manages freight engages these drivers, they should also be liable for any penalties.</para>
<para>There are some interesting statistics on articulated trucks in Australia. There are 64,000 articulated trucksâsemis, B-doubles and road trains. That comes from the ABS motor vehicle census. The registration cost is about $4,737 for a six-axle articulated vehicle and $8,154 for a nine-axle B-double. Most states are moving to a uniform price for registration. That is to stop the shopping for the cheapest registration that used to go on. The only price variation now is in the different levels of stamp duty applied by the states.</para>
<para>As I said, load limits for articulated trucks vary from state to state. For a six-axle articulated, it is 42.5 tonnes on standard mass and 45.5 tonnes on higher mass limits. For a nine-axle B-double it is 62.5 tonnes on statutory limits and 68 tonnes on a higher mass limit. But there is an issue about different loads for different states.</para>
<para>The ABS showed that 9.9 per cent of Australiaâs 1,457 fatal road accidents in 2003 involved articulated vehicles. Recent statistics from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau indicated that between 1991 and 2001, despite an increase of 18 per cent in operating articulated trucks and 34 per cent in total kilometres travelled, the fatality rate per kilometre travelled declined by about 20 per cent.</para>
<para>I have to give great credit to the Australian Trucking Association. I have had the pleasure of working with Mike Almond, the past president, and Chris Althaus. Their whole drive has been towards the introduction of greater safety as the priority for the Australian Trucking Association.</para>
<para>The trucking industry transports nearly 80 per cent of all non-bulk freight carried in Australiaâs seven major corridors. Australiaâs truck fleet travels about 12.5 billion kilometres and transports 1.5 billion tonnes of freight each year. It is important that we work hand in hand with groups like the Australian Trucking Association to address the safety needs of not just the people driving rigs but also the motorists who travel on the same roads. I urge the government to look at a national system of articulated truck registration and a national system of licences for reticulated truck drivers so that we can provide better management and, as a result, greater safety on our roads.</para>

<para>âI want to put on the record a very serious issue in my electorate. It is one I have raised before, and others in this House have also raised it. I refer to the current situation of people who were involved in the deseal-reseal programs of the RAAF. About 500 to 600 Defence Force personnel and civilian personnel were involved in these programs. Let me give the parliament some indication of what was involved. Under the direction of the Defence Force, through the RAAF, people were required to get inside F111 fuel tanks, remove a sealant inside that prevented fuel leaks and then reseal the tanks. Invariably, the people who did thisâairmen and other people who got inside these fuel tanksâdid it without any protective clothing, including eyewear and a whole range of other protections and safeguards to provide for their long-term safety. That was done with the full knowledge of the ADF broadly, and specifically the RAAF, in full view, with full acceptance and full direction.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In those days it would probably have been the case that there was a cultural belief that you did not need to protect yourself or, maybe, that information about the dangerous and poisonous nature of the chemicals they were dealing with were not fully known; although, I believe there were appropriate signs and warnings on the chemicals used.</para>
<para>Nonetheless, working with poisons did take place and hundreds of our Defence Force personnel were involved. Since that time, again invariably, almost every single person who worked on these programs has had some sort of illness, condition, disease or cancer. This case has been the subject of countless bureaucratic reviews, reports, studies and surveys which have determined, pretty much without a doubtâI would not say without a doubt but as far as these reports can determine within a cohort, group or set of people the effects of being exposed to a particular poisonâthe impact it has had on their lives and the lives of their descendants. In my view, it is fairly conclusive that there was a massive impact. These people have contracted cancer at a rate far greater and far more rapidly than anyone else in society. They have been generally in poorer health and sicker. They have died earlier and have passed on, as it were, conditions to their children.</para>
<para>The severity and seriousness of this case is massive. I can honestly say that there would not be too many times that I would come into this place and ever agree with the member for Blair on just about anything. But in this case I know the member for Blair is the member representing the base at Amberley, where most of this took place. My electorate of Oxley probably covers the majority of people affectedâthey live in my electorate, while the base is in the electorate of the member for Blair. I would say that we are pretty well of the same view on thisâthat is, the government needs to end the reviews, the rhetoric, the studies and the surveys and compensate these people before they are all gone. I am not talking about old men or about people that served in World War II. I am talking about relatively young people who in their early 20s and 30s were involved in these programs and who today are incapacitated and disabled to a state where they can no longer work or have massive problemsâif their illnesses are not directly killing them.</para>
<para>The majority of these people, now in their 40s, are literally left without a careerâwithout an opportunity to continue their work in the defence forcesâbecause they were involved in the deseal-reseal programs for the F111s. As I said, there have been a number of communications from me, the member for Blair and other members in this House who want to see an end to the buck-passing and duckshovingâI cannot describe it any other wayâon this issue. I am not trying to be cute or political. It is simply the case that we now know that there is a problem and the government, whether it is this government or a future government, should deal with the problem and should do it as soon as it is physically and legislatively possible. It can be done through the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, through the goodwill of the government or through a simple mechanism. If nothing can be done through the current legislation, then I would urge the government to introduce new legislation to specifically rope in these people who have been so unjustly dealt with for many years. The time has come when people in the communityâcertainly people in the Australian Defence Forceâhave an expectation of the government in dealing with their problems.</para>
<para>We often hear in this place of the great commitment that this federal governmentâthe Howard-Anderson governmentâhas towards people in the defence forces. Here is the governmentâs opportunity to put that to the test. Here is its opportunity to take a huge issueâone that affects so many peopleâs lives in the defence forcesâand deal with it. This matter has been very inadequately dealt with by the department and the Minister for Veteransâ Affairs. There has been a nonacceptance and bureaucratic passing of responsibility in dealing with these people. They are not asking for anything outside what would normally be due to and expected by anybody who worked for the Australian Defence Force who, in the course of their employment and duty, incurred some injury or condition and should therefore be compensated for it.</para>
<para>The minister should look at what I am saying on the record tonight.Â  She should not look at ways to get out, not look at the technicalities, not look at the opportunities available to not pay or compensate, and not look at those bits in the act that bar a claim that was made pre the act coming in in 1988âbecause a lot of people made claims or had claims partially settled in 1983. The minister should not look at those technicalities but at a way of solving this situation. The minister should look for a way by which the government can correct an injustice. That is the least we can do for these people who are suffering greatly. If anyone is interested in this topic or wants to make themselves aware of its impact there is a lot of information about this on the public recordâreports and surveys and so forth of the people affected.</para>
<para>I make a number of calls tonight of the government in this place. I will give my continued full support to the airmen that were involved in the deseal-reseal programs for the F111s. Whatever conditions they have need to be dealt with and compensated for by the government. The government has to find a way to resolve this issue. It ought to get its bureaucracyâthe Department of Veteransâ Affairsâto set about the task of finding a way of dealing with the issue and compensating the people affected. I know I would be supported in what I am saying by the member for Blair and I welcome his comments on this issue. I know he supports the airmen that have been injuredâpoisonedâby the chemicals used during the deseal-reseal programs with the F111s.</para>
<para>I make a plea to the minister to find a way to resolve this issue and to get on with the job. I do not want to make this a political issue. I want to keep it as straightforward as I can and set out what needs to be done for these Defence Force personnel. But I do not have a great deal of confidence. We have seen a range of issues come through the Department of Veteransâ Affairs and have heard a lot of rhetoric about the goodwill and the good spirit felt towards our veterans. But when it comes to doing anything specifically, such as the <inline font-style="italic">Voyager</inline> case and the Black Hawk incident not that long ago, the government walks away from its responsibilities through technicalities or through the passage of time. It is just not good enough. There needs to be some quick action. The minister needs to take it upon herself to resolve this issue once and for all.</para>
<para>In the short time I have left I will leave this one message: if this government does not have the tenacity or guts to do it, let me assure you that Labor will do it at the earliest opportunity when we come to government. The federal Labor leader, Kim Beazley, has made a number of comments on this issue and his view is clear: if these people are due compensationâand they are, because they were injured in the course of their dutiesâthen let us not look at the technicalities of why they should not be paid; let us look at the ways in which we can fully compensate them.</para>

<para>âOn a matter of grievance, I wish to address issues of health and safety within my electorate of Flinders. I want to proceed in three steps: firstly, to look at two local hospitals that are not being adequately resourced and treated; secondly, to look at the positive side of the way aged care continues to be addressed; and thirdly, to look at some of the support that the Commonwealth has been able to give to overcome some problems in road safety.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>There are two very important hospitals within the electorate of Flinders: the Kooweerup Regional Health Service, which is alternatively known as the Kooweerup hospital; and Warley Hospital on Phillip Island. Both of these hospitalsâthey are not the only hospitals; there is also Rosebud Hospitalâplay a tremendous role within the community. Unfortunately, the Kooweerup Regional Health Service recently lost its day surgery capacity because of a policy decision by the Victorian government to take that facility away from this wonderful hospital. The Kooweerup hospital has a long history as one of Victoriaâs most effective day surgery operations. It serves the local population and prevents them from having to travel too far. It provides a local service in a familiar environment with high-quality people. It is a great shame that the state saw fit not to continue this practice. That is a disappointment not only for the residents of Kooweerup, Bayles, Catani, Lang Lang, Tooradin, Dalmore and all the surrounding towns but also for the staff, who do such a tremendous job under Terrona Ramsay, CEO of the Kooweerup Regional Health Service and the chairperson, Garry King. I urge the state government to reconsider this decision.</para>
<para>The second hospital in question is Warley Hospital. Warley Hospital is a bush nursing hospital, so it is a community owned hospital, run on a not-for-profit-basis on Phillip Island. The Commonwealth has contributed to that hospital, on an annual basis through aged care funding, almost $1Â½ million per annum. Unfortunately, the stateâs contribution has literally been only tens of thousands of dollars, despite this hospital serving the community on a not-for-profit basis. That hospital has had a challenge, because of the costs, in maintaining its accident and emergency services. I implore the state, which entered into discussions and negotiations more than six months ago, to quickly conclude them and work with the people of Warley. Under the CEO Douglas Wain, the staff, the executive and the board members do a tremendous job working for this community hospital. It seems a terrible shame that they and the people of Phillip Island would have to go through the stress of wondering whether or not there is certainty in their future funding. I am pleased to be able to report that the Commonwealth has an outstanding offer of well over an additional $1 million in recurrent annual funding for aged care, which is another activity carried out at Warley, once the new buildings are completed. I think the state needs to reconsider its position and to contribute both to Kooweerup Regional Health Service and to Warley Hospital.</para>
<para>I want to compare that grievance with news that I am able to report to my constituents through the House today. The Commonwealth is announcing an additional 217 beds or support services for aged care in the electorate of Flinders. Those 217 places involve an additional 122 residential high-care places and 95 residential low-care places. The 122 high-care places have a value of $5,065,000 and the 95 low-care places have a value of $1.35 million. Taken together, just over $6.4 million in recurrent annual funding will be coming into the electorate of Flinders and helping to pay due care and attention to the needs of our elderly citizens. In an ageing society, in the oldest electorate in Victoria, I believe that these additions are well needed and will be much appreciated. I want to specifically identify the four providers who will be able to benefit their communities, particularly on Phillip Island where an additional 20 beds, including five for dementia, will be developed by Parkwood Aged Care Services. All up, that will make 80 places, 20 of which will be dementia specific. I think that is a very important addition to the health and care on Phillip Island.</para>
<para>Secondlyâand I am very pleased with thisâa new aged care facility will be created at Waterfall Gully in Rosebud. It will involve 90 beds funded by the Commonwealth. There will be 60 high-care beds, including 40 general care, 10 for those of non-English-speaking background and 10 for veterans; and 30 low-care beds, including 20 in the general category, five for those of non-English-speaking background and five for veterans. This new 90-bed facility will be associated with a 50-bed retirement village and 30 assisted living apartments. When you put all of those together, it means a great step forward for the people of Rosebud, for the elderly population on the Mornington Peninsula and for those who live and have families with older members in need of care and attention. I think the choice of Rosebud was first-class and it is a tremendous outcome. I am delighted that a new facility will be created that covers assisted living and retirement villages, including low care and high care. That is a tremendous step forward.</para>
<para>Moving further around we find an additional 47 places for Regis Sherwood Park in South Cranbourne, comprising 33 general high-care places and 14 dementia-specific high-care places. This builds on the funding provided for new Medicare offices in Cranbourne and Rosebudâtwo of only a small number of new such offices throughout Australia, so we have done very well locally. Those 47 new places for Regis Sherwood Park will serve people from Pearcedale, Somerville, Baxter, Tooradin, Devon Meadows, the coastal villages, Cranbourne, Clyde, Cardiniaâall of which will benefit from these new beds. It compares very favourably with the points that I made at the outset about the state and the way in which the state has dealt with the two hospitals in question.</para>
<para>The fourth of the facilities to benefit is Tea Tree Gardens. Tea Tree Gardens aged care facility does a tremendous job and it serves the community extremely well. There will be 60 new beds available at Tea Tree Gardens: 15 new beds in the high-care general category and 45 new beds in the low-care category. They represent an additional 60 beds for Rosebud on top of the 90 beds already mentioned in relation to Waterfall Gully. In all there will be 150 high-care and low-care beds for Rosebud. One of the highest concentrations of retirees and seniors in Victoria is rightly receiving an allocation which represents the demographic of that area. I am delighted with the outcome. I thank the Minister for Ageing and all those associated with that process.</para>
<para>That is on the health front. I am also very pleased to note that throughout the Mornington Peninsula one of the great challenges we have had is road safety and that the Commonwealth has stepped in where the state has left some gaps. Many new projects such as Eramosa Road in Somerville, Loders Road in Moorooduc, Hotham Road in Sorrento and many others have been funded by the Commonwealth under the Roads to Recovery programâa program which has done a tremendous job in filling some of those infrastructure gaps created by the stateâs inactivity. I raise these grievances and I am delighted to be able to present responses to those grievancesâin particular, to commend to the House the work being done for aged care services in Rosebud, Phillip Island and Cranbourne.</para>

<para>âI rise today to decry the lack of funding for mental health services in our country. According to the Mental Health Council report <inline font-style="italic">Investing in Australiaâs future: the personal, social and economic benefits of good mental health</inline>, my seat of Chisholm is home to nearly 5,000 people suffering from depression and more than 6,500 people suffering from substance abuse. The report estimates that 424 of my constituents are affected by bipolar disorder and 169 people are suffering from schizophrenia. These figures are startlingâactually, they are alarming. They are even more startling given that highly respected former federal Human Rights Commissioner Brian Burdekin said over the weekend that the plight of some people with mental illness had become progressively worse over the past decade. Mr Burdekin said that many people had been de-institutionalised only to be re-institutionalised within prisons and immigration detention centres serving as de facto asylums. Mr Burdekin said:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">Thereâs no question that a very large percentage of the prison populationâ50 per centâare severely mentally ill or have a significant mental health problem in NSW and the situation is similar in most other jurisdictions.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Even Minister for Health and Ageing Tony Abbott, in an amazing display of candour, admitted last month that Australiaâs mental health system was âan absolute disasterâ. The Mental Health Council report notes that by OECD standards Australia underinvests in providing mental health services or promoting good mental health. Alarmingly, it points out that, on last available estimates, we spend only half as much per capita on mental health services as New Zealand does. The report goes on to state:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... local politicians who conduct actual community forums increasingly report that one of the commonest areas of complaint is inadequate mental health and alcohol and drug services.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">How true that is. In all the forums I hold and all the mobile offices I conduct, it is alarming that mental health is an issue that comes up time and time again. It is an issue that walks through the doors of all our electorate offices. When I held a community health forum last year with shadow health minister Julia Gillard mental health was the No. 1 issue of the day. One constituent spoke of the need for more post-natal care for new mothers, while another raised concerns about the lack of early response services available to teenagers in crisis. This only echoes, as I say, the numerous reports and concerns I get from parents, carers and sufferers about the absolute lack of services available to them, particularly when they need themâwhen they are in crisis.</para>
<para>I consider my seat to be in a better position than many others in terms of the provision of quality mental health services. Upton House, which adjoins Box Hill hospital and is run by Eastern Health, offers excellent services to care for those who require voluntary or involuntary short-term care. Koonung and Waverley community mental health services, also part of Eastern Health, provide a whole range of community based non-urgent psychiatric services to individuals who have a mental illness. On behalf of my staff, I would like to express my thanks for the wonderful support we get from these services when we need to refer people to them.</para>
<para>While these services exist, accessing them is another issue. The Mental Health Councilâs report provided a summary of mental health services in the adjoining seat of Deakin, which I think holds true for Chisholm as well. The report stated:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Although situated in Melbourneâs more resourced Eastern suburbs, access to GPs and specialist mental health services is still a relevant issue. Although Victoria has been the stand-out state in terms of progress of national mental health reform, chronic lack of resources and increasing pressure on acute care services have led to similar reports of grossly inadequate services as elsewhere in the nation.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">As Allan Felsâthe parent of a daughter with schizophreniaâhas said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It is clear that with the closing of the large psychiatric institutions, governments grossly underestimated the number and range of community services that would be needed to provide humane and effective care.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Dr Fels said that treatment should include access to good medications and psychological treatments, improved community based supported accommodation, rehabilitation and recreation programs, help for families and other carers, and an end to stigma. I think that is most important of all, remembering that mental health issues are about health, not about befuddled individuals.</para>
<para>Given this desperate need for more mental health services, I was pleased to read an <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper report yesterday that the Victorian government is considering increasing its mental health budget by $600 million as part of its May budget. The report said the money would be used to make prevention programs for young people more available; to create more acute beds, particularly in the outer east; and to develop strategies to cut the number of mentally ill people going to hospital emergency departments. This is a welcome thing. This is a major step in the right direction, and on behalf of my community I call upon the Victorian government to ensure that this much-needed boost for mental health services makes it through the budget process.</para>
<para>I also desperately hope that the upcoming Senate inquiry will lead to Commonwealth and state cooperation on mental health. The last thing sufferers of mental illness and their families need is for the inquiry to turn into a farce, serving only as an opportunity for the federal government to scapegoat state governments. As the Mental Health Council notes in its report:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... national leaders have attempted to re-direct complaints related to mental health services to State Governments. However, the Australian Government does have key areas of responsibility involving medical payments to psychiatrists, medical payments to GPs to provide mental health services, costs for medications under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, insurance costs to private health providers of mental health services and new payments to psychologists and other non-medical providers of mental health. Increasingly, the electorate rates health as the major domestic issue facing our community, recognises mental health as a key part of health, and no longer accepts the lack of national leadership or coordination of improvements in health.</para>

<para class="block">Just this morning I received an email from Dr Judith Burstyner, who was inspired by the shameful treatment of Cornelia Rau to call for a fair go for the mentally ill. Dr Burstyner wrote:</para>

<para class="block">Dr Burstyner, a Victorian dental surgeon, bemoaned that only seven per cent of our health budget is allocated to mental health, although mental health constitutes 20 per cent of our health burden. Currently, it is estimated that one in five Australian citizens is suffering from some form of mental health disease. It is predicted that in the future the largest cost to the health budget will be depression related illnesses. We are not doing enough about these. Dr Burstyner wrote:</para>

</quote>
<para class="block">Of course, Cornelia Rauâs case highlighted the inadequate care within Australiaâs detention centres provided for detainees suffering from a mental illness. Human Rights Commissioner Dr Sev Ozdowski said in November last year that we do not know how many detainees suffer from a mental illness. He went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">But I think we can fairly surmise that a lot of detainees will suffer mental problems, either from their experience prior to arrival in Australia or because of long-term immigration detention, or a combination of both ... I have come to the considered view that Australiaâs immigration detention centres have become de facto mental institutionsâbut without the appropriate capability. And nothing that I saw in my September 2004 visit to Baxter has caused me to alter that opinion.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I will be fascinated to hear from members opposite who have also been to Baxter recently what their opinion is of the current state of individuals suffering from mental illnesses in those institutions.</para>
<para>A Just Australia estimates that there are 187 people in our detention centres who have been there for more than three years. What mental toll must it take on them to be locked away, out of sight? We must put resources into resolving their cases as a priority. We do ourselves great shame when we continue to treat these people inhumanely. We do ourselves great shame when we continue not to provide them with adequate mental care when they are in these centres. It is incumbent upon all levels of government to be doing more for people suffering from mental illnesses within our prison environment. Many individuals are ending up in a prison environment, as Cornelia Rau did, when they should be within the jurisdiction of a mental health facility. Too often these people are being locked away in prisons. More needs to be done. I hope that the current Senate inquiry is not just a witch-hunt of shifting blame and that we finally get down to treating this issue as seriously as it should be treated.</para>

<para>âI rise this evening to bring the attention of the House to the Wireless North Project. For a long time I have been a great advocate of the further sale of Telstra. It would be no surprise to the House that it is not particularly popular with a number of my constituents. They believe that, as long as Telstra remains in government hands, it will be directed to provide certain services in regional and remote Australia. I have argued the fact fairly definitely that the provision of increased services in regional and remote Australia is not at the behest of Telstra, that Telstra has some benevolent dream one evening and decides to spend more money in the bush; it is because of the insistence of government that it does so and that it meets its obligations. The lastâand, I think, the most radicalâchange through Telstra in recent times to improve regional communication systems has been the move for the first time to untimed local calls for some 38,000 subscribers in the more remote parts of Australia. That was done after the calling of tenders from all manner of communication companies, and the tender was eventually won by Telstra. At a cost of some $150 million worth of taxpayersâ funds allocated through the government, that new service was provided for the first time to regional and remote subscribers so that they could enjoy the benefits of untimed local calls that city dwellers enjoy.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>However, the time has come for me to rise in a grievance debate and bring the attention of the House to the fact that there are many people in my electorate who do not enjoy all the privileges of modern communication that are taken for granted by city dwellers today. I refer specifically, of course, to mobile phone coverage. There are many centres across my vast electorate that do not have mobile phone facilities. More importantly, the visitors to and the transporters who work in and along the highways of my electorate are surprised that they are so limited in the opportunity to use their mobile phones. As I say, they use them frequently and they take for granted that all Australians enjoy mobile telephone communication.</para>
<para>The Wireless North project proposes to provide mobile communications from Geraldton, on the coast in Western Australia, just to the south of my electorate, to Port Hedland, in the Pilbara region of my electorate, along the North West Coastal Highway, in an unbroken CDMA telephone communication link. From Port Hedland to Broome, it proposes to provide spasmodic coverage. At this point in time, probably as few as 100 kilometres of those nearly 800 kilometres are covered by mobile phone technology.</para>
<para>This is not a new proposalâand I rise tonight because it is not a new proposal. This was first mooted in 2001 as a follow-up to the very successful Wireless West program. The Wireless West program provided some 45 new CDMA phone towers in the south-west of WA and provided mobile communications to those subscribers for the first time. It made quite a wonderful difference to agriculturalists in the area who, in the past, during seeding time and harvest time, virtually had to employ an additional hand full-time to relay messages about the movement of machinery and the gaining of spare parts et cetera to keep the show on the road. The introduction of CDMA technology, however, meant that people on tractors could communicate with the bins in town, the person doing the transportation, or somebody back at the homestead regarding catering or some of the comforts of home.</para>
<para>Technology makes a great deal of difference to people on the land who are using that technology, so I think it is about time that the Wireless North project got a guernsey. This project has been mooted since 2001, with the very reasonable proposition that it be funded at a total cost of $12 million, to be shared between Telstra and the state and federal governments, with some $6 million being provided through Telstra funds, $3 million from the state government and $3 million from the federal government. That is not a lot of money when you consider the potential to provide services that are so urgently required.</para>
<para>The North West Coastal Highway is approximately 1,900 kilometres from Geraldton to Broome. That coastal highway is extremely popular, not just for heavy haulage and for people of the region going about their business from one centre to another or back to the city of Perth but, today, very much in the interest of tourism. There are literally tens of thousands of tourists a month using that coastal highway. They have at their disposal primarily GSM telephonesâhand-held setsâbut a few of them have CDMA, and today all they are able to use, if they can get their hands on one, is a satellite phone. That is great. We provide satellite services and hand-held satellite phones for pastoralists, businesspeople and people residing in those remote areas where there is no landline available, and we provide a substantial subsidy for those satellite telephones, which are far more expensive to run than a CDMA phone. But the fact is that, for my people and the tourists who are visiting them, taking advantage of their businesses and looking at the natural splendours of the Pilbara and the Kimberley, it is about time that they got some CDMA coverage. For a paltry $3 million contribution from the federal government, that can be provided.</para>
<para>Already, during the run-up to the last state election, the state government of Western Australia have, in a very informal way, committed themselves to a contribution of $3 million. At this stage, what is seriously required from Western Australia is a proper, detailed, costed proposition that says just what they would like to do with a $3 million contribution from the federal government that would see this dream become a realityâa reality that will provide communication services that will assist stranded motorists. The North West Coastal Highway is a very long highway, with up to a couple of hundred kilometres between habitation points. It has extremes of temperature during the summer months. Temperatures of 48 and 50 degrees are not unheard of; in fact, they are becoming more common these days. If unsuspecting tourists and other travellers on that highway are unprepared to break down and have no means of communication except the hope that somebody will come along who has a satellite phone or HF radio, they are liable to be in exceptionally dire straits.</para>
<para>This is not a luxury that I urge federal minister Senator Coonan to support; it is fast becoming a necessity. What is more, it is taken for granted by so many people living around this great nation today. There is no reason why we cannot give serious consideration, in cooperation with the present Western Australian government and certainly in cooperation with Telstra, to bringing that great distance of the North West Coastal Highway from Geraldton to Broome up to some reasonable level of communication standard that is available elsewhere in this nation at this point in time. I commit myself to fighting tooth and nail to make that come to fruition.</para>

</talker>
<para>âI raise in this grievance debate this evening the failure of the Howard government to accept responsibility for failing the Australian community on the issue of skills, both trade and professional. In doing so, I refer the House to the <inline font-style="italic">Skills for Work</inline> report. This report, released today, is an indictment of the governmentâs record and failures in the area of vocational education and training. The report reveals in a factual manner that most of the growth in apprenticeships has been in areas where there are no skills shortages and that the share of new apprenticeships in traditional trades, where we have an absolute shortage at the moment, halved from 25 per cent in 1996 to 13 per cent in 2003.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The report suggests that, after nine years of failure in training and skills, the growth of the Australian economy is now severely constrained because of skills shortages, particularly in the trades and engineering. Further, not one but two recent OECD reports have now highlighted the urgency for government and industry to respond to skills shortages in the Australian economy.</para>
<para>Nowhere is this more evident than in the resources sector. I saw this first-hand last week when I undertook a tour of major mining and oil and gas operations in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. That tour showed that Australian mining operations are rapidly responding to the major boom in demand for minerals, yet the major impediment identified by the companies is the lack of skilled and professional employees. On Friday it was reported that plans to reopen the Western Australian Bronzewing goldmine are to be abandoned because of acute skills shortages. How many more Bronzewings are needed before the Howard government starts to accept its responsibility for the need to do something real about training in the traditional apprenticeships area and for assisting industry with respect to some of the professional careers available?</para>
<para>The issue of resources is important. I say that because some reports indicate that $20 billion worth of major infrastructure and resources projects could be in jeopardy as a result of skills shortages primarily in the trades and engineering areas. This is a sector we as a nation must keep healthy. Over the decade to 2003-04, the value of exports from the minerals and energy sector grew by 95 per cent, reflecting just how important this sector is to Australiaâs export performance. More than 25 per cent of Australiaâs total exports now come from the resources sector. In addition, the sector contributes $34 billion gross value-added and 4.6 per cent to Australiaâs total GDP, and over $4 billion to government revenue through royalties alone. Surely it is about time for the Howard government to get real about trying to assist this sector of the Australian community with trade training. In that context, late last year there were nearly 22,000 unfilled vacancies for tradespersons in Australia, and it is estimated that skills shortages could cost the Australian economy $9 billion in lost output over the coming decade. While both industry and state and federal governments have a role to play in addressing these issues, it is the Howard government that has been spectacular in its failure to plan for Australiaâs future. Tens of thousands of young Australians have been turned away from TAFE each year. The failure by the Howard government to rise to the challenge of vocational education and training has left Australian industry stranded.</para>
<para>There are, however, some outstanding examples of innovation by the states and by industry in addressing the skills shortage. I refer the House to the Gladstone Schools Engineering Skills Centre in Queensland. This is a partnership between three local high schools and industry, notably NRGâs Gladstone power station and the Comalco Community Fund. NRG has supplied an engineering workshop on site at the power station for a peppercorn rent, and the Comalco Community Fund has invested in transport for the students and in funding for a full-time project officer. Teaching staff come from all the schools involved. The program is targeted at year 11 and 12 students and exposes them to a real industrial environment, using industrial standard latest technology tools, for 1Â½ days a week. The students are treated as adults in the workplace. They are trained in workplace health and safety, are required to wear uniforms and personal protective equipment and are exposed to enterprise and business skills as well as physical hand skills and light-engineering skills. The students also undertake practical work experience with an employer on one day per week.</para>
<para>At the same time, and this is important, the students are required to spend 2Â½ days in the school environment, mixing with their peers, playing sport or being involved in other school activities and continuing to learn fundamental language, social and mathematical skills. This is in stark contrast to the suggestion by the Prime Minister today, a policy issue determined on the run, that in order to advance skills training in Australia we should encourage our young to leave school at years 9 or 10. It is about time the Howard government realised that you can both stay at school and successfully commence a real apprenticeship. That is about having a rounded education, something which the Labor Party aspires to for all Australian youth.</para>
<para>I note that at the end of the program the students are awarded a Certificate I in Engineering (Manufacturing) qualification, a nationally accredited qualification allowing them to enter trade apprenticeships and the TAFE system. In essence, they are job ready. By staying at school and completing this program they are more attractive to employers. The last thing we need in Australia is for the Prime Minister to have his way and force our young people out of school at years 9 or 10. In fact, these students leave the program with all the underpinning knowledge for certificate II and are often awarded this qualification very soon after entering the TAFE system because of their success in initially undertaking this type of training. But, perhaps more importantly, because of the effort being put in by local schools, industry and the Queensland government, the program has 100 per cent employment outcomes, with 90 to 95 per cent of students going into apprenticeships and the other five to 10 per cent going into tradesmenâs assistant roles. That is what success is aboutâwhere you get a cooperative approach to trade training in Australia.</para>
<para>I therefore say to the House that the program is a credit not only to the state governments and the companies involved but also to the individual teachers, tradespeople, engineers, managers and parents who personally invested their time and social vision in making it happen. But, obviously, it all costs money. It adds to the cost of traditional secondary education and places an additional burden on the education system. This is where the Howard government should be concentrating its activities. It should not be taking a hammer to ANTA, suggesting that it should be reabsorbed into the Department of Education, Science and Trainingâwhich would involve more bureaucracy and red tape. Perhaps more importantly we should be trying to work out how the private sector, schools and state, territory and Commonwealth governments can work in a cooperative model to actually make real progress on the apprenticeship front. I suggest that, rather than going down the alternative technical college route, it is about time the Prime Minister put additional money into the existing system. We need $289 million spent on delivering training today, not on bricks and mortar in four years time.</para>
<para>The governmentâs proposal for a new system of technical skills will create unnecessary duplication, inefficiencies and competition for scarce resources. Tasmania is a prime example of how we can cooperate. The coalitionâs election policy on technical colleges was designed on the run, based on a mainland template that does not exist in Tasmania. Tasmaniaâs emphasis on workplace vocational education and training, akin to the Gladstone model, is something which we need to work for as opposed to the school based VET system, which is in some ways also important. There is no demand for a greenfield site to build a separate college.</para>
<para>While the government now wants to blame the states for skill shortages, the facts show that the Commonwealth governmentâs failure to match the state increases in VET funding since 1997 has reduced VET spending by $832 million. Since these massive cuts in TAFE funding, we have gone backwards on trade training. It is about time we actually spent our money wisely. I call on the Commonwealth government to get real about doing something about traditional trade training, to work out a cooperative modelânot one based on conflict and confrontationâbecause it has failed on trade training since 1996. The Australian economy will now suffer because of this lack of investment. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI grieve today for a number of fundamental aspects of human decency and compassion. However, it is important as I do so that we do not lose sight of the values that make our society in Australia so great. We are a unique peopleâdetermined yet humble; enthusiastic yet accommodating; entrepreneurial yet empathetic. I grieve today for those innocent members of community groups and organisations who find themselves and their organisation used by ideologues who have their own values and prejudices to push. Those same elements all too often preach against this government, accusing it of lacking moral compassion.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I grieve for members of the Uniting Church, who innocently attend church services in the belief that they are there to engage in pastoral care and to practise their faith. It is a breach of one of these fundamental aspects of human decency and compassion of which I was disgusted to learn last Tuesday, 2 March, when elements of the Uniting Church turned their back on the veteran community.</para>
<para>On behalf of the veteran community, members of the four RSL subbranches in my electorate of DeakinâBlackburn, Mitcham, Ringwood and Croydonâand all decent and compassionate people in my electorate, I grieve at the action of Reverend Wes Campbell of St Johnâs Uniting Church in Essendon. His decision to refuse the dying wish of World War II veteran Mr George Vipond to have his coffin draped in the Australian flag, and an RSL memorial service to be held, is an insult to the man and to the veteran community. Tens of thousands of our nationâs heroes have given their lives fighting to protect our shores from the forces of tyranny. Mr Vipond, who served in Papua New Guinea from 1942 to 1946, was one of those people. Now it seems that some in the community fail to understand the contribution and the efforts those people put in to advance the freedoms that we enjoy today.</para>
<para>The rationale behind the churchâs decision is perplexing, and its motives are disturbing. In embarking on this moral crusade, the Uniting Church in Essendonâsupported, I understand from a radio interview, by the moderator of the Uniting Churchârode roughshod over Mr Vipondâs final wish. This action flies in the face of what a decent, compassionate and responsible community leader should do. Churches of all denominations are traditionally institutions to which the community turn for spiritual guidance. Sadly, all too frequently we are seeing churches exploit a situation to peddle their own extreme political views. It calls into question the parameters in which influential community figures engage the community.</para>
<para>It was interesting to learn of the reactions of everyday people on Melbourne talkback radio. Caller after caller came on the radio, disgusted at the insinuation that the use of an Australian flag at a funeral and an RSL service is a symbol of war. Ironically, just prior to listening to these conversations, I had attended Southwood Boys Grammar School in my electorate to present them with a brand new Australian flag. In the ceremony the schoolâs campus principal expressed the sense of responsibility that the flag brought to the school. To the Southwood community, the Australian flag represents ideals such as tolerance, opportunity, friendship and peace. Clearly, any effort to undermine the proud attachment that we have to our flag is outrageous.</para>
<para>I was not surprised to learn of a connection between the decision on Mr Vipondâs funeral and the anti Iraqi war vigils in early 2003. The decision to ban an RSL service in his church was solely based on a personal view. The sickening aspect of this is that the decision drew the entire parish into a political crusade and demonised the service of a war veteran in the process. Reverend Campbell may claim that his motives represent human decency. He stated that he had âcome to a judgment that fundamentally the gospel calls us to be people of peace and that the church is always to seek reconciliation, where possible, between enemiesâ.</para>
<para>The argument appears to have missed two key points. One of these was highlighted by former Victorian RSL president Bruce Ruxton. Mr Ruxton was clearly taken aback by the decision to refuse his friendâs wish, stating that Reverend Campbell âshould be ashamed of himselfâ. In his typical way, Mr Ruxton went on to echo the feelings of a generation of Australians when he said that he âoften wonders what these reverend gentlemen would have done if the Japanese had landed here in 1942â. The second point missed by this misguided church is that Australia has reconciled with this difficult past. Japan has become one of our most important trading partners. Recently we have also seen increased cooperation between our countries in the war on terror. The peace and reconciliation which the church calls for could not have been achieved without the heroics of men and women like George Vipond during the Second World War, and the veterans in preceding and subsequent conflicts.</para>
<para>The strength of human decency in Australiaâs identity is evident when you travel abroad. As recently as January, I had the good fortune to travel through the streets of the Palestinian West Bank territory to witness the Palestinian presidential elections. The reaction of everyday people, children and even Israeli security forces to the kangaroo emblem on our car and clothing was memorable. To these people, images of Australiana inspire a smile and a friendly comment. This really did reinforce to me what I personally associate with being Australian. I am proud of our intelligence, our warmth, our compassion, our sense of engagement and our sense of being part of the world community. Human decency encompasses all of these ideals and forms a plank from which we must not deviate as a society. If there are rules within various parishes in the church community which prevent them from honouring members of the veteran community in such a dignified wayâby giving them an RSL service and displaying the Australian flagâthen I call upon those churches to change those rules so that we can honour with dignity our veterans, and do so in a way which does not glorify war.</para>
<para>In the brief time I have left, I would like to talk about another national issue which also touches on the issues of compassion and decency. Few national issues have generated as much emotion in my electorate as the mandatory detention of illegal immigrants. Interestingly, the link between the Uniting Church and the debate on Australiaâs border control policy also comes into question at this time. I can understand and empathise with many of the strong views that have been expressed on both sides of the debate. The immigration department has never taken lightly decisions to detain people, and I understand that. The security of Australiaâs borders and the integrity of our immigration system are critical, and detention centres are a necessary part of the process.</para>
<para>I am not standing here today calling for a policy change on Australiaâs immigration system. Clearly, the fewer unauthorised arrivals we have in Australia, the fewer people we will have in immigration detention. The governmentâs policy towards people-smug-gling has stemmed the trade, even though an editorial in one of last weekendâs Melbourne newspapers casts doubt on this assertion.</para>
<para>Just last week, I had the opportunity to visit the Baxter immigration detention facility in South Australia. Of particular concern to me has been the case of Peter Qasim, who has been in detention for the past six years. Mr Qasim claims that he is from the disputed territory of Kashmir in India. Since arriving in 1998, Mr Qasimâs protracted case has put him in limbo. The dispute over his homeland has resulted in him becoming a stateless person.</para>
<para>I do not want to enter into the finer details and complications of his case. However, I am concerned that the immigration appeals process, with its multilayered path of tribunals and referrals to the federal and high courts, can leave some cases unresolved and leave illegal immigrants in detention for lengthy periods of time. In Mr Qasimâs case, 6Â½ years is clearly stretching the realms of acceptability and is not in line with the parameters of a compassionate society. The security of Australiaâs borders and the integrity of our immigration system can be maintained while adhering to the principles of human decency. In Mr Qasimâs case, the decent thing to do is to find a way to break the current impasse that is in place between the government and India over his status. A solution needs to be found to prevent cases such as Mr Qasimâs occurring in the future without compromising the integrity of our immigration system. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âAs you will doubtlessly recall, when the House adjourned just two weeks ago I was critical of the governmentâs mishandling of the broadcasting antisiphoning legislation because, at the time, no commercial free-to-air network had acquired the free-to-air broadcast rights to the 2005 Ashes cricket series. While my criticism of the government stands, I want to begin by congratulating SBS television, which last week secured the free-to-air television rights for the forthcoming Ashes series. I also congratulate the ABC, which, along with SBS, recognised the importance of this event and that the national interest required the matches to be broadcast on free-to-air television.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>While we can be pleased with this outcome, Australian viewers are entitled to know who is to blame for the terrible loophole in the antisiphoning legislation which, in the endâat five minutes to midnightârequired action to ensure free-to-air coverage of the Ashes and spare the government severe embarrassment. Australians are also entitled to know why the government is treating all media policy in Australia as an opportunity to serve the commercial interests of their nearest and dearest powerful media moguls. Clearly, in relation to our media policy and the laws governing the media, the Howard government is allergic to the public interest. We all await with great interest the governmentâs recasting of the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Media Ownership) Bill after 1 July this year.</para>
<para>There are three main players in the antisiphoning mess and each of them must accept a share of the blame: the commercial free-to-air networks, the pay TV licensees andâin my view, the worst of allâthe Howard government. The pay TV industry has complained bitterly about the three commercial free-to-air networks which, as they see it, have too frequently abused the antisiphoning laws in order to hoard sporting eventsâthat is, buying the rights to events yet refusing to screen them live. As many commentators representing the interests of pay TV licensees argued, the only reason the Ashes were not going to be seen on commercial free-to-air television this year was that the networks had no interest in showing the Ashes live. Thankfully, now we are going to see them. Foxtel has argued that it would happily share rights with free-to-air rivals but is often locked out of negotiations by the antisiphoning laws.</para>
<para>It is in the interests of pay television licensees to argue for a dual rights system to replace the antisiphoning laws, but this ignores the fact that the antisiphoning regime was establishedârightly, and by a Labor governmentânot for the benefit of commercial free-to-air networks but, principally, for more than three-quarters of Australian households who do not have access to pay television or do not want to be forced to pay between $50 and $80 per month to see a nationally significant sporting event. That is why the free-to-air networks must be given some protection when bidding for broadcast rights of the most popular sporting events.</para>
<para>While it is easy to see that the three commercial free-to-air networks are not entirely blameless in this, it is far more important to examine the pay television players and their cynical use of the loophole in the law. The pay television industry, as represented by the Australian Subscription Television and Radio Association (ASTRA), has in the past maintained that it agrees with the concept of the antisiphoning list but believes it should be more realisticâthat is, reflective of what free-to-air networks have historically shown rather than the much longer list that currently exists. Compare that sentiment with the behaviour of Foxtel and the way they have locked up the rights to broadcast the Ashes. We know the Ashes have historically been shown live on free-to-air television, yet Foxtel, through the program provider Fox Sports, have made it a commercially much less viable option for the commercial free-to-air networks to acquire the free-to-air rights. It has not gone unnoticed that Foxtel is Australiaâs largest subscription television provider, with Mr Packerâs Publishing and Broadcasting Limited (PBL) and Mr Murdochâs News Corporation each owning a 25 per cent stake. Telstra, as you know, owns the remaining 50 per cent stake.</para>
<para>Fox Sports has already acquired the rights to televise the Ashes because it is not a pay television licensee and is therefore not caught by the provisions of the antisiphoning laws. I again draw to the attention of the House the fact that, conveniently, Fox Sports is half owned by PBL and News Corporation. Their sole interest is, obviously, promoting pay TV and not the spirit of the antisiphoning legislation. The free-to-air networks rightly want the rules governing sports broadcasting to stop Fox Sports buying television rights to the nationâs most popular events. They rightly complain that Fox Sports should not be allowed to buy an event and offer it to the networks, fulfilling its legal obligations, while simultaneously retaining the right to show the event on pay television as well. As Toni OâLoughlin reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> in August last year, free-to-air network executives argue that:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">If a buyer acquires pay and free-to-air rights and offers them on a non-exclusive basis, nine times out of ten it wonât be feasible for the free-to-airs to buy rights because they wonât get a big enough audience or the advertisers, because the advertisers want exclusivity.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The ultimate losers from all of this are the families in my electorate of Lowe and across Australia who do not have pay TV.</para>
<para>As I said earlier, worst of all in this debacle is the Howard government. What is the government doing to prevent future sporting events being hijacked by the pay TV licensees? Sadly, the government has not proposed any amendments to the antisiphoning legislation in order to close the loophole and protect the public interest. It has not moved to protect the interests of millions of Australian viewers. Instead, the governmentâs attitude to this communications issue has matched its agenda regarding the proposed cynical changes to Australiaâs cross-media ownership lawsâsomething I have spoken about continually in this House for the last three years. Sadly and disturbingly, as I keep reminding the House, the Howard government is only interested in promoting the interests of Australiaâs largest media organisations and their ownersânamely, PBL and News Corporation.</para>
<para>As far as the antisiphoning legislation is concerned, it is clear the Howard government is now backing away from protecting free-to-air viewers. Last year the government reviewed the antisiphoning list and released a revised list, covering events that will occur between 2006 and 2010. While the list covers the 2006 FIFA World Cup, it does not cover the 2010 tournament. Consequently, pay television licensees will be able to obtain exclusive rights to the event before free-to-air broadcasters have had the opportunity to do so. The governmentâs failure to list the 2010 FIFA World Cup significantly increases the likelihood that it will only be available on pay television, as was the case with the European football championships last year. Tonight, I invite the minister to answer my question in writing No. 600 and explain why the FIFA World Cup is worthy of protection in 2006 but not in 2010.</para>

<para>âThe member for Hotham says that is a fair question, and it is. Thousands of viewers in my electorate and, doubtless, many constituents in Hotham, along with millions more across Australia, will be rightly angry and disappointed if the government only looks after the interests of the pay television industry and its owners. The government must immediately close the loophole that has seen the Ashes series disappear from commercial free-to-air screens this year. It is overwhelmingly in the public interest to prevent entities associated with pay television licensees acquiring broadcast rights to listed events and, in so doing, making it commercially difficult for commercial free-to-air networks to acquire free-to-air rights. The government should support Laborâs amendment to the Broadcasting Services Act and ensure the 2010 FIFA World Cup is listed. It must close the existing loophole and guarantee the exclusive free-to-air broadcast rights to all nationally significant events. The government must act to strengthen the antisiphoning regime in the interests of all Australians, and it must stop crawling to Australiaâs most powerful media moguls. We have had a gutful.</para>

<para>âIn speaking to <inline ref="R2279">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2004-2005,</inline> <inline ref="R2278">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2004-2005</inline> and <inline ref="R2277">Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2004-2005</inline>, I would like to look at what the Labor Party have been saying about what they claim is a $66 billion spending spree by the federal government. In particular, I want to challenge the claim that budget decisions by the government over the last 12 months are anything other than a totally manageable and effective set of spending initiatives.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The shadow Treasurer, who humiliated himself today by back-pedalling on his insistence that the states stick by their contract to remove certain state taxes in return for the totality of GST funds, has also embarrassed himself with absurd claims of economic vandalism in relation to the governmentâs expenditure program. The fact is that you have to look back more than nine years to find acts of economic vandalism. Let me remind the shadow Treasurer of Laborâs abuse of monetary policy in the late eighties. It is legendary. The Labor Treasurer of the day, Paul Keating, arrogantly and wantonly boasted about having the Reserve Bank of Australia in his back pocket. Seventeen per cent mortgage rates were the product of that arrogance and that interference. Now that is an act of economic vandalismâand it is sad to see Laborâs former Prime Minister Paul Keating sticking his tortured head up every time he thinks something may go wrong so that he can again try to rewrite history.</para>
<para>The shadow Treasurerâs rhetoric and angst ring a bit hollow when you consider the situation we are in as a nation. Inflation is lowâit was 9.3 per cent in Paul Keatingâs era and it is 2.6 per cent today. Interest rates are still at historically low levels. There were mortgage rates as high as 17 per cent in Paul Keatingâs era; today they are at 7.3 per cent. The budget is strongly in surplus, employment is at a 30-year low, business investment is strong, profit share is close to a record and $73 billion of Keating government debt has been repaid. We have plenty of challenges if we want to continue this record of success, but they are challenges of success rather than challenges of weakness or failure.</para>
<para>The shadow Treasurer is asserting that the $66 billion expenditure announced over the last 12 months led to an increase in interest rates and has put serious pressure on inflation. He is again showing a poor grasp of monetary policy. Let us look at some of the facts. The $66 billion in spending is spread over five years, from 2003-04 to 2007-08. It is made up of $52 billion worth of policy decisions reported in the budget last year, $5.1 billion worth of policy decisions reported in the pre-election fiscal outlook and $8.4 billion worth of initiatives as part of election commitments in 2004.</para>
<para>So what has happened in this parliament concerning the major initiatives of that first tranche of $52 billion in the 2004-05 budget? Firstly, there was $19.2 billion in help for families over five years. Labor passed that legislation. Secondly, income tax worth $14.7 billion over the next four years is to be cut so that more than 80 per cent of taxpayers will face a marginal tax bracket of 30 per cent or less. Labor put up an alternative program of similar cost. Thirdly, retirement savings will be boosted, with a superannuation contribution scheme totalling $2.1 billionâor three per cent of the $66 billion expenditure. Labor opposed this expenditure, which says much about their short-term view of the world.</para>
<para>Fourthly, we announced investment of $5.3 billion for science and innovation, as well as $3.1 billion for land transport infrastructure. Labor supported these initiatives. Next we provided for carers and aged care, with an additional $461 million over five years and a further $2.2 billion over five years to the aged care sector. Labor supported these initiatives. Finally there was investment in Australiaâs security, with an extra $755 million to enhance intelligence capabilities and strengthen security arrangements. Labor opposed this spending. They preferred to cut and run. It is interesting to note that the two programs concerned with our long-term securityâthose providing for the financial security of our aged and for national securityâLabor opposed. Despite opposing those two measures, the opposition broadly matched our budget expenditure, either supporting our measures, amending them or promising to spend more in some cases.</para>
<para>Now let us look at the election promises made by the opposition. The government promised $8.4 billion during the campaignâ$8.4 billion that will be spent, again, over five years. The opposition promised more than $13 billion worth of initiatives, which is a conservative estimate considering that many of their programs were underfunded and that the cost blow-outs of many of their programs were massive. To take just one case, Medicare Gold, Labor allocated $1.7 billion in 2006-07 and $2 billion in 2007-08, to fund all hospital treatment for people over the age of 75. A report by respected economic analyst Econtech has found that the real costs would have been $4.2 billion and $4.5 billion per year respectivelyâan estimated likely cost of $8.7 billion. For that one particular initiative there would have been a blow-out of $5 billion, which was more than the total cost of the coalitionâs election promises. More than our entire total would have gone on one program. If you extend that blow-out over five years of expenditure, you see that there would have been a total cost of well over $20 billion for that one initiative.</para>
<para>So not only did Labor effectively commit tens of billions of dollars more than the coalition but they continue to misrepresent the stimulatory effect on the economy of the governmentâs spending. The $66 billion is to be spent at an average rate of $13.1 billion a year. That is 1.6 per cent of the economyâan $800 billion economy. Of the $66 billion, over $52 billion is yet to be spent. In other words, 80 per cent of the money is yet to be spent. To suggest that these spending decisions have materially impacted on monetary policy is economic naivetyâthe sort of naivety that always leads the Labor government to make a mess of running the shop.</para>
<para>We have the Leader of the Opposition and his shadow Treasurer saying to anyone who will listen, â$66 billion, $66 billion.â We heard the mantra again at question time today. However, our Labor opponents are not letting on that that is expenditure over five years. Our Labor opponents are not letting on that most of that expenditureâin fact, nearly 80 per centâis yet to be spent and therefore is not causing the inflationary pressure they insist on hammering on about. Our opponents are not letting on that the cost of these commitments on an annual basis represents roughly 1.6 per cent of the economy, so the likelihood that meeting that cost will materially overheat the economy is absurd. Our opponents are not letting on that most of the $66 billion of expenditure committed over the last year is yet to be spent. It is an odd thing how expenditure earmarked for spending over three years from nowâand representing well under two per cent of the economyâis lifting interest rates today. Our opponents are not letting on that Labor either supported the legislation giving effect to the budget expenditure of $66 billion or promised greater spending. In other words, Labor are damning expenditure that they either supported or promised to amend or to exceed in other ways. It must be very uncomfortable having their tongues so firmly planted in their cheeks.</para>
<para>Our opponents will not let on that in relation to the national accounts of last week there is no evidence of inflationary pressures coming from fiscal policy. Our opponents in this regard do not want to hear or repeat what the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Ian Macfarlane, said as recently as 18 February. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">When I go overseas and I talk to other central bank governors, and we get on to fiscal policy, everyone just says, âOh, how lucky you are.â The US has a big and increasing fiscal deficit; the European area has lots of countries that do not know how to keep their budget deficit down to three per cent of GDP, which they are obliged to under the Growth and Stability Pact; even the UK fiscal policy is a big issue there because of their deficit getting larger. Japan is a special case, but it has a massive fiscal deficit. If you have a small surplus every year, as we have had in Australia, it is ... hard to make a case that that is inflationary and therefore it is very hard to make a case that it has any impact at all on monetary policy.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">There is deadly silence on the other side of the House about the opinions and the judgment of the Governor of the Reserve Bank.</para>
<para>Our opponents are also not letting on that inflation is still historically low in Australia. They will not tell you that inflation is within the two to three per cent band set by the government. They will not tell you that forecasts show that it will not go outside that band, nor that the Reserve Bank agreed with such forecasts as recently as last week. Our opponents are not letting on that, after all that, the Howard government will maintain the budget in surplus, having paid off $73 billion of government debt left by Prime Minister Paul Keating and the finance minister of the day, Kim Beazley. Our opponents are not letting on about what major expenditure from that $66 billion they would scrap. The reason is simple: if they were running the country they would be spending more. The Leader of the Opposition was, of course, Australiaâs finance minister from 1993 to 1996, and for every day he held those responsibilities the federal budget was seriously in the red.</para>
<para>Despite supporting most of the legislation that sits behind the $66 billion of budget spending over five years, Labor says that much of it should be spent on skills shortages, new initiatives and new incentives. But, again, do not listen to what they say; look at what they do. Labor in government gutted new apprenticeships in the trades. Between 1990 and 1994 Labor slashed new apprenticeships in trades and related occupations. There were 160,990 in 1990 but that was reduced to 107,000 in 1994. The government has been focussed on this area, and today there are more than 416,000 new apprentices in training, which means the numbers in training have almost tripled since 1995.</para>
<para>Under Labor, unmet demand for training places hit 60,700 in 1995. Laborâs policies helped foster prejudice against vocational education and the trades. The coalitionâs policy will create more than 48,000 new apprenticeship opportunities over the next four years, with 21,600 students in technical colleges, 3,000 new apprenticeships through defence industry contracts, 4,000 school based new apprenticeships, 4,500 pre-vocational training places and 15,000 people in the New Apprenticeships Access Program. Nothing in Laborâs approach will change the cultural prejudice against vocational education and the trades, which are considered second class compared with university education.</para>
<para>As to Laborâs gratuitous suggestion that we should be spending this money on new tax initiatives, let me draw attention to the fact that the government is reducing tax on 1 July. We are raising the threshold for the top rate and the second top rate. The government is reducing tax for some 500,000 small business and new business start-ups and is reducing tax for parents who are paying child-care expenses.</para>
<para>We can and will do more throughout this term, but let us not gloss over the fact that nearly half of the $66 billion in budget commitments is in the form of tax cuts. The bottom line is that members of the opposition have hypocritically established a âstraw manâ when they bang on about a $66 billion spending spree. They are hypocritical in the sense that the Labor Party passed most of the legislation supporting these initiatives. Furthermore, during the election the Labor Party committed itself to far greater spending than the coalition did. Laborâs forward commitment was well over $80 billion, if we look at all the sensitivities of the assumptions that it made in its calculationsâwithout the benefit of related policies to improve productivity to ensure that such expenditure is manageable and non-inflationary. Labor has constructed a straw man in the sense that only 20 per cent of the funding has actually been spent to date, because the funding relates to commitments spread over five years. To suggest that spending over nearly two years which equates to around one per cent of the total economy can have such influence is either disingenuous or naive. I suspect the former.</para>
<para>The really important factor in all of this is that the government continues to contribute to national savings. In seven of the nine Howard-Costello government budgets, we have delivered surpluses. This compares with the record of the Hawke and Keating governments: nine of their 13 budgets were in deficit. Kim Beazley, as finance minister from 1993 to 1996, was involved with their last four budget deficitsâ$17 billion in 1992-93, $17 billion in 1993-94, $13 billion in 1994-95 and $10 billion in 1995-96. Kim Beazley then spent his first six years as Leader of the Opposition opposing every attempt by the Howard government to get the budget back into surplus.</para>
<para>Against this background the Beazley opposition is not well placed to lecture the government on matters of responsible spending. The challenge of managing the economy is the challenge of managing a strong economy. The government is eager to meet this challenge. The opposition could assist by doing some serious policy work, rather than spending its time scaremongering, with hypocritical and disingenuous arguments.</para>

<para>âThis debate on the <inline ref="R2279">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2004-2005</inline> and related bills gives us an opportunity to look at the vision that the Howard government brings for the next term of parliament. Despite the protestations of those opposite, the opposition can be quite assured in the case it puts that, during the election campaign, a lot of things that were promised by the government were about the short term. They were very much promised with an eye to the result of the election rather than the longer vision. Whatever way we cobble it together, the items that are listed in these appropriation bills really do illustrate that case. As I have discussed before, my concern is that Australia will suffer unless we, as a legislative body, together look at the longer term and the way in which we can invest in infrastructure that is for the long term. Over the past short while, we have seen a lot of commentaryâreaching a crescendo with the Reserve Bankâs decision to increase interest ratesâabout the shortcomings of previous decisions of the government and about the way in which the government has dropped its eye from the main game and looked at these decisions that have a very short horizon.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>If we are building on the work that was done over a decade ago during the Hawke and Keating years to bring forward an economy that has great strengths, what is required is to ensure that, whilst we might be going through a period of economic sunshine, we are investing what we are achieving at the moment for the longer term, ensuring that, in an intergenerational sense, what we leave now benefits the community and the nation going forward.</para>
<para>Earlier this year, I placed on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> a question regarding a promise that was made in the federal electorate of Gippsland. I stumbled upon this proposal whilst visiting Metung down on the Gippsland lakes. I had just walked into the village. I had walked along the road. There was no footpath and there was very little space on the verge to walk safely. When I got into the shop I was visiting, I saw on the community noticeboardâunder the heading of the minister and local member, Peter McGauran, and the Leader of the National Party and Deputy Prime Ministerâan announcement that the government was to fund a boardwalk along the Metung Road, to the tune of half a million dollars. As I have said when mentioning this project before, I have no problems with this being a project with some merit. But I am very interested in the process. That is why I put on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> a question about this proposal for a boardwalk along the Metung Road, Bancroft Bay, north of the Metung Yacht Club. I asked what sum was approved, when the funding was announced and what the expected completion date of the project was.</para>
<para>The answer to the first question I askedâwhat date was the funding approved?âis that the funding for the boardwalk was announced on 28 September 2004 as an election commitment. The answer to my second questionâwhat sum was approved?âis that final funding will be settled through the additional estimates process, which is what we have just gone through. My third question was: when was it announced? I was referred back to the 28 September date. The answer to the question on the expected completion date of the project is that the completion date has not been identified.</para>
<para>Alongside this press release, the local community body said that it was a month after the election at that stage and they had not heard anything more about it. We are now three or four months down the track and I am sure they still have not heard anything. The intriguing thing with this proposal is that, no matter what its meritâand as we have discovered with a lot of these proposalsâyou did not have to apply. You just put up your hand and said: âWalking along the Metung Road along Bancroft Bay I have had a brainwave. I was nearly skittled by the tourists. It is dangerous. Perhaps extending the boardwalk would be a sensible idea.â That is okay, but, as I indicated, the funding came out of the pot of money for the Roads to Recovery strategic fund. It is not stated in the aforementioned answer that that was where it was coming from. I note in appropriation bills which we are discussing tonight that there is $30 million for the Department of Transport and Regional Services to fulfil promises like thisâfor the expansion of the Roads to Recovery program.</para>
<para>There is a whole host of other things listed in these bills that are of a similar ilk. I was really interestedâwhen you have a proposal like that or like the dredging of Tumbi Creek on the Central Coast of New South Wales, which was awarded $1.5 millionâin what that might have meant to the electorate of Scullin. When I put this question to people with the skill to give me the answers they suggested that if we were envisaging doing the heavy-rail extension, which I will get back to later, $500,000 provides one level crossing. One and a half million dollars is half a bridge, and there are three or four of those required for the extension. For Plenty Gorge and Linear Park the $500,000 would provide 10 kilometres of trail, signage and crossingsâof course, it would provide that over 30 kilometres if you were to get the $1.5 million.</para>
<para>If we look at some of the other proposals, the interesting thing is that some of the suggestions that were put to me were to start in the electorate of Scullin and move through to the electorate of McEwenâthings like the Epping to Whittlesea rail trail, which is 20 kilometres long at $40 a metre. You get the partial construction for $500,000; for $1 million you get construction of shared paths, signage, access points and safe road-crossing treatments. Perhaps I made the mistake of not referring the people that live in Scullin to the member for McEwen, who could have got her hands on these magic pots of funding, because there was no advertisement to say that these funds were available. There is no process. You do not put in a submission that has to have some substance and rigour to it and there is no process that would look at them with substance and rigour. What happens is that if you can get a friendly minister to issue a press release that gets displayed on the noticeboard in the village, then that is a commitment. Then, when we get to this stage of considering amendments to the legislation, one of the guidelines will be that these projects can get funding if they have been previous election commitments. If they have not been previous election commitments then, unfortunately, your project will have to get over a whole host of hurdles.</para>
<para>I do not mind a process that has some rigour. I do not mind a process in which it is said to everybody, âThis is how we are going to assess those that get funding.â If that were the process, in the electorate of Scullin we could come up with projects for everything and anything you can imagine that would have some credibility and would establish that there is a need. We will take our chances on a proper, open process. We have had nine years of neglect when we could not get anything out of the Howard government. Again I remind the House that my Liberal opponent on the day after the election said, âYes, I have to admit the Howard government has neglected the seat of Scullin.â</para>
<para>Let us look at the $500,000 for this boardwalk comparatively. For instance, one of the great needs we have is for emergency housing. For a little over $500,000, we could get five emergency houses with private amenities, a common room and shared kitchen. There are other things, such as day respite and overnight disability accommodationâa very modest proposal which is of great importance, especially to families with young disabled members whose parents seek a night of respite here or there or, perhaps, a couple of weeks through the year to go off on holiday. If we could get access to the $1.5 million in the same way as those who got the minister to issue the press release about Tumbi Creek we could get some change, because the estimate that I have for a respite care home is $1,426,000.</para>
<para>One suggestion that was made to me, if this money were available, was a proposal for the Plenty River at Greensborough where, when we used to provide facilities like that, the old swimming pool was on the banks of the river. They talked about the upgrade of the Plenty River shared pathâthe Partingtons Flat to Greensborough bypass would cost only $90,000. Do you know what they were prepared to do? If it had been required to get the funding, they would have been happy to change the name of the Plenty River to Tumbi Creek. If that were all it took, they would have been happy to do that.</para>
<para>The point I want to make is that when the federal government is deciding what proposals it is going to be involved in there should be rigour and the guidelines should be very tight. I hope that the proposals would also be underscored by the fact that they provided not only a long-term benefit to the local community but a contribution to the way we develop as a nation. That is why there are pressures at the moment with the type of economy that we are running. We have a run-down of infrastructure. To use the economistsâ jargon, it is now about âcapacityââyou always learn new things in this game. For quite some time in this place I have railed at the lack of vision to be able to make proper investments in infrastructure. There are two things that we have to be cognisant of about infrastructure. Our present infrastructure has a shelf life and will run down. It has to be renewed and it has to be updated. With the growth in Australia there also has to be an eye towards the way we extend our infrastructure.</para>
<para>One of the problems that we see in an electorate like Scullin, on the outer urban fringe of a city like Melbourne, is that that is where the new housing is going. While it is easy to get land and greenfield sites subdivided and developed and find people willing to go in and convert those subdivisions into homes and communities, the greatest difficulty is in ensuring that infrastructure, both physical and social, is put in place to ensure that people are able to get on with their lives without much fuss.</para>
<para>In Scullin and the southern end of the adjoining seat of McEwen there is going to be huge growth on top of the already impressive growth that we have seen over the last couple of decades. One of the greatest shortfalls that we have seen in the provision of infrastructure in that area has been public transport. The only rail extensionâin this case, light rail extensionâthat we have seen to the area in the last 15 years was under the Building Better Cities program when the Bundoora light rail was extended from the McLeans Road terminus to McKimmes Road, alongside the RMIT Bundoora campus. It was funded by the federal government. It has been the only extension and is a bit short of the developing suburb of Mill Park. It is a very important piece of infrastructure. At the time, whilst this was a modest proposal that really was in the order of two or three kilometres, it was seen as very important. It was also seen as proof of the way governments should be matching the needs of their communities, especially the needs in public transport.</para>
<para>There has been a proposal on the books for quite some time to extend the hard railâin the old terminology: the trainâfrom Epping station along to the old South Morang station. This again is a fairly modest extension of a couple of kilometres. At one stage it was promised. That promise was not renewed at the last state election, so the whole project is in abeyance. The beauty of this project is that it follows the rail reserve that goes for nearly 20 kilometres to the Whittlesea township in the seat of McEwen. The rail reserve was first used in 1889, when the rail went up to Whittlesea. That is very interesting, because at that stage that particular railwayâwhich was steam, of courseâstarted at Spencer Street. It used the inner circleâthat is, it went through Royal Park, Carlton, Fitzroy North and then along the Epping line. Regrettably, the inner circle line was stopped. You now see that parcel of land being put to good community use, including some very solid rail station buildings that are used by community groups. But in the late 19th century there was great vision. There was a different balance between the use of private and public transport, and that was obvious in the way in which public transportârail in this caseâmade a contribution to the way Melbourne and its surrounding centres were developed. Regrettably, the Whittlesea line was closed down in 1959 or 1960, so the train then only went through to Epping. Fortunately, that reserve has remained.</para>
<para>A further extension along the High Street-Epping Road corridor is a development called Epping North. In this development, which is at the subdivision stage, another rail reserve has been put in place to cater for the demand that will be there in the new Epping Northâthe Epping bulge. That is a great piece of planning. But it is no use having the great piece of planning if you are not going to deliver. The dilemma for the local community is that, if we cannot get the two or three kilometres to South Morang along a reserve that has been there for 120 years, how are we going to get it along another reserve that has just been invented? Tonight I want to suggest that the proper authorities have a look at a different way of delivering what could be a very important project for the local area, one that would provide public transport that would cater for the developments that will go into Plenty Valley: take the rail reserve that exists along the Whittlesea line from Mernda/Doreen through to the proposed rail reserve in Epping North, a loop of 15 kilometres.</para>
<para>I call on the appropriate state authorities to use this reserve. If they cannot use the reserve for heavy railâthat is, for trainsâlook at different ways. If they think buses are the solution, go down the track of O-Bahn in South Australia, or they could do what is being done in Queensland in the constituency represented by the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education. Use those examples, because they have been very successful. Public transport is separated from the private and they do not mix.</para>
<para>As I said, I am not wedded to what they use. However, I ask them to consider light rail as I think that is the solution. It can be done in stages. The first stage could be from Epping railway station to South Morang. It would cater for the Plenty Valley shopping centre, the Epping Plaza shopping centre, the Northern Hospital, the industry parks that will be created along Cooper Street, and it would go past the TAFE and civic offices. It would cater for the future development of nearly 45,000 people in Mernda/Doreen and 60,000 people in Epping North. The first bit would cater for 20,000 people in South Morang. We need this vision. It would give a public transport spine to this developing area that would be very important. Governments should be involved, because we can demonstrate what is proper and appropriate to do in a situation like this. I seek leave to present the map that shows my proposal.</para>

<para>âAs an aside, I was very interested to hear the member for Scullin talking about planning for future transportation. The constituents of my electorate of Tangney are very concerned about the selling-off of public land by the state government for the Roe Highway, a piece of public infrastructure which is desperately needed by the people of Tangney to get traffic off local roads. However, that departs a little from the contribution I wanted to make on the <inline ref="R2279">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2004-2005</inline> and related bills.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We are reaching a crisis point in terms of oil production and oil use. There will come a time in the futureâno-one is quite sure yet what sort of time period we are looking atâwhen demand will outstrip supply. At that time we are going to have to look at energy alternatives. Clearly, now is the time to be thinking about what alternative energy sources we could potentially use.</para>
<para>People are still going to want to use personal transport and mass transportation systems. We will need an alternative to oil. There is an alternative to oil, which has been broached quite often, and that is the so-called hydrogen economy. Initially we would look at using hydrogen as the fuel source in a normal internal combustion engineâBMW has already demonstrated the capacityâwhere the waste product is water. However, this is not quite as efficient as fuel cells. Obviously the technology we would be looking at later, which is currently in its infancy but is rapidly moving towards maturity, would be hydrogen fuel cells, where efficiencies are very highâsomewhere around 60 to 70 per cent energy conversion.</para>
<para>The problem with hydrogen though is: where do we get the hydrogen from? There have been methods put up by the fuel companies where, for instance, we would use natural gas or other hydrocarbons. I would argue that that is not a very good solution, as you are still emitting pollutants. The best solution is simply to get water and use electrolysis to produce hydrogen. The problem here is that the generation of hydrogen using electrolysis requires a lot of power. Where is that power going to come from? I think most members would agree that using fossil fuels to generate electricity to produce fuel for personal vehicles would not be a good way of going about it, because once again the emissions would be very high.</para>
<para>All sorts of solutions using renewable energy sources have been bandied about and I would like to discuss some of these. A proposal that is heard a lot in Australia is the use of solar power generation. There are significant problems with this, however. First of all, the solar flux at ground level is very low. If you had a solar cell one metre by one metre that was 100 per cent efficient you would still only have enough power to power a one-bar radiator heaterâthat is it. However, solar cells are not 100 per cent efficient. The current state-of-the-art performance is about 16 to 20 per cent for commercially available solar cells or around 30 per cent for extremely expensive triple-junction solar cells that are used on satellites. Even with this level, the problem with solar cells is that you get what is called diffusion with heat, which limits the life of solar cells. So a lot of energy is required to produce solar cells in the first place; they have a limited life and they need to cover a very large area.</para>
<para>Another method that has been bandied about is wind energy. There are a number of problems with wind energy. Firstly, it is environmentally unfriendly on a number of groundsâthe wind-powered generators are known to kill birds and they are unattractive to many people who live near them. There are also problems with the variability of wind. What do you do when you do not have enough wind to generate power? How are you going to store energy for times when you do not generate wind power? There are clearly problems as far as wind energy is concerned.</para>
<para>One area that we really need to revisit is that of nuclear power. The fundamental issues and problems that people have with nuclear energy are related to safety and waste disposal. First of all, I would like to outline the safety of relative electricity generation sources. I will quote figures in terms of normalised deaths per terawatt yearâin other words, if you generate one terawatt of energy for a calendar year, how many deaths can you expect in the industry? For coal fired power stations, there are 342 fatalities per terawatt year. They are predominantly related to the coal workers actually extracting the coal. The number would be far worse if the figures where there were fewer than five fatalities per incident were included. With oil, the number is 418. With natural gas, it is somewhat lower. There are 85 fatalities per terawatt year, and these are workers and also the public. Incidentally, LPG related fatalities are extremely highâ3,280 per terawatt year of electricity generated. With hydro-electricity, a method that some in the green movement like and some hate, there are 883 fatalities per terawatt yearâpredominantly involving the public, due to collapsing dams et cetera.</para>
<para>Now we come to nuclear energy, with 31 fatalities per terawatt year. These are the workers. I know that some members opposite might like to point to Chernobyl. According to the OECD, there have been 10 fatalities in 10 years, due to thyroid cancerâthe major medical problem with radiation exposure. So, as we can see, nuclear is actually a very safe optionâand it is safer these days when you can have gas cooled nuclear power stations and adequate fail-safe systems put on. The problem with Chernobyl, apart from anything else, was that it had inadequate containment. Western containment has been far better. The worst event that we have seen in the West was at Three Mile Island, where the containment worked and the problem with the partial meltdown was due to an operator error.</para>
<para>As far as costs are concerned, gas, coal, oil, nuclear and wind energy have similar mid-term generating costs. These costs are typically within 10 per cent of each other. There are problems as far as waste is concerned. We have seen some of the bad methods of attempting to dispose of waste, such as dropping drums overboard from ships or putting it in concrete and then having to wet down the concrete continually to prevent excessive heat build-up so that the concrete does not turn to dust. However, we have a marvellous Australian invention that can be used to dispose of waste, and this product is called Synroc. This material was the result of the discovery of naturally occurring plutonium in West Africa a number of years ago.</para>

<para>âThank you for that. As far as the material itself is concerned, it was not recognised that plutonium occurred naturally. Of course, being a highly radioactive material, there was a lot of interest in how this material could be stored stably within the structure of the rock. One of the professors from ANU had a look at the structure of the rock and, together with ANSTO, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, came up with a synthetic analog. They developed this material, Synroc, standing for synthetic rock, that is a product of what is called a âHIP-ingâ process, hot isostatic pressing. This is a material that allows you to store high-grade nuclear waste for geological time periods, and the nuclear material will not leach in water.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I have mentioned the issues relating to safety and illustrated that nuclear energy, despite the common perception, is actually exceedingly safe and that you can get rid of waste safely. Let us now look at some of the alternative sources. Tidal power has been mentioned as a method of generating power, particularly up in the north-west of Western Australia where there are 12-metre tides. However, I had a look at the amount of power that would be generated by a proposal that was put up for Derby. They were talking about 48 megawatts, or 48 million watts, of tidal power at Derby. The problem is that, to generate enough power to meet Australiaâs current needs, you would need 900 Derby type tidal power stations.</para>
<para>Another method is wind power. I have already outlined some of the environmental concerns, but let us look at the thing physically. Using current state-of-the-art wind turbinesâand anyone who has been down to Albany or Esperance in my state of Western Australia would know that they are huge structuresâwe would need 22,500 to generate Australiaâs current electricity needs. There have been proposals for ocean current power, particularly with the LeeuwinâI think the Leeuwin flows at about four knots, but do not quote me on thatâbut they are at the embryonic stage. They have merely been proposed. To my knowledge, pilot scale plans have not even been put up.</para>
<para>I have mentioned the solar problem in basic terms, but let us put it in real terms. To generate Australiaâs power needs using solar cellsâand let us assume that we are using space grade solar cells that are 30 per cent efficientâwe would need a solar cell array of 12.3 kilometres by 12.3 kilometres. Imagine making that many solar cells. The problem is, once again, that solar cells only work when there is sun; they do not work at night. So, as far as night is concerned, you can double that figure. As well, there is not as much solar flux during the early morning and the late afternoon, so you can probably get close to quadrupling that figure. You are then talking about an array of approximately 50 kilometres by 50 kilometres of solar cellsânot very practical.</para>
<para>The only method that I have heard of that is somewhat viable is the solar tower turbine method that is proposed for Mildura. This has not seen a full industrial trial; however, it has seen small trials and it seems to work. The problem is that it is a massive structure. They are talking about it being a kilometre high and approximately 20 square kilometres in area. You can generate similar amounts of power by reducing the height of the tower, but then you have to increase the area. There they are talking about approximately 200 megawatts of peak power. To generate enough power for Australiaâs needs, we would need 225 solar towers. The problem there is, once again, that you still need sun for it to work adequately. It is possible that you could use a closed loop fuel cell unit, where you generate hydrogen when you have excess capacity and then you use that hydrogen in a fuel cell to generate power when you have excess demand. However, fuel cells, as I have mentioned, are still not fully commercially developed, and 225 solar towers are a lot of solar towers.</para>
<para>The people in my electorate are sick and tired of power outages and power shortages. In Western Australia last year, in February, we had a power cut for no good reason apart from inadequate power supply. There has been inadequate infrastructure development in terms of power stations; in fact, there have been no new power stations authorised in the last four years. This is a significant problem, where we are running short of power. The Western Australian government is now proposing a desalination plant which is going to up the load that is required by another 10 per centânot a very efficient way of doing it. The power cuts in my electorate are also caused by overhead power lines. Residents have been going on for years about the necessity to put the power lines underground but, unfortunately, a completely deaf ear has been turned to that.</para>
<para>In summary, it is clear that there are problems with both solar power methods: solar cells and the tower method. For solar cells, you are talking about a huge area. You require a lot of money to produce the solar cells in the first place. Then you have to maintain them. You have to keep them clean because, obviously, if there is any dirt on them, it reduces their efficiency. I do not think we have the capacity to produce a solar cell array that is 50 kilometres by 50 kilometresâand that is just for the current energy load that we require. What about when we get to the hydrogen economy, where we will need a lot more power to generate the hydrogen? The solar tower, as I have already outlined, is still in its feasibility stages. Even if it gets beyond that, we would still require a massive number of these solar towers.</para>
<para>Wind is too problematic. It is a haphazard way of producing power. You do not get consistent windâand what do you do in the off-periods? I have to admit that tidal power surprised me. I did not think we would need 900 tidal power stations to generate our power needsâI actually saw that as a good way of going in the future. Clearly, the current way of generating power is not the way that we want to do it, because all we are doing is putting more pollutants in the air to generate the hydrogen that we require.</para>
<para>So, as I mentioned, nuclear power is something that we have to consider. We have to start a reasoned debate on nuclear energy. I am not saying, âBuild nuclear power stations tomorrow,â but we really need to have a reasoned debateânot an emotive debate, which flies in the face of evidence. Nuclear power is safe; it has been proven historically. There are many 1950s technology nuclear power stations that are still operating effectively. There are literally hundreds of nuclear power stations around the world, includingâof all placesâJapan, which was the only country ever to be attacked by nuclear weapons. If ever there was a country that should fear nuclear energy, it should be Japan. I urge the Australian people to start actively thinking about their future energy needs and getting involved in a reasoned debate.</para>

<para>âTonight I want to reflect on some of the lessons that we should learn from the Cornelia Rau episode and to put on the record in this parliament my concern about the approach that has been taken in relation to the investigation. In introduction to this, may I say that the fact that we require a national missing persons register is not a matter that ought to have been suddenly discovered. In fact, the inadequacy of our national system for dealing with missing persons has been a matter of concern for well over a decade.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I want to put on record some of my personal experience in this area, because I have held the office of Minister for Justice. In the years that preceded the Keating governmentâs decision to establish the National Missing Persons Unitâsubsequently not continued by the Howard governmentâthere were a number of episodes that drew attention to the deficiencies of existing state-by-state systems of locating missing persons. The most tragic, of course, were the Belanglo murdersâa number of people who were hitchhikers travelling from overseas came to terribly tragic ends. In that circumstance it became painfully obvious that we needed a system that not only was responsive to the tragedy that individuals and their families suffered in this country when they lost contact with their loved ones but also was capable of liaising internationally with organisations, other police forces and corresponding organisations, when persons travelling in this country went missing.</para>
<para>That led the Keating government to establish the National Missing Persons Unit in 1995. I have direct and clear recall of this because I spoke at the opening. A press release that I issued at the time mentioned the fact that the federal government had dedicated almost a million dollars over four years to establishing the unit, which would also assist in locating foreigners missing in Australia. I pointed out at the time that about 27,000 Australians were reported missing each year. I said that 75 per cent were found within two days and 90 per cent within a month, and that after 12 months 98 per cent were accounted for. It was proposed that the unit would maintain a central database and photo bank on all outstanding missing persons, initially defined as those missing for more than 60 days. Sixty days was selected as the period in which the large majority of persons who were going to turn up safely would have done so, and we could focus on the more serious instances where people had been missing for some considerable period of time. Cornelia Rau, the woman at the centre of the scandal of having been detained by the immigration authorities, was detained for 10 months. So 60 days as a trip-wire would have well and truly expired had that system been operational, had it been continued by the Howard government.</para>
<para>In the media release that I issued at the time of the opening of the National Missing Persons Unit, I pointed out that the unit would also liaise with Interpol and the states and territories to develop and implement procedures for Australians missing overseas. I observed that a dual national-international approach was vital, pointing out that in the backpacker murders the victims were reported missing in Victoria and New South Wales and overseas. I also noted that a similar, very grievous tragedy had occurred in Britain, where a lack of an effective system for dealing with missing persons had shown up flaws. I said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The flaws in the British system were exposed in the House of Horrors murder case, when even though the last address of several of the missing women was the sameâFred and Rosemary Westâs houseâthe victims were never linked.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So obviously there was a law enforcement reason for having a data system that allowed this linkage. Not merely would it be an instance where we would be able to reassure the relatives that everything possible was being done and to have a coordinated national response; there would also be some benefit in making certain that these linkages were able to be made.</para>
<para>That decision made in 1995 and announced by me was followed shortly by the defeat of the Keating government. I am not certain precisely how it came to pass that the National Missing Persons Unit ceased to be operationally effective, but one thing you can be certain of is that it is not operationally effective now. It appears to have ceased to be operational by 1999. It was funded for four years by the Keating government. By 1999 the program seems to have disappeared. The then Minister for Justice, Amanda Vanstone, announced the establishment of CrimTrac, which was designed to be a central repository for various things like fingerprints and DNA, but lost in this process was an effective system for dealing with national missing persons.</para>
<para>There have been some most embarrassing parliamentary exchanges during the Senate estimates hearings. Senator Ludwig, asking questions of Mr Mobbs, the executive officer in charge of CrimTrac, made this comment:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">In the annual reportâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">that is, CrimTracâs annual reportâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">it mentions a missing persons database.</para>
<para class="block">Mr MobbsâDoes it?</para>
<para class="block">Senator LUDWIGâYes. I think it is on page 24.</para>
<para class="block">Mr MobbsâI have to say it is certainly not spelt out in any of the deliverables.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">What we discovered in that examination is that the only way the national missing persons system has anything residual left in CrimTrac is that, if you punch in the name of somebody, it will come up as to whether that person is recorded as a missing person. But you cannot provide photographic materials or search for that fact. We cannot produce all the identifying data so that we actually have an effective missing persons service.</para>
<para>Why am I so particularly concerned about this? I am particularly concerned about this because of two facts. Firstly, there is the failure of the Howard government to continue what seems to have been such a self-evidently necessary system, the National Missing Persons Unit. That in itself has not been sufficiently exposed in public debate. There was never any difficulty in understanding the necessity for such a unit. There have been those thousands of instances every year where families lose contact with their children, or even children with their parents. In those tragic circumstances, to have a National Missing Persons Unit to be able to give an assurance somebody is still aliveâeven if they may not wish to be contactedâto be able to have a central contact point between the states and territories and to have international liaison is so obvious and so important for the peace of mind of those involved. The failure to continue its implementation deserves the utmost condemnation.</para>
<para>Secondly, when it comes to the Cornelia Rau matter, Amanda Vanstone, who in her term of office as the Minister for Justice and Customs was responsible for the period in which the National Missing Persons Unit appears to have ceased to be effectively part of the law enforcement apparatus, turns up again in the role of Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. In that role she then appoints Mick Palmer, the Commissioner of the Federal Policeâwho may himself have been responsible for the implementation of the decision in which the National Missing Persons Unit was wound upâas the person to investigate the Cornelia Rau matter.</para>
<para>Now let me make one thing absolutely perfectly clear at this point: I have the utmost personal regard for the probity of Mick Palmer. I appointed him. He is a man whose personal integrity I would account for without any hesitation in any circumstance. But before I came into this parliament I workedâand I continue to serve from time to timeâin a profession where either the appearance of or the fact of a conflict of interest disqualifies a person from serving in an investigative or adjudicative role. Why does it do that? It does it because, notwithstanding the best intention of a person and their best probity, if you have been involved in some matter in which your own conduct or that of those who have appointed you is in question, it is simply an inappropriate conflict to find yourself in.</para>
<para>There is also the fact that, in this instance, the issues that need to be investigated are cross-jurisdictional. They do not just affect the Commonwealth: its law enforcement agencies and its department of immigration. They also affect potential adverse judgments that could be made against Queensland state institutions: the Queensland police and Queensland hospital services that Cornelia Rau was temporarily placed into for an assessment of her mental condition. Again, it is a conflict of interest to have a person from a Commonwealth law enforcement background placed by the Commonwealth in a position where judgments may have to be made about other jurisdictions.</para>
<para>The simple fact is that when the Howard government came to office it was committed to reducing expenditure on law enforcement. It made substantial reductions in the funding for the Australian Federal Police over its early years in office. It ran down the key institutional capacity of this nation to deal with the kinds of threats that later emerged: global terrorism, organised crime and, in this instance, the problem of missing persons. Those substantial cuts in key law enforcement areas were the subject of criticism in this parliament, but there was no response from the Howard government and its minister for justice at the time, Amanda Vanstone, other than to sweep them aside. In the early years of a government, these things can happenâgovernments survive themâbut they plant the seeds for the social circumstances that then emerge.</para>
<para>It is true that this government has expended very large sums of money in recent times on law enforcement. It increased the budget for the Australian Federal Police very substantially after September 11âquite understandably. Our good fortune as a country is that we were not the subject of the kind of attack that occurred in the United States, because had we been soâhad we had the kind of commission of inquiry that occurred in the United States when it was attackedâthe deficiencies that I have identified here would have been so transparent. We ran down what should be the core capacity of any national government, and that is its ability to protect its citizens through its law enforcement apparatus. We also ran down the key institutional framework for reassuring people that their loved ones would be found if they were missing.</para>
<para>The surprising thing is that we never restored that part of the framework. We have restored much of the capacity of law enforcement in the areas where terrorism might affect it and, indeed, where organised crime might affect it, but we have not restored the capacity to do what was intended to be done over a decade ago when I made the announcement as minister for justice that a national missing persons unit would be established. So self-evident was that requirement at that time, and yet a decade later we had a woman locked up for 10 months in a federal immigration detention unit but she was recorded in a state system as a missing personâthe linkages were not able to be made.</para>
<para>Those massive cuts occurred whilst Amanda Vanstone was minister for justiceâthey occurred on her watch. That same minister now holds the office of minister for immigration. It is not going too far to say that there must be an appearance of a conflict of interest in Minister Vanstone appointing Mick Palmer to examine circumstances where he was the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police during the period of substantial budget cuts when the National Missing Persons Unit effectively disappeared and to examine her own conductâshe being the minister to whom he was responsible at that time. It is also worth while reflecting in relation to this matter that the inquiry will have to take into account submissions from a wide range of persons who are quite fearful that what they say could lead them to be the subject of the kind of treatment that Cornelia Rau herself experienced. One of the things that have happened through the exposure of these matters is that we have discovered the almost routine cruelties that have been happening in immigration detention.</para>
<para>Any person who wishes to read about those routine cruelties would be well advised to have a look at two articles on the web site magazine called New Matilda: one by Julian Burnside called âHonesty matters: the ethics of daily lifeâ and one called âTalking about Corneliaâ by Jack Smit. They are both in the most recent edition of New Matilda at newmatilda.com. I do not want to go through them at length, but I would commend to any member of this House and anyone listening a careful examination of those articles. We have reacted with horror to the circumstances that Cornelia Rau went throughâan Australian, just like usâbut her experience was repeated many times by other persons, and we did not react with such horror to those cases. Some of the things that have been happening behind those razor wire and electrified fences are akin to the kind of things that we would be critical of if they happened elsewhere in the worldâakin to the kinds of things that we saw at Abu Ghraib on our television screens. That is not to say that everybody in the system is evil; our unwillingness to open our eyes to what is being done in our name is evil.</para>
<para>Finally, I do wish Mick Palmer well, but his is an inquiry that he should not be undertaking. It should be a full, independent judicial inquiry. By that I mean an inquiry with powers to compel witnesses, to swear witnesses and to protect witnesses. None of those powers are available to former Commissioner Palmer. He has been placed by the minister in the invidious position of judging her conduct when she was his minister. That is also inappropriate. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talker>
<para>âI take great pleasure in speaking in support of <inline ref="R2278">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2004-2005</inline>. I particularly want to draw the attention of the House and the audience listening to an item within that appropriation billâthat is, the $65.8 million being assigned to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and to Austrade to enhance the security of Australian diplomatic missions. It is important to put on the record my undying admiration for the work of our foreign affairs officials. They do a remarkable job. I am particularly privileged to be able to work with our consular staff. They are the people who are there when Australians need help overseas. They treat everybody as if they were members of their own family and do an absolutely remarkable job. No praise can be too high for the work the team did during the recent tsunami disaster. Many thousands of Australians were assisted by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials. Congratulations to all that team.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Through that work, I was fortunate enough to represent the department and the minister at, and to lead our Australian delegation to, a recent conference to set up an early warning tsunami system. That conference was held in Phuket in Thailand. I encourage anybody who is listening to think about re-engaging with Thailand. It was quite moving to see some of the images from the tsunami disasterâthey are images I will never forget. At the particular complex where that conference was held, I think the impact of the disaster was one dirty swimming pool, yet occupancy rates were around seven or eight per cent. As we look at how we can support affected countries and help them get back on their feet, we should acknowledge that supporting them to re-establish their livelihoods should be a part of that. So I encourage anybody thinking of travelling to those regions around the Indian Ocean to have a look at the smarttraveller.gov.au web site. You will find some helpful advice there about destinations in those affected countries that would be absolutely delighted to receive Australian visitors. I encourage anybody considering travelling overseas to remember that there is one âmust seeâ destination, and that is the www.smarttraveller.gov.au web site.</para>
<para>The link between Thailand and my next subject tonight is that I am speaking in favourâas I often find myself doingâof species that have no voice of their own. Often I speak in favour of people in communities who feel their needs are not being addressed. In this case I want to speak in favour of some elephants. You might be aware, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker Baldwin, that there is currently a proposition before the Commonwealth government through the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to approve the introduction of a number of elephants to a consortium of zoos. These elephants are from Thailand, and frankly they are captive-born elephants that have no productive use in the tourist industry where they were raised. The aspect that I am particularly interested in is the proposal for the Melbourne Zoo to supplement its world-class elephant exhibit with three captive-born female domestic elephants to create a natural social group for Bong Su and Mek Kapah, the two elephants at Melbourne Zoo. Many people are fond of these two elephants. They have been a key feature of the zoo.</para>
<para>Let me say at the outset that I see no conservation value in not granting this approval. What we are talking about here, in the case of Melbourne Zoo and the partnering zoos it is involved with, are world-class zoos. Melbourne Zoo has demonstrated a capacity to educate and inspire, introducing a million visitors a year to the delights of wildlife. A very big part of that has been the Trail of the Elephants, an award winning initiative at the zoo. The idea here is to take from work camps in Thailand three captive-born female Asian elephants and, in a consortium with Taronga and Auckland zoos, to bring them to a satisfactory environment where an understanding of elephant behaviour can be advanced, furthering the wonderful engagement people can have with these species in environments that are world class and, in the case of the Melbourne Zoo, building on a very constructive mutually supportive relationship not only amongst the zoological community but also amongst those who have the responsibility of caring for domestic and wild elephants in communities such as Thailand.</para>
<para>A number of other nations that have wild elephant populations are learning about elephant behaviour and about supporting and more or less ensuring the gene pool. In this case, they are able to engage with captive-born elephants that are no longer required in industry and to explore this trail of elephants, which has a whole range of habitat styles and topography that the elephants will find delightful. I think this is a terrific idea, and I am encouraged by the work that the zoo has put into making sure that its plans are understood, that the community is engaged and that the statutory authority that oversees the zoo is open and transparent. Through world-class leading edge management of elephants in captivity, the zoo is looking towards the interests of elephants that are part of the zoological population, but it is also demonstrating a preparedness to support conservation generally by sharing the insights that are gained by building up the constituency, if I could say so, for elephants more generally. Recently during a visit to southern Africa I saw elephants in the wild, which was magnificent, but not all elephants are in the wild. Some are in captivity, and some are in managed environments that are far from wild. If we can gain more insights into how to properly care for these magnificent creatures, I think that will be a step in the right direction.</para>
<para>So I urge the Minister for the Environment and Heritage to grant this conditional approval. I think it would be entirely appropriate to continue the transparent arrangement for the management of the elephants, the external public scrutiny and the shared goals of not only carrying forward best practice in zoological care and management of elephants but also the transfer of knowledge and know-how to those with that difficult and, frankly, internationally significant task of making sure the elephant population in the wild is sustained and properly managed. It is probably a bit of a stretch from travels to Thailand but it does highlight the fact that important work is going on between our two nations, not only at a trade and diplomatic level but also in a very practical sense.</para>
<para>Moving on, the House would be aware that âOur Dunkley Destinyâ is something that I work towards during each electoral term. In âOur Dunkley Destinyâ, we set out a community plan for the things we hope to pursue in partnership with the local community. I would just like to touch on a few of the initiatives in that today.</para>
<para>Some have heard me talk about the Solar Cities initiative and how absolutely tickled pink I am that the Howard government has had the vision to put in place a $75 million plan to develop solar city trials in typical urban, commercial and industrial settings. I think that is important because so much of the new technology needs to be demonstrated so that others have the confidence to embrace it and apply it in their own environments. In the early stages Adelaide and Sydney were identified as potential locations for such trials, and that makes some sense if you look at both the huge summer peaks in energy demand and their climates, which I would characterise as solar friendly. But I think one leg of the stool is missing, and that is a need to road test photovoltaic cell solar technology in more temperate conditions. We need a southern solar cityâand you would be surprised to learn that I am advocating the greater Frankston-Mornington Peninsula area. With its long-held commitment to a more sustainable way of living, of production and of community engagement, I think it provides an ideal setting for a southern solar city.</para>
<para>Our energy profiles in Victoria, particularly around Greater Melbourne, are starting to look not very dissimilar from those you see in Adelaide and Sydney, where in the peak of summer and in the height of the heat during the day, the demands created by airconditioning and climate control systems add to the commercial and industrial demands on the networkâand also the demands of residential properties. In our environment there is a range of residential and commercial opportunitiesânew and established in both cases. We have a whole range of housing prospects, we have heavy industry, and we have public and community service uses that I think provide an appropriate setting for a showcase of photovoltaic energy production in a more temperate climate.</para>
<para>I was delighted that the federal environment minister was able to meet with me and a number of local government representatives to canvass interest in this idea. There are stakeholders that are ready to engage in such a proposal, and energy retailers have indicated an interest as well. If the purposeâas it isâof the Solar Cities program is to road test the photovoltaic technology, it would be wise to road test it in a range of climates. Let us road test it in a more temperate environment like Melbourne, where there is an appetite for sustainability and where the Mornington Peninsula-greater Frankston area, through Cities for Climate Protection, has shown that when these things are on, our community turns up.</para>
<para>So, again, I would encourage the minister for the environment to consider that. I have spoken with him about it. I know the discussion paper is in its latter stages of consultation and refinement, and I would strongly urge him to embrace the case for a southern solar city pilot. I can assure you that he could do little better than engage the communities of the city of Frankston and the Mornington Peninsula in road testing that technology in a temperate environment. There is a delicious environment and a world of possibilities down in the Mornington Peninsula-greater Frankston area.</para>
<para>It is nice to see that the Howard governmentâs ongoing commitment to enhancing health services is already starting to pay dividends. There are some encouraging signs coming through in the most recent published report on bulk-billing statistics, but there is also an acknowledgment that we need to do more to attract doctors to outer metropolitan areas, where there are growing demands, the case loads and workloads that doctors and local hospitals need to service are increasingly complex and there is a need to make sure that tools are available.</para>
<para>You might recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I was almost evangelical about the need for an MRI machine to service our community, which has a large veteran population. Many people forget that the Mornington Peninsula is mighty long if you are down in the south and need to head up to the Monash Medical Centre or Dandenong, which were previously the only locations for a Medicare funded MRI machine. That was very difficult for some people in our community, and I am delighted, absolutely chuffed and, frankly, relieved that we have finally managed, after years of work, to have MRI service providers sharpen their pencils and respond to the opportunity made possible by the Howard government through a further extension of Medicare Benefits Schedule funded MRI units. The government increased them from 18 to 77 initially, and now there is a further group of 21 Medicare funded MRI units, including one co-located at the Frankston community hospital.</para>
<para>Frankston Hospital has had an MRI unit for some time. It has been readily available for in-patient analysis, and the work it has done has included scans of soft tissue, particularly for brain issues and spinal and musculoskeletal conditions. While it has been readily available for in-patient customers, outpatient customers have had to pay. They got world-class service, but for some the access to that diagnostic technology was just not affordable. Now, thankfully, as a result of the Howard government and years of advocacy by many of us in our community, there is a Medicare funded MRI serviceâan affordable, accessible, world-class health diagnostic technologyâat the Frankston Hospital, which is a further sign that the Howard government is engaged with the needs of outer metropolitan communities.</para>
<para>That leads to an issue we have often talked about, Mr Deputy Speakerâthat is, aged care in our communities. Our communities act as magnets. They draw people to them, not only because new families wish to start their lives in our communities and then ageing parents are drawn to those families, but also because of the quality of life our communities offer. On top of catching up from the shortfall in places left to us by the former Labor government, we have had to expand service availability. I am pleased to inform the House that not only have some of the EACH packagesâenhanced aged care in the home packagesâbeen announced for the Dunkley community and our region generally but, thankfully, through the recent aged care approval rounds the Baptist Village Baxter now has the beds to reopen a previously closed facility.</para>
<para>That facility was closed whilst that forward-looking organisation built a brand new facility that met the higher standards that ensure there is dignity and proper care for residents. So there was no loss of beds there, just a new facility constructed to meet those higher standards and a vacant older facility, albeit one needing further renovation. Thankfully there has been a bed allocation to support the reutilisation of that facility, as well as further services in the Mount Eliza area, an area that has quite a significant ageing population but does not have ready access to federally subsidised aged care. So that is positive news. A further encouraging step was the support for the relocation of the Regis Sheraton, an aged care facility landlocked in Frankston. That is moving to the former Karingal High School site. Supporting the redevelopment of that important facility, there is a further allocation of beds through the most recent aged care round, so that is all encouraging stuff.</para>
<para>You may recall that on a number of occasions in the House I have raised the issue of substance abuse, particularly the range of initiatives that are part of the Dunkley drugs plan. We have seen an expansion in available services. We have seen street trialling of retractable syringes, and it is interesting to track how that is proceeding. We have had mixed accounts of whether the technology is up to the task, but it is still an important initiative. We have had expanded treatment services to tackle drug harm through PenDAP, and some of the community health services have been involved. We have also seen work done with young people, trying to identify better options for their future, showing them that there are some other prospects for a better life and that illicit drug or substance abuse is not the way to live, work or play. So that has been going on.</para>
<para>Something that sat behind that was a need to do a stocktake of the services and facilities available in our community. There is, in particular, a crying need for a readily accessible, residential detoxification, rehabilitation and healing facility. It should not be like winning lotto to get that help. We know that a substance abuser needs to be ready to try new pathways and to engage in the difficult task of making better life choices but, if they make such a choice, whether or not support is available should not be a raffle. I have long argued the need for such a facility to service our region. There are far more beds available in your home state of New South Wales, Mr Deputy Speaker, than there are in Victoria, and I am not sure why that is the case. I am certainly not happy for it to stay that way.</para>
<para>I persuaded the former health minister to allocate some funds to do such an analysis of the services available in the Mornington Peninsula-greater Frankston region, and I am delighted to advise the House that just last week I launched the Dunkley needs analysis final report by the Turning Point Alcohol and Drug Centre. They did an absolutely first-class job of analysing the range of services available to our community, engaging substance users and abusers to find out their perspectives. They gave a big tick to current service providers for their empathetic and helpful approach, but they identified a big, glaring gap. That gap is the one that we intuitively knew would be there: that is, the lack of a residential facility. We know that once they are in a program we have a sense within the first six to eight weeks of whether someone is likely to choose better life pathways than the pathways of substance abuse. My proposition is that we should partner with established organisations like Odyssey to put in place a short-term program that targets that six- to eight-week window. We know at that point whether an outcome is likelyâwhether the person is committed and whether the environment is supportive of better life choices for illicit drug users and substance abusers.</para>
<para>As a community, we need to make sure that those services are available when they are needed and that support is available for those that care or despair for substance abusers and illicit drug usersâso that the users can identify for themselves positive and lasting life pathways and the families that hope for a better tomorrow can support them in getting their lives back on track. This report makes the recommendation that what we intuitively knew to be true now needs to be followed up by action. I commend the agencies in the greater Frankston-Mornington Peninsula area for their care and their interest. We have now a well-researched pathway to chase further resources to make sure that those people able to make a transition into better life choices can find a new, positive and constructive path in life and that the help is there to support them.</para>
<para>In the few minutes I have to close, I want to pay tribute to the people who are doing work in another area of innovation in our community. Frankston City Council has done a remarkable job trying to pull together the best available research and community attitudes on gambling. You will recall that the Prime Minister, quite rightly, back in 1999 said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The challenge ... is to find a response which balances the undoubted right of individual Australians to gamble if they wish with the ongoing responsibility of governments for overall community welfare.</para>

<para>âThe <inline font-style="italic">Sunshine Coast Daily</inline> on 4 March 2005 ran an article with the front page headline âHeartless! MPâs cruel snipe at cancer victimsâ. This was a hurtful, dishonest and scurrilous personal attack on me and my commitment to the chronically ill. For three weeks their journalist pestered me to talk about the problems of a constituent who had bowel cancer and her failure to obtain a disability support pensionâshe received Newstart allowance instead during her treatment. My response was that I do not talk about individuals who come to me with problems, for reasons of privacy. I stated that Australia is generous in income support for those out of work and quoted the figures of $364 per fortnight base rate and $1,227 per fortnight for a couple with three children. I did not refer to cancer sufferers. The journalist cherry picked words from different sentences, designing things deliberately in order to mislead readers and make me look uncaring to people with cancer, including my constituent. Everyone in this parliament knows that I am not an uncaring person.</para>

<para>The second occasion of shabby reporting by the <inline font-style="italic">Sunshine Coast Daily</inline> which occurred last week was on Tuesday, 1 March, in an article on interest rates. The previous day, in my capacity as a member of the House Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration, I gave an interview on interest rates to a journalist from the <inline font-style="italic">Sunshine Coast Daily</inline>. Words in the article that appeared on 1 March were attributed to me in quotes. They were words I never spoke. My office informed the editor of the error and I am still waiting for a published apology. I therefore question the editorâs agenda.</para>

<para>âI want to use tonightâs debate on the <inline ref="R2279">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2004-2005</inline> and cognate bills to deal with two issues. First, I want to deal with a local issue, an issue important in my community: the unnecessary, wasteful and frustrating duplication of planning processes here in the ACT. Second, I want to rebut some allegations that the Deputy Prime Minister has repeatedâmisleading assertions he has made concerning my views and my activities in the past concerning the use of ethanol in petrol.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Let me turn first to the question of the planning processes here in Canberra. In 1988, as a newly elected senator for the ACT, I was heavily involved in negotiations and in helping the various responsible ministers to put together a comprehensive package to smooth the transition to self-government for the ACT. This was a difficult time. There were many views on how self-government should proceed, and lots of compromises had to be made. The people of the ACT had made it plain that many of them did not want self-government at all. Furthermore, given that Canberra is the nationâs capital, there were legitimate concerns among members from other states and territories about safeguarding the capital for the future from the possible excesses of self-government. That was 17 years ago. Self-government is no longer an experiment or a risk but an accepted fact. The legislative assembly has grown up and the territoryâs government has matured. We now have our first elected majority government. I am very pleased to say that it is a Labor majority government. It does show a maturity of attitude towards the constituents here in Canberra concerning their ACT self-governing assembly.</para>
<para>It is time to re-examine the safeguards that were thought necessary before the introduction of self-government. I think it is time to consider absolutely getting rid of some of them. In particular, I want to call for an overhaul of the unnecessary duplication of planning requirements in the ACT. The National Capital Authority was proclaimed by the government of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1989, the same year that the Australian Capital Territory was established as a self-governing and separate legal entity. I want to make it clear in my remarks that, while in the past I have been a pretty strong critic of the National Capital Authority, I am not tonight criticising them. They have been discharging the law and their requirements under the law. My concern is that the law under which they operate should be changed. I have criticised them sometimes in the past, but my comments tonight are not, and should not be seen as, a criticism of that authority.</para>
<para>The purpose of the National Capital Authority was, and still is, to manage the Commonwealthâs continuing interest in the planning and development of Canberra as the national capital. Therefore, planning in the ACT is guided by the Commonwealth through the National Capital Plan and the National Capital Authority as well as by the ACT government and its ACT Planning and Land Authority. The National Capital Plan provides a general policy framework for land use and planning in the ACT and, more specifically, guides the planning of areas of the ACT that have been identified as having national capital importance. As a consequence, any significant departure from the National Capital Plan requires the Commonwealthâs agreement. Matters of national significance, as identified in the National Capital Plan, include securing Walter Burley Griffinâs planning agenda, maintaining the hierarchy of centres, maintaining the rural and open space setting, providing intertown public transport and maintaining high-quality entry points.</para>
<para>There are more matters, but I think people get the idea of how comprehensive it begins to be. The territory plan, which is the key statutory planning document in the ACT, must not be inconsistent with the National Capital Plan. The purpose of the territory plan is to manage land use change and development in a manner consistent with the strategic direction set by the ACT government, the ACT Legislative Assembly and the ACT community.</para>
<para>The National Capital Plan and the territory plan are compatible and seem to have similar objectives. Tonight I want to ask whether the territory really needs to have the NCA watching over its shoulder. Everyone in Canberra and everyone in Australia recognises the necessity of national involvement in the planning of the national capital. We have some benefits and some costs in being the national capital, but we are proud of it; we recognise that there is a national interest, not just a local interest. But I question whether the extent of involvement necessary to win support for self-government is still necessary today in Canberraâs planning.</para>
<para>Through the National Capital Plan, the National Capital Authority has almost unlimited capacity to interfere in planning matters in the ACT. I can offer many examples of interference in the 17 years since self-government. Let me just refer to a few of the more recent ones.</para>
<para>After the devastating bushfires of January 2003, the ACT government sought to establish new rural villages on the burnt out sites of Uriarra and Pierces Creek. These are not in my electorate; they are in the electorate of my colleague the member for Canberra. The ACT government was told that the National Capital Authority was not happy. I understand that a compromise has now been reached on the future development of a rural village at Uriarra, but Pierces Creek is still under discussion. The NCA is apparently saying that any settlement must be limited to what was there before; the ACT government is saying that, for very good social and economic reasons, the settlement must be bigger. It is not my area, and I am not an expert in who is right and who is wrong, although, on the face of it, the ACT governmentâs argument seems compelling. My question is this: what on earth has this got to do with the national capital aspects of Canberra?</para>
<para>Of course, the planning here in the triangle and the planning for the War Memorial and that area must be a national responsibility. This area belongs to all Australians; it just happens to be in Canberra. But what has the preservation of the legitimate national interest in the national capital got to do with the Commonwealth government interfering in how Uriarra and Pierces Creek should be redeveloped? What has it got to do with the national capital aspects of Canberra, in any reasonable definition?</para>
<para>Let me give another example. All of Canberraâs main avenues are what is called designated landâthat is, land over which the Commonwealth says, âWe have a planning interest,â even though it is territory land managed by the ACT. Therefore, as I am advised, the territory has to seek works approvals from the National Capital Authority before it can even remove an unsafe tree. Let me give another example. The proposed redevelopment of the existing link building between the Canberra Theatre and the Playhouse has had to involve extensive design modifications in order to secure National Capital Authority approval. What has that got to do with the national interest in preserving the national capital aspects of Canberraâthose things which we acknowledge are a proper national responsibility?</para>
<para>Similarly, and controversially, the NCA overturned the decision of the ACT government to construct Gungahlin Drive on its preferred western route. The road had been a big issue in an election here. The Canberra people had made it clear that they preferred the western route. In recent times here in the parliament, we have had a lot of speeches about how we should be impressed by and respect the outcome of elections. Certainly no-one respected the outcome of that one. The decision by the National Capital Authority has led to significant delays, increased costs and a series of court cases. Until the outcome of the latest appeal is known, the ACT government cannot proceed with every aspect of building the road. The benefit of the road is being denied to thousands of Gungahlin residents, constituents of mine, who have been treated worse than people in any other town centre development in Canberra. I am going to speak up for those people: this planning has been unfair to those people.</para>
<para>I could refer to many other matters, but just for the moment let me leave it at those and move on to other aspects of my concern and how I think we might move forward with regard to this matter. The list goes on and on. While I am highlighting the role of the NCA in these situations, I repeat that I am not seeking to apportion blame. I have been a critic of the NCA in the past, but not this time. They are just doing what they are required by the law to do. I sometimes agree with their decisions; I sometimes do not. But my concern here is not with their decision; it is with the law under which they are operating. The examples that I have given merely highlight the fact that what seemed appropriate planning structures at the birth of self-government can now be seen as inappropriate and patronising.</para>
<para>Canberra is the nationâs capital, so there is a role for the Commonwealth in the main area of national significance, the Parliamentary Triangle, and, for example, the area down to the War Memorial. I do not think anyone would dispute that. However, to many Canberra residents it seems to be absurd to extend the role of the Commonwealth, through the NCA, to issues such as the number of houses to be built in a rural settlement on the edge of the ACT. Extending the role of the Commonwealth, through the NCA, to the determination of the direction of a road between two town centres which pass nowhere near any of the major national capital interestsâthe parliament, the National Library, the Gallery, the War Memorial and so onâwould be totally unacceptable if it were to occur in any other city.</para>
<para>We accept that special planning issues are involved in being the national capital. That is necessary. Whether we are talking about Washington, Ottawa or Pretoria, there is national interest in what happens in national capitals, and planning issues are consequently affected. Yes, the Commonwealth should take responsibility for Parliament House, the National Gallery, the High Court, the National Library and the surrounding areas, but surely the territory has now come of age and can safely be left to look after the rest of Canberra.</para>
<para>In 2004, the National Capital Authority published <inline font-style="italic">The Griffin Legacy</inline>. The NCA claims that Canberra has not realised its full potential. It says that it is time to address the future and it has prepared a strategy to âunlock the potential of Canberraâs Central National Area, its landscape setting and approachesâ. My view is that the NCA should be concentrating on that central national area. We will have a bit of a disagreement in the end about what constitutes the central national area, but I do not want to go to that today. For the moment, I am quite prepared to accept that what was originally designated as national land should constitute the legitimate responsibility of the Commonwealth in planning, and that should be it. The Commonwealth should concentrate on that central national area, leaving the rest of Canberra to the territory to manage.</para>
<para>One possible response to this ridiculous duplication is to call for some sort of inquiry or review. That is what we always doâwe say, âHere is a problem; let us have an inquiry.â But we do not actually need that. The Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories has already made recommendations on this issue. I was not on that committee when it looked at these matters but I have had a look at its report and its recommendations. The committee recommended:</para>
<motion>
<para class="block">That the National Capital Plan be amended so that designated area status is lifted from all territory land with the exception of the Deakin/Forrest residential area, the inner hills and the main avenues and approach routes; and that in assuming planning responsibility for the areas to be uplifted, the territory government uphold the principles articulated in the National Capital Plan.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">It is not that I disagree with that recommendationâI just want to go further. That recommendation should be the bare minimum. That is the very least that should happen and it should happen today. But, if it cannot, I think we should go further.</para>
<para>The National Capital Authority deals with two distinct areas: national land and designated land. National land is what we all think of as the heart of the national capitalâParliament House, the War Memorial and so on, including Lake Burley Griffin. Designated land is all that other land that people in 1989 feared might be subject to development which could impair the national capital characteristics of Canberraâthe entry roads, and so on. There is no need for there to be national involvement in the planning of these areas anymore. We still wait for the Howard governmentâs response to the recommendations of the joint committee, including the recommendation I spoke of before. At the very least, it should endorse the committeeâs bipartisan recommendations to lift designated area status from all territory land with the exception of Deakin, Forrest, the inner hills and the main avenues and approach routes. But I think we should go further. We should scrap designated land altogether and restrict the federal government involvement in Canberraâs planning to the essential central areas of national land.</para>
<para>That was the key issue I wanted to refer to tonight. It is very important for my constituents and it has had serious adverse consequences for the constituents in Gungahlin particularly. From time to time, it can impose difficulties on businesses trying to get planning approval, but, most particularly, it is an ongoing concern in terms of inefficiency and interference in the development of Canberra in places like Uriarra and Pierces Creek.</para>
<para>I want to use most of the few minutes remaining to me to rebut a regular assertion that has been made on and off for a couple of years by the Deputy Prime Minister about my attitude to ethanol. I have stood up in this place and rebutted it before. It is true that I campaigned against some activities of the Howard government in relation to ethanol, but I never at any stage questioned the legitimacy of ethanol as a product. Accusations have been made that in some way in the campaign in which I was involvedâand from which I do not resileâwe sought to damage the legitimate role of ethanol in the fuel mix in the modern fuel policy of 21st century Australia. I have before and I will again absolutely repudiate that allegation. After all, what was the policy I was campaigning for? I campaigned for the fact that the government should put a 10 per cent limit on the amount of ethanol in petrol. What is the Howard governmentâs policy? It is a 10 per cent limit on ethanolâit just took a long time to get there.</para>
<para>It is quite clear that, in the face of recommendations from every expert committee that was set up, and, in the knowledge that the failure to set that limit was putting warranties of motorists, boat owners and others at risk, the government delayed acting. The evidence is clear that the Prime Minister intruded directly to prevent the government acting because he had some discussions with major donors to the Liberal Party. The government thought that it was shocking when I said that it should put a 10 per cent limit on ethanol and that there were risks associated with not doing it. I highlighted those risks and the government attacked me. Then it adopted the policy. The reputation of ethanol has been substantially damagedânot by me but by greed. It has been damaged by the greed of those who sought to put a percentage of ethanol in petrol that was beyond the recommended limits. They did that because they thought they could make more money out of that process and in the short term they were correct. I do not refer to individual retailers, many of whom acted absolutely in good faith and with propriety in this matter.</para>
<para>But there is no doubt the reputation of ethanol has been affected, and so have the very legitimate attempts by companies to introduce E10 products. Every time I have spoken on this matter I have said that E10 is a legitimate product and that if it could be successful in the marketplace it had a legitimate role in the spectrum of fuel supplies in this country. I said it again and again. On 11 December 2002 I said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Ethanol is a perfectly legitimate product in petrol at reasonable limits. Everybody but the manufacturers say the limit should be 10 per cent, but the Prime Minister refuses to allow his ministers to act because it seems, on all the evidence, there is no explanation except he is protecting his mates at the expense of Australian motorists.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That was an unequivocal indication that ethanol is a perfectly legitimate product. As this controversy rolled on, on October 2002 I said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I am not anti-ethanol. There is a case for some ethanol in petrol and if people are advised and they choose to put it in, as is happening in some other parts of Australia, I have no problem with that at all. The problem is, people donât know what they are buying.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It was a straight consumer affairs issue and the government refused to act. For years they refused to allow consumers to be advised. It was, in effect, a fuel substitution scandal. The government were aware of it for two years and they continued to refuse to act. They knew that warranties could be voided. They were advised back in 2000 by expert committees and agencies that they should act to set a 10 per cent limit on the amount of ethanol. The Prime Minister, I was advised, personally intervened on at least two occasions to make sure that the government took years to act. That is why the reputation of ethanol was damaged. It was not because of anything I did but because I exposed what the government did.</para>
<para>These appropriation bills come before us at a time when the national economy confronts the prospect of increasing interest rates, increasing inflationary pressures and the possibility that unemployment will begin to rise as the economy slows. The government has received a bonanza from the boost to our terms of trade and, instead of investing it, they have squandered it. Therefore I support the amendment moved by the member for Lilley. In so doing I hope that the government will heed the remarks I have made on the two issues I have focused on this evening and stop misrepresenting the history of the ethanol issue on the one hand and, importantly for the constituents of my electorate of Fraser and the adjoining electorate of Canberra, address the duplication of planning here in Canberra as soon as possible.</para>

<para>âI am pleased to be speaking on the <inline ref="R2279">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2004-2005</inline>, the <inline ref="R2278">Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2004-2005</inline> and the <inline ref="R2277">Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 2004-2005</inline>. It is obvious that many of the previous speakers have spoken on issues near and dear to them and have explored a vast range of interests and concerns. This is a very good thing for parliamentary debate and parliamentary democracy. I should state from the outset my support for the three bills currently being debated. These bills highlight once again the continuing sound management of the economy under the Howard government, the sort of economic management that has delivered 3.7 per cent unemployment in my electorate of Indi.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In this vein, I want to explore a few issues of interest currently being played out in the community. The word âaccountabilityâ has become a catchcry of political campaigning in recent yearsââtransparencyâ and âopennessâ are others. You often hear these slogans bandied about, particularly during a state election campaign. When the Bracks government rode to office on the back of catchcries of openness and accountability, it made the hysterical reaction from premier Bracks and Treasurer Brumby following the federal Treasurerâs recent suggestion that state governments be accountable when they collectively spend $35 billion from the proceeds of the GST all the more breathtaking for its utter hypocrisy. We have seen a lot from the state premiers in recent times. They went from adoring cheerleaders of former Labor leader Mark Latham to the ones who ultimately made his leadership terminal in January this year. With friends like the ALP premiers, who needs enemies in politics? Shaun Carney captured this disturbing trend rather eloquently. In an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> he wrote:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The elevation of the state leaders as some sort of council of wise elders cum Greek chorus who see it as part of their remit not only to provide running commentary on federal Laborâs travails but to go about trying to pick and choose the federal leader is an alarming development.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Quite so. Of course, these are the state premiersâincluding Mr Bracksâwho believe the decision to plonk tolls on the Scoresby Freeway had no consequence for the federal outcome. Mr Bracks was at pains to say the big swings to the government in the Scoresby corridor had nothing to do with a state issue influencing a federal outcome. If that is the case, the Victorian Premier should butt out and refrain from commentating on the federal scene.</para>
<para>Heaven knows there is enough on the Victorian governmentâs plate. Maybe the fact that not one major project has come to fruition under the Bracks government should have the alarm bells ringing. One could say the wheels are falling off, but they were never on in the first place. Awash with revenue, mainly thanks to the proceeds of the GSTâwhich will give Victoria a $285 million windfall this year and will continue to riseâthe Bracks government also callously fleeces Victorian landholders and businesses with their land tax regime, which in recent times has simply put many Victorian operations out of business. As a child who was raised in a small business, and who reaped the benefits of understanding enterprise and hard work through that direct experience, it is a very sad time and I am very distressed by this particular development.</para>
<para>Readers of yesterdayâs <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Age</inline> would have seen the plight of the Metung Hotel, whose land tax bill has ballooned from $4,000 five years ago to $80,925 for 2005-06. To put this in perspective, it was pointed out that if the price of a pot of beer at the pub had risen by the same amount as the land tax on the pub, we would now be paying $50 for a pot of beer. The state government announced a cut from five per cent to three per cent over five years, but this is too little too late for the Metung Hotelâand for the Whitehorse Inn, for that matter, which recently announced that it was closing its doors. Its publican, Jim Ryan, said that the land tax bill had risen from $1,440 in 1998 to almost $40,000 this year. The state government will receive more than $1 billion dollars from the proceeds of land tax this financial year alone.</para>
<para>What sense are we to make of the ceaseless cries for help from the state premiers and treasurers when they are awash with revenue? With these figures in mind, surely even an unaligned observer can see that the state administrators crying poor every time something goes wrong in their respective bureaucracies and claiming that the Commonwealth does not give them enough money is just a cheap stunt and a bit rich to take. They continually underfund health services, their dental health programs are an absolute joke and investment in education is nowhere near the levels that the Commonwealth has increased its funding by in this area. We know today that the states, for all their talk about vocational education, have not increased their funding to the sector nearly as much as that of the Commonwealth, which increased overall vocational education and training funding by 35 per cent between 1997 and 2003.</para>
<para>Australians are an aspirational people: families strive to do the best by their children and by world standards we are not riven with class envy. We live in relative comfort, which is essentially the human dividend of the actions of a government that keeps the economy strong, people in work and interest rates low. We do not go as far as the Marxists and falsely claim that just because the economic side of the equation is looked after everything else is okayâlife and the Australian community are far more complex than this.</para>
<para>The recent riots in Macquarie Fields have been particularly unedifying spectacles. They were closely followed by riots last weekend in the foothills of Perth, again in Sydney and further violent criminal attacks in Melbourneâone in particular on a taxi driver who was bashed to escape a $40 fare. It is not only the wave of criminal activity of late in the public housing heartland that is cause for concern; there is still a cloud of fear hanging over the community after Victoriaâs gangland murders. This particular underworld war has claimed up to 30 lives. This oppressive wave of organised violence bears all the hallmarks of unrestrained anarchyâthe law of the jungle; people shot in front of their children, and diners at an Italian restaurant in Carlton dodging bullets.</para>
<para>This terrible blotch on Melbourne is an untypical lapseâsome type of subcultural civil war that we can well do without. So it was of great concern that one of the underworld kingpins of this whole sorry saga, Mario Condello, was released last Friday on $700,000 bail and walked into well-paid employment. Victorian Deputy Chief Magistrate, Jelena Popovicâherself no stranger to controversyâpractises a particular form of âtherapeutic jurisprudenceâ. She has openly admitted that her ruling âwill not be a popular decisionâ and that âpolice will not be happy about itâ. The reality is that there have been no further gangland murders in Victoria since the so-called kingpins and bosses of the underworld have been behind bars. Why should we put this recent calm at risk? Is it any wonder people lament the impotence of the courts and the rule of law when this type of ruling is handed down? Where will it all end?</para>
<para>Action is required from state legislators so that the people of Victoria can truly rely upon them. They cannot be silent procrastinators; they must actually implement a tougher approach on these issues and look at and assess the issue of appropriate judicial appointment. This is the only way forward to achieve a sustainable and workable society and some sort of mechanism to deal with deeply entrenched organised crime. Legislators in Victoria cannot expect the community to trust them and to trust them in dispensing the power that is at their fingertips if organised crime is not confronted be it in Carlton, Brunswickâor Macquarie Fields. The judiciary must also remember that they are there not only to implement and interpret the law but also to use as their guide current community standards.</para>
<para>Melbourne historians remember the 1929 police strikes in inner-city Melbourne, when shops were looted from Collins Street right through to North Melbourne because there were no police officers on duty to enforce the law. The problems that have besieged public housing estates like Macquarie Fields are not lack of police and initial attack but the growing social disintegration in these communitiesâsurely a manifestation of community fragmentation such as that which occurred in Los Angeles in the early 1990s. The community is now paying for the misguided paternalistic experiments of the 1960s and 1970s in high-density public housing and a too-heavy reliance on paternalistic bureaucracies and the welfare system. How did relations between the community and the upholders of the law come to be so strained?</para>
<para>This week, I am told, my electorate office has received calls suggesting that a return to national service might be the way to go. There are many ideas out there in the community because there is quite serious and severe concern. Whatever the actual solution is, a return to values and discipline and a greater reliance on and advocacy of personal responsibility would I think be integral parts of the solution. The social experiments of previous decades have produced some very poisonous fruit: homeless children on the streets, access to recreational and illicit drugs, and an increasing rate of family breakdown and street violence.</para>
<para>It was quite interesting to listen to some comments that the NSW Premier made today when he suggested that a lack of values taught at home was the genesis of the rise in lawlessness. He may very well have a good point. Occasionally the New South Wales Premier does come out with some very interesting observations. Whatever the case, there is only so much that governments can do to legislate for behaviour and family relationships. But there is much they can do, particularly at the state level, because in so many ways state governments are at the coalface of so many important institutions.</para>
<para>This is a great nation and we are truly privilegedâsome of us to have been born here; some of us to have had the good fortune and luck to have been granted permission to come here. We were truly at the top of the tree once upon a time both in terms of the economy and social standards. Unfortunately, with regard to our social relationships, something is falling apart. If we do not as governments particularly focus on these issues, the problems will increase exponentially. It is time for state governments to stop crying poor and to use some of the billions of dollars they have received in windfalls to implement visionary plans to ensure that our social relationships and our communities right across this country do not continue to disintegrate.</para>

<para>âI want to speak this evening about the indefinite detention of people in asylum throughout this country in detention centres and particularly the effects on their mental health. Figures from DIMIA and the International Organisation for Migration as at February show that 198 of the 927 in detention have been there for longer than three years. A lot of them have been incarcerated for longer than this, but we cannot get precise statistics from the government so it is impossible to determine how long each person has actually been held. Nonetheless, there are a few very well publicised cases of people being held for much longer than this and without judicial review.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Of the 927 people in detention facilities as at 2 February this year, 222 were in the now notorious Baxter Detention Centre. One of those detained on that day was Cornelia Rau, a permanent Australian resident and one of the three women there described as being of âotherâ nationality. Although her detention for 10 months is now a matter of public notoriety, it is perhaps less well appreciated that her detention was almost certainly illegal. Some lawyers believe there are grounds for questioning the legality of both her initial and her continuing detention under the Migration Act. Perhaps that is why the government has been so nervous about apologising in her case. If she successfully sought damages for wrongful detention, she would, at the rates that applied in another caseâthe Goldie caseâbe entitled to a minimum of $1.5 million. Heâthat is, Goldieâand others have been compensated at the rate of $5,000 a day for wrongful detention. And, in her case, that is not counting the damages for failure of duty of care, which clearly applied in this case.</para>
<para>Perhaps the possibility of future claims for damage actually explains the extraordinary argument put by the federal government earlier this month in the Ruddock &amp; Ors v Taylor case before the High Court, that even Australian citizens could be kept in detention indefinitely on suspicion of being unlawful. The Commonwealth Solicitor-General argued:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It is not contrary to the Constitution that an Australian citizen is detained while it is determined whether the person is an alien or not.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It is simply incidental to the necessary determination in order to enforce the existence of the constitutional power against people to whom it does extend.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">If the Commonwealthâs argument is correct, convoluted though it sounds, anybody could be detained indefinitely until they could prove their citizenship or legal right to remain in Australia. Are we seeing the grounds prepared for identity cards?</para>
<para>Contrary to popular opinion, the majority of those who are still in onshore immigration detention and who arrived by boat without papers are not asylum seekers who are awaiting decisions, but rejected applicants who are awaiting removal, and amongst those are Palestinians, Afghanis and Iranians. In the case of many of the Palestinians, the Israeli government has refused to allow them to go to Israel or to the Occupied Territories. In these circumstances, the Federal Court initially ordered the release of some of those who had no prospect of immediate returnâin fact, who had been refusedâbut the High Court ruled in October 2004 that this indefinite detention was lawful. Among the 75 Iranians still held, many face discrimination and persecution if returnedâa reality the Australian government has so far refused to admit, despite the mounting evidence.</para>
<para>The so-called memorandum of understanding with Iran was supposed to provide, in the words of one bureaucrat, a âcredible threatâ of involuntary return to those Iranians who are here. Threat, it was hoped, would induce them to request âvoluntaryâ return. The government has persistently refused to make public the contents of that memorandum of understanding with a nation described by the Prime Minister, indeed, as part of the axis of evil. So we do not know the content of that agreement. The government has told the Senate and said, in answer to one of my questions, simply that it was ânot in the public interestâ to make the document public.</para>
<para>The government has also consistently refused to provide any guarantees for the safety of those that it would deportâand, in some cases, have deportedâto Iran and will not monitor their safety on return either. This is despite the fact that the head of the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, Justice Louis Joinet, has made it clear that, having visited Iran to inspect the human rights situation, he came away with very deep concerns about the nature of Australiaâs agreement with Iraq, particularly the fact that there are no guarantees, as he put it, as to what will happen when they are returned to Iran. He also expressed some scepticismâjustified, I thinkâabout whether the so-called voluntary returns would actually be voluntary. There is no doubt that the government does not regard itself as seriously bound by our international treaty obligations. But even by its standards, this represents a pretty flagrant disregard of our obligations under the refugee convention never to return a refugee to a place where his or her life or liberty is threatenedâand it clearly isâand it is also in breach of the torture convention not to send a person to a place where there is a real prospect of torture.</para>
<para>While the federal government continues to insist that none of the Iranians threatened with forcible deportation are owed protection under Australiaâs migration laws, many of those facing deportation I think realistically fear that, in the very act of providing information for their refugee applications, they have exposed themselves to greater danger. This is especially true for those who are easily identified by their religion, occupation or region, even if their names are withheld. Tom Morton said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The very act of fleeingâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">from Iranâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">takes on a political complexion.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">A lot of people in Iran do not like the idea that some of their citizens escape the regime, and returning them to it places them in grave danger.</para>
<para>Australiaâs detention centres now accommodate many people awaiting removal who have no realistic prospect of being sent to any other country. The government has not even explored third country resettlement options for them either. Instead, it has insisted that, if they have failed their refugee claims, it is safe to return them to their country of origin. It argues that these people are in detention only as long as they choose to be, that they can return âhomeâ at any time. In the meantime, it keeps them in maximum security without public scrutiny, threatens them with deportation, opposes their legal applications and gives them no option but to stay or goâa policy which ignores the impossibility of that âchoiceâ for many of them, particularly those who are stateless and those who are genuinely terrified of retribution. What is more, the experience of long-term detention inevitably damages the judgment of some of the detainees. Mental illness, depression, pride, fear and unreliable or mistrusted information about their home circumstances all contribute to making it very difficult for them to make sensible judgments.</para>
<para>I want to draw attention here tonight to the High Court decision of last year in the cases of Mr al-Kateb and Mr al-Khafagi, which means that, as elected representatives in this parliament, we now have to squarely confront the reality that so-called failed asylum seekers who cannot be deported can, under our Constitution and our laws, be held indefinitely. There is no constitutional remedy. While the decision raised precious little comment from the media, it should have, since it followed a very acrimonious division in the High Court, and it created precedents for a dramatic reduction in the protection of fundamental human rights in Australia. The majority in the case appear to have persuaded themselves of what I think is a very improbable propositionâthat is, that the executive detention of a stateless person indefinitely, and perhaps for life, cannot be regarded as punitive. I find that amazing. Consequently, the court concluded that it could not intervene to order this personâs release, and the decision effectively allows unlimited executive power to deprive individuals of their liberty.</para>
<para>I think most Australians should be terrified of this prospect, especially as we now have the Solicitor-General arguing that it could apply to Australian citizens as well. As La Trobe Law Professor Zifcak has emphasised, in reality, the court determined that a stateless person who has committed no offence against any law of Australia and who has requested deportation following the failure of his application for refugee status could be detained here indefinitely and if necessary for life if no foreign country were willing to receive him. As we know, in some circumstances they have declined to do so.</para>
<para>The court has ruled in another case, Behrooz, that it makes no difference that such detention possibly involves harsh or inhuman treatment of detainees. The House should be made aware that Mr Behrooz has since been taken into protective custody by the Public Advocate of South Australia because his mental state had so deteriorated that he could not remain in immigration detention. He is still gravely ill.</para>
<para>In other judgments, such as Re Woolley, the High Court has confirmed that the immigration act does not provide children with legal or constitutional immunity from mandatory detention. Children are in the same position legally as their parents. They too can be detained indefinitely under legislation passed by this parliament and, again, there is no constitutional remedy.</para>
<para>There is no doubt that Australiaâs incarceration of children breaches many of our obligations under UN conventions to which we are a signatory, such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and in any case, even if we were not a signatory, constitutes a calculated assault on childrenâs human rights. It has been pointed out that the court could not take account of these and other matters, including HREOCâs report on the evidence of systematic abuse of children and the psychological harm inflicted on them. The legislationâlegislation that we passed through this parliamentâin fact makes no distinction between children and adults. As one lawyer put it, the judgment in the al-Kateb case is âuncompromisingly ruthlessâ, and the responsibility for remedy is the parliamentâs. We cannot shift the blame to the High Court.</para>
<para>The people about whom the judgment was made, Abbas al-Khafagi and Ahmed al-Kateb, and others like them, have nowhere else to go. There is no place on earth that we have been able to identify that will allow them entry, and Australia does not want them either, apparently, except under lock and key. I think even Australians with the hardest hearts surely would not be able to sleep easily knowing that their government insists that we condemn stateless peopleâmen, women and childrenâto live out their lives behind locked gates, walled in forever. Even the minister found it unpalatable, since the latter two gentlemen in question are now in the community on bridging visas. What will happen to them now, however, is anyoneâs guess.</para>
<para>Surely most Australians would flinch at the plight of Muhammadâsometimes called PeterâQasim, who has already been in detention for six years, with nowhere else to go. He is stateless and increasingly desperate. As he put it in a letter to me, and I am sure to others: âI have committed no crime, but I have a life sentence.â It appears that Qasim came to Australia from Indian-occupied Kashmir after his father, a separatist activist, was murdered and Qasim himself had been tortured by Indian security forces. His application for asylum failed, and he has been in detention ever sinceâsix years. The government wanted him to return to India and eventually he agreed to go, but India will not take him, so he is now stateless. So, apparently, he is to remain locked up forever.</para>
<para>The department continues to insist that he has not cooperated with authoritiesâsix years is a pretty stiff penalty for not cooperatingâand claims that he has revised his account on several occasions, but people who have seen his file refute DIMIAâs claims. Even if the department is to be believed, detention for six years seems a severely disproportionate response, as I said. Why would Peter Qasim conspire in his own continuing detention for this durationâwithout charge, without sentence and apparently without end? Even Dick Smithâs intervention seems unlikely to see him freed, if the ministerâs response is any indication.</para>
<para>When I think about what is happening now and about our own history, there is a cruel symmetry between the way many of our forebears arrived on these shores and the treatment we have meted out to the latest boat arrivalsâand they, as opposed to many of our ancestors, have committed no crimes, even petty ones.</para>
<para>There are other reasons to be concerned about the current regime. Firstly, it sets a dangerous precedent, providing the government with the power to indefinitely detain individuals who have not been charged with an offenceâjust like Hicks and Habib have been detainedâand who have nowhere else to go. It is also worth noting that the High Court was seriously divided over such an important constitutional issue, which calls into question the longevity of this position, especially as one of the majority judges is soon to retire.</para>
<para>At its core, the policy of indefinite mandatory detention contains a flagrant disregard for our human rights obligations under international law. Australia is and was a voluntary signatory to various international treaties and declarations; indeed, we helped to draft some of them. The most important of these is the UN international refugee convention, which requires host countries to treat asylum seekers with dignity and respect while their claims for asylum are being analysed. The current policy contravenes these principles and has caused considerable damage to Australiaâs reputation as a fair and just nation. The policy is also clearly in contravention of article 10 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and article 37 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. I know that the government does not care about these things, but an honourable nation would honour its treaty obligations.</para>
<para>In addition, the reasons usually given for initial detentionâhealth, security and identity checksâare not applicable to those in indefinite detention. It is quite clear that such people are not a danger to the community and are not likely to abscondâarguments that are supported by the fact that some of them have been granted bridging visas so they can live in the community.</para>
<para>The argument that their continued detention sends a clear message to people smugglers is based on the premise that detention will be seen as a punishment for using a people smuggler. Under the Australian Constitution, only the courts are allowed to administer punitive detention. Therefore, if we are sending a clear message to the people smugglers by detaining people, we are in breach of our constitutional separation of powers.</para>
<para>Of course, there are more mundane reasons for abandoning this practice, including the cost to the taxpayer. The current estimate for detention is approximately $87 million per year for accommodation, staff and other administrative costs. In evidence to a Senate estimates hearing on 17 February 2004, DIMIA officials reported that the average detention centre costs for 2003-04 were between $111 and $725 per person per day and that asylum seekers made up approximately half of the detainee population. That is a very expensive intervention.</para>
<para>I have spoken on other occasions about the long-term mental health consequences of this detention. The government continues to want to ignore those consequences, but there is a growing body of evidence. I must say that the most interesting intervention by the government recently on this score is their attempt to discredit researchers and to minimise in their public utterances the known destructive effects of detention. I did note the Prime Minister speaking about a young woman who is being detained for the moment in Bali, saying how traumatic that must be for her. I hope he will just look across into his own backyard and see how traumatic it must be for the people who have been there for three, four, five and six years.</para>
<para>Despite the now overwhelming evidence of psychological harm, there has been an official refusal to confront the consequences of the policy. The former Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, now the Attorney-General, even denied that depression is a mental illness; they refuse to count it in statistics that were given to this parliament. In answering a question about the incidence of mental illness he actually excluded it as a category, and in a later interview he said, âIâm not sure that everybody would regard depression as a mental illness.â I have news for you, Minister: everybody with any qualification does.</para>
<para>The government has also sought to discredit a team of researchers who have, under very difficult circumstances, documented the impact of detention and the elevated rates of suicide, self harm, depression and other mental illness. The government will not let them in there to examine it first-hand, so invariably their research has had to be conducted, to some extent, at armâs length. Despite the fact that most of their published articles have been in prestigious peer-reviewed journals, the minister responsible has asserted that their findings are not sufficiently ârobustâ, which was her justification for paying another psychiatrist, with no research experience but who happens to be a member of the Liberal Party, $30,000 for an unsolicited and critical review of the researchânice work if you can get it!âall the while refusing access for researchers to detention centres so that their research could be more ârobustâ. Denial will not serve in this case. People are being damaged, Minister, whether you like it or not.</para>
<para>What are the options for change? What should this parliament do? Peter Qasimâand others like himâis condemned, according to our Constitution and the laws passed by this parliament, for the term of his natural life. And there is nothing that he, or others like him, can do about it except appeal to the minister to use her discretion and release him. And she should and she must. But we also have to change the law. The implication of the High Court decisions should shock all Australians. They show that we, a so-called advanced democracy, have no effective protections against arbitrary imprisonment by the state. Our Constitution and laws allow innocent people whom we call âaliensâ to be locked up without hope of release. While we can urge the minister to use her discretionary powers to release Muhammad Qasim and others whose hopes of a court ordered release have been dashed by this decision, we cannot escape the inevitable consequence of the decision. I believe we need a bill of rights to protect civil liberties and to constrain the actions of the government.</para>
<para>But there are other actions we can take. In my view, the brutality of the current system means that we must change the migration law to outlaw indefinite detention. There are a number of ways in which the regime could be changed. We could develop a system of administrative and judicial review so that any decision to detain a person must be tested against stringent criteria of public safety, not political convenience. We could amend the Migration Act so that it is unlawful to detain someone indefinitely where there is no real likelihood that the person can be deported in the reasonably foreseeable future. We could develop a system of complementary protection visas for those who are not refugees under the meaning of the act but who cannot be returned to their countries. These are not extravagant proposals. They are eminently sensible; indeed some of them have been embraced by members opposite, just in case the minister at the table thinks otherwise. We need to revive our commitment to the principle that lies at the heart of our Western liberal tradition: that every person has the right to be free, a right that is second only to the right to life itself.</para>

<para>âI have an unexpected opportunity to speak here tonight in the debate on the appropriation bills and I am pleased to do so. I think all Australians across the political divide and across the geographical spread of our nation would have been distraught and disappointedâand stronger adjectives than thatâat the violence they have seen in Sydney, in Macquarie Fields in particular, in recent days, with youths roaming the streets, throwing objects at police. Police in Australia in riot gear night after night in suburban streets are not scenes we are accustomed to seeing in Australia, nor should we be. They are not scenes that we would wish to see repeated or condoned by anyone. In fact, there is no reason in this country, which boasts such wonderful resources and such great opportunities, for any Australian to feel so aggrieved as to do such things. These are scenes that are reminiscent of Belfast and of people with political struggles, not of people that are having an argument with law and order.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It turned my thoughts to how we could prevent this from occurring in the first place. What is the genesis for people feeling so alienated from the processes of governance and good order that they can behave in such a way? I do not condone it; in fact, I condemn it in every fashion. But we must look at the root cause of it. In my own electorate of Longmanâand, for those who are unaware, Longman is not in the backblocks of Queensland; we are less than an hour out of the CBD of Brisbaneâwe have, unfortunately, Aboriginal boys and girls as young as seven years of age sniffing petrol. This is something that I have found hard to come to grips with in an area of considerable wealth and affluence and obviously all the other benefits that come from living in an Australian suburb. Here we have young people feeling so disenfranchised and so alone that they are doing such things to occupy their time. Of course, with that come violence and health issues et cetera.</para>
<para>So I, as a local member and in dealings with local police and other community groups, looked at what we could do about this issue. Ultimately, if we do not deal with the issue then we are going to see the scenes that we are seeing in Macquarie Fields repeated in more places throughout Australia. To that end, I by chance ran into rugby league legend and former Australian captain Mal Meninga, who was at that stage living here in Canberra. He had been running an intervention program with young Aboriginal children who had transgressed the law. That program was providing those children with a new avenueâit provided them with something to do, it gave them some positive role models and it was non-competitive sport. I was very impressed with the program and had Mal and his team apply, through Brendan Jones, for a two-year grant to conduct the Primary After School Sports programâthe PASS program, which comes under the Commonwealth governmentâs crime prevention strategiesâthroughout my electorate. I had wonderful support from the local schools. I think just about every school would like to participate, but in particular we chose Beerwah, Bribie Island, Deception Bay North and Morayfield primary schools.</para>
<para>Just last week, as the culmination of some considerable effort and after talking to parents, teachers and the like, we had our first come-and-try days. It just hit home to me how many parents are crying out for assistance in dealing with their own children, not necessarily children who are coming to the forefront of law and order but children who are looking for something extraâsomething that perhaps in my own youth was there naturally but today is not. Students put their names down for these come-and-try days, and we were expecting 20 or 30 students. At one school 80 students put their names down and 150 turned up. In fact, at almost every school about 150 students turned up for these basic come-and-try days, playing after school in a non-competitive and safe environment, where they learnt a little bit about hygiene and nutrition and benefited from participating and being active.</para>
<para>We all know the problems of obesity, but I wonder for how many of these children obesity is just a health issue. Perhaps the real issue is about being active, being involved, understanding their place in the world, being wanted, being loved and having a chance to participate. We have been blown away by the overwhelming support for the program but we now need to find a way in which to grow it, because we had anticipated the need being there for a certain number of people and catered for about 80 students.</para>
<para>I wonder how many young people from Macquarie Fields who attend something like this would get themselves on a different path. People as removed from them as the Mal Meningas and the well-respected people of the sporting world are willing to give of their time. In fact, the Broncos are going to come up, and Steve Irwin from Australia Zoo has invited students to the zooâactivities that students who are generally excelling get to participate in. But this is an opportunity where young people who, in many cases, are struggling with society can suddenly see that they are worth something.</para>
<para>I have a great belief that, if we show these young people that society cares about them and that there is another path, and if we support their parents, then we can ensure that the society that I grew up in and that I hold such pride in can also be created for another generationâa generation where there are, unfortunately, more broken marriages and where the traditional family is not there as a base to support them, which brings with it many other challenges for single parents, whether they be male or female. But I see this as just a small step, a way of working with the community to build up the support for these young people and their parents so that they can have a better life and, in doing so, hopefully grow their opportunities and not know the violence that we are seeing in other parts of the country.</para>
<para>It obviously has the spin-off of tackling obesityâone of the great health issues of our nation. There is no reason why any of us need to be obese. There is no reason for our children to develop diabetes and other associated terrible illnesses that have a huge cost, both personal and financial. Sport, particularly non-competitive sport, can certainly deal with those issues.</para>
<para>I would also briefly like to mention a couple of other positive things about young people in my district. I have been proud and privileged to be patron of the Morayfield High Schoolâs youth leadership program for a number of years now. I want to congratulate the current school leaders, who are going above and beyondânot just helping with events like Clean Up Australia Day and Shave for a Cure, which they are doing, but trying to make their school a better place.</para>
<para>We often debate in this place about how much funding goes to schoolsâand I am pleased that we had a very successful forum just last week with Minister Nelsonâs people, talking about the $1 billion that the federal government is putting directly into schools. But it really hit home to me when I met with some students and asked them what the No. 1 priority was that they wanted to see completed or achieved in their school at the momentâif you could just wave a magic wand, what would the one thing be? It was not a swimming pool. It was not a great arts centre. I am almost embarrassed to say that it was toilet doors. I find it appalling to think that 15-, 16- and 17-year-old girls and boys do not even have toilet doors in some of our state schools. We have to ask ourselves where the priorities of state governments are when the budgets for maintenance are so pitiful that the schools cannot find the money to have those sorts of things that the students aspire to have. How can you expect people to respect a school and its surroundings if you do not have those basic, fundamental issues of cleanliness, hygiene and of course self-dignity dealt with?</para>
<para>I want to congratulate Morayfield High School students for the leadership they are showing and the way that they are undertaking their work this year both inside and outside of the school and in taking it to new heights. We have many fine schools in the area. The federal government just recently announced funding to three private, non-state schools, as part of the capital works program. They are all fine schoolsâSt Peterâs Catholic Primary School at Caboolture; Glasshouse Country Christian College, which has just entered its first year 8s, and I congratulate them on the incredible success that they have had in just a few short years; and also Caboolture Christian College, which goes from strength to strength.</para>
<para>There is also a great push from this government to support those young people who are choosing an apprenticeship in a technical trade. Next Friday the members for my neighbouring electorates of Petrie and Dickson will be joining me for a forum with Minister Hardgrave. One of the most exciting initiatives for my electorate and this region is that we are going to have a technical college which will give young people yet another choice about the sort of future they want for themselves and their families in an area which is growing substantially. I thank all of the business community and the Redcliffe, Caboolture and Pine Rivers shire councilsâall of whom are showing great foresight in being part of this program.</para>
<para>I have a lot of faith in Australiaâs youth, but they do need our support. I commend the Primary After School Sports program, the PASS program, which is now running in my electorate and will hopefully be running in many other electorates soon. To all the other members, consider this: we start with our youth and we build a better nation.</para>

<para>âThe House would be aware that the recent Western Australian state election was convincingly won by the Labor Party under Premier Geoff Gallop. Mr Gallop deserved to win, not least because his more prudent approach to addressing Perth and Western Australiaâs considerable problems in relation to securing long-term water supplies was manifestly superior to that spruiked by the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Barnett.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Mr Barnettâs planâuntested, unrealistically costed and unbelievableâto build a giant canal and divert water from the Kimberley region in the north to Perth over 3,600 kilometres across some of the hottest, most inhospitable and remote terrain on earth gave new meaning to the term âpipe dreamâ. It seems some politicians still cannot resist the âbig nature fixâ idea. In Australia the notion of turning rivers backward, digging into groundwater and spiriting the precious resource away whence it came and from where it plays its vital role in the nourishment of regional ecosystems is still about. It seems the current parlous state of the Murray-Darling Basin river system had not entered Mr Barnettâs mind. To be sure, there is merit in examining ways of securing water supplies into the longer term, but to unilaterally launch a scheme of this order as a master strategy for election success was the stupidest idea we have seen for some time.</para>
<para>The proposed canal was a hugely expensive, environmentally deficient white elephant in waiting. The federal Treasurer, alone among his colleagues, had the good sense to treat the plan with scepticism, bordering on disdain; as, ultimately, did the electors of Western Australia. Amongst the many objections to the water pipeline plan the most critical was that it overlooked the environment. You cannot leave the environment out of any plan which involves significant impacts on the environment. That much ought to be commonsense. It appears that the federal Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Campbell, was one of the schemeâs mastermindsâa scheme which appeared not to allow for appropriate environmental assessment and showed a glaring lack of on-ground knowledge of the natural resources of the Kimberley region.</para>
<para>Amazingly this plan neglected to address the basic fact that, for starters, most of the time surplus water is simply not there and that even in peak years water levels tend to be low in the dry season. Studies have shown that the water is generally not available in aquifers connected to the Fitzroy River. So the most likely way water would have been supplied to the canal is by the construction of a dam. I have first-hand knowledge of the region, having spent time travelling and campaigning in the Kimberley, and I can assure the House that this great river system plays a central and powerful role in the ecology and productivity of north-western Western Australia. Its annual discharge, whilst huge, is an essential component in renewing and enhancing wetlands, groundwater and aquatic environments.</para>
<para>Fundamentally, water in the Fitzroy River is not wasted water. It already supports a range of diverse industries and the whole environment, including fisheries, pastoralism, tourism, internationally important wetlands and endangered species. The water is completely integral to the environment of the Kimberley. It buttresses Indigenous communities. It is not there simply to be removed on a whim to serve the election prospects of politicians. The proposal appeared to bypass an assessment of adverse social impacts for landholders, including Aboriginal communities along the length of the canal. It was never made clear how the rights of these stakeholders would be respected. Also ignored were the climate change predictions for more intense and frequent cyclones in the stateâs north and the vexing question of ensuring the security of Perthâs water supplies, with a hugely long canal being an easy target for terrorists. The Governor-General spoke earlier in the year of the need to carefully develop Australiaâs north. He was right. Prudent and ecologically aware planning is necessary for this fast-growing region. But the Western Australian Liberal opposition proposal to build a giant canal fluffed this issue altogether. The giant canal was merely a pipe dream of those desperate to be elected but ignorant of the basics of geography and ecology. It deserved to be consigned by the people of Western Australia to the dustbin of history, and thankfully on 26 February 2005 it was.</para>

</talker>
<para>âTonight I rise with a great sense of sadness to reflect on the life, and particularly the successful parliamentary career, of the late Mr James Corbett MBE, the former member for Maranoa from 1966 to 1980. I knew Jim, as he was affectionately known, for many years and had become good friends with him and his wife Ethel. Only recently I spoke at length to his wife, Mrs Corbett, now his widow, about political matters. Mrs Corbett still maintains a very strong interest in the activities of parliament, just as she did in supporting her husband Jim not only during his parliamentary life but throughout their whole married life.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In the early days as member for Maranoa, Mr Corbett was often a source of great advice to me on matters affecting Maranoa. Although I am one of only two of Mr Corbettâs successors, I still look to his work and his personal attributes for inspiration today. Jim had a very distinguished career prior to entering parliament which qualified him well to represent the people of Maranoa. For nine years he was the Deputy Chairman of the local shire, the Murilla shire, in which he spent the rest of his life. For two years he was the Senior Vice President of the Australian Country Party in Queensland. He spent two years, from 1949 to 1951, as Vice President of the South-East Graziers Association. While a member of parliament, Jim held the position of National Country Party Whip from 1976 until his resignation from parliament in 1980. He was also Deputy Chairman of Committees from 1970 to 1972 and had several committee positions. Jim was also recognisedâand this was a source of great pride for him and his familyâfor his contribution to rural communities by being made a Member of the British Empire and awarded the MBE.</para>
<para>My earliest recollections of Jim are from my time as a member of the Young Country Party, as it was in those days. I remember his grassroots street campaigns where people would come and hear him speak on street corners. Mr Speaker, as you know, in those days there was no television, no email, no faxes and no spin doctors. Instead it was off-the-cuff, off the stump, real campaigning. We are worse as a nation for the loss of that sort of campaigning.</para>
<para>Â Let me remind the House of the contribution Mr Corbett made to not only the people of Maranoa but also all those currently living in rural communities across Australia. One only has to read his maiden speech from 2 March 1967 to realise that Mr Corbett was a man of commitment and vision.</para>
<para>Jim passed away on 3 March 2005âlast weekâand just 38 years and one day before this date, James Corbett made his maiden speech to the House of Representatives in Old Parliament House. His maiden speech highlighted the important issues to rural communities of communication services, the need for drought preparedness and water infrastructure, trade opportunities and the tenacious nature of the people he representedâall of which are still relevant today.</para>
<para>Firstly, it was well known that Mr Corbett was a strong campaigner for improved communications for the people of the bush. He understood the necessity of radio, television, mail services and, of course, telephone as vital forms of communication to keep up to date with the news and to stay in contact with family and friends. All his people wanted to know was when they could expect television in western Queensland. Mr Corbett sought more adequate telephone service, more rural automatic exchanges and a widening of the extended local service areas, and he asked for improved ABC radio reception in western Queensland. Mr Corbett fought for equality between city and country in communication services.</para>
<para>Secondly, Mr Corbett spoke about the effects of drought on families and businesses in Maranoa. He emphasised the importance of creating sustainable water infrastructure to help overcome future droughts. Jim offered ideas for drought preparedness which included farmers being able to build up tax-free reserves of cash in preparation for the next drought, freight concessions for the movement of fodder to be stored on properties, long-term low interest loans and zoning for taxation purposes. He also suggested the potential for water conservation projects in the Murray-Darling and Dawson basins in my electorate of Maranoa. Thirdly, diversifying Australiaâs trade opportunities was high on Mr Corbettâs agenda, for he believed it was inevitable that Great Britain would join the European Common Market and it was important that we were able to open new markets to replace those markets that were lost when Great Britain joined the European Community.</para>
<para>Jim Corbett showed tremendous persistence in achieving a better way of life for the people of Maranoa. He will be remembered by the parliament as a man who campaigned heavily for the improvement of living standards and a greater equity of access of services for people in the bush. On Thursday, I will represent the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party at a funeral service in Miles to say goodbye to Mr Corbett as we celebrate his life. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI rise to speak on the circumstances of those who are living in immigration detention in Australia. When it was discovered that an Australian citizen, Cornelia Rau, had been kept at Baxter detention centre, where she was not given the care that she needed, Australians were outraged at her terrible circumstances and that checks and balances had failed her. However, as Cornelia Rauâs family says, at least it has highlighted the conditions in which detainees continue to live. There is a dangerous lack of accountability for our detention centres and, without that accountability, anything can happen, as demonstrated by Cornelia Rauâs detention. That signals a foundation to the fears of those who have lobbied this government again and again to introduce a more humane migration system.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>There are now 198 people who have been living in detention for more than three years, and we have no guarantee that their physical or mental health needs are being addressed. In fact, we have a growing amount of evidence which suggests that they are not. Immigration detention in itself contributes to deteriorating mental health and, as such, our vigilance in identifying and treating ill health needs to be consistent and thorough. Poor mental health is a life-threatening illness, and yet this government continues to ignore the health needs of detainees.</para>
<para>State governments have worked hard to be allowed to provide their services to detainees. In South Australia, for example, child protection services have had to request permission to go to Woomera and then Baxter whenever they have received a child protection notification. Mental health services face a similar dilemma, and, if DIMIA says they are not allowed on the site, they cannot go, despite the needs of those in detention. At this stage, I understand negotiations are continuing between the state and federal governments with regard to the provision of physical and mental health services, but the federal government has been tardy in signing protocols to improve services. I do not understand why this is the case but, after the Cornelia Rau incident, there can be no more excuses.</para>
<para>Australians are not unkind people. Our wonderful response to the tsunami disaster demonstrates this countyâs open and generous nature, but somehow this government has failed to understand that, while Australians want to know that we have an effective immigration system, that does not mean that we wish to treat people who try to come to our home without compassion. Without meaning to be flippant, I suggest that we are not usually such bad hosts and that this governmentâs attitude to our guests is alarming. When an Australian meets a so-called âillegal detaineeâ it is not an attitude that persists. Our humanity, our innate sense of what is right and fair, overcomes the barriers that this government has tried so hard to put up.</para>
<para>This brings me back to the unfortunate case of Cornelia Rau, and many people have had a lot to say about this case. One person who has been very vocal on the Cornelia Rau issue is the South Australian Public Advocate. He has said a lot about this terrible and totally unacceptable situation that Cornelia Rau found herself in. What John Harley, the Public Advocate, had to say was that it was disturbing that it took authorities so long to identify Ms Rau. Mr Harley also said that he had been trying since December 2004 to establish Ms Rauâs identity. He also said that Ms Rau was severely disturbed in Baxter and, on many occasions, required four armed guards to move her in and out of her cell. He said that it is unfortunate that it has taken an Australian citizen to highlight serious mental health problems inside these detention centresâBaxter, Woomera and other places. In other statements he made, Mr Harley indicated that he was concerned that other people with mental illnesses were in this situation in Baxter, and they are not receiving the proper care that they need.</para>
<para>A public inquiry into the case of Corneliu Rau would stop Australian citizens from being kept in immigration detention again, but it would also highlight the circumstances of other unfortunate detainees in Australiaâs detention centres. This government knows that, because Australians believe in a fair go, they will not tolerate what a public inquiry would find. Once again this government opts for secrecy. But the Australian people are no fools and, cover-up or not, they know a little more about life in detention, thanks to the unfortunate circumstances of this poor woman, Cornelia Rau.</para>

</talker>
<para>âI rise this evening to bring the attention of the House to an advancing army that will become a plague across Northern Australia. I refer, of course, to the cane toad. Anyone who lives with cane toads will know full well the obnoxious nature of this marauding amphibian. It is something that is going to have the potential to reshape the nature of Northern Australia if it is successful in its advance across the Northern Territory and into the cane fields of Kununurraâinto that horticultural, irrigated area of Kununurra and the Ord River scheme. From there it is but a short hop into the more temperate zones of Western Australia, and, for those in this House who are familiar with the very desirable wine district of Margaret River in Western Australia, it is not too long a comparison to draw to imagine those romantic vineyards of the Margaret River area invaded by Queensland cane toads.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>What I want to achieve this evening is simply to make people aware that the cane toad is no friendly frog. It is an obnoxious amphibian that is toxic to everything that consumes it. A number of Australian species prey upon the cane toad. The largest is the bungarra, the perenti or the water monitor of Northern Australia. When those lizards prey upon the cane toad, the effect is disastrous for the lizards. When those wonderful reptiles, which are at the top of the food chain in Northern Australia, prey upon this advancing horde of cane toads, they are the ones who are worse off. Slowly but surely, as the wave of cane toads advances across Northern Australia from east to west it is decimating populations of native reptiles and fauna generally. For example, for the warral, the eastern native cat that feeds on the cane toads because they look like a likely meal, it is disastrous, toxic and final. If only Australians knew about this generally and were moved to action, I believe more action would be taken by the collective state and territory governments across the northâwith the assistance of the federal government under the stewardship of our competent federal minister for the environment, Senator Ian Campbellâto do something about this invading army.</para>
<para>We have already had sightings of cane toads in Kununurra, which is across the border in Western Australia on the Ord River scheme. If the cane toads can establish a breeding colony in Kununurra on the Ord River, it will mean that during the flood their eggs will be washed down the length of the Ord. The dispersal will be absolute and the consequences will be catastrophic. This is not just an obnoxious thing that you have to run over every now and again as you negotiate roads at night where there are populations of cane toads. This is a real threat to native fauna in Australia. It is not contained in tropical Australia; it has the potential to invade temperate zones of Australia.</para>
<para>I am calling tonight for Australians to wake up and make a very loud and long call to governments generallyâlocal, state and federalâto have funding and initiatives put in place to find solutions to the cane toad problem. The cane toad was brought into the country as a biological solution and it has become a biological hazard. We must make sure we do not jump upon the first and easy solution and make the mistake of creating a problem into the future. I urge that all members of the House take note that cane toads are likely to be not just a problem in Queensland today but a major problem for all of Australia tomorrow.</para>

</talker>
<para>âTonight I want to talk about skill shortages in Tasmania. There is a big problem in the system, and five minutes is not going to allow me to scratch the surface of it. I do not think this problem is just in Tasmania. It is Australia wide and it boils down to the fact that VET has been cut in real terms over the last nine years and short-term mickey mouse schemes have been put in to try to put some sort of training in place that does not require as much federal funding. I have a similar worry about the new technical colleges and whether they will indeed deal with skill shortages.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Despite what it seems is a popular belief of this government, any old course will not do. Employers want properly trained, work-ready graduates, not someone who has just touched the surface of the topic they have chosen. The building industry is a case in point. In Tasmania, according to the skills shortage list which was updated in August 2004, there are shortages in bricklayers, carpenters and joiners, fibrous plasterers and solid plasterers. Add to that the shortages in electronic equipment tradespersons, general electricians as well as special class electricians, plumbers and mechanical services and airconditioning plumbers, and anyone wanting to have a house built has Buckleyâs to no chance!</para>
<para>Most people in the industry now are working beyond their capacities and have no time to deal with apprenticeships or to seek suitable apprentices. In fact, I know many people who have been waiting for ages for someone to build their house. Even the building program of the state housing department in Tasmania has come to a standstill. Yet we have many young people seeking work or training. Shortening apprenticeships might be part of the answer, with more intensive training, but each potential worker is still three years off from being a competent employee. What the devil has been going on for the last nine years?</para>
<para>I will make a few quick observations here. Many young people who should be going on VET programs are not, and they are also not searching for apprenticeships. Two reasons seem to be coming out in Tasmania. Firstly, the courses are expensive and, although some people are eligible for Austudy, at the age they access it it barely covers the cost of getting to a course, let alone the cost of living and buying books and other equipment.</para>
<para>Secondly, employers are no longer keen to contribute to the cost of training, nor do they have time to undertake some of the on-the-job side of the training. In fact, an article in <inline font-style="italic">Workplace Intelligence</inline> of May 2004 shows that employers fear workers will take the training and then leave the organisation. According to the same article, some employer groups are doing their own training rather than meet the expense of buying into a reliable national scheme, because the federal government has not provided enough money for training places at TAFE for apprentices and apprentices are not being funded properly.</para>
<para>These shortages have been recognised for some time. A report came out in September 1999 which talks of considerable structural change. It says many skilled people have changed their career path because of what they describe as occupational wastage. These are qualified workers who are no longer required by or employed in the trade for which they are qualified, because either they have reached middle age and sought less physically demanding work or less uncongenial working hours, particularly for chefs and the food trades, they have gone to raise a family or they have a reaction to chemicals in their trade, such as those in hairdressing or vehicle painting. When these people leave, there are few apprentices working through their years to take over. Training has changed, too. Once you just learned on the job with some outside courses; now you have to be job ready.</para>
<para>This government just does not understand the training needs or is not interested in really dealing with the shortages; otherwise it would be ploughing much more money into these programs, adding training to the Work for the Dole scheme and paying for proper supervision of training. This is only a quick sketch, but I am watching what the government is doing and I will keep picking away at those shortages, because of what is being inflicted on us by this government.</para>

<para>â I rise to speak on a matter of grave concern to the people of my electorate. As I am sure most members would be aware, the city of Devonport, in my electorate, is the proud home port of the three <inline font-style="italic">Spirit of Tasmania</inline> ferries. <inline font-style="italic">Spirit of Tasmania I</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Spirit of Tasmania II</inline> take on the Devonport to Melbourne route, while the <inline font-style="italic">Spirit of Tasmania III</inline> sails between Devonport and Sydney. There is no doubt that these three ships have changed the face of Tasmaniaâs tourism industryâfrom the north-west, to the north, to the southâbeing responsible for bringing to our state record visitor numbers. While the state Labor government is loath to admit it, the fact is that without the Australian governmentâs Bass Strait Passenger Vehicle Equalisation Scheme we would not be seeing two <inline font-style="italic">Spirit of Tasmania</inline> ferries in service, let alone three.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Unfortunately, it now appears likely, if not certain, that the Lennon Labor government will axe the <inline font-style="italic">Spirit of Tasmania III</inline> service to Sydney. What a short-sighted, reactionary decision that would be. It seems the current Premier of Tasmania, Paul Lennon, lacks all the leadership skills of his predecessor, Mr Jim Bacon. Indeed, Mr Lennon would do well to take note of the words of the former Premier. In January last year, Mr Bacon heralded the arrival in Sydney of the <inline font-style="italic">Spirit of Tasmania III</inline> as âthe start of a new era in Tasmanian tourismâ, saying that when Australians living on the eastern seaboard:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... see this magnificent ship sailing in and out of Sydney Harbour three times a week, I am sure that the high level of interest will only increase.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Faced with media reports of a mounting loss by TT-Line due to the operations of the <inline font-style="italic">Spirit of Tasmania III</inline>, the response of the Lennon Labor government could not be of greater contrast.</para>
<para>As has been widely reported, Mr Lennon sent his tourism minister along to a parliamentary committee hearing without a vital report, where, not surprisingly, he promptly made a complete fool of himself. Without being too harsh, the appearance by the minister, the honourable Ken Bacon MHA, was by all accounts one of the worst displays by any member of any parliament in the country over the last few years. This was the same minister, might I add, who once thanked âthe honourable question for his memberâ. Only today, the three state Labor members for my electorate have shown the appalling lack of backbone that we have also come to expect. When asked by our local media where they stood on the future of the <inline font-style="italic">Spirit of Tasmania III</inline>, they all refused to answerâmembers Green, Kons and Best.</para>
<para>A cynic would say that the <inline font-style="italic">Spirit of Tasmania III</inline> is doomed. Mr Lennon is even comparing it to health funding, as if Tasmanians could have one but not the other. The Premier could have made a comparison with his pet project, a $20 million racetrack near Hobart, but, no, he chose health funding. In the last state budget, one is appalled at the lack of funding for health, yet the Premier could allocate $20 million to shift a trotting track which is located at the Hobart Showground, across the road to Elwick Racecourse.</para>
<para>What is being forgotten in all of this, however, is that the <inline font-style="italic">Spirit of Tasmania III</inline> has hardly had a chance to prove itself. It has been operating for barely over a year. Surely, the 300-plus employees whose jobs depend on the survival of this service, and the wider Tasmanian tourism industry, deserve more consideration than this. The speculation and uncertainty that now surround the <inline font-style="italic">Spirit of Tasmania III</inline> are a direct result of the failure of the Lennon Labor government to make its position clear. One day it is one thing and another day it is another, depending on what newspaper you read. This failure to be decisive and remain positive has come at a time when what those 300 employees and the wider Tasmanian tourism industry most needed to hear was a statement of confidence in the service. The Lennon government must take full responsibility for the doubt that now surrounds the future of the <inline font-style="italic">Spirit of Tasmania III</inline>, and it must act accordingly. We need a clear commitment to retaining the ship in service on the Devonport to Sydney route for at least another 18 months to two years. Anything less would be an insult to the employees and to all Tasmanians who are involved in the tourism industry.</para>

<para>That this House:</para>

<para>(2)Â Â  notes that in the United States these suits are known as âStrategic Lawsuits Against Public Participationâ or âSLAPPâ suits;</para>
<para>(3)Â Â  notes that in many cases SLAPP suits have no real legal foundation, but their aim is to intimidate individual protesters into silence by the prospect of costly and time-consuming legal action;</para>
<para>(4)Â Â  notes that common law action against protesters may take several different forms, including the torts of nuisance, unlawful interference in business, conspiracy to damage commercial interests and defamation, and that such torts are largely areas of State jurisdiction;</para>
<para>(5)Â Â  notes that SLAPP suits could be discouraged if State Governments legislated to allow for the summary dismissal of unsoundly based SLAPP suits;</para>
<para>(6)Â Â  notes that the insertion of an express right of freedom of speech in the Constitution, to impress upon courts that common law torts should be interpreted so as to ensure the protection of freedom of speech would also discourage unsound SLAPP suits;</para>

<para>(3)Â Â  The Health Insurance Commission (HIC) administers Medicare and decides on the placement of Medicare offices within its network. I am advised that part of the establishment criteria includes considerations on claiming patterns for the catchment area and the potential impact on existing sites. Localities that are assessed and approved for a Medicare office are positioned in suitable and available premises that are convenient for the greatest number of residents. Major shopping centres are the most common locations for Medicare offices.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>(4)Â Â  The residents of Warrawong and the surrounding suburbs have access to Medicare through alternate access points such as the Medicare easyclaim network. There are currently three easyclaim sites in operation within Warrawong. Customers can claim their Medicare benefits, with the refund (for paid accounts) deposited directly into their bank account, without the need to complete a claim form. Easyclaim customers can also update their enrolment records, request tax statements and initiate registration for the Australian Organ Donor Register.</para>
</item>
<item label="">
<para>(5)Â Â  No. The HIC administers the Medicare office network and need to do this as effectively and efficiently as possible within their available resources. I am advised that Warrawong does not meet the criteria for establishing an office at this time.</para>

<para>The Child Support Agency (CSA) routinely reminds parents of their obligations to inform the Agency of changes in circumstances which affect their child support entitlement or liability. This information is included in the Child Support Handbook provided to all new clients and included on a flyer which is sent out with statements of account. The CSA website also reminds parents that they should inform the Agency of changes in their circumstances. Client Service Officers also reinforce this message when talking to parents. Where CSA becomes aware of a change in circumstances which may change the amount of child support payable, the CSA contacts the parents and works with them to ensure that the child support assessment is correct and that every appropriate option for both parents has been explored.</para>

<para pgwide="yes">These statistics relate to all providers of at least one service on a âfee-for-serviceâ basis and for which Medicare benefits were processed by the Health Insurance Commission in the years in question. Excluded are details of services to public patients in hospital, to Department of Veteransâ Affairs patients and some compensation cases.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The simple headcounts given above do not account for differences in the number of services claimed and will include a high proportion of casual and part-time practitioners. Therefore it will not accurately represent the supply of doctors.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is for this reason that âFull-Time Equivalentâ (FTE) practitioner is the statistic used in the population ratios given above. FTE is a standardised measure to estimate the number of full-time doctors which adjusts for the partial contribution of casual and part-time doctors. FTE is calculated by dividing each doctorâs Medicare billing by the average billing of full-time doctors for the reference period. Where the doctorâs Medicare billing is greater than or equal to the mean billing of full-time doctors, then the FTE is capped at one.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In general terms, practitioners with at least 50% of Schedule fee income from non-referred (GP) attendances in the June quarter of the years in question were considered to be General Practitioners. All other practitioners, including optometrists and some dentists who provided services under Medicare, were categorised as âSpecialists.â</para>
<para pgwide="yes">These statistics were compiled from Medicare data on the basis of servicing provider postcode. In compiling statistics for Federal electoral division boundaries, statistics by servicing provider postcode were mapped to electorate according to the proportion of the population of each postcode in each Federal electoral division.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">State-level statistics were compiled by allocating each postcode to a single state only. National statistics are the aggregate of all providers.</para>

<para>âThe answer to the honourable memberâs question is as follows:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>Results from the 2001 National Report on Schooling in Australia show that for reading 10% of Year 3 students and 10% of Year 5 students failed to achieve the national reading benchmark.Â </para>
<para>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Some groups of students had even greater difficulty achieving reading benchmarks.Â  For example, 12% of boys in Year 3 and 12% of boys in Year 5 failed to achieve the national reading benchmarks.Â  Literacy levels among Indigenous students are cause for real concern with only 72% in Year 3 and 67% in Year 5 achieving the national reading benchmarks.</para>
<para>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Australian Government has enshrined in legislation the target that all Year 3 children should achieve benchmark standards in reading from 2001 on, recognising that the benchmarks represent minimum levels of achievement required to enable students to progress their schooling.Â  Under the proposed arrangements for the new quadrennial funding agreement for 2005-2008, education authorities will be required to make additional commitments so that all children in Year 5 and Year 7 are expected to achieve the relevant reading benchmarks with the same proviso recognising that a very small percentage of students have severe educational disabilities and may not achieve the benchmark standards.Â  As a condition of funding, all education authorities are required to commit to achieving performance targets in the legislation.Â </para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>Results from the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) in 2003 for 15 year-olds in the 41 countries that participated indicate that Australia had the fourth highest mean score for reading literacy.Â  The OECD has estimated that Australia ranks between 3rd and 5th among OECD countries and between 3rd and 6th among all participating countries.</para>
<para>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Despite our high performance overall, the results also show that there are still too many Australian students performing at the lowest levels measured by PISA.Â  In reading, more than one in ten of our students achieved only at the two lowest levels of proficiency. As PISA reported, these students are âat risk of not acquiring essential life skills, partly because they do not have the foundation of literacy skills needed for continued learning and extending their knowledge horizonâ.Â </para>
<para>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Boysâ reading achievement is significantly lower than that for girls, as occurs in all OECD countries.Â  There was a large performance difference in reading literacy achievement between Indigenous students and non-Indigenous students with 38% of Indigenous students performing at Level 1 or Below Level 1.Â </para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>The final report of the latest available International Adult Literacy Survey (OECD Statistics Canada 2000) shows that Australia places around 10th in comparative distributions prepared by the OECD of the literacy levels of 22 countries.Â  Australia is ranked behind Canada and ahead of UK, US and New Zealand.Â </para>

<para>Customs is in the final stages of developing an integrated succession and career management program. The program was developed in response to a number of factors including Australian Public Service Commission papers (APSC) indicating the need for agencies to give greater attention to succession management and feedback from staff indicating a greater need for career development and assistance.Â  Customs already has an integrated approach to Workforce Planning and an Assignment and Career management Policy and a succession management program will compliment these existing approaches.Â  The program consists of an informative Policy Advice and, a Toolkit to help managers with their work areaâs succession needs and staff to better manage their careers.Â  The program will be incorporated into each Customs regionâs career assignment process over the period February to June 2005.</para>

<item label="(2)">
<para>An evaluation of the program will be scheduled following the implementation of the program through a full Performance Assessment and Feedback cycle (at this stage July 2006).

<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>The Attorney-Generalâs Department Annual Report 2003â04 referred to a review of the Departmentâs corporate performance management framework on page 118.Â  That review recommended developments to the existing framework and processes that would enable more consistent planning approaches across the Department.</para>
<para>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I am advised that the first stage was to conduct a trial of a revised planning process (based on a modified balanced scorecard approach) in the Departmentâs Corporate Services Group (CSG).Â  That trial commenced with the development of a business plan for the Group.Â  That plan forms the basis of a series of cascading branch plans and section/team plans that reflect the goals and priorities set in the higher level plan.Â  Some of those lower level plans have been developed using the new approach while others are currently in development. The remaining plans for CSG will be completed during 2005.</para>
<para>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  At the Groupâs most recent performance review by the Departmentâs Executive, the new CSG business plan was used to assess the Groupâs achievements against planned business strategies.Â  Once the full set of CSG plans have been developed and in use for another reporting cycle, an evaluation will be conducted to determine the suitability of the modified approach from a whole-of-Department perspective.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>I am advised that, in keeping with the Departmentâs integrated approach to performance management, individual performance agreements with staff are to be aligned with the Departmentâs goals, expressed in successive levels of division/office business plans, branch plans and section/team plans.Â  In this way there is a clear link between the planned activities of individual staff and the organisationâs goals.Â  This linkage occurs with the plans and agreements prepared under the current performance framework.</para>
<para>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  In the case of the CSG trial referred to in part (1) of the response above, where the lower level plans have been developed using the new approach, individualsâ performance agreements have been, or are in the process of being, aligned to the plans.Â  Performance agreements for other staff can be aligned when the respective plans for that area have been developed according to the new approach.</para>

<para>Yes. As answered in response to Question 1.</para>

<item label="(4)">
<para>Yes. EMA managed a project to develop competency standards for emergency management in 1995. These were overtaken by the introduction of the National Training Framework and the move away from a hazards approach to a risk based approach to emergency management.Â </para>
<para>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Public Safety Industry Training Package that includes competency standards for emergency management, including risk management, was developed by the PSITAB and endorsed by the former Ministerial Council of the Australian National Training Authority (ANTA) in July 2000.Â Â </para>
<para>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  During 2002-03, EMA progressively developed training and assessment programs to achieve the emergency management competency standards, and during this process confirmed deficiencies already identified through the PSITAB scoping project undertaken in 2001-02.Â Â </para>
</item>
<item label="(5)">
<para>Yes. EMA was actively involved in the move from the 1995 standards to the 2000 version.Â  The later version has broader applicability across the Public Safety Industry and supports the implementation of a risk based, community centred approach to emergency risk management.</para>
