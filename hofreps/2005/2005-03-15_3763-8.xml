He was showing me a letter he was writing to the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> to correct a misreporting of his views. I will let the Leader of the Opposition in on another secret: I had dinner last night with the member for Wentworth. I hasten to assure you that the member for Indi was present as well. But do not worry—it was a very kosher gathering because the member for Corangamite was there to keep us in order and there were sundry other colleagues there. The member for Kingston was there too, doing that sound South Australian commentary, and there were numbers of others of my colleagues.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition that all of us on this side of the House are very proud of the way in which taxation has been reduced under this government. We are very proud of the fact that further taxation cuts will come into operation, as legislated following last year’s budget, on 1 July this year. I am very proud of the fact that, as a result of the tax and other reforms that this government has undertaken, the disposable income of an average production worker in Australia is the second lowest in the OECD area.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Greenway for her interest in this issue. Yesterday was the one-month anniversary of Rafik Hariri’s assassination. There was another very powerful demonstration of people power with a simply massive turnout at a peaceful demonstration in Beirut. Lebanese, British and French media reports estimate that the turnout was around one million people. The demands of the people in the street were the same as I articulated a month ago: the perpetrators of this vile act of terrorism must be brought to justice. Also, there is no doubt that Syria must implement Security Council resolution 1559 and fully withdraw from Lebanon, and we are pleased to see that beginning to happen.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>What is happening in Lebanon is part of a broader trend in the Middle East. People of the Middle East are standing up to terrorism, violence, intimidation and tyranny. People of the Middle East are increasingly turning to freedom and democracy. We should be ensuring that everybody in this parliament—not just the government but the whole parliament—supports this campaign as best we can. I mentioned yesterday the speech of the British Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, to the Fabian Society, applauding the movements towards freedom and democracy in the Middle East and making the point that you could not divorce that from what has happened in Iraq.</para>
<para>Even the US Democrat senator Ted Kennedy says that what has taken place in the Middle East is ‘enormously constructive’ and ‘a reflection the President has been involved’. That is an extraordinary concession coming from somebody like Senator Kennedy, who is an eternal critic of the Republican Party and has been a strong critic of President Bush.</para>
<para>In conclusion, let me remind the House again about the British MP, the left-wing member for North East Derbyshire, the redoubtable Harry Barnes. I am trying to check this, but I think my parents-in-law may actually live in his electorate, although they would not vote for him of course. They would certainly never vote Labour, but maybe they could be persuaded to next time because Harry Barnes is somebody with a bit of courage. He is somebody who has adopted the strong position of helping to set up the Labour Friends of Iraq. Let us remind ourselves of what he said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">… we must face the facts if we are to provide solidarity to Iraqi democrats in their hour of utmost need. My plain message to those on the left who ... rubbish Iraqi democracy because they cannot stand the idea that ... Blair or ... Bush get some sort of credibility from them is to get real and do so quickly.</para>

I do not regret anything I said to the Australian people because everything I said about interest rates was true.

</talker>
<para>—I thank the honourable member for Goldstein for his question. As he would remember, and as members of this House would remember, when the government went to the Australian public to introduce a goods and services tax, it made it entirely clear that this was a replacement tax for other indirect taxes; that the Commonwealth would abolish the wholesale sales tax, which it did; and that the Commonwealth would expect the states to abolish their indirect taxes. This would start with bed taxes, financial institutions duty, reducing their gambling taxes and abolishing their bank account debits taxes.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>When the GST legislation was finally negotiated through the Senate, the base was not as broad as the government had proposed and there was some doubt as to whether the revenue would be great enough for the states to abolish those taxes. It was agreed that we would wait until 2005 and review the issue. I can report to the House that the actual receipts of GST are greater than we expected when we came to that agreement in 1999. Of the $35 billion in revenue going to the states this year, they will be getting a windfall of $1.9 billion over the guaranteed amount. That means there is now no excuse not to abolish those indirect state taxes which are to be replaced by the GST.</para>
<para>There will be a meeting of state treasurers with the Commonwealth on 23 March where this matter will be decided. I want to say to the House that there have been some welcome developments overnight. In particular, there have been welcome developments from the Queensland government. The Queensland Treasurer, Mr Mackenroth, is quoted in today’s <inline font-style="italic">Courier Mail</inline> as saying that he will be coming to the meeting on 23 March with an open mind. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We will go into the meeting … with an open mind … we have to have enough money to deliver services.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">But he accepts that the windfall will be available for the abolition of some of those state taxes. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We will see what we can deliver, but we won’t be bludgeoned by Canberra over it …</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">There is no intention whatsoever to bludgeon states; there is an intention to keep to the agreement of 1999. Nothing could be more simple.</para>
<para>Let me make two points. The first point is that those states which abolish their inefficient indirect taxes and which now have the capacity to do something will be doing something for their own consumers and businesses. The second point is that, if states like Queensland are prepared to lead the way, it will be the state of Queensland that will steal the economic advantage from other states that follow. I would say to the states as they come to that meeting on 23 March that those states that lead the way and abolish their tax bases will be the states that will attract investment and whose people will have improved standards of living.</para>
<para>The government welcomes the statement that has been made by Mr Mackenroth overnight. I would have hoped that both sides of this House would have joined together in maintaining the Commonwealth’s position on the abolition of state indirect taxes and the ending of double taxation as a consequence. There has been an eerie silence from federal Labor. Why? Because the Leader of the Opposition is a patsy for the state premiers and he cannot stand up to them. That is the truth of the matter. He has been shown up by Terry Mackenroth, whose stand on this we welcome. We urge the other state treasurers and premiers to follow the lead that is coming out of Queensland.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Maranoa for his question and recognise that he chairs the Australia-UAE Parliamentary Friendship Group. This morning in the building I co-chaired the fourth Australia-UAE Joint Ministerial Commission with Minister Sheikha Lubna Al Qasimi and her colleagues from the UAE government, who are visiting Australia with a rather large business delegation at this time. This is the fourth joint ministerial commission that has been held. It is a very important mechanism for strengthening and enhancing an already significant economic relationship between Australia and the Emirates. The UAE is Australia’s second-largest export market in the Middle East. Two-way merchandise trade stood at about $2.2 billion in 2004. Importantly, two-way trade in services stands at $1.5 billion between Australia and the Emirates.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As a result of the discussions that took place in the JMC this morning, this relationship is set to grow and expand even further, following agreement reached between my UAE ministerial colleagues and me to begin negotiations on a free trade agreement between Australia and the United Arab Emirates. It is a very important market in the Middle East, as I indicated. This will be Australia’s first free trade agreement negotiation with a country from the Middle East region—a significant step forward. Australian exporters can expect big gains and opportunities from a prospective free trade agreement with the Emirates.</para>
<para>The Emirates is a regional financial and transportation hub—the Singapore of the Middle East, if you like. It is a launch pad into the Gulf and Middle East markets and a very important trading partner of Australia’s, as I indicated. Currently, over 100 Australian companies have their regional headquarters in Dubai and over 6,000 Australians reside in the UAE. The Emirates has enormous oil and capital reserves and it is looking to diversify its investment portfolio as its economy is forecast to continue to grow at current rates. A free trade agreement with the Emirates was a key element of the government’s trade policy commitments at the last election. This demonstrates not only our government’s dedication to implementing our election commitments but also our dedication and approach to delivering ongoing market access improvements around the world for Australian exporters.</para>

<para>—My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to his claim yesterday that the government solved tax disincentives in last year’s budget. Is the Treasurer aware that a senior Treasury official has admitted to a Senate estimates committee that budget measures worsened disincentives for some low-income families? Was this confirmed by the Melbourne Institute’s analysis of the package, which found these poorer incentives would have resulted in 22,000 individuals leaving the labour market? In the light of this evidence, why does the Treasurer continue to assert that last year’s budget package fixed the tax trap for low-income families? Why do so many on his back bench disagree with him?</para>

<para>—I would like to refer to the case that has been raised by the Melbourne Institute, which has been referred to by the honourable member for Lilley. The case is a single earner on a minimum wage with one child under five. On a weekly income of $467.30 such a person would pay $66.57 in tax. They would receive $58.59 in parenting payment, $78.76 in FTBA and $57.49 in FTBB for a total of $194.83. They would receive a low-income rebate of $2.43.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>They have a private income of $467.30, parenting payments and FTB of $194.83 and in taxation a net figure of $64.13. Out of the weekly wage of $467.30 they have a disposable income of $598.10—that is, in net terms not only do they not pay tax but they receive more in tax benefits than they actually pay in tax. Let me turn it around another way. After their tax benefits are taken into account, on an annual basis their income jumps from $24,299 to $31,096—that is, instead of paying tax, that family actually receives in tax benefits in net terms $6,796. The person on the minimum wage pays no tax and, after they receive their tax benefits, receives in net terms an additional $6,796. They receive $6,796.</para>
<para>What did the budget this year do for that family? Let me tell you. The budget this year made that family $23 a week better off. How did the budget make that family $23 a week better off? It made it $23 a week better off because it increased family tax benefit A by $600 per annum, it increased the free area for the family tax benefit by $420 and it increased the amount for the family tax benefit by $150 from 1 January, but that will be $300 in a full year. With the changes to the tapers, the free areas and the amounts, that family through this year’s budget was made $23 a week better off. It was already in a net refund position and it was made $23 a week better off.</para>
<para>If the member for Lilley were really worried about this family, Mr Speaker, you would think that his policy at the last election would have made that family better off, wouldn’t you? Because otherwise it would just be hot air. I do not think he would be running around mouthing concern for this family if his actual policy did not make them better off. But I have to let the House into a secret—he had a policy for this family at the last election. Do you know what it was? It was to strip them of $600 of family tax benefit part A. Is that right? It would not be the case, would it, that the member for Lilley would run around professing concern for a family who he wanted to actually strip of benefits? That would not be the case! A white-bread politician would not be that cynical—oh, no!</para>
<para>In the last budget we increased by $600 family tax benefit A, we increased the free area for family tax benefit B, we reduced the taper for family tax benefit B and we increased the amount. That family was made $23 a week better off and is in a net refund position—a position that the member for Lilley wanted to oppose.</para>

<para>—I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge the considerable expertise that he brings to health issues in this House. Today I am announcing a Productivity Commission report to study the long-term education and supply of health professionals in Australia with a view to taking away any regulatory or competitive blocks preventing the training of sufficient doctors, nurses and specialists to meet Australia’s needs in the future.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In its landmark report released back in 2002, the <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational report</inline>, the Commonwealth showed that no area of expenditure will increase faster over the next 40 years than health. Health is expected to grow from 4.7 per cent of GDP today to 9.9 per cent of GDP in 2040. The consequences of that are that, if we are to maintain the standards that we have today, if we are to respond to technological developments and if we are to cope with the ageing of the population, expenditures will double in proportion to GDP—meaning that, if you want to keep Australia on the same tax base, other areas of expenditure commensurately will have to recede. That is the implication of the ageing of the population.</para>
<para>This government has already put in place measures to boost the supply of doctors and nurses. But in response to a COAG request and state government requests the government will commission the Productivity Commission to look at those restrictions on supply, including restrictions on the supply of specialists. There is a concern that in relation to specialist training not as many specialists are being trained. In order to meet that looming demographic change and technological change, we will have to boost the supply of health services. The Productivity Commission report which I am announcing today will go a long way down that track.</para>

<para>—The answer to the first part of the question is yes. The answer to the second part of the question is no. I do not believe it is a justified construction of the remarks made by General Cosgrove to reach the conclusion that the Leader of the Opposition did in the concluding part of his question. It is true, as the government clearly laid out in the election campaign, that this country is suffering a skills shortage. It is largely a result of our economy having performed so strongly. That is the reason. There is no secret.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>What the Leader of the Opposition should be reminded of is that every time he complains about this expenditure of $66 billion he is complaining about the more than $1 billion that the government invested in skills upgrading. He is complaining about the $14 billion of tax cuts. He is complaining about the $23 billion of family tax benefits. He is complaining about the additional expenditure on roads infrastructure. The Leader of the Opposition has a problem: he excitedly runs after the latest headline in a newspaper without understanding that, unless you have a consistency of policy, unless you recall your previous stances, you can get yourself into a great deal of difficulty.</para>
<para>This country does have a skills shortage and this government has never sought to deny that. It is a function of a very strongly performing economy, and this government is putting in place a large number of measures to address the skills shortage.</para>

<para>—I hear calls from the opposition about ‘nine years’. Let me go back nine years; let me go back a bit further than nine years. Do you know how many apprentices there were in December 1995? Were there 200,000? No, there were 143,700. How many were there in September 2004? There were 393,800. In other words, we are very proud of the commitment that we have made to apprentices throughout the nine years that this government has been in office. We are very proud of the commitment we have had to training. But does more remain to be done? Yes. That is why, in the fullness of time, the commitments we made in the last election campaign will come into effect.</para>

<para>There has been enormous interest expressed in the construction and development of the 24 Australian technical colleges around Australia. I notice that, in the last election campaign, the former Leader of the Opposition opposed the Australian technical colleges. I am pleased to note that I think the current Leader of the Opposition has reversed that policy. I am not absolutely certain—maybe he could clarify that, maybe he could make it clear that he is definitely going to support it. There is no doubt that this country does need to adopt new measures to address the skills shortage, and that is exactly what the government is doing.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I thank the member for Braddon for his question. He and so many people on this side of the House are very enthusiastic about giving support to the various choices young people seek. In fact, we saw a 52 per cent increase in the number of school based new apprenticeships in the 12 months to September last year. In fact, there are now over 12½ thousand school based new apprentices. But, sadly, over half of those are in one state alone. It is sad, because a school based new apprentice is somebody more likely to actually complete their training, because of the environment they start that training in. These apprenticeships include the hospitality, retail, agriculture, forestry, property, building services, building and construction and manufacturing sectors. Since 2000 the numbers have surged from just 2,370 a year to this magnificent figure of 12½ thousand plus. This gives young people the opportunity to gain nationally recognised trade qualifications and work experience while they are still at school.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Australian government are committed to this process. Over the next three years, out of that $66 billion the Labor Party does not like us spending, we are providing an extra $17.9 million, which will create an additional 7,000 school based new apprenticeship places through group training organisations. This will of course address so many of the skills demands in industries. It will increase career and training pathways available to school students.</para>
<para>The concern that we have on this side can actually be addressed by those on the other side: their political masters—the union movement and, indeed, the state governments, whom the Leader of the Opposition owes his career to—can in fact make a difference tomorrow. In the state of New South Wales there are no school based—that is, part-time—new apprentices in the trades with skill shortages. None, zero. In the biggest state of Australia, the answer is zero. We need to see a change in that. In Western Australia, in the building and construction trades, I am advised there are virtually no school based new apprentices. It is because of state based industrial awards that these starts are being prevented for young people.</para>
<para>The Australian technical college initiative—$289 million over the next three years—will provide more opportunities for school based new apprentices in years 11 and 12. We have made progress as a government, and we are determined to keep that progress coming.</para>

<para>—I am delighted to be able to answer this question, because it has been 100 days since the Labor Party have asked me one question on skills training—which repeats the mistake of the 40th Parliament, when they did not ask any. With regard to the specifics of the member for Ballarat’s question, let me advise that I have asked my department to make some direct inquiries into the MaxiTRANS new apprenticeship situation. We have been advised that the new apprentices in fact were being recruited through a local group training organisation. I have asked that group training organisation and the New Apprenticeships centres in the Ballarat region to work together to place with other host employers any new apprentices who were selected for MaxiTRANS and did not commence.</para>

These people do not come here simply because they want to. Very simply, it is a process by which the employers have to advertise the vacancy nationally.

<para>—I thank the member for Casey for his question and acknowledge the considerable interest which he takes in promoting opportunities for mature age workers in his electorate of Casey. In last year’s budget the government allocated $12.1 million to help mature age work seekers to continue to work and, indeed, made a further substantial commitment in the election platform last year. So the government is making a substantial commitment and providing substantial assistance to employers to assist mature age workers, but can I say that we also need to encourage employers to do more themselves. If one looks at the participation rate for people in Australia aged between 55 and 64, it stands at 53.4 per cent. This compares with the rates, for example, for the United Kingdom, which is at 57.5 per cent; the United States of America, which is at 62.4 per cent; and our nearest neighbour, New Zealand, which is at 66.8 per cent.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Yesterday the government made announcements of awards to four companies under its Mature Age Workers Employer Champion awards. These are companies which have put in place policies not only to retain mature age workers but indeed to recruit older workers. I would like to commend those companies—the Westpac Banking Corporation, Socobell OEM of Spotswood in Melbourne, Aurora Energy in Tasmania and Magnet Mart here in Canberra—for their policies in developing age-friendly workplaces. One of the consequences of the ageing population in Australia will be a contraction in the coming years in the net growth of the Australian work force. Therefore, one of the measures which we are seeking to encourage employers and businesses throughout Australia to adopt is to retain and indeed to regain older workers.</para>
<para>These proposals and this program stand in marked contrast to the program that the Leader of the Opposition employed when he was the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, back in the previous government, and the member for Lilley was the chairman of the special caucus committee on long-term unemployment. Indeed, in May 1993, the then Labor government, with the Leader of the Opposition as the minister for employment, proposed the idea of paying old age pensions to unemployed people from the age of 55 and no longer counting them as part of the work force. So, instead of doing something to assist mature age workers, the policy of the Leader of the Opposition when he was last responsible for employment was simply to give up and to pension off these people from the work force. No wonder he told his biographer subsequently: ‘I lost a lot of ambition and I stopped straining. I thought there was less capacity to achieve in that portfolio than in just about anything that I had.’ Instead of rising to the challenge to assist mature age workers, the Leader of the Opposition squibbed it. We will not do that.</para>

<para>—Finally, a question from the opposition directly to me. It has taken 100 days for them to actually raise apprenticeships directly with me. But, as I said the other day, there are lots of galahs in the pet shop, not just parrots. The <inline font-style="italic">Skills at work</inline> report showed that the number of completions of new apprenticeships has in fact increased by 280 per cent since 1996. Over the 12 months to June 2003, the period of the report, around 120,500 new apprenticeships were completed. We need to see the Australian Labor Party actually get behind the efforts of the government to keep encouraging the choices that young people make and to celebrate the process of choice that is at work in the marketplace today. The number of people starting apprenticeships across the board is up; the number of people starting apprenticeships in traditional trades is up; the completions are up; the funding is up. If only the Labor Party would actually have the good grace and decency to encourage young people to feel good about their choices, just as we are doing on this side of the chamber.</para>

She in particular and many members on this side have committed much of their adult lives to fighting for the fundamental principle that every Australian should be free to join a union, a guild or an association and be represented by that union if they so choose but that equally every Australian, whether they be in a workplace or a university campus, should be free to not join a union. This government will very shortly introduce legislation to give effect to the long-held Liberal principle that, when Australian university students—there are now 750,000 of them—arrive on campus each year, they should have the choice to join a union, a guild or association or equally they should be free not to join that union.</para>

Why is it that students who want to enrol in a diploma of language at Sydney University and who then have to do a course at ANU in India are sent a bill for ANU union fees, when all they want to do is to get an education at Sydney University? Why is it that a student in the 21st century goes to Sydney University to pay $2 for a sausage roll when they can buy one for $1.70 off campus and be served by a person who actually smiles at them?</para>

He indicated, as indeed many members of the Tamworth business community have indicated to me, that they would like to see a change in representation. He himself said all of that in the Senate hearing the other day. So, in that sense, have members of the Tamworth business community talked to me about their representation? Yes. Did I say to him in some form or another that I had some offer to make to you? Very specifically, as I have said endlessly in this place, no I did not.</para>

<para>—I thank the honourable member for his question. I can inform the House that yesterday’s announcement of the new regulations, form and legislation going forward on the government’s choice of superannuation fund from 1 July was very well received. In fact, Mr Richard Gilbert, the Chief Executive Officer of the Investment and Financial Services Association, said:</para>

<quote>
<para>This is a good result for investors and consumers.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Whilst it is important that industry and business are engaged in and supportive of choice, the most important people in this equation are the consumers. I was particularly pleased to read an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper today which asked a typical young 23-year-old worker in the Sydney suburb of Bronte, Mr David Birtwell, about choice. He said that he was ‘eager to control where his superannuation money was placed so he could ensure he paid minimum fees for maximum returns’. It is a pretty simple concept and one that we on this side of that House fully support. Mr Birtwell went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para>I think it is definitely beneficial to have a choice. ... if I can choose, I will definitely take much more of an interest in it.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It is very important that Australians take a very keen interest in their superannuation and choice will encourage them to do just that. I asked myself why those who sit opposite and their Labor state colleagues are opposed to choice, opposed to giving a fundamental right to average consumers to make what is probably the second largest financial decision of their lives beyond buying their own homes—that is, where they are going to place their superannuation, what sorts of fees they are going to be charged and what sorts of returns they expect to receive.</para>
<para>The Labor Party are incapable of making these sorts of decisions on behalf of the public. They have now said that they do not believe Australian consumers should have a right to choose where their super funds go. Tom Barton, the Queensland Minister for Employment, Training and Industrial Relations and a former union heavyweight in Queensland, proudly stated, when he reintroduced into the state parliament the removal of the little bit of choice that was there for state workers, that he had consulted with employers and unions. There was no suggestion that he had consulted with the people most affected, the workers themselves, the people whose money it is that is in choice. I encourage the Labor Party to think again, repudiate their current policy position and support choice.</para>

If he has an allegation to make he might first begin by declaring straight up and down whether he has confidence in the Australian Federal Police and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions who found that there was no case. The direct answer to his question is that there is no conflict whatsoever in terms of the substantive purpose for which I was requested to meet with Mr Maguire to talk about the proposed equine centre. We had a conversation about the matter that was at hand. No inducements were offered. Your implication somehow now that you want to make accusations, that you want to get into the swim of this, first demands that you make clear what your allegation is and whether or not in some way you are casting doubts on the findings of the Australian Federal Police.

<para>—I thank the member for McMillan for his question and acknowledge that he has been a very successful small businessman in regional Victoria and is passionate about small business. We have 1.1 million small businesses in this country employing 3.3 million Australians. They play a very central role in the economy because they generate around 30 per cent of the economic production. The government values and recognises this contribution by small business and provides a range of assistance so that small business can grow. Programs like the 25 per cent entrepreneurs’ tax discount will provide $1.1 billion of tax cuts to 300,000 small businesses. I am asked: are there disincentives for small business to grow and employ more people? I can tell the House that one of that biggest disincentives for small business is the hike in land tax that state Labor governments are applying to small business right around the country. The two states who are the worst offenders are New South Wales and Victoria. Victoria has increased its grab for land tax.</para>

<para>—Thank you, Mr Speaker. As I was saying, Victoria has increased its grab for land tax by 123 per cent. The New South Wales grab for land tax this year is going to be $1.4 billion. On the ground, that means that small businesses like Dennison’s Dry Cleaning in Camberwell in Victoria have had their land tax increased over the past five years from $947 to $20,500. It also means, on the ground, that the small business people running Arthur’s Hotel in Arthur’s Seat have had their land tax increased from $1,330 to $46,130. If the Leader of the Opposition had the slightest interest in small business, he would actually speak to his Labor counterparts in each of the states and convince them to reduce this burden on small business and give small business a fair go.</para>

<para>—I acknowledge the member for Forde’s interest in aged care and thank her for arranging an aged care forum when I visited her electorate. The Australian government is committed to ensuring that older Australians receive not only high-quality care and choice in care but also high-quality accommodation if they need residential care. That is why the government introduced a 10-year certification program to ensure that by 2008 aged care homes meet community expectations in terms of building standards and the privacy and amenity in those homes. I am pleased to report to the House that already around 90 per cent of homes meet that 2008 certification standard.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The sector is showing great confidence in the government’s policies and continuing reform agenda in aged care. The most recent survey of aged care homes indicates that some $2 billion in private investment has been made either for work carried out or for work in progress to 30 June last year. Some 25 per cent or one in four homes report that they are planning new work in their homes. The Australian government committed almost a billion dollars over four years in the last budget in capital payments to aged care homes.</para>
<para>In addition, recently I was able to announce the outcome of the 2004 allocation—a $40 million capital fund for rural and regional homes. I know, for example, that the member for Lingiari will be pleased that a home in Alice Springs in his electorate received $2½ million by way of a capital payment. Indeed, the member for Kennedy, whom I see here today, would also be pleased that the Fred Leftwich Rest Home received a $2½ million capital payment. I visited the Fred Leftwich hostel last year and I was very impressed with the work that they are doing in Mareeba for Aboriginal and Tourist Strait Islanders needing care. My colleague the member for Eden-Monaro has already indicated to me how pleased the people are at the Sir William Hudson Memorial Centre in his electorate, which is providing high care for people in rural areas. They have received a targeted grant of $1 million. So the combination of Australian government investment and private sector investment from the aged care sector, together with our ongoing reform program, is securing the future for aged care in Australia.</para>

<para>—I want to start with a story about a fantastic <inline font-style="italic">Far Side</inline> cartoon that reminds me of the absolute farce that we saw in question time today. It had two cowboys standing over the body of a third cowboy. One cowboy has a smoking gun and he is staring at the body on the ground saying, ‘Okay, stranger; what’s the circumference of the earth?’ or ‘Who wrote the <inline font-style="italic">Odyssey</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Iliad</inline>?’ or ‘What is the average rainfall of the Amazon Basin?’ The other cowboy has his hands to his face and he is saying, ‘Bart, you fool; you can’t shoot first and ask questions later.’ It is, I have to say, <inline font-style="italic">Far Side</inline> at its best and, of course, aptly describes the absurdity of what the Prime Minister is trying to pull off. Just substitute the Prime Minister and the Treasurer for these two standing cowboys and Australia’s training system for the cowboy who is laid out on the floor—the one who has been shot—and imagine the questions the Prime Minister is shouting over the training system’s mortally wounded carcass.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We do, of course, have insightful gems from the Prime Minister when he asks: why doesn’t Australia have enough skilled workers? Of course, you get the general idea. We have a Prime Minister, a Treasurer and education ministers who have spent nine years shooting the heck out of Australia’s training system and then asking questions about why all of a sudden we have this skills crisis in Australia. This government has had nine years to fix this problem—nine years in which it has created a skills crisis in Australia that is hurting business and hurting families and, most significantly now, is the reason behind the latest interest rate rise that is hurting our economy.</para>
<para>The government has been in office for nine years. We have had a severe shortage of skilled workers, and this Prime Minister has nobody to blame but himself, yet during this time the government has actually turned away 270,000 people from TAFE—that is, just since 1998. We also know that the government has lagged behind the spending of the states when it comes to vocational education and training. We know that, when this government first came in, it actually cut funding to vocational education and training in 1998 and 1999, and it took until 2002 for federal funding to reach 1997 levels again. Is it any wonder that this country is facing the crisis that it is?</para>
<para>We heard the member for Ballarat today ask a question about an important company in her electorate which has put on hold indefinitely eight apprenticeships for Australians in favour of having to import boilermakers and welders from China. This means that we now have a situation in Ballarat where young Australians are not getting the training that they need, and this government decides that it will go for the quick fix of bringing in skilled workers from overseas, all because it has spent the last nine years being complacent about skilled training.</para>
<para>We have already seen a massive increase in the level of skilled migration during this government’s time in office—and this is something that really has not been talked about much—but the government’s response to the skills crisis now that they have finally woken up to it is only one thing, and that is to bring in more skilled migrants from overseas. But that is only a short-term political fix. It is certainly not a substitute for a long-term program of training Australians first. When the Leader of the Opposition raised a question about this in question time, we discovered that this government is actually threatening Australia’s national security because of the skills crisis as well.</para>
<para>The fig leaf that the government have been trying to use for the last little while about this skills crisis had to be removed when the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education was forced to reveal the <inline font-style="italic">Skills at work</inline> document just last week. That revealed—and this is the point that everybody on the government side has finally woken up to—that most of the growth in new apprenticeships is in areas where there is no skills shortage. Most of the growth is going to those areas where we are not short of skilled labour. The share of traditional trades, as part of the new apprenticeships, has actually halved since 1996. Between 2000 and 2003, we saw the number of trades apprentices decline, while sales and service apprenticeships rose by about 25,000 people. That is what has been happening under this government.</para>
<para>The report that the minister was forced to release also shows that a staggering 40 per cent of people who start a new apprenticeship do not even complete their training. They go into one of these traineeships but they never complete their training. That is yet another reason why we have such a serious shortage. Of the people who do complete their training, what do they say about the quality of the training they get? Half of them say that their skills do not improve. They go into these traineeships and, in response to a government questionnaire, half of them say their skills do not improve. Six per cent actually say they have less skills than when they started—damning evidence from the government’s own report that their New Apprenticeships scheme is certainly not meeting the needs of trainees or apprentices. It is not giving them the skills they need, let alone meeting the needs of the economy.</para>
<para>So what is the story from the government and their New Apprenticeships scheme? We have far too few people starting apprenticeships in the traditional trades, we have people not completing their training and we have people saying that the training they get is not actually adding to their skills. The whole New Apprenticeships scheme is really just an exercise in smoke and mirrors. The government have, of course, been crowing for years about the increased number of new apprenticeships. They went about that by introducing a fiddle back in 1998 to include traineeships in a range of service industries and to count them as apprenticeships. Of course, nobody who knows anything about real apprenticeships would count these traineeships as what people would normally understand an apprenticeship to be.</para>
<para>Back in 2002 the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> really got it right when they said in one of their analyses:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The mantra of “record numbers”—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">and the minister should listen to this—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">of apprentices and trainees chanted by successive Federal Government ministers bears some similarity to Soviet propaganda about record production under the command economy.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The paper went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Some experts say the system is functioning in part as a source of cheap labour, and this has driven the record-breaking numbers of people in training.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So that is what has been driving the record number in training. It is not actually people going into proper traditional trades who would be able to address the skills shortage. The <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> were obviously very concerned about this back in 2002, as they went on the next day to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Experts reckon wage subsidies, rather than the urge to train more people, have inflated the numbers.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is what has really been going on. The government have been providing wage subsidies to some companies, calling them traineeships and then trying to count them as new apprenticeships. That is what has inflated the numbers. As the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It looks suspiciously like some churning is occurring, where employers take on workers as trainees and use the generous incentives and low training wages with little commitment to actual training.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The nub of the problem with the system that the minister is now responsible for is:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... the training system may only be serving as a low-wage vehicle to get people into jobs.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is not an apprenticeship. That was two years ago, but the government have been clinging to this fig leaf on record numbers ever since. At last that fig leaf has been removed.</para>
<para>An excellent caller to an ABC radio program in Melbourne the other day really belled the cat on this issue. He talked about his wife, who had been made an apprentice at the age of 50. This story really sums up the problem with the minister’s scheme. At the age of 50, she was made an apprentice in process work, a job she had done for the last 24 years. Describing the Howard government’s New Apprenticeship scheme as ‘the apprentice scheme you have when you don’t really have one,’ the caller said his wife would be retiring in two to three years, just as she finishes her apprenticeship—which is actually, of course, not an apprenticeship. She is just a person who has had some wage subsidy money paid to her employer. She did not get any additional training. As her husband said, it is all about the apprenticeship scheme you have when you do not really have one.</para>
<para>It happens at the other end of the age spectrum as well. Young people go into training for companies, but the companies do not actually provide any training. All they are doing is taking the wage subsidy from the Howard government. All the Howard government are trying to do is pump up the numbers and make it look like they are doing something. They are trying to make it seem as if they have really been addressing this apprenticeship problem, but, most significantly, they are creating what we now have: a very, very serious skills crisis in this country. The Howard government have been misdirecting taxpayers’ dollars where no training is being provided and, in many other cases, putting the training into areas where there is no economic need. As a direct result of the government’s failure on training, we now have interest rate rises. As Tim Colebatch pointed out in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> at the weekend:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The main reason home mortgage repayments rose this week was that the Australian industry is short of skilled workers.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is something that this minister has to take full responsibility for when he goes around and has to front up to all of the people who are paying more for their mortgages: it is all because of this government’s failure on the skills shortage.</para>
<para>What about the cost of renovating? It is not only that mortgage rates have increased; we know that the cost of renovating has increased. If anyone who is listening has had to employ a plumber, an electrician or a carpenter, they would know how expensive it is. Overall, the cost of renovating increased by 8.3 per cent in the December quarter alone.</para>
<para>We know that in the traditional trades we have business crying out for more skilled labour, whether it is metal fitters, toolmakers, mechanics, electricians, carpenters or bricklayers. These are the people who are in desperately short supply. Where do we see this government increasing training? It is increasing training for clerical workers and sales assistants. That is this government’s priority, not the areas where business is crying out for more skilled labour.</para>
<para>Most shamefully, skills as a driver of productivity have dropped by 75 per cent over the last 10 years. There has been a 75 per cent drop in skills as a driver of productivity—all because this government has not made sure that investment is going in where skills are really needed.</para>
<para>We have the Reserve Bank, the OECD and now every Australian mortgage holder saying to the Howard government, ‘It’s your responsibility to make sure that we’ve got the skilled workers that we need so that we don’t see our interest rates continue to go through the roof.’ What have we had from this government? During the election campaign, we had a proposal to introduce these new technical colleges. These colleges will not produce one additional skilled tradesperson until 2010. That is five years away. We have a skills crisis right now—all because this government did not do something five years ago. Now they want to introduce these new technical colleges. In 2010—just get the dimension of what they are doing—there will be 3,600 people coming out of these technical colleges when the Australian Industry Group says that we need 100,000 extra skilled workers in the next five years.</para>
<para>What an initiative from this minister! We have a government that has certainly taken its eye off the ball. It has had plenty of early warnings. It was warned way back in 1999 and in the year 2000 by the Australian Industry Group and by Access Economics. All of these groups have been warning the Prime Minister. Yet on Sunday we had the Prime Minister saying that he identified this skills shortage months ago. Months ago! He identified it months ago. He has his eye on the ball. He has his eye right on the ball. He identified this problem months ago. Years ago, this was a problem. Years ago it was a problem because this government tried to fiddle the figures and did not deliver the skilled workers. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—The end of the speech of the member for Jagajaga could not come soon enough for her. It was a very strained contribution that the member for Jagajaga made today, under awful duress, talking about a subject that she had no real interest in until the last few weeks. During the entire 40th Parliament did she raise this subject matter? Did she raise any questions about increases in apprenticeships or increases in funding for training? No. Back on 7 December and again today she has finally raised some questions about it.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Australian Labor Party are exposed awfully on this entire policy initiative. By their utterances in this place and in other fora around the country, they have proved time and time again why the people of Australia so resoundingly endorsed the government at the last election. The Australian Labor Party are a blunt object when it comes to these sorts of things. Today they have come forward to put the case that suits the Australian Education Union. In debates on matters of public importance, we find that generally the union contributors to Labor Party coffers order the agenda of the day. Today is the Education Union’s turn.</para>
<para>The education system in this country uses a supply driven approach to education and training. That suits the union agenda. This is about supplying people, educating and training them, and hoping that employers will take these people on. This government is very determined to actually create a sense of partnership like there has never been before with Australian industry, to create the industry driven approach that industry itself is demanding. The people who actually hire apprentices are saying to us, ‘We want that partnership.’</para>
<para>Unlike the member for Jagajaga, I have been to 19 regions around Australia in the discussion on the Australian technical college proposal. The member for Casey was in one of those regional discussions; he is going to contribute to this debate today, and I am glad of that. What regions all around this country are saying is, ‘We know what our industry base is; we know what our education and training assets are; we want to support young people in gaining access to trade skills; we want to get on with the job.’ The only thing that the member for Jagajaga has put into any of those regions has been a press release—and it has been the same press release all around the country. It is quite an extraordinary set of press releases I have got from the member for Jagajaga. The northern Tasmanian one changed, I think, when the policy position of the Labor Party on the Australian technical colleges changed a week ago.</para>
<para>At the end of the day, the Labor Party are lazy on this whole issue. They have failed to recognise that since the 1997-98 budget we have increased overall VET funding by 35.5 per cent.</para>

<para>—That has been the increase. I hear ‘Rubbish’ from the people opposite. These are the facts. If you look at the increases since the 1995 budget, the total Australian government contribution to VET has increased by 57½ per cent—a 57½ per cent increase in real terms: these are not nominal terms; these are real terms. This includes a large increase in the measures of support for new apprenticeships—importantly, in what are now regarded as skill shortage needs. Our national skill shortage strategy, which has been in place over the last couple of years, is directly addressing so many of those particular issues, looking at the traditional trades.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>What has happened just this calendar year, without an agreement on national training with the states? The states walked out of that in 2003—walked out and denied 71,000 people the chance to start in TAFEs around this country. That is 71,000 people who, if they had been given a start, might have had some of their demands met. But the states, for political reasons—and I suspect it had something to do with the fact that it was leading into an election year—rewarded TAFE students with, in New South Wales, up to a 300 per cent increase in TAFE fees. Did we get questions from the member for Jagajaga when that was occurring—not this year, but last year? No, there was no mention about that. At the end of the day, there was a 57½ per cent increase—a $1.154 billion commitment this year to the states and territories to deal with their aspects of training.</para>
<para>And then look at the skill shortages in the traditional trades. There is a lot of talk about traditional trades suddenly coming from what was once the great political party of the workers. Labor have lost their way. They are completely lost in the wilderness. We have seen a substantial 38 per cent increase of new apprentices in the trades and trade related occupations, covering trades such as carpenters, plumbers and electricians, even though those occupations only make up 13 per cent of the entire work force. We are seeing young Australians and their now employers backing their ambitions to get on with the job, grow the particular industry that they happen to be a part of and give these kids a solid base for the future. And yet all we hear in this place is a lampooning of the sorts of choices that people make. There was the disgraceful contribution from the member for Jagajaga in her ‘Big Mac attack’ last week, an absolutely disgraceful derision of people who seek traineeships at Hungry Jacks and McDonald’s. For the job snobbery that came from those opposite last week they should hang their heads in shame but there is no word of apology from them.</para>
<para>Since September 1996, we have seen an 18 per cent growth in new apprenticeships in trade and trade related occupations. That is from 126,100 in 1996 to 148,400 in September last year. These are substantial growth figures. The member for Jagajaga gave us a further insight into her thinking on this whole thing and we have seen evidence of this also from the Leader of the Opposition. There seems to be some suggestion that somewhere along the line this government should not only enforce Labor’s plan of ‘no ticket no start’ but also do it before they even get a start. In other words, we should be directing people into trades. We should somehow or other say, ‘You have no choice and no freedom.’ Those opposite do not like freedom of choice. They do not like to trust individual people. They would prefer to see us say, ‘There is a shortage over there so go and have that job or else you get nothing.’ We respect the choices that people make. It is amazing to think that this party—the Liberal Party and the National Party—is the party of the real workers of Australia. We have supported the choices that young people make with such comments as those made by the Prime Minister a weekend ago. He said quite clearly that we should respect the choices that young people leaving school at the end of year 10 make because the opportunities they might like to seek for themselves are real and they are choices they make quite freely.</para>
<para>But let me tell the House why the Labor Party are so embarrassed about this. Apprenticeships are an exercise in building the nation and our work force. We are still paying an enormous price for the legacy of the Leader of the Opposition’s years as the education minister. In fact, it was the single most dramatic decline—</para>

</talker>
<para>—The member for Jagajaga can keep stewing on this but she can wait—I have got an answer for that too. The single most dramatic decline in apprenticeships in training occurred between 1992 and 1994 while under the portfolio responsibilities of the member for Brand. This led to a lack of employers in the system today. Fewer people in training years ago means fewer people in the trades today. Those who took on the trade training are the people most likely to take apprentices today, and there were fewer entered into the system between 1992 and 1994. Let me tell you: they were not just marginal losses. There were 143,900 in 1992—the year of the recession we had to have, engineered by the former Deputy Prime Minister in the Keating government, the member for Brand. The recession we apparently had to have killed apprenticeships to the extent that in 1992 there were 143,900 in the system and 122,700 in 1993. But wait—there is more. In 1994 the figure was 107,100. Then there was some growth the following year, so when we came to office in 1995 we found there was 143,000. We have built that up to almost 400,000 now. The Labor Party of course understand that they are very culpable on this. The so-called workers’ party that let the working people and their children down so severely when they were last in office are now trying to pretend that they have no responsibility for those failure years.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The failure of the member for Brand’s years as the education minister was not the only failure that we need to address. The then current skill needs were a problem, but the failure to provide a framework for employers to allow for future capacity was completely eroded because of that failure to invest in those days. This government is not only about addressing those problems but also about addressing the future needs of Australia. That is why there are so many policy initiatives that were promised during the last election campaign to enhance the position, which I have already put, about the substantial growth that has been earned off the efforts and choices made by young people and by the industries that are now employing them. Those sorts of choices have been endorsed by the fact that training money has backed those choices and given people an opportunity to learn a trade, to learn a skill, to seek employment, to stay employed, to keep the economy growing and to then employ the next lot of potential employers, hopefully always with apprenticeships in every particular case.</para>
<para>At the end of the day, the single most damaging contribution came during the member for Brand’s time. We find ourselves in the position today where there were problems that had been hidden, and those opposite want to continue to hide them. However, our agenda is strong. On top of the $2.1 billion that we are spending this year in this particular area of government activity, there is a further $1.06 billion, which will be confirmed through the budget processes, for initiatives that back those who are in and entering the trades that are relevant to them. So, from 1 July, first year apprentices—these are apprentices in these areas of trade skills shortage—will be able to access a $500 tax free initiative that they will be able to keep. We recognise that there are costs involved in the early days—the first and second years of an apprenticeship. There is also the $800 tool kit allowance. All these initiatives are positive.</para>
<para>If those opposite were really serious about doing something they could take up the challenge I offered during question time to talk to their union masters about amending, in the state context, industrial relations impediments to progress. For years state training and education ministers have gone along to national training agreement conferences and signed off on the idea of certain outcomes, but of course at the end of the day the implementation of those outcomes has failed. In the state of New South Wales in trade skills needs areas there are no school based new apprentices allowed, not because nobody wants to do them but because the unions refuse to have part-time apprentices on the work site. In Western Australia the same story exists in the building and construction trades: no school based part-time apprentices are allowed.</para>
<para>The Australian Labor Party, because their union masters keep putting this case, want to maintain—and in everything we have heard from the member for Brand and the member for Jagajaga this is the case—this outdated notion that we have got to make time based assessments of how we are going and the improvements we make. Something that served us well in the 230 years since the industrial revolution I think somehow in the year 2005 should be on the agenda for change. We would like to see what the training ministers around the country have actually signed up to. Union agreements, award agreements, training packages and all of those state based impediments have prevented a real competency based assessment from ensuring that young people are able to get into that trade if they have got the capacity to do it.</para>
<para>The opportunity to speak on this matter is welcomed by this side because it gives us an opportunity to actually expose the unfortunate complete misunderstanding by the member for Jagajaga of what this entire matter is all about. She constantly wades into water that is too deep on this subject and makes fundamental errors, because where she is coming from and the philosophy which underpins what she is on about are about entrenching what suits the union movement, which does not represent most of the work force in Australia and which needs to update its logic and give young people an opportunity to actually take on the trade skills that we need more of today.</para>
<para>Why are so many employers reluctant to take on apprentices? It is because of the range of complicated paperwork that is still in place. When we released a discussion paper two weeks ago we outlined a number of things. We want to see an industry driven approach. We want to see quality assured and in fact enhanced, and the No. 1 quality is the successful attainment of a trade skill outcome that suits the purposes of industry. We do not want to see a time based approach; we want to see a competency based approach. When individuals perform well, that should be signed off as a performance that guarantees them the trade they are looking for. We want to see a streamlined paperwork system. We will be working with the states. We want the states to actually implement this agreement, not simply to sign off on it and hide behind industrial relations practices that are preventing us meeting the trade skill needs of Australia today. Because of the strong economy we have, as the Treasurer outlined fantastically well in the paper yesterday, and because of the ageing of the work force, the ambition of young people needs to be backed by the choices they can make, and that is what this government does. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I am pleased to second the matter of public importance on the damage the skills crisis is doing to Australian families and businesses and the economy, as raised by the deputy leader. The Prime Minister and the minister at the table, the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education, are in denial that the skills crisis has anything to do with them. We heard them in question time today trying to absolve themselves of any responsibility for the facts that Australian companies are unable to find skilled tradespeople to fill positions today, that Australian kids have missed out on being trained so they could take up these positions today and that companies are having to bring in the quick fix of skilled workers from overseas to solve the crisis. The Howard government sat idly by and watched the skills crisis hit Australian families, businesses and workers. I am not against skilled migration, but when it comes at the expense of local kids’ jobs, not because we do not have enough people to fill these jobs but because the Howard government has failed to put policies in place that would have seen local kids trained to fill them, then you bet I am against it. This is a crisis that the Howard government has created and is doing little to fix.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Yesterday the reality of this crisis was brought home to eight potential apprentices in my electorate. Maxi-TRANS, a company with manufacturing plants in Ballarat and Melbourne, has been struggling to get welders, metal fabricators and boilermakers to meet its contracts. It took the decision to do two things—firstly, to meet its immediate skill shortages it decided to bring in overseas labour on skilled migration visas. Twenty-five of them are to start in Ballarat shortly. It took this decision because it needs trained workers today—not in four years time but today so it can meet its contractual obligations. Secondly, it took the decision to recruit apprentices and contracted the Australian Industry Group to recruit 25 apprentices in Australia. It has, as of Friday, put eight of these apprenticeships on hold indefinitely.</para>
<para>The consequences of this on the Ballarat economy, but also on the individual lives of the young people affected, are absolutely devastating. I spoke to Chris today, a 26-year-old from Linton who has shown great initiative in getting work. For him, being recommended alongside 11 young people for interview at Maxi-TRANS by the Australian Industry Group represented a huge opportunity. It represented having a stable income for the first time since he left school, it represented having a regular income, it represented the end to endless job searching, and it represented the possibility that he could finally get ahead and start saving, maybe, to buy a house. He has been in and out of casual and temporary employment since he left school. He is a 26-year-old young man.</para>
<para>The cruel issue in all of this is that MaxiTRANS would not have had to turn overseas for skilled labour if the Howard government had not dropped the ball on the skills crisis and neglected to train enough people in traditional trades in my electorate of Ballarat. It is outrageous that companies like MaxiTRANS are now having to recruit from overseas to meet their immediate skills needs and that local young people like Chris are once again being forced back onto the casual job merry-go-round. If the government had done its job five years ago, there would be enough skilled tradespeople in Ballarat to fill these positions. That is the point of my question today. If the government had decent incentives in place to train apprentices and if it had invested in TAFE rather than try to dismantle it then there would have been enough trained tradespeople today to fill these jobs in Ballarat. It is policy failure on a grand scale.</para>
<para>The minister, in a piece of spin that I have to say would have made a creative accountant absolutely blush, tried to fudge this issue in question time today by saying that every skilled migrant that is employed in Ballarat will create six jobs. I am not absolutely fantastic at maths, but I would have thought that, if you employed one local person and you got six jobs created out of that, that would make seven jobs. In fact that is actually more. I do not know what point the minister was trying to make. Again, I am not against skilled migration; but if it comes at the expense of opportunities and jobs for local kids, then it is not the solution to the skills crisis.</para>
<para>We have a problem in my community, and it is a problem of this government’s making. This is policy failure on a grand scale. The Howard government needs to face up to the crisis instead of pretending that it does not exist. There is now a serious disconnection between national labour market policies and skills development policies. The underparticipation of a substantial number of young people has severe implications not just in lost opportunities for individuals but also for Australia’s future economic prosperity.</para>
<para>The Howard government is not creating the pathways from school to employment. To fix the government’s policy failure, the Prime Minister wants teenagers to leave school early to unclog the Australian skills bottleneck. It has cobbled together, in the context of an election campaign, the Australian technical colleges policy to hide the fact that it has done nothing in its nine years in office. We will not stand in the way of your technical college proposals, but you have to face up to the fact that they are too little, too late. They do little to address the enormity of the problem that you have left Australian business with. You have completely overlooked communities such as my own. With Australian technical colleges going to Bendigo and Geelong, you have left my community out to dry.</para>
<para>The government has absolutely failed to foresee the nation’s employment needs. There are far too many young people going into areas where we do not have skills shortages, rather than into those areas where there are very serious skills shortages. Extra cash incentives for hiring apprentices and more TAFE places are needed to fix Australia’s shortage of skilled tradespeople, according to employers and to your own <inline font-style="italic">Skills at work</inline> report. Calls for action came as new data showed a boom in new apprenticeship numbers, but most of the growth is in industries where there are no skills shortages. Sectors that are in desperate need, such as plumbing and carpentry—and, in my electorate, metal fabrication, where skilled labour shortages have sent costs soaring—hired 2,000 fewer apprentices in the three years to 2003, according to the government’s own <inline font-style="italic">Skills at work</inline> report. By combining traineeships under the heading of ‘New Apprenticeships’ the government has inflated the figures and is hiding the reality of the skills crisis.</para>
<para>The Howard government is continuing to hurt Australian businesses and regional areas, with skilled vacancies rising over the past year in several key areas. The skills vacancy index reveals that the Howard government has still not addressed the skills shortages for regional carpenters, joiners, fibrous plasterers, bricklayers and solid plasterers—and again, in the case of my electorate, welders, boilermakers and metal fabricators. These latest figures are particularly concerning as they come on the back of rising teenage unemployment rates in regional Victoria. In the area that covers my own electorate, the Barwon West region, the teenage unemployment rate was reported recently to be 35.4 per cent, compared to a 4.8 per cent in inner Melbourne. Such a divide is totally unacceptable and it is not excusable.</para>
<para>It is not just the level of teenage unemployment that is concerning but the speed at which it is increasing. In the Barwon West district—again, the area that covers my electorate and the Speaker’s electorate—we have seen a 10 per cent increase in the space of only a few months. Regional labour markets are suffering a skills shortage today, yet we have a large number of teenagers seeking apprenticeships who are unable to get into TAFE courses. There is something seriously wrong when you have such high rates of teenage unemployment yet local companies are totally unable to get access to skilled workers and are having to import workers from overseas and drop local apprenticeships. It is policy failure on a grand scale.</para>
<para>It is clear that the Howard government’s policies are not doing the job. The Howard government is not performing, particularly in regional Australia. It needs to stop believing its own publicity and give regional Australia long-term policy solutions to its skills shortage and high teenage unemployment rates. In Victoria there were over 86,000 vacancies on Australian Jobsearch in mid-February 2005. The top four occupational groups were labourers, factory and machine workers; food, hospitality and tourism; gardening, farming and fishing; and sales assistants and storepersons. Over the month, 10 occupational groups rose. The largest increases were for medical science professionals; printing trades; building and engineering professionals; and organisation and information professionals.</para>
<para>The government’s own <inline font-style="italic">Skills at work</inline> report clearly shows that most of the growth, and certainly the largest increases in New Apprenticeships, are in areas where there are no skills shortages. The share of traditional trades in the New Apprenticeships has halved since 1996. It is a fact that, between 2000 and 2003, trade apprenticeships declined by over 2,000 while sales and service apprenticeships and traineeships—or so-called ‘New Apprenticeships’—rose during that period. This skills crisis is not sustainable, and the Howard government cannot continue to deny that it exists. The skills crisis is of the government’s own making. Businesses in my electorate need skilled workers today. Kids in my electorate need jobs today. The government has been asleep on the job in relation to the skills crisis, and businesses, families and young people in my electorate are paying for it.</para>

<para>—As usual in a matter of public importance debate we have seen the Labor Party at their best misrepresenting the situation. We have seen on display their policy hypocrisy, their muddle-headedness and their contradictory statements. We have had two rather politically hysterical contributions, from the member for Jagajaga and the member for Ballarat. Those outside and in the public gallery listening would think there was not a single tradesperson working in Australia. There has been no mention of the economic context. You would think it was a totally controlled command economy. You would think there had been no increase at all in spending on vocational education. There was no mention of the states. You would think that every single aspect of vocational education and training was totally controlled by the federal government—in fact, you would think we did not even have states in Australia. But of course that is the big unmentionable with the Labor Party. The federal Labor Party caucus now finds itself an apologist for the six state governments.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The matter of public importance is decided at the opposition’s tactics meeting some time in the morning. The other sad thing is that this time we know it is an exception—this MPI was decided on Saturday when Alan Ramsey published his column. It was decided when he published Rodney Cavalier’s description of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I do not know Rodney Cavalier—I have never met him—but, as Alan Ramsey reported:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">As for the highly protected species of the Left’s Jenny Macklin, Labor’s invisible deputy leader of the past three years ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is the Labor Party speaking, not me. It was decided on Saturday that this MPI would take place and we now have this hysterical contribution on skills in Australia. Nobody says that there is not a skills shortage, but to speak in each contribution—15 minutes and 10 minutes—and not even mention the economic context says one of two things: either total ignorance or utter hypocrisy. As any reasonable economic commentator points out, demand for labour and demand for skilled jobs is a direct function of the strength of the economy.</para>
<para>I can understand why you will not mention anything before 1996. I can even understand that the member for Ballarat might have wiped all of that from her mind on the basis that she was not here. The economic transformation that has taken place in Australia over the last nine years has seen unemployment fall from 11 per cent to five per cent and interest rates fall from 10½ per cent, which you thought were low.</para>

<para>—To have no discussion of the economic context says so much about the modern Labor Party. You would think that the economic transformation which has occurred in the Australian economy just happened like a change in the weather. What happened in 1996? In 1996 there was government debt of $90 billion, there had been budget deficit after budget deficit, unemployment was stuck above eight per cent and interest rates were at 10½ per cent. Step by step the fiscal policy of the nation was reformed, tax policy was reformed lock stock and barrel against all the opposition you could muster, the financial system was reformed and now you have unemployment with a five in front of it. If anyone had predicted that in 1996, they would have been laughed at.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>What has been the consequence? As the Treasurer and the Prime Minister have pointed out, we have in Australia a huge demand for labour. For you that is something that is hard to fathom—we appreciate that and accept it. But imagine the situation for a 16- or 17-year-old Australian in 2005 compared to 1990. In 1990 you are finishing school with no prospect of a job whatsoever. You were given up by the Labor Party and had no prospect of a job whatsoever. Compare that to today, where the world is at your feet in terms of employment.</para>
<para>As the Prime Minister pointed out, if you want to have a serious debate on this you can without degenerating into a hysterical contribution where, as I said at the outset, you would think that there was not a single tradesperson working in Australia today. However, a serious policy discussion is one that actually addresses some of the issues. It is one that addresses the role of the states, addresses some of the funding initiatives that can make a difference and addresses the fact that we do not just have traditional trades that have become more complex and technological but new and emerging trades in some of the regional and rural areas and the outer suburban areas. Success in this area requires every level of government to contribute.</para>
<para>To listen to the member for Jagajaga and then the member for Ballarat you would think that we had slashed funding for apprenticeships. In fact, we have increased it massively. It is worth reiterating some of the facts on that. As the minister previously pointed out, VET funding increased by 35 per cent in the six years between 1997-98 and 2003-04. Over the entire period we have been in government it has increased by 57.5 per cent. As he said in question time in answer to a question I think from the member for Ballarat, school based new apprenticeship commencements have increased by 52 per cent.</para>
<para>In the election campaign and before, we announced further additional funding measures. The member for Jagajaga said that the recent interest rate rise was to do with the skills shortage, whereas all last week the Leader of the Opposition said that the interest rate rise was to do with the government spending. Some of that spending was exactly in this area. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot criticise the funding initiatives and say that the government is wasting money by spending money on apprenticeships, when you say there is a skills crisis, and then at the same time blame a skills shortage for an interest rate rise. This just sums up the utter muddle-headedness on the policy front of the Labor Party. What has actually happened with apprenticeships under this government?</para>

<para>—In the election campaign further announcements were made. As the minister pointed out, 24 Australian technical colleges will be established, all going into areas in regions across Australia where there is a direct skills shortage and a direct need. Why are we doing this? Because frankly we have to step in where the states have failed. As I said at the outset, once again you will never hear any criticism from the federal Labor Party of state Labor governments. That is the bottom line. There was not a mention from the previous speakers on the rise in TAFE fees. So I take it that you agree with a rise in TAFE fees?</para>

<para>—That is good. The member for Jagajaga might do something that she has not done in the last year—put out two press releases in one week. We will see whether your word is worth it. Put out a press release this afternoon criticising each state government for raising TAFE fees, which represents a direct barrier to apprenticeships and training throughout Australia. These technical colleges we are introducing right across Australia are going to have a federal response in areas where there is a skills shortage. There are also practical issues like the $800 for a toolkit. That was something criticised by the Labor Party in the election campaign but something tangible to every new apprentice that takes that up after July.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>In the short time remaining to me, I would like to address some of the other issues that are often lost in this debate and that certainly we will never hear about from those opposite. They talk about skills shortages. The truth is, the shortage in labour is across every sector of the economy and it is a function of economic growth. That is a problem that has arisen because of economic strengths. Another area, which the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations touched on in question time today, is also critical—that is, the area of mature age employment. I personally think that the business community need to adjust their attitudes to mature age employment. They need to have a more open attitude to mature age workers and they need to look at that across some of those important sectors where there have been job layoffs in recent times.</para>

</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">It is good that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is present in the chamber, because we do excellent work in Laos. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade proposes to construct a new chancery building for the Australian Embassy in Vientiane, Laos. The present building, formerly a factory, was purchased by the Australian government in 1960 and refurbished for its current use. The building is in poor condition and is no longer adequate to meet the embassy’s requirements. It is too small to accommodate the staff of some tenant agencies, who have to be housed in separate leased buildings. It does not meet current security and occupational health and safety standards.</para>
<para>It is proposed to build the new chancery on vacant land acquired by the Australian government in 1997 as part of a reciprocal arrangement which provided land for the Lao Embassy in Canberra. The site would satisfactorily meet the long-term needs of the embassy, in terms of both location and function. The present chancery building will be sold. Other options considered were leasing accommodation for the chancery, and building on the existing site. Neither of these options is viable. No suitable buildings are available for lease in Vientiane. Construction of a new chancery on the existing site would not meet boundary setback and other security requirements.</para>
<para>The estimated cost of the new facility is $11 million. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is planned to commence in March next year and to be completed in the first half of 2007. I commend the motion to the House.</para>

<para>—The opposition support the <inline ref="R2299">National Security Information Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline>. We believe one particular area of the legislation requires further examination, an area which I will refer to during the course of my contribution, but certainly the purpose and intent of the legislation are supported. The legislation basically extends to civil proceedings the framework that the House has previously considered with respect to the National Security Information Legislation Act 2005. That extension is in accordance with recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission in its report <inline font-style="italic">Keeping secrets: the protection of classified and security sensitive information</inline>, which was released in May 2004 and formed the basis for the preparation of the primary act and this amending legislation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The bill we are considering today will be the second set of amendments made to the original act. The first of those amendments were made by the National Security Information (Criminal Proceedings) Amendment (Application) Bill 2005, which was passed by both houses of parliament last month with the opposition’s support. Indeed, I think it can be fairly said that the opposition supported the expeditious passage of that legislation. Those first amendments were necessary to resolve ambiguities and, in particular, to confirm that the regime that applied to national security sensitive information applied to those proceedings that had already been commenced, not only to those proceedings commenced after the legislation was introduced. That bill also clarified that, rather than issuing a separate notification at every stage of the proceedings, it was only necessary for the prosecutor to issue one notification to the Attorney-General that national security sensitive information might be adduced during the course of the proceedings. We gave our support to that legislation and recognised the importance of passing it expeditiously, given its potential impact on criminal proceedings.</para>
<para>We will cooperate again in the expeditious passage of this legislation. We do think there is one issue with respect to preserving a civil court’s ability to ensure fairness between the parties in circumstances where national security sensitive information may be adduced in the course of the proceedings, but I will refer to that a little later.</para>
<para>The National Security Information Legislation Amendment Bill 2005, as I have said, constitutes the second amendment to the primary act. I know that, appropriately, the Attorney-General in his second reading speech went through the major provisions of the legislation in quite some detail, but I think it is appropriate in our contribution to recognise at least the major thrust of those relevant provisions. Consistent with the primary act, the bill introduces a mechanism for the handling of national security sensitive information in civil proceedings.</para>
<para>We do have an issue which we have raised with the government, and I think it has been recognised in our discussions: civil proceedings may perhaps be too broadly defined. They have been defined in the bill as any proceedings in a court of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory other than federal criminal proceedings. They include contempt proceedings in relation to other civil proceedings or federal criminal proceedings. Civil proceedings are defined to include all stages of the civil process, including discovery, ex parte applications, interlocutory proceedings and appeal proceedings. It is appropriate that all stages of civil proceedings are included. In particular, the discovery process, which is increasingly utilised in civil proceedings, is obviously a point where national security sensitive information could become relevant or come to light.</para>
<para>Our concern with the definition that I have referred to is that, in referring to civil proceedings as proceedings in a court of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory other than federal criminal proceedings, it could be interpreted—at least with respect to the application of that provision—to also include state criminal proceedings, which is not the intention of the government. While that is probably made clear in other provisions of the entire act, we believe it is better for that ambiguity to be resolved. I think the government is prepared to do that.</para>
<para>As I have previously indicated in respect of the primary act, it is important to have a framework for dealing with national security sensitive information. This bill is consistent with the framework of the primary act as it applies to federal criminal proceedings. In particular, the legislation will operate once the Attorney-General has issued a notice to the parties and to the court that security sensitive material is likely to be adduced in the proceedings. Notice can be given at any time during the proceedings. It is also specified that, if the Attorney-General is a party to the proceedings, the Attorney-General must appoint another minister to undertake the administrative function of issuing the certificate in those circumstances. That is obviously to avoid the conflict of interest that may arise in civil proceedings but would not arise in criminal proceedings, where the party would obviously be the Director of Public Prosecutions in federal proceedings.</para>
<para>Before there is a substantive hearing as to whether or how the national security sensitive information should be dealt with, it is important that it be appreciated. The legislation tries to encourage agreement between the parties as to the best mechanism for handling that information, with the assistance of the court. In that context, either party has the ability to request that a conference be held between the parties and the court. The Attorney-General must be given notice of that conference in order to participate and, on behalf of the Australian people generally, to provide the Attorney’s view of the appropriate method of handling that national security sensitive information. Should an agreement be reached in that conference phase, the court is empowered to make an order giving effect to the agreement.</para>
<para>I should say that, before the notification by the Attorney-General to the court, there is likely to be a previous stage where the Attorney-General is notified by the parties. In that context, the bill places an obligation on the parties to proceedings to notify the Attorney-General where they think it is likely that national security sensitive information will arise. That is obviously a public duty, which I think responsible legal practitioners will recognise in discharging it by appropriately judging and making an assessment as to whether national security sensitive information is likely to arise.</para>
<para>The bill essentially defines the context in which national security sensitive information may arise. It may arise in the form of a document, in the context of evidence to be given orally by a witness or in the context of the mere presence of a witness, given that person’s involvement in an event or in the context of gathering information that is national security sensitive information. When the Attorney-General gives a certificate that indicates how that national security sensitive information should be dealt with, that certificate can state that the information should not be adduced. It could give a recommendation that it be summarised, or that it be adduced in a method that redacts the security sensitive information references in the document.</para>
<para>After that certificate has been issued, the court has an obligation to hold a closed hearing to consider the validity of the Attorney-General’s certificate. Whilst the holding of a closed hearing is obviously controversial—and, for literally centuries, our system of justice has operated on the presumption that justice will be open and public—in this instance there is obviously a balance between the public’s interest in open justice and the public’s interest in preserving national security sensitive information. It is obviously vital to protect that information not only because of the potential for misuse of the information but to guarantee that we continue to receive national security sensitive information. Potentially, intelligence from other countries or, in some circumstances, the disclosure of national security sensitive information could prejudice the safety or the lives of the person or persons who provided the information. Clearly there are weighty public interest considerations to be balanced, but we believe that it is appropriate to hold a closed hearing to consider what will happen with the Attorney-General’s certificate.</para>
<para>It is also important to recognise that the Attorney-General’s certificate is considered entirely by the court. The court has the power to set aside that certificate, to agree with the certificate or to modify the certificate. While there is initially an executive act to determine what will happen with the national security sensitive information, the final body that determines whether it will occur is the court, and that is regarded as being appropriate by both sides of the House.</para>
<para>In the context of the closed hearing, there is a significant issue that has been controversial and could again be controversial in the context of civil proceedings—that is, whether a non security-cleared party or a non security-cleared lawyer should have the right to be present during the entirety of the closed hearing or to have access to the entirety of the national security sensitive information that will be considered by the court in that closed hearing. While there obviously should be a presumption that a party is present during the course of considerations that affect their interests, it has to be seen in the context that the party and/or their counsel or advocate would automatically have that entitlement if they obtained an appropriate security clearance. I will say something about that, which is of itself an issue, a little later in this contribution.</para>
<para>After the closed hearing, the court has an obligation to give reasons for its decision on what it will do with that certificate. Whether the court agrees with the certificate, modifies it or sets it aside, the court has to give reasons. Those reasons have to be given to the parties, and the record of the closed hearing has to be made available to a security cleared, self-represented litigant or advocate. Full appeal rights are preserved against that decision of the court.</para>
<para>With regard to the issue I flagged a short while ago, perhaps it is an overstatement to say there is a requirement for security clearance. I should state it in reverse: a lawyer or advocate, security cleared to the appropriate level, has a right to be present during all stages of even the closed hearing and to have access to the security cleared material. Contrary to what has been expressed by some organisations, the bill does not make it mandatory for a lawyer to be security cleared. Although I am always willing, if an opportunity arises, to fairly criticise the government, I do not believe that criticism of the government is justified in this instance. This is not a situation where the Attorney-General is seeking to exercise a power of veto or to exercise a gatekeeper function as to which advocate will appear in proceedings. Under this bill, the litigant has a choice either to retain their status as a self-represented litigant or to choose a lawyer. If they or their lawyers decide not to obtain a security clearance, certain consequences will follow—that is, they may not have access to the security sensitive material or be given the opportunity to contribute to the debate on how that security sensitive material should be dealt with by the court—but it is not a situation where obtaining a security clearance is mandated.</para>
<para>If a self-represented litigant or their counsel, despite receiving notice that the regime may be activated through the intention of a party to present security sensitive information, elects not to seek security clearance then the Secretary of the Attorney-General’s Department may advise the court and the court may advise the litigant before them of the consequences of themselves or their advocate not having the security clearance and indicate that they have the option of retaining alternative counsel who would, if security cleared, have access to all the security sensitive information that might be considered by the court. But again, it is not a situation where the obtaining of the security clearance is mandated by this legislation.</para>
<para>The bill to enable the advocate or the self-represented litigant to obtain a security clearance makes it mandatory for the court to adjourn the proceedings to enable that security clearance to be obtained, again facilitating that course of action. Again, I refer specifically to section 39A of the act which is a facilitative provision—that is, the Secretary of the Attorney-General’s Department notifies a party or their advocate that the mechanisms of this legislation may arise and it is for the litigant or their advocate to make the decision whether or not to obtain the security clearance. Again, that is entirely consistent with the Australian Law Reform Commission recommendations. The Law Reform Commission was careful to not recommend—and specifically did not recommend—that obtaining a security clearance was mandated but it did recommend that certain consequences should follow if the security clearance was not obtained. The Law Reform Commission quite openly discussed those competing public policy considerations.</para>
<para>Our justice system is dependent upon a counsel being able to represent the interests of their clients without fear or favour, without being beholden to the executive in any way, shape or form—or indeed, subject to them being an officer of the court, not being beholden to, other than to respect orders of, the court and not being an extension in any way of the court but rather at all times being fearless in their representation of their client’s interests. But that has to be balanced with the consequences of national security sensitive information not being handled in accordance with our agreements with other nations, and that is that it will only be provided to those persons who have appropriate security clearances, or in the context of information potentially being mishandled through access to a person who does not have a security clearance.</para>
<para>I know some people reading this speech may say that is a terrible imputation to make against a potential legal counsel, given the professional standards that they have to comply with and so forth. I specifically state that I am not making any such imputation but when you consider the right of a litigant and indeed the right of counsel to appear in proceedings, to present and to advocate their cases to the best of their ability against the public interest of preserving the source of national security information and the integrity of the information, it is not an overly burdensome obligation, as the Australian Law Reform Commission pointed out, to require counsel to obtain a security clearance. Indeed, I think it is fair to say that you would have to try pretty hard not to obtain a security clearance. It would certainly be the exception rather than the rule for a person to be denied an appropriate security clearance in those circumstances.</para>
<para>The government has agreed in the context of a self-represented litigant that if a self-represented litigant was denied a security clearance then this could have a particularly significant impact if that self-represented litigant was not given the opportunity to appear in a closed hearing or was not given the opportunity to receive and comment upon the security sensitive information. But the government has, we believe appropriately, agreed to provide for a special circumstances scheme to effectively provide legal aid to a self-represented litigant in that situation to obtain the services of a security cleared legal representative to have access to that material. The bill also amends other acts, in particular, the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act and the Judiciary Act, essentially to remove the right to challenge the Attorney-General’s certificate under the provisions of the judicial review legislation. That is appropriate because there are full rights of appeal against the orders of the primary court that are made in the closed hearing.</para>
<para>In concluding, I move into an area where the opposition do have some concern. We note that the bill specifically retains, as is appropriate, the right of a civil court to direct its own proceedings and indeed to make such orders and give directions—that is not the precise language—as are necessary to ensure that the parties before it are afforded a fair hearing.</para>
<para>But our concern is how that works in practice. It is perhaps not as difficult in the context of federal criminal proceedings where, after having considered how information is to be adduced, a court may say, ‘Look, in that context it is not possible for an accused to receive a fair hearing and we will in those circumstances stay the proceedings.’ But it may well not be appropriate—and, indeed, it may be most inappropriate—for civil proceedings to be stayed. It could cause real injustice to a party: for instance, a party to a personal injury suit having their proceedings stayed may be deprived of compensation or, indeed, a party to a defamation proceeding having their actions stayed may well suffer an injustice in the context of not obtaining confirmation for the damage they have sustained from any defamatory context.</para>
<para>Equally it is possible that a restriction or an impediment on a defence in a defamation context may be relevant, and it could indeed conceivably be relevant in the case of a media company making imputations that a person was or was not involved in terrorism resulting in their being made a respondent to defamation proceedings. I am not sure that this legislation has addressed circumstances where those media outlets may wish to plead truth as a defence or what impact this legislation would have or would potentially have on their ability to plead truth if their ability to present evidence that was available was impeded as a result of either the Attorney-General’s certificate or the Attorney-General’s certificate as modified by an order of the court.</para>
<para>I am not sure that the government have thought through the consequences of the application or potential application of these provisions in the context of civil litigation, which, as I have said, is quite different indeed from the conduct of federal criminal proceedings. So it is that issue, and it is quite a narrow issue, that we would like examined by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee. We believe that can be considered and reported on expeditiously. That would also avail the committee of consulting more broadly with state governments, who we understand from at least cursory contact may not have been consulted as much as they appropriately should have been consulted in the context of this legislation affecting, or potentially affecting, the way some civil proceedings are conducted. Obviously civil proceedings are within the jurisdictions of those state governments. I know the government have said that there is precedent for dealing with information that is not admissible before a court and have referred to the case of Rann v Olsen, but, having read that case, we are again not satisfied that that addresses the issue. Staying a civil proceeding is quite different from staying a criminal proceeding, and staying a civil proceeding may in fact cause real injustice to the parties.</para>
<para>In summary, we have to be realistic. There is a need for the legislation. In raising that issue, I am not criticising the thrust and purpose of the legislation. There is a need to protect national security sensitive information, whether it be adduced in criminal proceedings or whether it be adduced in civil proceedings, as the Australian Law Reform Commission recommended. There are competing demands for open justice. In response to that I have indicated that there is a particular part of the proceeding that will be closed—that is, the closure to consider the national security sensitive information. There is a public interest in ensuring that Australia has access to intelligence from other countries and that security sensitive information is properly dealt with and handled and, hence, should not be disclosed to people who do not possess the appropriate level of security clearance. But, again, balancing that public interest with ensuring that national security sensitive information is dealt with properly does not, we believe, cast an overly serious burden, given the consequences, on lawyers or litigants to obtain security clearance—particularly in the context where there is an automatic right to obtain an adjournment for that purpose and in which circumstances the litigant or their lawyer is entitled to access the national security sensitive information. So, while it is legitimate and valid to raise concerns, it is important that in raising those concerns people are not blind to the broader national security interest in preserving the integrity of national security information and our access to it. So we believe the substance of the bill has established the appropriate balance and we do support the purpose and intent of the legislation, subject to the one reservation that I mentioned.</para>

<para>—I rise in the House today in support of the <inline ref="R2299">National Security Information Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline>, which seeks to amend the National Security Information (Criminal Proceedings) Act 2004 by extending the operation of the act to include certain civil proceedings. The government sought to strengthen the protections for security sensitive information through the introduction of this act as part of our fundamental role to protect Australia’s national security. These protections were significantly enhanced with the commencement of the act on 11 January 2005. The act applies to federal criminal proceedings to protect information that relates to, or whose disclosure may affect, national security. It aims to facilitate the prosecution of an offence without prejudicing national security and the rights of the defendant to a fair trial. This bill extends those protections to include certain civil proceedings where such security sensitive information arises, including accident compensation and family law proceedings. It is essential that security sensitive information can be used by parties in such civil cases without jeopardising Australia’s national security.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The bill introduces a number of measures to strengthen the protections in civil proceedings for information that is likely to prejudice our national security. The bill broadly adopts the process of federal criminal proceedings under the principal act, with some necessary departures to account for the particular nature of civil proceedings, and applies to all stages of the civil process, including discovery and interlocutory proceedings in any Australian court. The key differences in a civil regime are mainly that the Attorney-General or an appointed minister gives written notice to the parties and court, rather than the prosecutor, that the act applies to a civil proceeding and that the Attorney-General may appoint a minister to perform the Attorney-General’s functions under the act where the Attorney-General is a party to the proceedings, which is not necessary in federal criminal proceedings which invariably involve the Director of Public Prosecutions. The permitted circumstances for the disclosure of information must have been extended. The Attorney-General or appointed minister must be given notice of a pre-hearing conference and may attend the conference, given that the Attorney-General may not necessarily be a party to the proceedings and may not otherwise be aware of it. At any time during the civil proceedings, the Attorney-General or appointed minister may agree with the parties to the proceedings to an arrangement about any disclosure and the court can give effect to such as an order. The security clearance provisions extend to the parties, as many parties will be representing themselves in civil proceedings. It is also extended to their legal representatives and the assistants of legal representatives, given that, unlike defendants accused of serious criminal offences, parties to civil proceedings come from all walks of life and many may already have, or qualify for, a security clearance. Where a witness may disclose security sensitive information in giving evidence, the court must order a witness to provide a written answer to the question. Upon receiving the answer, the court must adjourn the proceedings. This departure from the procedure for criminal proceedings will seek to reduce delays and adjournments during the civil proceedings.</para>
<para>A party must notify the Attorney-General, at any stage of civil proceedings, where that party expects to introduce information that relates to, or disclose information that may affect, national security. This includes information that may be introduced through a document, a witness’s answer to a question or the presence of a witness. Upon notification, the Attorney-General considers the information and determines whether disclosure of the information is likely to prejudice national security. If so, the Attorney-General may issue a certificate which either prevents the disclosure of the information or allows the information to be disclosed in a summarised or redrafted form. The certificate will remain in force until it is revoked by the Attorney-General or until the court makes an order in relation to the disclosure of information. Any certificates which have been issued must be considered at a closed hearing of the court before the substantive hearing commences. If the Attorney-General issues a certificate after the substantive hearing has begun, the court must adjourn the hearing and hold a closed hearing.</para>
<para>Whilst the court has the discretion to exclude from the closed hearing court officials, parties and the legal representatives of a party who are not security cleared, the Attorney-General or the appointed minister can intervene in a closed hearing. The non-security cleared parties and their legal representatives are able to make submissions to the court on arguments relating to the disclosure of information or calling of a witness. The court considers the original information and the certificate as to whether there would be a risk of prejudice to national security if the information were disclosed or disclosed otherwise than in accordance with the Attorney-General’s certificate.</para>
<para>The court must also consider whether the making of the order for the exclusion of information or a witness would have a substantial adverse effect on the fairness of the hearing. The court may also consider other relevant matters. In its deliberation, the court must give greatest weight to the national security considerations. The court may make orders in relation to the disclosure of information the subject of the certificate. The court may also order that the information be disclosed in a summarised or edited form—disclosed in full or not disclosed at all. The court retains its power to determine that the proceedings should be stayed in the event that a party would not be guaranteed a fair hearing, even after the court makes an order after the closed hearing.</para>
<para>The bill provides for the court to give reasons to the parties and their legal representatives for its decision to make an order for admitting, excluding or editing the information or excluding a witness. The bill allows the Attorney-General being represented at the closed hearing to challenge the proposed publication of the statement of reasons to ensure that it does not disclose information which is prejudicial to national security. The bill provides that the court must make a record of the closed hearing and that this record can be disclosed to security cleared self-represented parties or legal representatives. The bill allows the Attorney-General being represented at the closed hearing to request that the record be varied to ensure that it does not disclose information which is prejudicial to national security to security cleared parties or their legal representatives.</para>
<para>The bill also allows the parties or the Attorney-General being represented at the closed hearing to appeal an order of the court for admitting, excluding or editing information or excluding a witness. Clause 38E sets out a procedure for protecting information that a party to a civil proceeding knows or believes a witness will disclose in answering a question whilst giving evidence in the proceeding where that information relates to, or the disclosure of which may affect, national security. This clause applies during the proceeding itself. In this case, subclause 38E(2) requires the party to advise the court of his or her knowledge or belief. Subclause 38E(3) requires that the court must then order that the witness give the court a written answer to the question. Subclauses 38E(4) and 38E(5) require the court to adjourn the proceedings on receiving the written answer and to give the written answer to the Attorney-General respectively. Subclause 38E(6) states that the court must continue to adjourn the proceedings until the Attorney-General gives the court a certificate or advice under subsection 38F(5) or 38F(7) respectively. The adjournment gives the Attorney-General sufficient time to consider whether to issue a certificate or advice.</para>
<para>The procedure differs from the procedure used in federal criminal proceedings in several ways. In a criminal proceeding, once the prosecutor or defendant informs the court of the requisite knowledge or belief the court must adjourn the proceeding and hold a closed hearing in which the witness gives the court a written answer to the question. The court must show the answer to the prosecutor. If the prosecutor believes the answer relates to, or its disclosure would affect, national security, the prosecutor must advise the court of that knowledge and, as soon as practicable, give notice to the Attorney-General. Once advised, the court must adjourn the proceeding until the Attorney-General gives a certificate or advice. The difference between the two procedures is explained by the substantial involvement of the Director of Public Prosecutions in criminal proceedings. There is no equivalent to the director in the civil context. The exceptions arise to simplify the process and avoid unnecessary adjournments where there is already a certificate in place in relation to that information.</para>
<para>The bill also allows the parties to confer before the substantive hearing in a civil proceeding to consider issues in relation to disclosure. If the Attorney-General is not a party to the proceeding, the Attorney-General or his or her legal representative may attend the conference. The court may issue orders to give effect to any agreements made by the parties and the Attorney-General or the appointed minister. The bill requires the parties to the proceeding to be security cleared. Upon receiving written notice from the Secretary of the Attorney-General’s Department, a party or a party’s legal representative may apply to the secretary of the department for a security clearance at a level that the secretary considers appropriate.</para>
<para>The bill extends the security clearance requirement to all parties to the proceedings and not just legal representatives. If a party or a party’s legal representative does not apply for a security clearance within 14 days after the day on which the notice is served or within such further period as the secretary allows, the secretary may advise the court that a party or a party’s legal representative has not sought clearance. The court may then advise the party of the consequences of not being security cleared or of being represented by an uncleared counsel and may recommend that the party seek a security clearance or engage a legal representative of his or her own choosing who has been given, or is prepared to seek, a security clearance from the department at the level considered appropriate by the secretary in relation to the information.</para>
<para>While the bill changes the way that information that may affect our national security is used in civil proceedings, it also seeks to uphold the interests of the parties to the proceedings. I note that the provisions of protection in civil proceedings proposed in this bill were also recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission. The proposed measures demonstrate that this government has indeed facilitated an accurate balance between protecting national security and protecting the rights of the parties. I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para>—Regrettably, the events of the last four years, from September 11 in New York and Washington and October 2002 in Bali to the 2004 Madrid bombings and more recently the bombing of the Australian Embassy in Jakarta, are all evidence of the new international security environment. This is a security environment in which the work of intelligence agencies, hitherto largely outside the public domain, is now increasingly in the public domain, as we grapple with the difficult question of balancing our new national security needs on the one hand with the proper protection of civil liberties on the other.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The <inline ref="R2299">National Security Information Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline> deals with the protection of classified information in our civil justice system. That the protection of national security classified information in court proceedings, both civil and criminal, has led to the introduction of the measures proposed in this bill points to the increasing reliance on intelligence agencies in the fight against terrorism. The opposition supports the purposes of the legislation because, while still in need of refinement, it seeks to protect national security information before the courts—information that is vital in the continued fight against terrorism.</para>
<para>The debate on the legislation provides an opportunity to restate at some length our overall approach to terrorism, as outlined in our foreign policy statement prior to the last election. Terrorism is not a new phenomenon in history. It is a form of asymmetric warfare waged by non-state actors, aimed at removing governments or bringing about policy changes by governments. The inherently asymmetric nature of terrorism is illustrated by Zachary Abuza, who noted recently in relation to Jemaah Islamiah that the Bali bombing in which 202 people were killed and which led to the estimated loss of more than $1 billion in tourism revenue for the country itself cost under $35,000. Terrorism is truly asymmetric warfare.</para>
<para>When we speak of al-Qaeda we speak of an operation that, while operating on a truly global basis, between 1996 and 2001 was headquartered in Afghanistan, where it enjoyed the political support of the ruling Taliban. Peter Chalk points out that the relationship between al-Qaeda and the Taliban was one of mutual self-interest:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">In return for basing privileges in Afghanistan, bin Laden provided the Taliban with both troops and finance (reportedly as much as US$100 million over six years) to prosecute the war against the Northern Alliance. The Afghan haven provided al Qaeda with a secure location in which to train its operatives and plan its attacks, while money and personnel from bin Laden allowed the Taliban to rapidly overrun and marginalise the NA.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In Asia, al-Qaeda’s influence was extended most visibly into Kashmir, the southern Philippines and Indonesia, with some evidence of activity in Malaysia as well. In Kashmir, al-Qaeda’s linkages were strongest with two militant groups in particular: Lashkar-e-Taiba, LeT, and Jaish-e-Mohammed, JeM. The names of these two organisations can be translated as ‘the Army of the Pious’ and ‘the Soldiers of Mohammed’. In the southern Philippines, al-Qaeda is believed to have some connections with groups that have traditionally been dedicated to the establishment of a separate Islamic state in Mindanao. In Indonesia, al-Qaeda’s most obvious connection has been with Jemaah Islamiah.</para>
<para>According to Rohan Gunaratna, one of the leading international analysts of al-Qaeda, the impact of the successful US-led coalition invasion of Afghanistan and the removal of the Taliban regime has been the dispersal of al-Qaeda organisers, operatives and financiers to other parts of the world, principally to South-East Asia, the Horn of Africa, the Middle East, parts of the former Soviet Union and Europe. As Gunaratna observes:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">To compensate for the loss of its training and operational infrastructure in Afghanistan, al Qaeda is seeking to establish new bases in Yemen, the Philippines, Indian Kashmir, Georgia and Chechnya.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Gunaratna has also noted that the frequency of al-Qaeda attacks has increased since September 2001. Before then, al-Qaeda conducted attacks, on average, every two years. Since that time, attacks from al-Qaeda and associated organisations have been taking place, on average, every three months. Gunaratna predicts that al-Qaeda will conduct fewer military operations in its own right in the future but will instead focus on coordinating attacks by other groups with which it is affiliated around the world. Gunuratna points to five such groups: Ansar al-Islam in Iraq; the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat in Algeria; al-Ansar Mujahadeen in Chechnya; Hizb-i-Islami, the Islamic movement of the Taliban; and Jemaah Islamiah in South-East Asia.</para>
<para>Abuza, a keen analyst of JI, has described in detail the establishment of this organisation in 1993-94 by two radical Indonesian clerics, Abu Bakar Bashir and the late Abdullah Sungkar. Both had been living in exile in Malaysia until 1984, returning to Indonesia only following the collapse of President Suharto’s New Order regime. They had earlier been active recruiters for the Mujahadeen in Afghanistan. It is Abuza’s contention that al-Qaeda first saw South-East Asia as a back office for their operations elsewhere in the world where they undertook fundraising, recruitment, the forging of documents and the purchasing of weapons and explosives. It was only later that South-East Asia, and Indonesia in particular, became its own discrete theatre of operations for Jemaah Islamiah once the latter had developed its own capabilities. Gunaratna’s view is that those capabilities were significantly enhanced following the dispersal of various al-Qaeda operatives from Afghanistan and Pakistan to South-East Asia following the coalition invasion of 2001. According to Abuza:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">JI is not a large organization—with perhaps no more than 500 members, though if one adds the affiliated paramilitaries ... membership increases to between 1000 and 1500, but this is a high estimate.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Although writing more than 12 months ago, Abuza provides the following disturbing observation about JI’s pattern of activity:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">JI is in full recruitment mode. Their recruits are not just students from the madrasa of the region, but young technical students and disenfranchised youth with little prospects. They are younger, angrier and they are technically savvy.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Abuza also points to disturbing training links between MILF and the Abu Sayyaf group in the Philippines and Jemaah Islamiah. There are also growing concerns about the potential cooperation between JI and separatist movements among the six million Muslims who live in southern Thailand. According to analysts from the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies in Singapore, while al-Qaeda and JI penetration of southern Thailand may have been limited to date, the Krue Se mosque incident is being used by Islamist groups in other countries as a mobilisation tool. There are also concerns among analysts about links between some religious schools in southern Thailand—the pondoks—and certain madrasas in Pakistan.</para>
<para>There is growing evidence of the movement of JI personnel across South-East Asia. The interrelationship between training bases in various parts of the region and fields of operation in other parts of the region underlines the importance of dealing with JI and al-Qaeda on a region-wide basis. It is widely recognised across the region that uncoordinated, national responses to terrorism will ultimately be inadequate in dealing with the terrorist challenge.</para>
<para>Recruitment to these organisations is also an important consideration. Abuza and other academics speak of the importance of ‘underlying conditions’, including mass unemployment, and ‘diminished expectations, frustration and aggression, especially among educated youth’. These conditions make it easier for terrorist organisations to recruit and, in any balanced strategy to deal with terrorism in the region, they must also be addressed.</para>
<para>A further factor now fuelling the radicalisation of Islamic youth in South-East Asia is Iraq. Gunaratna in particular is scathing about the impact of the coalition invasion of Iraq on the overall strength of the Islamist militant cause beyond Iraq. As Gunaratna observes:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Washington’s decision to intervene in Iraq complicated the security environment rather than reduced the threat of terrorism.</para>
<para class="block">Al-Qaeda and its associate groups are aggressively harnessing resentment among Muslims living in the west and elsewhere. In Iraq’s immediate region and beyond the growing anger directed towards the US and its partners has provided Islamist groups with the opportunity to exercise greater influence among Muslim communities.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">On 16 February 2005, the new director of the CIA, Porter Goss, said in his testimony before the Senate Committee on Intelligence:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Islamic extremists are exploiting the Iraqi conflict to recruit new anti-US jihadists. These jihadists who survive will leave Iraq experienced in and focused on acts of urban terrorism. They represent a potential pool of contacts to build transnational terrorist cells, groups, and networks in Saudi Arabia, Jordan and other countries.</para>

<para class="block">Beyond the underlying social, economic and political factors adding to the capacity of terrorist organisations to recruit in various parts of the Islamic world, we must also recognise the continuing impact of the financing of terrorist training and recruitment operations. A core element of this lies in the return of large-scale opium and heroin production to Afghanistan in areas beyond the control of the central government in Kabul. According to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, UNODC, the opium-related income of Afghanistan’s farmers and traffickers was approximately $US2.3 billion in 2003—half of the legitimate GDP of that country. A proportion of this terrorist/narco finance from Afghanistan also assists in funding the operations of al-Qaeda’s associated organisations around the world, including Jemaah Islamiah in South-East Asia.</para>
<para>While the foreign minister and the government have focused their priorities on the other side of the world, the terrorist threat to our own region remains significant. Terrorist threats in South-East Asia are not in the headlines at present. The problem is that terrorists in South-East Asia are planning to be in the headlines again—and soon. I use this opportunity in this parliamentary debate to warn the parliament that Jemaah Islamiah is out there in the region—and maybe not just out there in the region but closer to home—planning its next attack, planning to do our people harm. And all this occurs at a time when the government’s efforts are primarily directed elsewhere. The reality is that Jemaah Islamiah is now acting more like al-Qaeda. Al-Qaeda’s operating strength used to exist in its capacity to train new members of smaller terrorist organisations such as Abu Sayyaf. But today some regional terrorism experts—Gunaratna and Borgu—believe that Jemaah Islamiah is providing similar training opportunities to those traditionally offered by al-Qaeda—most prominently the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and Abu Sayyaf. Jemaah Islamiah has, therefore, emerged as a significant ‘force multiplier’ in South-East Asia, emulating al-Qaeda in both recruitment and training. The loss of Afghanistan for al-Qaeda is effectively being compensated for by the increasing JI membership in South-East Asia.</para>
<para>Terrorism experts that we have had contact with suggest that the most likely location for a future attack is Indonesia or the Philippines. However, given the escalation of the threat posed by increasing JI numbers, other countries could now be within that spectrum. These experts have told me privately that an alternative strategy for JI could be to use Indonesia or the Philippines as an operational base to hit a neighbouring country, such as Australia. At the top of the threat spectrum remain soft US, UK, Singaporean and Australian targets, primarily in the form of tourist locations and government facilities. The threat remains real.</para>
<para>Despite the dimensions of the terrorism challenge, the government has yet to put in place a comprehensive national counter-terrorism strategy or a comprehensive regional counter-terrorism strategy. As Borgu, of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, noted in April last year: ‘Despite the emphasis we seem to place on the seriousness of the terrorist threat, Australia still has no overarching national counter-terrorism strategy. We have lots of plans to deal with terrorist attacks after they occur but no whole-of-government, whole-of-nation strategy to fight it on an ongoing, long-term basis.’</para>
<para>Nor has the government articulated a coherent long-term regional counter-terrorism strategy. Instead Australia finds itself party to a miscellany of bilateral and regional memoranda of understanding, agreements and declarations with a range of states on a range of often unrelated counter-terrorism related tasks. Each of these initiatives when considered in isolation may well be worth while. However, they do not add up to a coordinated counter-terrorism strategy for the region. Nor has the government outlined the regional machinery through which any such comprehensive strategy could be developed. This has now become an urgent need. We argue that a comprehensive regional counter-terrorism strategy should be based on five core organising principles: prevention; protection; emergency response management in the event that terrorist attacks occur; coordinated capacity building across the region; and a hearts and minds strategy to address the underlying political, economic and societal factors which terrorist groups exploit to their advantage. A regional counter-terrorism strategy can only deliver results when it has the support of key regional partners. Maintaining positive bilateral relationships with the countries in question is critical to ensure that that occurs.</para>
<para>On prevention we need an improved national and regional intelligence effort. Governments must have access to accurate, timely and comprehensive intelligence to break up terrorist cells and to prevent terrorist attacks. Australia has been beset by a number of well-publicised intelligence failures in recent years. The recently completed Flood inquiry highlighted the failure of the Australian intelligence agencies adequately to recognise the threat by JI prior to December 2001. As Mr Flood noted, Australia and regional countries should have known by the end of 2001 much more about Jemaah Islamiah, its development of terrorist capabilities and its intentions towards Western targets. First-rate intelligence requires closer cooperation between Australian intelligence services and those of our allies and key regional partners. There are considerable gaps in the region’s overall intelligence capabilities, and there are also flaws in the region’s intelligence-sharing arrangements, due in part to the absence of a strong tradition of cooperation in this area. In the words of one regional intelligence official, the level of substantive exchange and information is minimal.</para>
<para>We argue that Australia should move to negotiate intelligence-sharing protocols across the region to facilitate better flows of intelligence on regional terrorist organisations and individuals. Australia should assist in developing an enhanced open-source database on regional terrorist organisations. This could be based on the existing database being developed by the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies in Singapore. This database should help regional governments track and understand the evolving regional terrorist threat.</para>
<para>Enhanced cooperation between the region’s police services must also form part of terrorism prevention efforts. Australia already operates modest capacity-building and cooperation programs with the police services of Indonesia and the Philippines. While these initiatives are welcome, they are piecemeal in nature. A comprehensive, region-wide capacity-building effort must be initiated, based on a full audit of existing policing skills and capabilities. Australia, in partnership with key regional governments, should undertake a comprehensive audit of police and law enforcement capabilities. Based on this audit, Australia should formulate, in consultation with regional partners, a long-term law enforcement capability enhancement program. The purpose of this program would be to fill capability gaps over time through the coordinated provision of regional training programs and other forms of support.</para>
<para>Greater regional cooperation is also required in the areas of passport security and border controls. Most regional police services and intelligence agencies regard national borders in South-East Asia as highly porous. Officials from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs have engaged in a number of useful bilateral and regional capability-building exercises. Australia, in partnership with regional governments, should audit capability gaps in regional border control systems. On the basis of this audit, a range of capacity-building initiatives should be developed, including focused training programs and the provision of specialised equipment.</para>
<para>We must cut off the sources of terrorist financing, and combating terrorist financing must be a key element of any effective terrorism prevention strategy. This must begin in Afghanistan, the source of much narco finance for terrorist organisations and operations world wide. Australia should work closely with the Afghan government, the UN and the UK to combat opium production and narcotics trafficking in Afghanistan, the major sources of funding for al-Qaeda today. Australia should assist in funding a range of counter-narcotics initiatives, including funding for the training of police commandos in Afghanistan and targeted measures to help farmers reduce their dependence on opium production.</para>
<para>There is a need to strengthen legal frameworks in some countries to enable them to better deal with terrorist organisations. In Indonesia, for example, legal and practical impediments have created constraints on the government’s capacity to ban suspected terrorist organisations. Australia should work closely with Jakarta in support of its efforts to strengthen legal provisions dealing with terrorists and terrorist organisations. Australia should press Jakarta during the upcoming visit of the President of Indonesia and ministers on the desirability of proscribing JI and associated organisations. This has yet to occur, and represents an ongoing legislative and legal constraint for law enforcement agencies and counter-terrorist efforts in Indonesia.</para>
<para>A further element of a comprehensive counter-terrorist strategy is the adequate protection of Australian interests and individuals abroad. The government must attach the highest priority to protecting Australia’s diplomatic and consular representatives in the region. There must be a total and comprehensive review of the adequacy of physical protection of all Australian embassies, consulates and diplomatic residences. The review should examine any outstanding requests from our embassies and consulates for improved security arrangements that have not yet been met by the government. The review should also include the security of transport arrangements for diplomatic and consular staff, including the need for armour-plated vehicles.</para>
<para>Governments must also be concerned about the security of Australian citizens and institutions abroad. On this question, the recent submission of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to the Senate inquiry into Australian expatriates is worthy of note. In 2002-03, 5,700,000 Australians visited other countries, 759,000 resided abroad and 88,711 registered with the relevant diplomatic or consular post. That is a large gap. In 2002-03, 1,500,000 Australians visited South-East Asia, 45,000 Australians were resident in the region and 21,000 were registered with the relevant Australian post.</para>
<para>Australia should enhance its travel advisory system by ensuring that travel agents are required to dispense travel advisories at the point at which travel arrangements are made. We are concerned, also, about the vulnerability of soft Australian targets overseas. We believe that a better strategy is necessary for providing protection for such targets. These elements form part of an overall integrated comprehensive regional counter-terrorism strategy for Australia, together with emergency response strategies and with capacity building in other related areas. As we approach legislation such as we have before us in the parliament at present I call on the government to take seriously the challenge which terrorism represents for Australian interests at home and in the region so that these challenges can now be met. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I would like to thank all the members for their contributions to this second reading debate. On behalf of the Attorney-General, who could not be in the House this afternoon, I would particularly like to thank the member for Barton, the member for Forrest and the member for Griffith, who made contributions of varying quality to the second reading debate. Of course, the member for Forrest’s was the best contribution to the debate. The member for Griffith and the member for Barton made useful, workmanlike contributions.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The <inline ref="R2299">National Security Information Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline> adds another dimension to the current protections for security sensitive information. Late last year the parliament passed legislation to protect information that may affect our national security if disclosed in federal criminal proceedings. That legislation targets the increasingly common evidential use of classified material in prosecutions for terrorist offences. The current bill provides similar protections for classified material in civil proceedings. Parties have sought to use such material in a wide range of civil cases, including family law and accident compensation proceedings. As with criminal proceedings, it is important that parties can use classified information without risk to our national security.</para>
<para>The bill introduces a regime for protecting security sensitive information in civil proceedings that broadly follows the regime in federal criminal proceedings. One main difference is the ability of the parties to apply for security clearances to gain access to security sensitive information. This was not an option in criminal proceedings, where defendants accused of terrorist offences are unlikely to receive such a clearance. In contrast, parties to civil proceedings are more likely to be self-represented and are also more likely to be eligible for a security clearance. When introducing the bill the Attorney-General advised the parliament that where a self-represented litigant in a civil matter is refused an appropriate security clearance, that individual would be eligible to apply for financial assistance under the non-statutory special circumstances scheme. I would now like to present new guidelines which specifically refer to this scheme.</para>
<para>The assistance would be subject to the Attorney-General, or his or her delegate, being satisfied that the individual would suffer financial hardship if the application were refused. The guidelines provide that successful applicants would receive financial assistance for the legal costs and related expenses of engaging a security cleared legal representative to attend the closed hearing and any related appeal. In this way the government is alleviating the costs of complying with the bill.</para>
<para>The government has also included provisions in the bill to protect the interests of parties. In making an order about disclosing information or calling a witness, subclause 38L(7) of the bill requires a court to consider whether the exclusion of information or a witness would have a substantial adverse effect on the substantive hearing in the proceeding. This means that the court must consider the effect of the order on both parties to the proceeding. Even if the court initially determines that the order would not have a substantial adverse effect, clause 19 states that the court can still stay the proceedings if it later finds otherwise. The court has an inherent jurisdiction to stay proceedings to prevent an injustice. The bill does not change this common law position. The bill makes it clear that where the court has made an order under subclause 38L, this inherent jurisdiction will not be affected. These measures demonstrate how the government is continuing to protect Australia’s national security without compromising the integrity of our legal system.</para>
<para>Since introducing the bill I have become aware of a drafting error that could lead to a misrepresentation of the term ‘civil proceeding’ as used in the legislation. For that reason I will shortly be moving an amendment to the bill to clarify the meaning of ‘civil proceeding’. I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para class="block">The <inline ref="R2299">National Security Information Legislation Amendment Bill 2005</inline> was introduced into parliament on 10 March 2005. As foreshadowed earlier, the amendment I am moving rectifies a drafting error that could lead to a misinterpretation of the term ‘civil proceeding’ as used in the bill. Item 1 amends schedule 1, item 11 of the bill to remove the references to a federal criminal proceeding and to a contempt proceeding. ‘Civil proceeding’ will mean any proceeding in a Commonwealth, state or territory court except a criminal proceeding.</para>
<para>Omitting the word ‘federal’ corrects a drafting oversight that may have meant that a civil proceeding under the bill could include a criminal proceeding under a state or territory law. The intention underlying the initial inclusion of the wording relating to contempt was to ensure that where contempt was not an ordinary criminal offence created by statute but within the inherent power of the court to punish, it should be treated as a civil proceeding. On further consideration it is apparent that statutory contempt offences will fall within the definition of a criminal proceeding under the National Security Information Criminal Proceedings Act 2004. By contrast, contempt punishable under a court’s inherent powers will fall outside the definition of a criminal proceeding and would therefore constitute a civil proceeding. The reference to a contempt proceeding in the definition of civil proceeding is therefore unnecessary.</para>

<para class="block">The purpose of the bill before the House is to abolish the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. The <inline ref="R2223">bill</inline>, which is largely identical to the bill passed by the House of Representatives and considered by the Senate in June 2004, is part of a major reform of the Australian government’s approach to Indigenous affairs.</para>
<para>The bill does one thing: it abolishes ATSIC. The bulk of the Australian government’s reforms to Indigenous affairs are proceeding independently of this bill.</para>
<para>In June 2004, the bill was referred to the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Indigenous Affairs. The committee reported back on 8 March 2005 saying that the abolition of ATSIC was a ‘fait accompli’. The delay in abolishing ATSIC has already cost the taxpayer around $2 million in commissioners’ salaries.</para>
<para>Significant changes to the way in which services are delivered to Indigenous Australian people have already been introduced. A quiet revolution has been under way since 1 July 2004, involving a radical new approach which will see Indigenous people empowered and taking control of their own destiny.</para>
<para>As a government, we have no intention of repeating the failed ATSIC experiment. ATSIC elections cost between $7 million and $9 million and annual remuneration for commissioners alone costs the taxpayer almost $3 million and a further $1 million for travel expenses. No-one could sensibly argue that there are not far better ways to spend that sort of money to benefit Indigenous people. We are culpable if we do not direct every available dollar to the welfare, needs and assistance of Aboriginal communities as they find new ways for self-reliance and independence.</para>
<para>The National Indigenous Council is not a replacement to ATSIC. It is a very different sort of body. It is not a representative body—its members were selected for their expertise.</para>
<para>They will not be the only group that the government will take advice from. There are numerous representative bodies and committees at the national level that will continue to express their views. Other Indigenous leaders will do so also—and we will listen.</para>
<para>Some senior Indigenous Australians are discussing the development of their own national representative body. If such a body emerges, it will be theirs—governments should not interfere by imposing a statutory model.</para>
<para>Indeed many of the submissions to the Senate select committee said that unlike ATSIC, which was a European construct, representative Indigenous bodies should be developed by Indigenous people themselves.</para>
<para>At the regional level we are working with state and territory governments, regional councils and a range of Indigenous organisations and communities to establish new regional representative arrangements. We recognise that different models are likely to emerge to suit different regions and jurisdictions.</para>
<para>But we do not want these representative and advisory bodies to prevent us from dealing directly with local families and communities. Our approach to shared responsibility agreements, based on a 20- to 30-year community vision, will be the vehicle for that.</para>
<para>All these measures have been put in place independently of the bill before the House. Most of the provisions of the bill are consequential to the abolition of ATSIC or put in place transitional or other provisions arising from the abolition of ATSIC.</para>
<para>This includes the transfer of the Regional Land Fund to the Indigenous Land Corporation and of ATSIC’s Housing Fund and Business Development Program to Indigenous Business Australia. Other land and property assets will be divested to Indigenous interests prior to the abolition of ATSIC or will be transferred to the Indigenous Land Corporation or Indigenous Business Australia for divestment or use for the benefit of Indigenous people.</para>
<para>The Office of Evaluation and Audit, OEA, which audits ATSIC programs, will audit the full range of Australian government Indigenous specific programs. It will continue to investigate the performance of bodies that obtain funding from Indigenous specific programs.</para>
<para>The bill that was introduced in the Senate in December last year includes a few minor changes to the previous bill in order to take into account the passage of time and to clarify some specific provisions.</para>
<para>The bill now before the House includes amendments moved by the Australian Labor Party. The opposition amendments include delaying the abolition of regional councils to 1 January 2006. The government rejects that amendment.</para>
<para>The bill before the House includes three amendments moved by the Australian Democrats. The amendments would limit the power of the minister to give general directions to Indigenous Business Australia, which is taking over some of ATSIC’s programs; insert a right to seek review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of decisions by Indigenous Business Australia to refuse a business loan; and, require the Minister for the Environment and Heritage to consult an Indigenous advisory committee and an Indigenous expert on the Australian Heritage Council about proposals which could impact on Indigenous heritage values. We cannot accept these amendments because they are contrary to the intent of the bill. Accordingly, I will be moving during the consideration in detail stage to remove both the Labor Party’s and the Australian Democrats’ amendments from the bill. I will give quite detailed explanations of the bases for the government’s rejection of these amendments. It is not appropriate in a second reading speech to canvass these matters in detail, but I look forward to the debate at the time of the consideration in detail.</para>
<para>I trust that the opposition will now fulfil the commitment given on its behalf by the former leader of the Labor Party, the former member for Werriwa, to abolish ATSIC and allow the expeditious passage of the bill so a new era of dealing with Indigenous communities at a formal consultative level at least can begin to gather steam in the interests of Indigenous people especially. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</para>

<para>—I rise to speak to the second reading of the <inline ref="R2223">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2005</inline>. Labor will be supporting the second reading of the bill but we will be moving our own second reading amendment. This bill formally abolishes ATSIC. However, it is important to acknowledge up front that the abolition of ATSIC is already an administrative fait accompli. The opposition agree with the government that major changes are required in the form of national representation for Australia’s Indigenous people, but that is essentially where the agreement ends. We fundamentally disagree with the government’s new arrangements and its approach to implementing them. Labor have a firm policy in support of a national Indigenous representative body—and when we say that we mean a representative body, not a phoney or fake advisory council that operates in secret.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The government’s new National Indigenous Council is not chosen by Indigenous people and does not represent them in any meaningful way that we would all understand as being a basic form of representative democracy. This is doubly sad, given that the government’s new administrative arrangements are in such disarray. I will be moving a second reading amendment, as I have indicated, in line with that accepted by the Senate which highlights Labor’s concerns with the government’s approach. The government’s approach to Indigenous representation and self-determination is crystal clear. Its attitude to ATSIC and towards Indigenous Australians was clearly articulated in 1988, when the bill to establish ATSIC was first introduced into parliament. The ATSIC Bill was heavily amended by the opposition of the day, now the government. The debate in the Senate lasted for some 40 hours. At the time, the bill was the most amended by an opposition in the history of the Australian parliament. It is worth reflecting on some of the remarks made at the time by the now Prime Minister, John Howard. On 11 April 1989, when in opposition, Mr Howard told the House:</para>

<para>—As Senator Carr pointed out, John Howard’s words at the time of ATSIC’s establishment have proven to be nothing more than unfounded scaremongering, in terms of talking of establishing a nation within a nation and of dividing black against white. Yes, of course—to answer the minister—there have been obvious difficulties. There have been, indeed, more than difficulties; there have been real concerns. But in terms of your fundamental approach and your fundamental recognition of basic rights of representation and basic principles of democratic representation, those words indeed were scaremongering. If the minister wants to adopt them, we will be particularly interested.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Who can forget the great act of reconciliation in the year 2000, when hundreds of thousands of Australians walked across bridges in this country to support the cause of reconciliation between Australia’s Indigenous and non-Indigenous citizens—walking across bridges being, of course, so tremendously symbolic of building bridges between the traditional owners and occupiers of our land and Australian citizens. Far from being divided one against another, black and white Australians came together in pursuit of true reconciliation. Unfortunately, it is now the government, in pushing its assimilation agenda, that has produced division and resentment, as the minister’s recent interjection in this debate has proven. It has done so without even making progress in addressing the ‘practical’ issue of Indigenous disadvantage, which unfortunately is still a shame that the Australian people must recognise and, with our resources, address.</para>
<para>During its time in government, the coalition has used ATSIC as a convenient scapegoat for all the problems in Indigenous service delivery. Indeed, the evidence presented throughout the Senate committee inquiry confirmed that ATSIC has often taken the blame for the broader failure of both Commonwealth and state government programs. We recognise that state governments of both persuasions could do better in this area, as well as the Commonwealth. But, at the end of the day, what we provide in terms of redressing what is unfortunately still an embarrassment to this nation means that, without fear or favour, you have to get stuck into both sides of politics. These include in areas such as education and health, for which ATSIC has no responsibility and in which mainstream programs have been letting Indigenous people down. The reality is that, despite the restraints placed on it, ATSIC has managed many successful programs. Despite its faults, ATSIC and its regional councils have demonstrated that Indigenous self-determination can be a powerful force for community and economic development.</para>
<para>There are many examples of Indigenous controlled programs that have succeeded. This is in line with the experience of other nations which have been far more successful than Australia in addressing indigenous disadvantage through self-determination—the very concept that the government consistently denigrates. Unfortunately, this government refuses to learn the lessons of Indigenous success, preferring to paint all Indigenous controlled programs as corrupt failures. Now ATSIC’s successful programs are to be mainstreamed. Whether they can maintain their unique features and, more importantly, their effectiveness remains to be seen, but the evidence so far does not give grounds for optimism.</para>
<para>Under the auspices of ATSIC, the Community Development Employment Projects scheme established in the 1970s continued to grow and develop. The CDEP provides meaningful work for thousands of Indigenous people within their own communities and supports vital community development and cultural activities. Its essential character is now under threat as a result of its move to the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations. In February of this year, Minister Andrews released a discussion paper on the future of CDEP. The discussion paper is a perfect example of the government’s failure to learn from success and its desire to adopt a so-called clean-slate approach to Indigenous policy. The paper says that, under the new arrangements, CDEP organisations will benefit from the assistance and experience of other employment and business services. There is no proposal to ask successful CDEPs whether, for instance, they would be in a position to mentor others to follow their successful examples. There is no proposed mechanism to support any form of sharing of best practice among CDEPs.</para>
<para>The government’s approach to consultation with Indigenous people about issues of critical importance to them is also demonstrated by its CDEP consultations. Following the release of the paper, Mr Andrews’ department immediately launched a four-day whistlestop tour of Australia allegedly to consult with Indigenous people and service providers. From what Labor has been told, departmental officials were able to offer very few answers in response to the questions and concerns of the participants who effectively had no real option in the consultation process. Indigenous communities, some of whom only get mail deliveries once a week, were then given a month to respond to the discussion paper. One month for remote communities during the wet season becomes particularly ridiculous when you realise the minimum community consultation period in the ACT, with its well-educated population and geographically small area, is six weeks. But, of course, it turns out that, like the abolition of ATSIC, the changes to CDEP are also a fait accompli anyway, so that casts doubt on the genuineness of that consultation process.</para>
<para>CDEP organisations have to submit expressions of interest for running the program under the new arrangements just four days after the closing date for submissions—and those four days are the Easter weekend. This approach to so-called consultation is entirely consistent with the development of its arrangements to replace ATSIC. Throughout the inquiry by the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Indigenous Affairs, Indigenous participants told the committee that their voices had not been listened to in terms of recognising and respecting the dignity of the traditional owners of our country. That is indeed concerning.</para>
<para>All of the above is not to say that ATSIC was without fault. As we have recognised, as I think people of objective mind have recognised, like the government’s $1.4 million review the Senate committee identified a number of problems with ATSIC’s structure and operation. But these issues could be addressed to make a replacement national representative structure for Indigenous people a success. That is clearly what Indigenous Australians want to see. Professor Dodson, in evidence to the Senate inquiry and in relation to the national Indigenous leaders meeting which was held in Adelaide in 2004, said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... the most significant point of agreement—overwhelming agreement; there was not one dissenter—was the need to maintain a national representative Indigenous voice. Participants at the meeting stressed that they—we, if you like; Indigenous Australians—should elect for themselves who would represent them at a national level.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is not an unreasonable request by any means. The Senate committee recommended that the government provide active support and funding for the formation of a national Indigenous elected representative body and provide it with ongoing funding.</para>
<para>Labor calls on the government to heed the cause of Indigenous Australians, and indeed all fair-minded people, and to negotiate with Indigenous people to establish a new national Indigenous representative body based on sound democratic principles and self-representation. Labor will be actively consulting with Indigenous people about the new representative arrangements that they want. It will be listening to what Indigenous Australians have to say about how they want to be represented and will respect the dignity of those representations that will be made as part of its consultation processes. As I said at the beginning of this speech, while Labor is committed to the development of a new national representative voice for Indigenous Australians, it accepts that the abolition of ATSIC is a fait accompli.</para>
<para>However, Labor has moved an amendment in the Senate in relation to regional councils and that amendment is reflected in the bill that is now before the House. The opposition amendment extends the life of the ATSIC regional councils by six months—in line with recommendation 4.3 of the report of the Senate select committee tabled in parliament on 8 March 2005. Labor talked to the government about this proposal at some length over quite a period of time. Initially it appeared that the government was going to be reasonable about this, and there are a number of reasonable government senators who I suspect are quite uncomfortable about how the government’s approach to this legislation has developed. The opposition’s reasoning in dealing with the matter was absolutely sound and absolutely moderate. The irony of the situation is that the existence of strong regional frameworks is going to be essential for the government to achieve the kind of effective practical partnerships that it says it wants with Indigenous people.</para>
<para>The government’s own policy approach of shared responsibility depends on these partnerships having credibility among Indigenous people. The government’s policy depends on having a credible regional body with which it can negotiate regional partnership agreements which are supposed to provide the framework for the community-level shared responsibility agreements. The Senate select committee inquiry uncovered a remarkable degree of uncertainty within the bureaucracy about how shared responsibility agreements will operate. It also found deep concern and a substantial degree of confusion in Indigenous communities about the abolition of ATSIC regional structures, how they are going to be replaced and how the new arrangements will work.</para>
<para>The Murdi Paaki Regional Council is one of the most successful regional councils and one that is working hard to ensure that a sound regional structure remains after the commission has gone. While this western New South Wales area has received praise from the government for its efforts, Mr Sam Jeffries from the council expressed serious concerns in the Senate committee hearings based on his own experience. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Murdi Paaki experience demonstrates that the best way to connect government service delivery for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is through institutions of Indigenous representation, advocacy and participation which have legislative endorsement and accountability. Regional and community governance are the leadership tools that return responsibility to us, lift us out of the poverty trap and break the generational cycle that has handed down a legacy of social dysfunction.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">They are words which I will not read again; they are on the record and they really cut to the chase. We would focus the government precisely on those comments by a person who, clearly, is practical, is a person of competence and is a person of achievement in genuinely representing the interests of Indigenous Australians. The government’s approach is to wait for new structures to ‘emerge’—to use their term—without putting resources into communities to support their consultation process.</para>
<para>During the Senate select committee hearings it became clear that regional councils which have been working on developing new representative models that suit their communities need more time. These communities are willing to do the hard yards but they cannot do it without support. You would think that the government would embrace the continuation of a structure which provides certainty and enables consultation at the regional level while the new arrangements are still being bedded down. Instead, the government’s form of consultation really seems to be requiring these bodies to negotiate about terms of surrender rather than about something that is going to genuinely work in these communities.</para>
<para>A key reason for extending the life of the regional councils is to ensure some certainty and stability while regions and communities endeavour to establish new arrangements. It is for this reason that the amendment includes a clause which prevents current ATSIC commissioners from returning to positions in regional councils and being elected to the position of chair. This was a refinement discussed with the government and reflects how seriously Minister Vanstone was considering supporting this amendment before she was overruled by the Prime Minister’s office.</para>
<para>In conclusion, Labor stand beside Australia’s Indigenous people in their struggle for social justice. We as Australians collectively have a responsibility to deliver that. We will work with Indigenous Australians to achieve the restoration of a national representative structure. We will respect their dignity as the traditional owners of this land. We will recognise our responsibilities to them. Labor’s second reading amendment expresses our concern about the direction of Indigenous policy under the Howard government’s proposal, which is essentially, as the minister indicated in his interjection, one that is still frightfully divisive. I now move the opposition’s second reading amendment, which is:</para>

<para>—I am very pleased to be able to support the <inline ref="R2223">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2005</inline> and I certainly oppose the amendment just moved by the honourable member for Barton. I do not think that in 2005 any of us should feel particularly proud of the situation of our Indigenous people in this country. There is no doubt that over the years Indigenous people have fallen behind the general community. However, since 1996 when the government was elected there has been substantial progress to improve outcomes.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I think that traditionally in Australia there seems to be an attitude that to throw money at a problem is in some way going to solve it. But it is pretty clear when you look at the level of Indigenous disadvantage—in infant mortality, housing, education and so on—that money alone is simply not going to solve the problem. Personally, I believe that there has been too much emphasis on process and insufficient emphasis on outcome. Quite appropriately, both sides of politics have endeavoured to involve Indigenous people in the decision-making process, but our focus always ought to be on outcomes and not on process.</para>
<para>I spoke to a Queensland medical specialist some time ago who used to run quite a small program which did not cost very much and was designed to improve Indigenous eye care. It was taken over by an Indigenous bureaucracy. The program cost more and achieved less. While as a community we might feel that we are salving our collective consciences by assigning the decision-making process to Indigenous people, I believe the ultimate aim ought to be to redress Indigenous disadvantage, not simply make us all feel great at having passed the buck to Indigenous people to make the decisions.</para>
<para>The government have very real reason to be proud of the many achievements that we have gained through Indigenous programs. We have introduced new initiatives and there has been a very strong focus on practical reconciliation in the key areas of health, housing, employment and education. The government are entitled to reflect on our record and be proud, but there is of course much more to be done. The community is particularly keen to see accountability for money spent on Indigenous programs at the same level as the community demands for other government expenditure. A lot of the haemorrhaging headlines we have seen in relation to ATSIC make it very difficult for any government to get the necessary community support for spending the level of dollars that we need to spend to redress Indigenous disadvantage. I think the community is quite happy for money to be spent on improving the situation of our Indigenous people as long as the community and Indigenous people are seen to be getting value for money. When we read stories of theft of money from government programs and of ATSIC allocating government resources for Indigenous people to benefit individual commissioners, the situation plays into the hands of those people who do not have the interests of Indigenous people at heart.</para>
<para>That is why I very strongly support this bill. This bill is not about removing Indigenous people’s opportunity to make decisions; it is all about improving Indigenous outcomes. I am pleased that the opposition does accept that ATSIC has had its day. In fact, when you look at what people have said about ATSIC over the years, it is fairly clear that ATSIC has been a failed experiment. I would like to draw the attention of honourable members to an editorial in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper of 24 February this year. It is quite a long editorial. It is headed ‘Death throes of ATSIC a disgrace’ and in effect it is quite critical of ATSIC and the fact that, even though the Howard government’s new Indigenous council has made a promising start, ‘it is being starved of oxygen by an ATSIC sideshow that is costing taxpayers $65,000 a week in commissioners’ wages’. The editorial goes on to state:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Meanwhile, the problems in Aboriginal communities—of hygiene, disease, substance abuse and sexual violence—continue to grow worse, just as they have done throughout ATSIC’s 15-year existence. ATSIC has gone from a failed experiment to a shamed one. Will Labor finally do the right thing when the bill to abolish ATSIC returns to the Senate next month?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Like many honourable members, I have a very high personal regard for the honourable member for Barton. I think he is a person of great individual integrity. He is a person whom I respect tremendously. However, I am disappointed that he has moved this motion in the House to extend the life of regional councils. The delay in passing the ATSIC bill has caused a great deal of confusion and damage to Indigenous Australians. We have a situation whereby the ALP is seeking to extend the regional councils by six months. This will simply cause more confusion and further hurt Indigenous Australians.</para>
<para>Indigenous Australians and others are aware that these councils were to finish up on 1 July this year. Some councils have been active and replacement arrangements are in place. An extension would mean that these plans would be disrupted. Other regional councils have dropped the ball and we have a situation where regional councils do not really have a high mandate from Indigenous people, and I am told that only one in five eligible voters actually bother to vote. You could imagine what people would say about the mandate of the federal government of the day if only 20 per cent of Australians bothered to vote at the ballot box. The regional councils’ job was to produce regional plans. A lot of effort went into these but many regional councils have complained that no-one reads them or takes any notice of them. We saw in-fighting in the ATSIC board. This has also extended in many cases to regional councils, and the government wants Indigenous people to construct their own regional bodies if they actually want them.</para>
<para>I point out that since 1996 the government has a lot to be proud of but that there is still more to be done. The proportion of Indigenous people who own or are purchasing their own home has increased from one in four in the 1970s to one in three today. The proportion of Indigenous students completing high school has quadrupled since the 1970s. The infant mortality rate has been cut by more than three-quarters, from up to 20 times the non-Indigenous rate to three times that rate. That is still too high but it is a very substantial improvement. The Aboriginal imprisonment rate relative to that of non-Aborigines has been declining, as have average per capita deaths in prison. So while there is more to be done, much has been achieved and it is the responsibility of the government to try to bring about an outcome so that we are able to build on the successes that we already have. The government has taken the initiative in reducing Indigenous disadvantage. A record $2.9 billion will be spent this year on Indigenous specific programs alone. The ALP are always talking about apologies, but one could really ask what they have done in a practical sense. The Australian government has provided $120 million for real initiatives, including counselling and parenting programs, language and cultural programs, and the link-up network, a record preservation project. These are all meaningful outcomes. The opposition simply like to lambaste the government, accusing us of not listening, being dogmatic or moving forward in a way that Indigenous people do not want. I think it is important to focus on outcome. It is pretty clear that the opposition have not been listening properly. We are not abolishing special programs; we are putting in place machinery to make the mainstream agencies take up their required responsibilities. Many of the Indigenous programs that mainstream agencies now manage will benefit Indigenous people in the future.</para>
<para>It is important to recognise that this bill is a very vital step forward in the progress of Indigenous people. I am someone who is passionate about outcomes for Indigenous people. I am not proud of what we have achieved as a society with respect to our Indigenous people over the last 200 years; in fact, we should be ashamed. However, this government has achieved much. It is a work in progress and the abolition of ATSIC is an important step in this direction.</para>
<para>I gather that the party whips have agreed to limit the amount of time for members to speak on this bill to 10 minutes, so it is probably appropriate at this stage that I commend the bill to the House. I encourage the opposition not to persist with their second reading amendment, because I think the future of our Indigenous people is far too important to be politicised. It is something where we should be working hand in hand to improve outcomes. I know that on both sides of politics we passionately desire improved outcomes. This bill is a step in that direction. I thank honourable members for their support because it really is vital in 2005 that we continue the progress that we have made. ATSIC, of course, has failed. We need to find better outcomes and this bill is an important step in that direction. I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para>—Less than three weeks ago I met with a group of young Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians in Newcastle to mark the 40th anniversary of the 1965 freedom ride, when a busload of Sydney university students, led by Charlie Perkins, went on a journey through New South Wales to expose the level of discrimination against Indigenous people. One of the main aims of the 1965 freedom ride was to highlight examples of segregation, including at public swimming pools, picture theatres and pubs where Aboriginal people were refused entry. The 1965 freedom ride helped to bring the ingrained discrimination and racism in New South Wales country towns to the attention of the wider Australian public and was part of a broader push for Aboriginal civil rights taking place across the country.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the original freedom ride, ReconciliACTION filled a bus with young people passionate about reconciliation and retraced that original freedom ride journey whilst making a documentary about the experience. The Freedom Ride 2005 bus left from the University of Sydney on Saturday, 12 February. It then travelled north-west through Wellington, Dubbo, Gulargambone, Walgett, Moree, Boggabilla, Toomelah, Goondiwindi, Inverell, Tingha and the Myall Creek memorial to Lismore, Bowraville, Kempsey, Taree, Purfleet, Newcastle and then, of course, back to Sydney.</para>
<para>I had the privilege of meeting this group of passionate young Australians when they came to Newcastle and it was refreshing to hear them talk about their views of what they had learnt and their enthusiasm for shaping a better future. The bus returned to a celebratory homecoming in Redfern on Saturday, 26 February. The aim of the Freedom Ride 2005 was to get Australians talking again about the racism of today as well as to connect with young people across New South Wales to find out their views on how Australia can move forward in reconciliation. The House can be assured that these young Australians, like those they met on their journey, do not support the government’s notion of practical reconciliation or the soon-to-be-complete lack of any national representative body for Indigenous Australians.</para>
<para>Given the historical significance of both the 1965 and 2005 freedom rides and their special place within the history of struggles for Aboriginal rights in Australia, it is with great sadness that, less than three weeks after the completion of Freedom Ride 2005, the Australian parliament is being asked to abolish the only body that currently provides national representation for Indigenous people, with no plans for a replacement representative body—and I emphasise ‘representative’. It is not the abolition that is the main issue to me, to my constituents and to people concerned about reconciliation but the failure of this government to assist Indigenous people to determine the replacement body and their new form of representation. That is something of great regret.</para>
<para>The <inline ref="R2223">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2005</inline> will abolish ATSIC and, while the opposition agree that there needs to be a major revamp of the form of national representation of Australia’s Indigenous people, that is where we part company with the government. We strongly disagree with the government’s approach to implementing its new arrangements and moved a series of amendments in the Senate last night which have the support of the minor parties to improve this otherwise dismal and backward-looking piece of legislation. It certainly inspires no hope. Labor support the principle of a national Indigenous representative body, and this support is reflected in our policy. Regrettably, the government’s new National Indigenous Council is not a body chosen by Indigenous people to represent them at a national level. Although Labor have commended the expertise of members of the new NIC, we have also warned that they have no mandate to represent Indigenous Australians. The NIC’s only function is to advise the government, not to represent Indigenous people. It does not, and therefore indeed cannot, speak on behalf of all Indigenous Australians.</para>
<para>It appears that the NIC members are accountable to no-one except the person who chose them—the Prime Minister. In the wake of ATSIC it is important to underline the fact that the NIC is not a legitimate alternative to ATSIC. It is not a national Indigenous representative body but rather an advisory group that the government may or may not take any notice of when it deliberates on Indigenous affairs in the future. Given that the government will very soon control both houses of parliament, it is scandalous that the only body able to provide advice on Indigenous issues to the government is one that the government has itself created without consulting Indigenous people or the Australian parliament. That is not best practice. It is certainly not something I have seen done with any other advisory group. The council comprises people appointed by the very same government that sets the parameters of its structure and operations. That certainly raises a conflict of interest. So much for the notion of providing advice without fear or favour! This is a sad day for democracy and an even sadder day for Indigenous affairs. Forget self-determination; apparently this government has no plans to replace ATSIC with another elected representative body and, in the interim period, has managed to reduce Indigenous decision making and participation in national affairs to mere consultation with a very select few.</para>

<para>—The bill before the House gives effect to the government’s decision to abolish ATSIC by amending the ATSIC Act 1989 to provide for the abolition of ATSIC and ATSIC regional councils. Apart from concentrating much of the power previously vested in ATSIC in the hands of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and her/his delegate, the bill makes a number of so-called consequential amendments to the act.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We have, of course, seen this bill in a slightly different form in the House last year. Labor did not support the passage of the legislation then, because of our concerns about the government’s plans for administration of Indigenous affairs in the post-ATSIC environment. Accordingly, Labor supported the establishment of a Senate inquiry—the findings of which I will turn to later in this speech.</para>
<para>But for now it is clear that the Howard government is focused on the past as usual, emphasising assimilation through the so-called ‘mainstreaming’ of services for Indigenous people. That ‘mainstreaming’ has long failed to address Indigenous disadvantage in Australia seems not to bother this government at all. Indeed, ATSIC has long been blamed by this government for failing to improve Aboriginal health in Australia, despite the fact that Aboriginal health services were mainstreamed more than a decade ago, with very little to show by way of improved health outcomes for Indigenous people.</para>
<para>Aboriginal people still have a life expectancy 20 years less than the Australian average. The death rates of Indigenous people from diabetes are eight to 12 times higher than the average Australian rate, and 20 per cent of Indigenous children—55 per cent in some areas—have early stages of trachoma. You cannot blame ATSIC for these outcomes. Aboriginal health services were ‘mainstreamed’ 10 years ago.</para>
<para>ATSIC was established by the Hawke Labor government and came into operation in 1990. It combined for the first time ever in the one organisation the representative and program delivery roles of previous bodies. The Hawke Labor government gave decision-making power over Aboriginal affairs to Aboriginal people. This was a bold innovation in Indigenous affairs some 15 years ago.</para>
<para>And who can forget Paul Keating’s landmark Redfern speech, when he launched the Year of the World’s Indigenous People in December 1992? As Prime Minister, Keating spoke passionately about the newly established ATSIC. He explained how ‘ATSIC emerged from the vision of Indigenous self-determination and self-management’ and described how ‘all over Australia, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities are taking charge of their own lives’. The speech was inspirational and delivered a positive agenda for the future of Indigenous affairs in Australia.</para>
<para>But here we are, some 13 years later, with a Prime Minister and coalition government intent on destroying any remnants of Aboriginal self-determination and self-management that have managed to survive their ongoing attacks since coming to office. While the 1990s can be described as a time of hope for Indigenous people, this current period is perhaps best described as a full-frontal attack on Indigenous rights, hopes and aspirations.</para>
<para>The Prime Minister has always opposed the existence of ATSIC. During the parliamentary debate on ATSIC’s establishment, the then opposition leader, John Howard, argued against the establishment of a separate representative body and service delivery organisation, claiming that the creation of ‘a parliament within the Australian community for Aboriginal people’ was a ‘misguided notion’, the pursuit of which would be a ‘monumental disservice to the Australian community’. But history will eventually show that it is in fact the Howard government that has proven to be a ‘monumental disservice’ to the Australian community and to Indigenous Australians in particular.</para>
<para>Following instructions from the Howard government in 1996, an independent company of auditors found very little fault with the financial affairs and accountabilities of ATSIC, but the Howard government opted to cut $470 million from ATSIC’s budget over the next four years and slashed programs by up to 30 per cent. And now we wonder why the government have some concerns about performance! Finally, the government imposed financial constraints on ATSIC, dictating the exact purpose for which over 80 per cent of their budget was to be used.</para>
<para>It is remarkable that in the face of unrelenting attacks from this government ATSIC, and the ATSIC regional councils in particular, have continued to manage a number of successful programs. For example, under the auspices of ATSIC, the Community Development Employment Projects scheme has grown enormously. In Newcastle, Youloe-Ta, our local registered CDEP, is funded for 266 participants at present. It has grown, since being set up by Yarnteen in 1993, and has continued to have outstanding outcomes. One particular success of Yarnteen was the granting of $100,000—not by the Australian government but by Microsoft USA—to network all CDEPs across New South Wales. It is an outstanding program and an outstanding achievement.</para>
<para>In our region, Yarnteen are caught up in this legislative problem. This new legislation poses severe difficulties for organisations such as Yarnteen. Yarnteen have been operating since 1991. Their aim is to become a full, free agent in their own development. As an organisation, they have always kept pace with change and reviewed the quality of their service delivery. I would say that, with the exception of economic self-sufficiency—and I want to raise that point—all their other objectives have been achieved.</para>
<para>In relation to Yarnteen’s enterprise development, we are talking about a very successful tourism venture; property investments based on advice from Indigenous Business Australia, Indigenous business development; programs to improve social wellbeing; a digital access strategy; leadership development; and partnership promotion. At the moment, they wish to expand into an education centre which would train people and provide great advances in employment opportunities for Indigenous people. But they are caught in a trap: there is a caveat on their loan held by ATSIC.</para>
<para>While they are seeking, and would be granted, a further loan to do that from the financial sector, the caveat stays in place on the loan they have with ATSIC. It is a loan for $1 million. They have actually paid off over $2 million in ATSIC loans ahead of time and they have never defaulted. They have opportunities now to keep investing in the future, but because of the quagmire created by this legislation and the government’s failure to anticipate the risk to all the good things that are happening out in regional Australia they are caught up in this and are prejudiced by this situation. One can only wonder whether that is the intention. These groups do aim for self-sufficiency and, unfortunately, have their hands tied. Success stories like these are not told by this government, and problems like that faced by Yarnteen are certainly not solved by this legislation.</para>
<para>ATSIC also administers the funding for the Aboriginal legal service in my area. Those legal services are seriously underfunded and cannot possibly meet the demands of the people in the Many Rivers zone. The equivalent of 2½ lawyers are available to meet the needs of 35,000 people in the whole of the Many Rivers region. But this government is now threatening to effectively mainstream Aboriginal legal services via a new tendering process. In New South Wales there are currently six regional ALSs that cover the whole of New South Wales and the ACT. They have been delivering quality, culturally appropriate legal services since 1997. The Many Rivers Aboriginal Legal Service has an office in my electorate of Newcastle. It provides a wide range of services, including specialist services for domestic violence that are highly regarded.</para>
<para>Labor is concerned that the government’s push to have legal services for Aboriginal people in New South Wales tendered out is very narrowly focused in that it does not take account of the full range of services currently provided by the existing legal services and it further reduces the employment and training opportunities for Aboriginal people in regional areas of New South Wales. Labor is, and I am, opposed to the tendering out of legal services for Aboriginal people.</para>
<para>The government’s program of dealing directly with local Indigenous communities by way of so-called ‘shared responsibility agreements’—SRAs—was not fully apparent at the time the abolition of ATSIC was announced. By the end of 2005 the government hopes to have 80 SRAs in place. But, as we discovered when the content of the draft SRA for the Mulan community in the Kimberley region of Western Australia was revealed, these agreements turn out not to be so shared after all but rather unbalanced and one-sided. As members of parliament, we deal every day with people —I think it is something like 7,000 a year in my office—who already find it difficult to negotiate through government departments, regulations and conditions. One wonders how remote communities would be able to equally negotiate genuine agreements.</para>
<para>Indigenous Australians must be able to reach genuine agreements with government, not be forced into coercive and patronising contracts. There is a stench of pious imposition and paternalism in SRAs. This government is telling Indigenous communities to choose between social rights and social responsibilities. I am not sure who has all the responsibilities, but the division does not seem quite right here. This government is telling Indigenous Australians that to obtain basic services they must meet conditions not imposed on others. That would be fine, I guess, if there was a guaranteed supply of clean water—if there were guaranteed supplies of the services that you and I take for granted every day of our lives. It does not seem right and it does not seem fair that a government would try to negotiate SRAs without any attempt at developing a level playing field and putting it in place for Indigenous people.</para>
<para>As a former school principal who has worked with Indigenous students, their families and their communities for many years, I know that this is not the way to effect change. Instead of forcing people into coercive contracts, why are we not making sure that Indigenous people have access to the services that they need for their families, for parenting, for raising children, for health care and for hygiene—things they are dependent on such as clean water and adequate housing. Decent jobs and lifelong learning would be a great start as well.</para>
<para>As was well demonstrated during the Senate inquiry, there is considerable concern about the degree to which responsibilities will be genuinely shared under the SRAs, whether obligations are genuinely agreed and genuinely mutual, the extent to which decisions are made on a genuinely informed basis and the extent to which the services under discussion in these agreements are discretionary or core entitlements of citizenship. There is also a concern that gains made in recent decades, such as land rights, will come under challenge.</para>
<para>Unfortunately, this bill does nothing to alleviate those concerns. The key messages arising from the evidence provided to the Senate committee were: anger and frustration at the lack of consultation with Indigenous people concerning the government’s new arrangements, in particular the fact that it has ignored the findings of its own $1.4 million review of ATSIC; concern that Indigenous representation is being removed, not only at the national level but particularly at the regional level, with no mechanism to establish or fund replacement regional structures—and I always believe in every field that local solutions are what work best, and if we do not aim for that with our Indigenous communities we are really going to have very little success; the lack of evidence that mainstreaming of service delivery is likely to lead to an improvement in outcomes for Indigenous people; concern over how ATSIC’s assets will be managed, and whether Indigenous control over significant cultural assets, such as the art collection, will be maintained, which obviously it will not; and concern over the speed with which the new arrangements have been implemented and the fact that they have so far led to more, rather than less, bureaucracy for Indigenous communities to deal with.</para>
<para>While the committee will make a number of recommendations relating to these issues, the key outcomes being sought are the extension of regional councils for a further six months, to 31 December 2005, to provide more opportunity for a smooth transition to new regional governance arrangements where these are under development—I would hope that such an outcome might help groups like Yarnteen find a financial solution that allows them to progress and continue with their outstanding programs—and the establishment of a Senate standing committee on Indigenous affairs. I call on the government to support Labor’s amendment so that the thousands of Aboriginal organisations like Yarnteen can have some certainty for their future. Indigenous Australians deserve much more from this government, but agreeing to these amendments would at least be a good start.</para>

<para>—I am pleased this evening to be able to speak on the <inline ref="R2223">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2005</inline>. It gives me the opportunity to make a few brief comments in support of this bill. Obviously, I reject the second reading amendment that has been moved by the member for Barton. It has obviously been foisted on him by the Left of his party and, as a result, he has moved it in this House. But we know that this is just tilting at windmills because ultimately, one way or another, this legislation will be passed.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>When the ATSIC Bill passed through the House under the Hawke government in November 1989, becoming law in 1990, and when ATSIC began functioning in 1990, ATSIC’s formation was described as a very bold experiment in the process and progress of Indigenous affairs and Aboriginal issues in this country, and it served a purpose in the intervening years. However, we reached a stage in the lead-up to 2004 where not only did the Aboriginal community and the wider community believe that ATSIC had failed the Aboriginal people of this country but also it was found to be an unworkable body which did not deliver to Aboriginal people. Just to put this in perspective, here in Canberra, where there are very few Aboriginal people, we had a bureaucracy of over 400 people—over 400 bureaucrats administering this huge body and massive amounts of money; it was $1.3 billion last year—working in a building in Woden. The notional amount of money out of that budget that ever reached Aboriginals on the ground was 8c in the dollar, which is not the way to serve Aboriginals and the community but the way to serve the Aboriginal bureaucrats and the ATSIC board themselves. A litany of cases have come before the courts and have been brought to media attention of ATSIC commissioners thwarting their power and responsibility, having served their own pockets in the promotion of themselves.</para>
<para>Last week two Aboriginal people came to see me in my electorate office—the Aboriginal elder of the Armadale area, Vivienne Hansen, and her husband, Mort. They said: ‘Mr Randall, if you think your politics are out of control, wait till you get involved in Aboriginal politics. They are the worst. You might engage in rough-and-tumble politics, but Aboriginal politics are brutal. As a result, we don’t believe the system has worked. We agree with the break-up of ATSIC because, ultimately, we believe we’re going to get a better deal for all Aboriginal people rather than just families and the nepotism which the ATSIC system eventually delivered.’ That is why many Aboriginal people themselves agreed with this break-up.</para>
<para>Many admirable people have led ATSIC. Lowitja O’Donoghue, for example, a very fine person, showed great leadership of the Aboriginal people. I think probably the most outstanding person was Gadil Djerr-kura, who was an icon to the Aboriginal people in his leadership, his decency and his own personal achievements in business and in the community. Mr Quartermaine, as the last ATSIC commissioner, has done a very good job. Probably the person who did most to bring ATSIC down was Geoff Clark, because of his recalcitrant behaviour. You only had to see that in the last few weeks where he has been involved in numerous cases. I will not go through them, but to take off with Nicky Winmar’s jumper—to take it down off the wall, decide to head off into the night with it and then get into some sort of a row with Nicky about whether it was the right jumper or not and who owned it—was the sort of bizarre behaviour that eventually brought discredit to ATSIC and those who led it. You just cannot allow something like that to continue. The community are on our side.</para>
<para>The former leader of the Labor Party, Mark Latham, for all his faults, agreed that ATSIC had run its course. When you look at the speakers list for this debate, it is interesting to see, other than the member for Barton, largely members of the Left of the Labor Party. My good friend over there, the member for Banks, would not shy away from the fact that he is a good paid-up member of the Left and, as a result, he is going to speak passionately on this bill and say, ‘We was all wronged on behalf of ATSIC!’ I will watch you on TV, Member for Banks, because I will hear an impassioned speech about how—</para>

<para>—No, I will watch it on TV, because then I can actually have a red wine while I am trying to enjoy myself watching you. At the end of the day, the member for Banks will do his job—and that is, as a paid-up member of the Left, to give an impassioned speech on this issue. Ultimately, the commission is to be replaced by a national Aboriginal advisory council, the National Indigenous Council, led by magistrate Sue Gordon—a Western Australian and a constituent of mine. Sue Gordon is a fine lady who has done some great things for Aboriginal people. Part of the so-called stolen generation in Western Australia and a former occupant of Sister Kate’s Home in Perth, she is somebody who has progressed beyond her whole background and given sensational leadership.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Interestingly, when I spoke to the Hansens last week in my office about Aboriginal leadership and the advisory board, of which Adam Goodes and other notable Aboriginal people are members, they said, ‘Look, Don, these blackfellas that are heading up this board aren’t like us; they’re not grassroots, hands-on Aboriginals. But at the end of the day I suppose we’ve got to have somebody leading us, and we think that they’re not bad—but we wouldn’t mind having a bit more of an input into it.’ My response to the Hansens was: ‘You can have an input into it, because not only can you go to the likes of Sue Gordon, who is available to you to further advise the government, but there is nothing precluding you from applying to be a part of this advisory committee or some form of this advisory body.’ I understand that it is not a closed shop. In fact, at the end of the day, a broad church is welcome to give advice on behalf of the Aboriginal community to government.</para>
<para>I found it rather interesting that another paid-up member of the Left over there, the member for Newcastle, talks in all this ingratiating language of how ashamed she is and of ‘culturally appropriate legal services’ for the Aboriginal community. I would have thought we are all Australians, whether we are Chinese or we come from some other ethnic background. We all have cultural differences in the way we interpret the law and how we respond to it, but to say that you need special people and there are only the equivalent of 2½ people in her region that could do this I thought was a bit patronising when she was endeavouring to say that this whole issue was patronising.</para>
<para>I recommend to the House an article by the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>’s editor-at-large, Paul Kelly, on Wednesday, 8 December 2004 headed ‘A new Indigenous politics—why Aboriginal leaders have veered right towards mutual obligation’. Nobody would claim that Paul Kelly was in any way biased or a friend of this government. He is considered to be someone in the media who is very balanced in his opinions. I need to read some of this article into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> because, in terms of the cultural change and the changes that are associated with this bill, it is very important that it be on the record:</para>
<quote>
<para>There is no better example of the transformation of our politics than the new joint position of Patrick Dodson and Noel Pearson that accepts mutual obligation as the essential step in improving the lives of indigenous Australians.</para>
<para>This has been driven not just by the convincing nature of John Howard’s fourth election victory but the failure of the progressive Left’s policy agenda over a generation.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Did you hear that, member for Banks? The article continues:</para>
<quote>
<para>Howard is no longer fighting the culture war against Paul Keating. His indigenous policies are no longer defined by negatives: … refusing the legitimacy of elected bodies with the abolition of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.</para>
<para>…       …            …</para>
<para class="block">This represents probably the most sweeping rethink since the 1967 referendum …</para>
<para>…       …            …</para>
<para class="block">The aim is to terminate passive welfare delivery and substitute instead “shared responsibility agreements” between local communities and government.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">We know that we are going from 35 regions to 85 SRAs. It is in line with the thinking of many members of the coalition that, instead of top-down funding from the huge bureaucracy in Canberra that delivers 8c in the dollar to Aboriginals on the ground, we talk about bottom-up funding, in which funding is delivered to the regions and Aboriginals can determine their own future through the massive amount of funding that can go to 2½ per cent of the population for their betterment, advancement and welfare.</para>
<para>We know that Noel Pearson was not a great friend of this government. But he has seen the light—unlike the Socialist Left. Pearson has been a decisive influence on this policy. It was Pearson who set out the bedrock position in this argument. He said that we have to see the Howard prime ministership as an opportunity rather than a threat to Indigenous Australians. Good on you, Noel Pearson. You are doing something for your people. You are taking them forward rather than taking them back to the dinosaur age, which the Left would do.</para>
<para>The Prime Minister welcomed the Dodson-Pearson olive branch. There is goodwill in the government towards trying to find lasting and better solutions for underprivileged Aboriginal communities. But, as I said, the Prime Minister stressed that this policy was based on localism—bottom-up funding to the regions and local communities. As Paul Kelly’s article says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The point is that the policies of the progressive Left have collapsed—and the failure of these policies in relation to Australia’s most underprivileged minority is pivotal in its own right and prophetic for the course of politics.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">As I said, the Latham leadership was unable to turn the Labor Party’s position around. Remember that they went to the last election saying that Latham was the best thing since sliced bread. Now you cannot hear a whisper about him. But he was the one leading them forward. As Paul Kelly says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Labor’s crisis is that it is embarrassed by the progressive Left’s social agenda almost to the point of an identity. Now it is humiliated and rendered irrelevant …</para>
<para>…       …            …</para>
<para class="block">Labor’s main problem is that the policies by which it has defined itself don’t work any more.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I rest my case. At the end of the day, here is a chance to take the Aboriginal community forward through mainstreaming and provide an opportunity for Aboriginals throughout Australia to receive the best possible policy initiatives from this government. It will be opposed by those on the other side because they are in an ideological left-wing time warp, but I commend this bill to the House.</para>

<para>—It is appropriate at the outset of my contribution to this debate on the <inline ref="R2223">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2005</inline> that I acknowledge the traditional owners of Canberra, the Ngunnawal people. I also want to acknowledge the presence in the gallery of ATSIC Commissioner Cliff Foley. History is written by the victors. Tonight we are presiding over the death throes of ATSIC. This legislation will bring ATSIC to a conclusion. It has taken nine years, but ATSIC’s fate was sealed when the Howard government was elected in March 1996. It did not take long. In the government’s first budget, in 1996, ATSIC’s budget was slashed by $470 million over four years. Many worthwhile programs hit the fence. With the election of this government, we were told that the government would determine the priorities of this nation. Indigenous affairs was certainly not one of the priorities.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This Prime Minister, to give him credit, has been consistent since the day he entered this parliament. On Indigenous issues he has been appalling. He has always taken the low road. History will judge him. At the end of the day, his period in office will be judged. Down the track, in the cold light of day, people will ask, ‘What did this Prime Minister achieve in his period of office?’ He has managed to politicise Indigenous affairs and immigration—two very sensitive areas. Immigration is now a hotbed in the United Kingdom. I see that the Tories want to use it as their way back to government.</para>
<para>This Prime Minister used Indigenous affairs as his way to the Lodge. He was involved as a backbencher in the early debates in the 1970s. He was observed during the debates on the ATSIC legislation to be frothing at the mouth at the dispatch box at the thought of the creation of ATSIC, at the thought of a treaty. With majority control of the Senate, he will have his way. We are told that this government with its ‘practical reconciliation’ for Indigenous affairs will ‘aim to improve the outcomes and opportunities and hopes of Indigenous people in areas of health, education and employment’—and the press release and the press conference went on and on.</para>
<para>Words are cheap. There are people of goodwill on both sides of this House, and expertise in this area does not lie on one side of the House or the other. But this is an issue that requires, over time, bipartisan support. No organisation, no group in the community could survive the attacks that ATSIC has had to put up with over the last nine years. ATSIC was not perfect, but it has been blamed in the Indigenous area for too long for things for which it was not responsible. The government to which I belonged, the Keating government, took health away from ATSIC in the early 1990s. What are the current health statistics? Twenty-four per cent of Aboriginal men will reach the age of 65, and 35 per cent of Aboriginal women will reach the age of 65, and the great tragedy is that many in the community blame ATSIC for those figures. It is not ATSIC’s fault. It is our fault as a parliament, both Labor governments and Liberal governments, because we have not come together to tackle what is a serious problem in relation to our Indigenous Australians, our First Australians, the most disadvantaged section of our community.</para>
<para>We have played the blame game. Make no mistake about it: there are many people on my side of the House who will rejoice at the demise of ATSIC. It did not enjoy support right across the Labor Party, and it has not from its inception. The consultation that took place produced compromise. The model was compromised in the Senate because the government did not have control. ATSIC in 1990 was the beginning; it should have been improved upon. When you look at its budget, you can see that most of it was CDEP, Work for the Dole that originated under Malcolm Fraser back in 1977, and the Community Housing and Infrastructure Program. Many of these programs were subject to audit after audit, including the legal services, and most came through with flying colours. Not all of them were perfect, but the first act of this government in its first budget was to bring in a $470 million cut that decimated some organisations and had an impact on training and bringing Aboriginal people through to administer these programs.</para>
<para>Frankly I am not in favour of the missionary approach. I am not here to save Aboriginal people. I do not know what is best for them. When I was the shadow Aboriginal affairs spokesman, from 1996 to 2000, the best job I have held in this place, it was a great learning experience for me. I worked with Aboriginal people. The solution lies with Aboriginal people. We should be there working with them, not attacking them. I think that ATSIC has had some colourful characters over the years, and it has suited this government and others to concentrate on the individuals not the organisation. Meanwhile the Department of Defence can slip through an estimates hearing with a $500 million overrun. The truth is that there is a double standard on both sides of the House. The argument is that you cannot trust Aboriginal people with money, and we heard that in relation to the previous speaker. But you can go to audit report after audit report. Indeed the last review into ATSIC did not recommend abolition of ATSIC, but the cabinet in considering the report took the abolition route. And it was made easier when the then leader of the Labor Party, Mark Latham, announced that we were going to walk away from ATSIC as well.</para>
<para>For me the good thing is that we will not have anymore, in ATSIC, a whipping boy to blame for the appalling statistics on Indigenous disadvantage. But will we require Aboriginal people to be involved in the solutions in the future? You bet. The attacks on Abstudy by this government have basically meant fewer Aboriginal people coming through to, in effect, be leaders and mentors in their communities. There is a whole series of problems, and the time has come for politicians on both sides to stop using Indigenous affairs to gain political advantage, because we are talking about our fellow Australians here. The repository of all wisdom does not lie on this side. But now, with the demise of ATSIC, this government and future governments, state governments and other bureaucracies will be held to account. The truth is that, in many respects, state governments as well have let the side down.</para>
<para>This is not an easy issue, but there is a mentality that we need to overcome. I did not hand out in the 1967 referendum; it passed me by because I was too young. The Prime Minister did, but what happened? In that referendum 90 per cent of the Australian population voted to give this parliament the constitutional authority to protect and work for Aboriginal people. That was the mandate this parliament received. That was one of the few referendums to succeed with bipartisan support. Malcolm Fraser in his time as Prime Minister had his heart in the right place, to his credit. He produced an Aboriginal land rights act, which was not the same as that introduced by the then Whitlam government but it was a long way ahead of any other legislation in its time.</para>
<para>The responsibility lies with us and the time has come to stop blaming the victim. I do not say that ATSIC was perfect but I enjoyed dealing with the commissioners, the regional councils, the committed people who worked out in the regions, and those within the public service and the communities. Of course mistakes were made. Have we learnt from the mistakes? No, we repeat them. And we continue to blame the victims. We continue to seek people within the Indigenous community and blame them for our mistakes.</para>
<para>There is no easy solution to this. I think the demise of ATSIC was inevitable with the election of the Howard government because ATSIC came into being without the support of the conservatives, and all they needed was an excuse. Sadly, in recent times the conservatives have had ample excuses, because it has been easy to get into the blame game. But my understanding is that while some criticisms arose from the audits that occurred, and while there were some arguments about improvements that could have been made, a lot of those organisations were producing results on the ground. ATSIC was value for money and this garbage about most of the money going to administration is just that—complete garbage. I do not intend to get into that debate this evening; the statistics speak for themselves.</para>
<para>There is a similar situation for regional Australians—the farmers. True equality in this country requires differential treatment because we do not come to the table as equals. The problems of regional Australia require special programs for regional Australia. The same applies to Aboriginal Australians. There is nothing wrong with providing intensive assistance to bring people through, but you need a place for them at the table as well.</para>
<para>The only reason that the 1967 referendum included a question on Indigenous people and the census statistics was that the government of the time was looking to retain a seat in Western Australia. So until the 1967 referendum we were more worried about our flora and fauna than our fellow Australians—our First Australians. They were counted in the census only because they were needed by the then Menzies government to retain their representation in the west.</para>
<para>But with the results of that referendum came an obligation on this parliament as a whole. And in the future I want to see an approach by government and opposition which will tackle the hard issues. But I have found that in Indigenous affairs you need Aboriginal people at the table because they are part of the solution. Think about the problems with water and a whole series of other things in remote and regional Australia. Of course ripping-off occurs. Most of the rip-offs—in terms of the stores, the vegetables and a whole series of things in remote Australia that directly impact on health—come from the white communities. A lot of that was not ATSIC’s responsibility, but the responsibility of state and territory governments.</para>
<para>I can recall being on the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation and talking to Senator Herron, the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, about benchmarking. The benchmarking of the states and territories received unanimous support within the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. Have the states and territories been properly benchmarked in relation to Indigenous affairs? No. I know that Dr Wooldridge, when he was Minister for Health—because of his former position as shadow minister for Aboriginal Affairs in the coalition—made a special effort in relation to Indigenous health in a number of programs. And this parliament should not apologise for that.</para>
<para>The sadness of the situation is that the demise of ATSIC represents a lost opportunity. It is an opportunity that we should have been building on. The only advantage that I see in the demise of ATSIC is that we will no longer have a whipping boy for the failures in Indigenous affairs by governments of all political persuasions. I repeat that I do not know of any organisation, government department or private enterprise that has been audited or scrutinised as much—or that could have withstood the savagery of the political attacks over time—as ATSIC has had to endure.</para>
<para>For a lot of people its demise will come as a relief. ATSIC did not enjoy a lot of support from some Aboriginal people. A lot of Aboriginal people were critics of it. It was quite easy to criticise it because it never had sufficient money to administer programs effectively in the areas for which it had responsibility. To overcome the backlog in Indigenous housing requires some $2 billion. Who is going to fund that? Which government has the courage to give $200 million, let alone $2 billion, to overcome the problems in Indigenous housing? Yet the Community Housing and Infrastructure Program was a ripper of a program in that regard. My understanding is that, in all the auditing that went on in relation to that program, it was never faulted.</para>
<para>In a lot of respects there was value for money but there were plenty of mistakes. Well, hallelujah! As I said, the double standard led to many of the mistakes being magnified. My view is this: if there was criminal behaviour, people should have been prosecuted. But do not blame people because we did not facilitate the training or adequately resource them to administer the services that were needed for their communities. For too long we sat silent when the health statistics were quoted, and did not stand up and say, ‘In 1994 we took responsibility for health away from ATSIC. That’s not ATSIC’s fault; it’s ours.’ And both sides were guilty of that silence, because it was a convenient alibi.</para>
<para>I am one who is genuinely sad at the demise of ATSIC. But that is life. Let us move on. If the government think that they are going to get away with their mainstreaming and assimilation in Indigenous affairs, they are wrong. History has proven that that does not work. What we need is a new partnership, one that can take us forward but one that involves Aboriginal people. That is why it is sad that the government are rejecting the Labor Party’s amendments to do with an extension—from my point of view, an even greater extension—of the regional councils. I do not see anything wrong with electing representatives of Indigenous Australians to speak to and deal with government on their behalf. Local councils are elected to deal with state and federal governments in relation to funding or whatever.</para>
<para>How do you pick an Indigenous person and say, ‘They’re the one to speak on behalf of Indigenous people’? They are a very diverse community. They are not united, as we are not united, but the problem is that their divisions are magnified by the ignorance and prejudice in our community. What worries me is that in the last decade we have not gone forward; we have gone backwards. If the 1967 referendum were held today, it would be lost. That is where we have come to. That is the legacy of the modern generation which includes both Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. We have to overcome that, because the statistics are appalling and Third World on every indicator. But tonight we can rejoice because ATSIC is no longer able to be blamed. To me that is the one positive out of this grubby legislation, which has taken nine years to come to fruition. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—With a background as a hospital medical officer, then as a child health researcher in remote Australia, as a community eye registrar and most recently as a consultant working for the very organisation we debate tonight, I am sure I speak on behalf of others in this House when I say that I have never walked in the shoes of the many people who are Indigenous Australians. I have not experienced what it must be like to have seniors from my family leave for weeks in hospital and come home in coffins, nor seen babies struggling with completely avoidable diseases, nor had hopes dashed of either a traditional life or a meaningful job, living in the miasma of alcohol and physical abuse that we see in many communities. But I have sat in a CDEP office and worked with incredibly dedicated ATSIC people. I have seen places with no bookkeeping skills and no operating statements that one can understand or decipher. I have seen free flights taken without being accounted for and have seen money being skimmed and disappearing while the kids run crazy, everything is broken and everything is really crook.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Tonight, as my first words about Indigenous affairs, I acknowledge Bessie Dixon and Teresa Mathews, who have given their lives to Indigenous affairs and their communities. Having worked with them, I know that there has been a culture of blame and victimisation often combined with poor services. I know that this talk tonight must seem to them like posturing to find a solution. But I would say to both Bessie and Teresa that these sweeping reforms are absolutely necessary and the record spending is the true indication of a practical commitment to making things different. The $2.9 billion spent last year is a far cry from what we saw a decade ago. The money spent today on health in Indigenous Australia is more than that spent in 1994, 1995 and 1996 added together and corrected for inflation. I think many here would agree that ATSIC really was beginning to have very little practical impact on policy development, despite the work of hundreds and thousands of really dedicated people doing everything they could over those 16 years.</para>
<para>I do not believe the CDEP program was producing the really meaningful jobs for which we were hoping. The Business Development Program had a list as long as my arm of failed enterprises, and the number of Indigenous Australians voting in ATSIC elections was down to just 20 per cent. Even when it had the chance, long after this government came to power, the opportunities were not taken to find meaningful solutions and come up with advocacy and policy development in the upper echelons of ATSIC. It was, of course, entirely captured by conflict and eventually by public squabbles and the erosion of public confidence.</para>
<para>There were regional plans that simply never hit the ground. From Urapuntja to Yuendumu, the benefits of having these layers within ATSIC were not being felt, nor was it a representative body because of the low level of voting. What is being proposed as a replacement to ATSIC is far from that. With the abolition of ATSIC, the National Indigenous Council is not intended to be a long-term replacement. Those who are within it are not individuals who are completely fawning, sycophantic and compliant; they are people with free minds, big ideas and bold intentions. I hope their ideas are heard and we hope that a bipartisan approach is taken.</para>
<para>In the past, Indigenous communities have had to struggle and shop around, deal with multiple levels of government and try to take advantage of programs while they could, and the whole time they were not really assisted with the complexities of dealing with government. I am glad that today, although it has been lost in this debate, both federal and state governments are working together and with local communities in the whole-of-government enterprise, and the Council of Australian Governments are guiding that enterprise. I believe communities have ideas and it is through that engagement that we will see success. That is why, while I acknowledge the fantastic work of individuals within ATSIC, I believe the organisation had to go and that the <inline ref="R2223">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 2005</inline> must be passed.</para>
<para>I do want to say just a few words about the opposition’s reflections upon milestones. The opposition have profited for many years in the comfort of those comparisons that benchmarks are not changing. And never have they been glued to anything as much as they have been to life expectancy figures. Surely it must be clear to everyone that you cannot begin to look at what affects life expectancy and you cannot begin to count life expectancy until people pass away. The life expectancy figures reflect the health and living conditions over 50 or 60 years; and, long after things start getting better in Aboriginal Australia, life expectancy figures will remain quite static. If you are serious about finding a figure that does not represent what is happening on the ground, then you will grasp at life expectancy figures.</para>
<para>There are plenty of opportunities to find great stories and improvements. It would be far wiser to focus on figures like those for infant mortality which have improved substantially—the mortality has dropped—in comparison with non-Indigenous Australia. These are the early signs and the evidence of progress in health delivery. I mention this because the opposition has often painted itself as having the warm embrace for Indigenous Australia, whether you travel from the universities to the health clinics and all the way out to the community centres. I have always had that slight concern that the warmth of the embrace is not really reflected in the ideas and proposals that are put together. It has always been that little bit easier to simply be critical of what is happening at the moment. I believe that because you often see these comparisons with New Zealand and Canada and Indigenous populations in the United States that have absolutely no relevance to the gains and the work that is being done on the ground in Indigenous Australia. It is a completely different situation from those we see in other countries where they have indigenous populations.</para>
<para>The disappointing thing tonight is that our 10 minutes each have been wasted by members on the other side, who really did have an opportunity to put together and propose some bold ideas and some alternatives. Instead we have seen what I suspect is a rather feeble amendment about retaining regional councils. It does surprise me that that would be an amendment proposed by the opposition. It surprises me that perhaps they have listened to a few members of regional councils who may have wandered in and asked the opposition to support such an amendment and they have thought, ‘We can’t really disagree with the bill, so we’ll put this up as an alternative and see whether it can consume little bit more time.’ What, fundamentally, is the difference between ATSIC and 35 little ATSICs in the form of regional councils?</para>
<para>In the end, there was not the engagement between government and community. The only way to get the ideas coming up from the community—quite apart from building capacity within those populations themselves—was to reduce the capacity required to engage government. That is what the whole-of-government approach is about. We can work for generations to build capacity, but isn’t it time we looked to ourselves to find ways of more effectively and efficiently delivering services and making them available, ensuring that the rubber hits the ground where it counts? That is what the whole-of-government approach is about, and I have great confidence in that process, having seen it from its evolution a few years ago.</para>
<para>I was often inspired to send people who wanted to know more about this debate to the opposition’s web site for a more fulsome expansion on what they might propose as an alternative to ATSIC. So it surprised me that, on going there, you would find just eight lines. The first line said: ‘Committed to reconciliation.’ The second line said: ‘An apology to the stolen generation.’ The third line said: ‘Replace ATSIC with an elected representative body’—of which there is no further definition or discussion. Then there were two final bullet points on service provision in health and education, and then something about ‘broad participation based on genuine reciprocity of obligations, where governments as well as citizens fulfil their responsibilities’. Apart from a bit of cutting and pasting about mutual obligation—taken from our side of the House; we had been talking about this for a decade—I do not see anything there of comfort to Indigenous Australians who look for an alternative vision.</para>
<para>We have heard tonight from opposition members that the National Indigenous Council cannot speak on behalf of Indigenous Australians. But I question seriously whether ATSIC ever did. The government reforms have shifted the emphasis from that very Western style regional council to working with local communities directly. I think that is an important advance that has been a little bit ignored tonight. No one size fits all, and there is an incredible heterogeneity in Indigenous communities from the urban to the remote, but I believe such bodies should be formed by Indigenous leaders themselves coming from the grassroots. With time, those leaders will emerge. It will take time and participation. Money is not the only input that needs to be measured. At the moment I believe there are no good ideas coming from the other side. We have heard three speakers; I would like to hear something put up as an alternative from the next four.</para>
<para>No-one could have been clearer than the member for Banks, who has deep experience in the area of Indigenous affairs, I have to acknowledge. But, again, there was a floundering around somewhat stratospheric and nebulous ideas about shifting blame. If ATSIC was something to get rid of it would have happened long ago. But, no, it was given an enormous amount of rope, an enormous amount of faith and an enormous amount of resources. I think there should be great concern in the Indigenous communities around Australia, whether they are remote or urban, about the lack of ideas from the opposition tonight. It has been a perfect time to step into this chamber and hold above your heads a piece of paper saying: ‘This is our vision’—as an alternative to ATSIC or to whatever structure is being proposed. If there is an emotional attachment to ATSIC, which I suspect is exemplified in the words of the member for Banks—I do not hear it from the other members—then say it. Let us hear those alternatives. Let us have the bold ideas, the big proposals. Let us seek concrete ideas to make a difference to the work and lives of people like Bessie Dixon and Teresa Mathews, to people who, from the Western Desert through to the central Northern Territory, have given their lives to helping their young ones, as paediatric workers, to have a future of health and achievement that they can look forward to.</para>
<para>Few will mourn the passing of ATSIC, but I think the Indigenous people of this country have a right to expect a whole lot more from the debate from those opposite tonight. They should expect meaningful alternatives and ideas but, so far, I think many of those have been glaringly vacant. I was not here for some of the early debate on this bill, but I think it is a great disappointment that tonight all we are hearing is some slightly sentimental and melancholic comment about the organisation but no meaningful alternative.</para>

<para>—The issue is always going to be not what the rate figure is but the relationship of debt to income. With the radical growth in credit, the property boom and radical changes in property prices, what it now costs a young family to get into the housing market compared to what it cost before means that you do not get to the real fear level at 17 per cent; you get to it well before then. It will be at 8½ per cent that most of my friends will not own their homes anymore—well before any figures like 17 per cent. I do not imagine there will be many homeowners left at all with those sorts of figures. So the idea that those figures are a threat is the government wanting to say, ‘The entire economy would collapse and then the interest rates would continue going up.’</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Every time the government talks about 17 per cent, it fails to acknowledge the danger to household income of 8½ per cent and the absolute financial strain and loss of property and loss of home ownership that people would face should interest rates get to nine per cent. What has happened to home ownership is something that I saw from the day that we got into our own mortgage. Within six months of moving to our part of Sydney, we were living in a home we could no longer afford to buy. I found a situation where friend after friend my own age was not able to purchase a home in the area where they grew up because property prices had gone to more than double what they could afford. They had found themselves moving out into areas of Western Sydney and south-west Sydney to get homes, then to find that the property prices there had similarly ballooned.</para>
<para>Add that to what has happened to credit card debt and compare interest rates of many years ago: not only are we now in a different international climate but, more importantly, we are in a different climate of household debt. Anyone who wants to claim a ministerial role in the government of Australia who does not understand the impact of household debt and how sensitive you can be to interest rates rises does not understand what goes on in the part of Sydney I come from. They do not understand what happens in south-western Sydney; they do not understand the area that is going to the by-election on Saturday; and, they do not understand what has also happened in parts of Melbourne or Brisbane. And you do not have to be in the major capital centres to find a radical rise in household debt.</para>
<para>We hear about average mortgages, but what is more important than that is average new mortgages. For young families trying to get into property and their own home ownership, it does not matter, when you average it out, what is happening to people in their late fifties who are at the very end of a loan. What matters to those young families is the new mortgage size. The average for new mortgages in Sydney is now $427,500 and a quarter of a per cent interest rate rise on that amount is $69 a month. So you can imagine how many young families are finding themselves—if they want to live anywhere near their extended family—on mortgages way in excess of that average. Then add to that what has happened to the other parts of household debt—<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I wanted to take the opportunity this evening to talk about developments in relation to water conservation within the electorate of Flinders and within Victoria generally. I want to make reference to three things. The first is dramatic progress in the fight to clean up and to resolve the issue of the Gunnamatta outfall.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>What has happened in Victoria is that after stalling for some years the Victorian government has finally agreed to make progress towards the clean-up of Gunnamatta outfall. Gunnamatta outfall produces 150 gigalitres, or 150 billion litres, of water each year which is pumped out as secondary level treated sewage straight onto Victoria’s beaches at Gunnamatta. It has a health effect; it has a dramatic environmental effect and it is an enormous waste of resources. One hundred and fifty gigalitres, or 150 billion litres, of water is water which could be used for agriculture and industry and in so doing take pressure off our dams and our rivers in the Thomson, Latrobe, Gippsland and Macalister systems.</para>
<para>On that basis what has occurred is a great step forward. With the National Water Initiative, the federal government had provided an opportunity and a way out for Victoria. It has provided a means by which the Victorian government will ultimately be able to address the problem of Gunnamatta, the shameful waste of water, the dramatic impact on our coastline and to deal with this in a way which has an impact for future generations.</para>
<para>Last week the Victorian government agreed to sign the National Water Initiative to embrace the Australian Water Fund and to give itself access to the $2 billion which the Commonwealth is providing, $1.6 billion of that being for infrastructure. That is a tremendous step forward. That means in particular that they will be able to examine the proposal for a pipeline for the recycled water, transferring it from the eastern treatment plant at Carrum Downs and using it for the Gippsland pulp, power and paper mills and stations in a way which will take the pressure off the water being drawn from the Thomson, Latrobe and Macalister systems and allow for environmental flows. It will reuse the water and will also significantly take away the impact of dumping sewage off Victoria’s coastline. That is a tremendous step forward. I welcome the agreement from the Victorian government and I thank the Commonwealth for the step that it has taken on that.</para>
<para>In relation to water infrastructure, there is an even bigger challenge within Australia. Melbourne Water, Sydney Water and a number of other major organisations around the country with the responsibility for water are state owned monopoly infrastructures. The problem here is that there is a lack of competition and a lack of openness to private capital in relation to the disposal of water. Why does this matter? It matters because, for example, in the case of Sydney there are 400 billion litres of sewage treated only to a primary stage and flushed between 2,000 and 3,700 metres offshore. Private sector money is willing to come in and have an impact by upgrading the quality of the treatment to ensure that the water is reused, overcoming the problems of health, environment and resource wastage. But under the current monopoly system they are being prevented from doing so. In that situation we need to bust open these monopolies in a way which will provide opportunities for private sector capital. Significantly, it will clean up the water resources and Sydney beaches and allow water to be reused. It will protect the Warragamba Dam and the Shoalhaven and, above all else, allow for Sydney’s water security over a long-term period.</para>

<name role="display">Mr GARRETT</name>
</talker>
<para>—I rise to draw to the attention of the House an issue I believe is of real interest to the people of Kingsford Smith and the community at large. As the House would be aware, Australians are living longer and healthier lives than ever before. Currently, life expectancy is 82 for men and 87 for women. While this is great news for the majority of us, it can be the cause of much anxiety for many as they struggle to plan for their own retirement or tackle the question of how to care for aged parents or grandparents.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>When we talk about ageing there is a range of factors to bear in mind: sufficiency of retirement incomes, availability of paid employment, family care, education, social participation and volunteering. These factors contribute to a quality of life that all Australians, regardless of age, deserve. Australia’s population is ageing rapidly. The <inline font-style="italic">Future ageing</inline> report released by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, which will be debated in the House, has found that there are around five people of working age supporting each person aged over 65. It is called the ‘potential support rate’. When you consider the majority of our population are between the ages of 40 and 65 it begs the question of what governments, and this government, are doing to ensure that investment in quality infrastructure as it pertains to an ageing population has been implemented and that forward planning exceeds the span of a four-year election cycle.</para>
<para>It is important to understand that illness and frailty are not inevitable parts of ageing. As Australia’s demographic changes so must the broader perceptions we have of older people. Too often we see negative images of ageing and the ageing process reinforcing myths and allowing discrimination. The media regularly portray health and longevity in terms of young people full of life, failing to show the same verve and activity in older folk, some of whom I am sure we know. So it is critical to recognise that only a minority of older people, for example, move into residential aged care facilities. That is why our focus must be broader than this stereotype of ‘old people in nursing homes’.</para>
<para>Labor’s policies have always been about ensuring dignity and security. Not surprisingly, we are critical of the government for their lack of infrastructure and long-term work force planning, their lack of investment in research and, most critically, their mixed record of collaboration with state and territory governments, stakeholders, researchers and carers. This effective collaboration is much needed to enhance the quality of life of this growing group of Australians. Our aged population deserves access to fair and equitable aged care facilities that encourage them to lead a fulfilling and healthy life well into their retirement, without fear of budget cuts to the pension or lack of adequate health care facilities.</para>
<para>In my electorate of Kingsford Smith alone, some 12,727 people receive the age pension, the majority of whom continue to live in their own home. The rising cost of living means that our ageing population faces an uncertain financial future. That is why I believe it is important to actively support people’s choice to continue living in their own home and to ensure that the necessary services are provided for them in that place. Whilst Labor welcomes the current injection of funds by the government in this area, we are conscious of the lack of planning in the area of service quality and provision since its first election term.</para>
<para>The National Aged Care Alliance has released a set of recommendations for strengthening the government agenda for aged care. My colleague Senator Jan McLucas, the shadow minister for ageing, disabilities and carers, has been active in the development of policies that ensure the longevity of aged care for future generations. The recommendations of the alliance focus on the need for fairness and equity in funding, the linking of aged care and health needs and, more importantly, the need for long-term high-quality service planning for the aged. I can assure the House that I will be actively working in my electorate to ensure that these recommendations are not ignored but are made to stick.</para>
<para>Quality of life is the key factor in this issue of an ageing Australian population. If we are to live longer then it must be satisfying and as enjoyable as possible. The community at large should be encouraged to make the most of the talents, wisdom and experience of those who reach a ripe old age. Older Australians with these qualities in abundance will contribute significantly to community volunteer projects, the arts and many other aspects of our life. Our seniors have so much to give; let us make sure we support them.</para>

</talker>
<para>—In this adjournment debate tonight I wish to highlight two issues which are of great concern to me. Firstly, I would like to place on record my very great admiration for the parliamentary reporting staff and Hansard but, in doing so, to express my concern at the adoption of the <inline font-style="italic">Macquarie</inline> <inline font-style="italic">Dictionary</inline> a number of years ago as the pre-eminent source of spelling for words used in the parliament. I think it is unfortunate that the thought police, or the word nazis, seem to have introduced spellings which most Australians would find to be utterly bizarre as the preferred spelling of words used in the parliamentary <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. I have not got time tonight to outline everything, but most people would accept that the <inline font-style="italic">Oxford</inline> <inline font-style="italic">Dictionary</inline> really is the pre-eminent English dictionary, yet a group of academics at Macquarie University decided to attempt to turn Australian English into a dialect and in doing so brought forward some most peculiar spellings.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In my own office I prevent my staff from using American spellings. I prefer the more traditional English spellings because—let us face it—we are a derivative society and mostly in Australia we tend to use the more traditional spellings over American spellings. It is therefore a matter of grave concern to me that the parliamentary <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> seems to have been hijacked by the thought police who have imposed American spellings on the Australian <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. I recall that a number of years ago I used the word ‘amok’ in a speech, yet Hansard insisted on using a spelling I had never seen before—‘amuck’. I spoke to about 20 people and I asked them, ‘How on earth do you spell the word “amok”?’ and every single person said ‘amok’, yet I was unable to convince the parliamentary Hansard staff to spell the word correctly. Hansard now assures me that they have adopted ‘amok’ instead of ‘amuck’. There are numerous other examples. People who want to turn our language into a dialect insist on, for instance, the American spelling of ‘program’, rather than ‘programme’. And I think that Mr Speaker ought to look at this matter because, as Australians, we are proud to be Australians, but I think that we ought not to accept that we are part of a cultural cringe.</para>
<para>I understand that John Campbell, when he was the Principal Parliamentary Reporter, a number of years ago decided in his wisdom to adopt the <inline font-style="italic">Macquarie</inline> <inline font-style="italic">Dictionary</inline>. To my knowledge, there was no debate in the parliament. It means that the way we spell words was hijacked by one person in the parliamentary Hansard. I would like to appeal to the current chief of the reporting staff to give some flexibility: if members want to use traditional spellings as opposed to the spellings imposed by the word nazis at Hansard, then maybe members ought to be able to write to Hansard to request that their speeches be written in a traditional form rather than the form dictated by the <inline font-style="italic">Macquarie</inline> <inline font-style="italic">Dictionary</inline>.</para>
<para>I also want to highlight at this stage a very important conference which is taking place on the Sunshine Coast in relation to the national sea change phenomenon. I have received a letter from the Mayor of Maroochy Shire, Councillor Joe Natoli, to advise me that the National Sea Change Summit will take place at Coolum in July this year. This is intended as a briefing session for members of the House of Representatives whose electorates cover coastal growth areas. A task force has been established as the national body to represent the interests of coastal councils and communities experiencing the effects of rapid population and tourism growth. Formed last year, it currently represents more than 50 member councils from all Australian states and the total population of the areas covered by these councils is approximately four million residents.</para>
<para>The Sunshine Coast is one of the fastest growing areas in Australia. People like to move from the rustbelt areas represented by many members opposite to the sunbelt, and we are very pleased to have them, but we have particular challenges relating to infrastructure and the need for government support, so I am hoping that this national sea change summit will be well attended. It is very important that we get the message across to governments, both state and federal, that as coastal communities growing rapidly we have particular needs. The Sunshine Coast is a wonderful part of the world in which to live, and it is a great privilege to represent it. Many people move to our area and we need particular government assistance. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talker>
<para>—I note at the outset that I am approached about many refugee cases and a large number of those I find unconvincing. However, tonight I wish to raise the situation of Ardeshir Gholipour, a detainee at Baxter who arrived in this country in the year 2000. I have recently been advised by an officer of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, as a result of correspondence to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, that decision making by the department is ‘objective and fair’. Well that might be; however, I believe this particular case does stand out for action by the minister. I am especially impressed that International PEN, a representative body of writers around the world, is supporting this particular case. This indicates something because it is an organisation that does not readily lend its name to every Tom, Dick and Harry who puts their name forward.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The situation in Iran is that after the Islamic revolution of 1979 there was severe repression by the newly instigated theocratic regime. Many had hoped that, with the disappearance of the shah’s regime and the repressive tactics of the SAVAK secret police, the situation would improve. They were sorely wrong. Since then we have had a regime which, by any international standards, is amongst the most repressive in the world. The 1997 election of Mohammed Khatami seemed to hold out the hope of improvements. However, his endeavours have been clearly stymied by the continued power of the religious leadership in the country.</para>
<para>As for Mr Gholipour, I am especially impressed that Faraj Sarkoohi, a person who was adopted by Germany in 1998 after his flight as a refugee and who is active in International PEN and its German branch, has testified in correspondence that Mr Gholipour did in fact assist him whilst he was jailed by ensuring that his documentary evidence of his incarceration was circulated throughout Iran in the magazine <inline font-style="italic">Khaber</inline> <inline font-style="italic">Nemeh</inline>. Similarly, the brother of Pirooz Faghhai Davani—who was murdered by the Iranian regime—who is also a resident of Germany, has testified in support of Mr Gholipour for his now deceased brother. There are clearly indications from Iranian progressive forces and people of international repute that Mr Gholipour has indeed the track record that he has claimed.</para>
<para>The situation in Iran, of course, is that from the late 1990s the murder of prominent writers and of journalists throughout the country has taken place. Newspapers have systematically been closed down. As late as December 2004, Sarah Leah Whitson, the executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch, spoke of the secret torture sites and the torture of internet journalists and community activists. It is a reality that still occurs daily in Iran. It is not a year ago; it is not two years ago; it is a continuing situation. With his track record of being a stern critic of the regime and having been jailed before his flight in 2000, Mr Gholipour would indeed be in great danger if he were to be returned to Iran. I note that in this particular case he has obtained the support of significant management figures at the Baxter detention centre. This, again, is unusual—that a detainee would actually have letters of support on the public record from people in those kinds of positions. His artistic skills have also been put on the record and could be beneficial to this country.</para>
<para>The situation, as I say, continues to be deplorable in Iran and it gives strong grounds for the minister to reconsider this case. I do not want to hear about the fact that, under ministerial discretion, this case has been decided properly. We know that ministers in this portfolio have been inventive in the way they have been able to read the rules of ministerial discretion to allow a significant number of people to pass through the system. The deplorably low level of support by the current minister, Minister McGauran, of only four per cent approvals—contrasting Minister Vanstone’s rate of 40 per cent—is indicative of the problems in the system at the moment. Mr Gholipour has a history of involvement in human rights issues in Iran. He has engendered widespread support in the Australian community. He has been supported, as I indicated earlier, by people in management positions at Baxter detention centre and, indeed, his case has been taken up by an organisation of international repute that does not give its name readily or easily to every person in the world with an asylum claim. I again ask the minister to consider this case very seriously under ministerial discretion.</para>

<para>—The spirit of Kokoda has been dormant for far too long and that has been recognised on the Gold Coast by the formation of the Kokoda Challenge Association, which was launched recently at Nerang RSL. The formation of this association has been led by Mr Doug Henderson with the advice and help of Mr Charlie Lynn—a man whose passion for Kokoda is truly inspiring. Charlie visited the Gold Coast last year and, at a meeting organised by Doug at Nerang RSL, told all in attendance about the history of Kokoda and the sacrifices of some astonishing young Aussies to hold back the invading Japanese. It was a story of endurance, sacrifice, courage and mateship. In the main, our young men were untrained and inexperienced as the majority of our regular forces were fighting overseas in Europe and the Middle East.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The young men sent to Kokoda were outnumbered. They were under-resourced and fighting in terrain that was inhospitable. They were supported along the 96-kilometre track by the fuzzy wuzzy angels—natives of New Guinea who helped carry urgent supplies of food and ammunition along the track for our young Aussie soldiers. The temperatures were often freezing in the Owen Stanley Range. The fuzzy wuzzy angels were not equipped for the weather. They had no footwear or blankets and had only grains of rice to sustain them. They even often shared the rice with wounded Australians whom they stretchered to safety.</para>
<para>Kokoda is a story like no other, but unfortunately it is a story that Australians do not know. It is time the youth of this country were educated about the story—about the sacrifices and ultimate victories. It is time this story was taught in a meaningful way in our education system. Today the jungle has reclaimed the battle sites which are etched in the minds of our ageing diggers. Along the Kokoda Track, rusting armaments, shallow graves, empty weapon pits and spent ammunition cartridges are haunting reminders of a desperate campaign fought on our very doorstep during the darkest days of the war in the Pacific just over 60 years ago.</para>
<para>The Kokoda challenge will be a tough team event with four members on each team. They must complete a 96-kilomentre trek, which is the same distance as the Kokoda Track. It is to be completed within 39 hours, which symbolises the 39th Militia Battalion, the first of our Australian troops to arrive at Kokoda, on 15 July 1942. The inaugural event will be held over the weekend of 16 and 17 July in the Gold Coast hinterland. The event will be a fundraising effort to assist Charlie Lynn and the Kokoda Track Foundation in their endeavours to promote and support the education, health and general wellbeing of the surviving fuzzy wuzzy angels and their descendants still living along the track.</para>
<para>The program for the event has been structured so that our Gold Coast youth can experience the real spirit and soul of our amazing country and her forefathers. It challenges our youth to seize the day, to accept the problems at hand, to adapt, and to envisage and implement future strategies of success in their own lives. The Kokoda youth leadership challenge, in partnership with the Returned Services League, service clubs and local secondary schools, will identify students that are determined as suitable candidates for the challenge. We all believe that the youth of our country hold the answers to our future success as a nation. Like our forefathers, the students participating in the walk will rise to the challenges they will experience over the two days.</para>
<para>Charlie Lynn shared with us his own personal experiences and those of a number of young troubled and negative people with whom he has walked the Kokoda Track. It certainly was a story of endurance, sacrifice, courage and mateship. The trek was difficult. There were enormous challenges for many of the young people, but with Charlie’s encouragement and commitment to each of them they finished the walk.</para>
<para>The Mayor of Gold Coast City Council, Ron Clarke MBE—one of Australia’s former great athletes—is patron of our Kokoda Challenge Association. Our Governor-General, Major General Michael Jeffery, and his wife will attend the inaugural dinner following the two-day event. The association is extremely grateful for the commitment of both these distinguished gentleman in supporting our inaugural challenge. Of course, thanks must go to the schools involved, to the local bushwalking group, who have assisted in marking out the track, to the first aid officers and to the local RSL clubs, who have embraced this event with enthusiasm and commitment. We believe that the Kokoda youth leadership challenge will be an enduring legacy to the spirit of Australia that was born at Gallipoli and held fast at Kokoda. I am personally very proud to be part of this challenge and wish all those involved every success with the inaugural event in July this year.</para>

<para>Total Australian Government funding for government schools is not reported at the level of detail requested. Australian Government General Recurrent Grants for government schools are provided to the government education authority in each State or Territory, on the basis of total enrolments. The State or Territory determines where the grants are used. Payments to individual schools are not recorded.</para>
<para>        The Department of Education, Science and Training only provides electoral division and postcode detail for General Recurrent Grants to non-government schools, and Capital Grants and Flagpoles Funding to both government and non-government schools.

Of this total, General Recurrent Grants provided $ 31,090,183 and Capital Grants provided $580,535 funding to non-government schools in the electoral division of Brand or identified postcodes.

<para>There are no international measures involving states currently under development to ban anti-vehicle mines (AVMs). The majority of countries do not support a complete ban on AVMs. Australia strongly supports efforts by states parties to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) to build a consensus that would allow the commencement of negotiations for a protocol to the CCW restricting the use of AVMs. Australia is a co-sponsor of the “30-nation proposal”, proposed at CCW meetings, which aims to make all AVMs detectable and ensure that all remotely-delivered mines self-destruct/self-neutralise and self-deactivate.</para>
