<para class="block">I am pleased to present legislation to give effect to a federal budget initiative that will benefit up to 44,000 Australian veterans, war widows and widowers.</para>
<para>This <inline ref="R2373">bill</inline> will amend the Veteransâ Entitlements Act 1986 to extend eligibility for the Australian governmentâs seniors concession allowance to holders of the gold card who are over veteran pension age and who are not otherwise eligible for the seniors concession allowance or the utilities allowance.</para>
<para>The seniors concession allowance was introduced by this government in December 2004, carrying through an election commitment to assist self-funded retirees in paying the costs of water, sewerage, electricity, rates and motor vehicle registration.</para>
<para>The allowance is currently available to DVA and Centrelink Commonwealth seniors health card holders as a non-taxable payment of $200, paid in two instalments in June and December each year.Â  The amount of seniors concession allowance is indexed twice yearly.</para>
<para>The bill also provides for the seniors concession allowance to be paid to eligible gold card holders if they are temporarily absent from Australia for no more than 13 weeks.</para>
<para>With passage of this bill, the first payment of seniors concession allowance to eligible gold card holders will take place in December 2005.</para>
<para>This legislation broadens the governmentâs support for our older veterans.Â  In 1999, we extended the gold card to Australian veterans and mariners aged 70 or over with qualifying service from World War II.</para>
<para>In 2002, we further extended eligibility for the gold card to include all Australian veterans aged 70 or over with qualifying service from any conflict.</para>
<para>This yearâs budget increases funding for the care of the veteran and Defence Force communities to more than $10.8 billion, a rise of $278 million on 2004-05.</para>
<para>The 2005-06 budget includes $4.6 billion for health careâan increase of $203 million on 2004-05âand $6.1 billion for compensation and income support, up from $6 billion last financial year.</para>
<para>Veteransâ Affairs funding has risen under this government from $6.5 billion in 1996 to more than $10.8 billion in this budgetâan average annual increase of 5.8 per cent.</para>
<para>Over a decade, the government has committed more than $86 billion in recognition of the special needs of our veterans and war widows.</para>
<para>Through our commitment to working with the ex-service and defence communities to identify and address key priorities, the government has delivered a repatriation system that continues to be highly regarded around the world.</para>
<para>The 2005-06 budget builds on our hard work to ensure that our veterans, whether they served in the world wars or in more recent deployments, will receive the care they need and the support the community expects for this important group of Australians.</para>
<para>This initiative recognises the needs of our older gold card recipients and continues this governmentâs strong commitment to the Australian veteran community.</para>

<para>âIn continuing the remarks I was making last night on the <inline ref="R2361">Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2005</inline>, I take the opportunity to remind members that I have a background in small business. I understand how small business feels when it is confronted with a new system and new paperwork.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Prior to the adjournment last night, I was saying that after reading the details of the superannuation choice scheme I was wondering what position I would have been in come 1 July. It is likely that I would have been in a position to sack my single employee without explanation as one of the businesses that would have been exempted from the unfair dismissal laws. That would be a particularly brave move on my part, given the fact that I have been married to my single employee for 29 years! Leaving that aside, it would seem that, come 1 July, I will not be able to discuss her superannuation choice or our future savings for retirement because that could be considered subject to sanctions.</para>
<para>Government members may scoff at the suggestion that small business is concerned about the introduction of choice but, to assure themselves that this is indeed the case, they need go no further than the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia. In early May this year the council issued a media release titled âPenalties for super choice too harsh!â The council expressed the deep concerns of its membership about the penalty regime imposed under the super choice scheme. I can understand their concerns. I do not know that anyone would like the prospect of a couple of years in jail for a few misplaced words in a conversation. The councilâs media release said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Shadow Small Business Minister Mr Tony Burke is right when he calls for exemptions for small business.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It is not that I think that the Council of Small Business Organisations could be confused with the ACTU but it is interesting that the Council of Small Business Organisations does emphasise that Laborâs position of calling for an exemption is supported by small businesses across the country. It would seem that small business is genuinely concerned by the introduction of super choice and wants an exemption.</para>
<para>Naturally the media release prompted me to wonder about the governmentâs motivation for not granting the exemption. I would have thought that, with a group such as the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia supporting Laborâs calls, there must be a sound reason for the government to ignore them. I dug through old statements by the minister to try to gain some insight as to why the government would not accede to the request of small business and grant an exemption, but the closest thing I found in my research was a statement by a spokeswoman for the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer. It said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Exempting small business from offering choice would just create a competitive disadvantage for small business in a tight labour market.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">As a small business person, I do not know what that means and neither do the very small business operators in Liverpool who I had the privilege to address recently. While calls from COSBOA may not be enough to convince members opposite to support Laborâs amendments, there are a number of other concerns that must be raised about this scheme.</para>
<para>Most people are well aware that the superannuation industry is a multibillion dollar industry. Recently I saw reports that estimated the assets of the superannuation industry to be in the order of $750 billion, which is a considerable sum by anybodyâs standards. The handling of those considerable assets requires management and funds management brings with it fees and charges. Annual revenue from these fees and charges on the management of superannuation funds has been estimated to be between $5 billion and $10 billionâanother significant sum.</para>
<para>Superannuation choice introduces a new dimension to retirement savings in Australia. The government has managed to bring together the finance and funds management industries and employees to make decisions on considerable financial holdings of workers with less than full information available to them. It was not all that long ago that people were very concerned because their superannuation funds had fallen. If things go bad again, I am sure government will wash its hands very quickly of this situation and hide behind the excuse that, after all, it was the employeesâ choiceâthat they had the right to choose where their funds went and that whether or not they chose a successful fund was in their hands.</para>
<para>Small businesses must be exempted from super choice. They are concerned about its impact on their business and they are concerned about what might happen to their employeesâ retirement savings. Small business operators will be overwhelmed by paperwork as a consequence of this scheme. That is what I find so amazing about the governmentâs refusal to exclude small business from the choice provisions. This governmentâthe self-appointed best friend of small businessâis going to increase the pressure on small business owners. Owners who are already spending many hours every week trying to comply with the âsimplified tax systemâ will have to deal with this as well.</para>
<para>Some time ago I reviewed the governmentâs document titled âCommitted to small businessâ. This document, released last year, outlined the governmentâs commitment to small business and what it had done to free up small business owners and operators so they could concentrate on growing their businesses. The document went to great lengths to praise the work of small business, to inform us of their contribution to the economy and to report that the governmentâs commitment to small business had not diminishedânoble sentiments that have not been borne out by the governmentâs position on superannuation choice. The document reported that it has been a priority of the government since its election in 1996 to reduce red tape and that it has made inroads into improving regulatory oversight applying to small business. It included the following statement:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Government is committed to streamlined, cost effective regulation that does not impose unnecessary paperwork or other compliance costs upon small business. The Government will continue to be responsive to small business needs and concerns on these issues.â</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I guess that along with super choice has now come a super change in policy. Super choice is the essence of unnecessary paperwork for small business. The governmentâs small business policy has undergone somewhat of a change. I guess the great friend of small business owners has now seen fit to abandon them.</para>
<para>Small business owners can handle a fair bit. We have to. In the main we do not enjoy the luxury of having finance departments to take care of the bookwork. We do not have human resource departments to take care of occupational health and safety, or superannuation departments to fill in and comply with the distribution of superannuation forms. For the most part, doing all this in a small business is the sole province of the small business owner and operator. Small business owners can handle having a relatively simple three-step process replaced with a 34-step process, if they have to. Small business owners can handle the extra paperwork associated with superannuation choice and the various aspects of superannuation funds, if they have to. But they do not have to. Government members have a choice. They can live up to their commitment to reduce unnecessary paperwork and compliance burdens on small business by supporting the oppositionâs amendment. Members opposite must support the small business call and the call of the opposition to exempt small business from superannuation choice.</para>

<para>âI am pleased to have the opportunity today to speak on the <inline ref="R2361">Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2005</inline>. In my electorate of Canberra I have many opportunities to meet with small business owners throughout my community. I find they are unique. They run businesses of very different strengths and sizes and they are all very hard-working men and women who have taken the risk of setting out on their own to start and continue with their own enterprises. I have a great amount of admiration and respect for those Canberrans that take this step. They are the powerhouse of our local economy and I believe that they deserve our support and our encouragement. I am aware that many small businesses, begun in Canberra over the years and decades in the past, have grown and prospered and led Canberra to the developed stage it is today. I pay absolute respect to the background of that business economy in my community.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is for all these reasons and for all of that local history and local commitment from the small business people that I was horrified to learn of the extraordinary burden that is about to be placed on all of those small businesses by this government. The compliance burden that the government wishes to place on small business through its super choice regulations is as astonishing as it is complex. The government has turned a simple three-step system for superannuation into a complex maze of 34 steps. And if Canberra small business owners take a wrong turn in the governmentâs superannuation maze, there are unbelievable penalties.</para>
<para>One of the pitfalls in the superannuation maze could see employers pay multiple fines of up to $500 per employee if they simply fail to navigate this government maze. Also, small business owners could face significant legal liabilities for just giving advice to employees even if they are asked by employees to give a view. This could see Canberra small business owners face two years in jail or fines up to $22,000 if they advise employees outside the terms of the choice of super law. On top of the prospects of facing massive fines and possible jail terms, Canberra employers must now cop an extra layer of Howard government inspired red tape.</para>
<para>Does this government have form on creating more red tape for small business? For employers Australia wide there are now an extra five million forms to be handed out to existing employees and over one million each year thereafter, thanks to this amazing piece of policy. Ongoing records will have to be kept and made available to the tax office for inspection and enforcement. We all remember very clearly the Prime Ministerâs laudable boast in 1996 that his government would commit itself to reducing red tape for small business by 50 per cent. In a media release in July 2004 the then minister for small business made the following statement:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">In addition to cutting red tape the Federal Government is also working to help empower small businesses.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Then the current Minister for Small Business and Tourism, who constantly claims in this House that the government has reduced red tape, had the audacity recently to make this claim:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Australiaâs 1.2 million small businesses continue to benefit from this Governmentâs very strong economic management and we are committed to reducing red tape.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It becomes a bit repetitive when you look over the history of this government in relation to red tape and small business. First there was the GST and now there is super choice. We can see that these promises on red tape and helping small business were just another example of non-core commitment from a government that in fact seems to be obsessed with regulation and therefore the creation of red tape.</para>
<para>I was so concerned by this change in policy in relation to super choice and the effect it would have on Canberraâs small businesses that I, along with my colleague Senator Lundy, recently wrote to small businesses in my electorate making sure they were aware of and prepared for the governmentâs plans. We included in this letter a petition for small businesses to sign and send in. The petition urges the government to exempt small business from the nightmare compliance regimes of these super choice laws. The response from small business in my electorate reflects their concern. The petitions continue to flow into my office from very concerned and very worried small business owners in Canberra. This is because Canberraâs small business owners understand these plans and they are concerned. They are also disappointed at the hypocrisy of this government. They are disappointed by the constant promises made, such as the promise to cut the mountain of red tape they face each day, and they are disappointed that the government continues to disregard and even break those commitments. This can be clearly shown in the response to that petition that I am receiving from small business in my community.</para>
<para>That is interesting, because in the world of politics it is very easy for people to take up the mantra that small business and Labor do not have much in common, that small business is not Laborâs natural constituency. That is said often. I dispute that; I always have. I do not believe in the claim of natural constituencies. I believe that you win constituencies by what you do with and for them. I understand very clearly how the small business community in my electorate are feeling about the impost that this ridiculous policy is going to place upon them.</para>
<para>We on this side of the House understand those problemsâI know I do. My community are talking with me and telling me what they think of it. We care enough to try and implement considered and practical policies and legislation that will help make small business flourish. We are not interested in ideologically driven policies based on division. We are interested in trying to do the right thing to encourage and see bloom even more the small business economy in this country. We do not believe that the introduction of more red tape is going to benefit anybody. In fact, we believe the opposite.</para>
<para>I am interested in supporting policies that are going to see the Australian economy grow. I am interested in seeing policy that is going to encourage and support the powerhouse of our economic base and my economic base in my electorate of Canberra, and that is small business. As I said earlier, the whole of the Canberra economy has grown from a very small beginning with a lot of dedicated people putting money, effort and hard work into developing businesses that began small. They have invested back into this community; they have not been enticed to go elsewhere. Some of these people have been working in this community for decades. They have built themselves into a viable economic community in my electorate and I do not want to see that damaged.</para>
<para>The government constantly claim that they are the best friend that small business has ever had and that they have nothing but the small businessesâ interests at heart. I cannot see how this super choice law and the implications of it for small business can sit beside those statements. I believe that it is a bit of a sad joke. The government are failing small business if they think that they can get away with putting this amazing set of regulations onto the small business in this community through the super choice laws. I am speaking in this debate because I think this is wrong. I think this is bad policy. There are simpler ways for it to be done. I implore the government to look at it very carefully. Putting this sort of regime onto small business while boasting of cutting red tape proves that that is a fallacy. It is just so illogical that I become almost wordless. I cannot understand how they can possibly boast that their policies in this regard are going to help small business. All I can see is small business in my community drowning in the red tape of the super choice regime. I speak very strongly against it and I will continue to represent the small businesses in my community who are telling me how they feel about it until it is changed.</para>

<para>âI would like to say a few brief words in relation to the <inline ref="R2361">Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2005</inline>. Rather than go back through many of the issues that various speakers have raised, I would like to place on record that I support the basic principles of choice in superannuation. I would encourage the government to move in some other areas as well where the legislative arrangements in relation to superannuation have actually sent the wrong message. When superannuation was originally set up it was designed to encourage people to save for their own retirements. Over the years there have been a number of legislative amendments that have essentially led to superannuation funds being used as fundraisers for other matters, not the least of which has been government. I am pleased to see that in recent months there are some positive changes in relation to that and I do congratulate the government.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>But the compliance burden that the shadow minister and the previous speakers for the opposition have raised is of concern to many small businesses within my electorate. I am pleased to see the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer here. I ask the minister, when he is making his response, to spend some time, if he could, on the arrangements that are in the legislation in relation to the two years jail and the $22,000 fine that small businesses could face by inadvertently being in breach of the legislation. I ask the minister if he would address that particular issue because it is outside the bounds of politics and I think we are hearing that loud and clear from the opposition.</para>
<para>Small businesses are concerned about this particular issue. Small businesses are not saying to me that there should not be choice. They agree with the basic principle. Individuals are saying to me that they are pleased to see that there is some choice because they have been shifted around from various funds. They have had money in some funds that they agreed with and other funds that they did not agree with. The fees and general administrative charges of some of the funds were different and they felt as though they were not getting a return out of some funds. This legislation, as I understand it, overcomes that. I think most people would applaud that. But there is this very real issue of red tape and the fines and possible jail sentences that could accrue to people in business who, in a sense, would only be giving advice that they thought was appropriate.</para>
<para>Obviously, in many small businesses, particularly where there are young people, employees will go to their boss, whom they hopefully regard with some respect, and ask for advice rather than have the additional expenses of going to financial planners, accountants et cetera to seek advice on what they should and should not be doing. I think that is the good part of small business: it is small enough to be, in a sense, a family in most casesâI am not saying in every caseâand there are opportunities for people to help one another within the business. That grows the integrity of the business and focuses people in the right direction: towards achieving in their part of the business for the business as a whole, and everybody wins. I think philosophically the government would agree with that but, as I said, I would ask the minister to address that issue specifically and make it very plain to the small businesses out there that this will not be the burden of red tape that it seems to be on reading the legislation. If it is going to be the burden of red tape that the legislation indicates, I would ask the minister to support the second part of the amendment that the opposition has moved in relation to the removal of those constraints.</para>

<para>âThis is an important issue and I want to intervene in the debate in support of the oppositionâs amendment. The debate we are having today concerns one of those ridiculous ham-fisted things that governments do in their late stages as they get increasingly out of touch with the people who put them there. Some people might say that the issue of super choice regulation cannot be that important in itself, but it is emblematic of a government that increasingly has a tin ear for criticism and that, as a result, is making more mistakes and errors of judgment day by day.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Several members of the government have spoken on the <inline ref="R2361">Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2005</inline> and on the Labor amendment in the past day. Each has extolled the virtues of the new super choice regime. They have all attacked Labor for daring to call that regime into question, but none of themânot oneâhas come to terms with the substance of this amendment. None has acknowledged what a red tape nightmare the super choice regime has become. None has explained just why a small business person should face a jail term for helping an employee. None has taken seriously the concerns of small business that the government is about to throw yet another layer of red tape onto themâyet another pesky set of regulations to add to the pressures and the uncertainties of running a business.</para>
<para>I draw your attention, Mr Speaker, to this newspaper advertisement put out by the government to get something of the spirit of the flat panic that the government is obviously now getting into: âEmployees and super choice: time is running outâ. What a way for a government to address an important part of its constituencyâor what it likes to claim is its constituency. What an extraordinary way to start speaking to them about this ideological obsession of yours, for which some of them are going to go to jail. Then, of the several points that are put down in the advertisement, there is this is one: âDonât provide financial advice.â Listen to what the government is saying: âYou may explain the choice process to your employees, but you should not give financial advice unless you are licensed to do so. If your employees want help about how to decide which fund is best for them, they can download the super choice booklet from www.superchoice.gov.au or they can request free copies by calling 13 28 64.â</para>
<para>What an extraordinary situation for employers to find themselves in. Just what constitutes financial advice in these circumstances? Why should an employer who is running some jobbing shop in the back blocks of the western suburbs of Sydney know exactly what that means in legal terms? And why would any employee who spends most of their lives just organising their families, moving to and from work and getting out to the weekend footy and the rest of it feel that they can, without any form of assistance, sit down and work their way through the complex problems of superannuation choice? There is only one person for them to speak to who they know might know something about itâand that is the bloke who pays their wages.</para>
<para>It is precisely for these reasons that we are moving this amendment. The amendment provides for two important changes to the super choice regime. It exempts small businesses from the regimeâs requirements. That means small business owners employing fewer than 20 staff will not be required to comply. It ensures that no small business owner acting in good faith and with no other financial incentives need fear penalties or jail terms if they answer questions from their employees about superannuation. These are sensible reforms. We are proposing them because we have been listening to small business concerns. The amendment addresses specific glaring problems with the operation of the super choice regime, and there is absolutely no reason not to pass it today.</para>
<para>I will start with the jail terms. I accept that there should be serious penalties for employers who get secret kickbacks for pushing their employees into choosing particular super funds. There are rogue employers out there and we must protect employees from people who would trick them into making bad financial decisions about their retirement income. But I do not think that employers should face jail for trying to be helpful. Surely the government should be listening to businesses on this issue. Surely it is too heavy handed to threaten a small business operator with a $22,000 fine or time in jail. Surely it is nonsense for them to be caught in the Corporations Act definition of âcarrying on a financial services businessâ just because they answer an employeeâs question about super.</para>
<para>Let us pause for a moment to reflect on how a small business workplace operates. Relations between employers and staff in many small businesses are relaxed, informal and close. Employers often go out of their way to support their staff, just as employees show a strong loyalty to their boss. Small businesses thrive on a relationship of trust. They do not have all the formal structures of big workplaces because they do not need them. That is why it does not make sense to impose big organisation solutions onto small business.</para>
<para>When it comes to complex legal issues like tax and superannuation, it is natural that employees will look to their boss for guidance. It is natural that some employees will ask their boss for advice about what to write on the super choice form and what fund to choose. That is how small businesses work. So the fact that an employer could face a jail term of up to two years for helping out and answering an employeeâs question is absurd. This is bureaucratic lunacy. This is nuts.</para>
<para>The government has made it inevitable that thousands of small business operators will inadvertently break the law. I cannot understand why the government will not do something about it. It is no use arguing that the courts will be reasonable and a judge will take all these things into account. Why not just fix the law? Why have the threat of these penalties hanging over small businesspeople? Doesnât the government think they have enough stress in their lives already? There is one simple thing the government can do: take them out. Amend this legislation and let employers across Australia breathe a little easier tonight, because I can assure you, Minister Brough, that small businesspeople are now getting worried, which is why you are putting out advertisements like the one I have here. Small businesspeople are getting worried about what it is that they are confronting. Amend this legislation and let employers across Australia breathe a little easier tonight. Just get it done.</para>
<para>We are giving members of the government an opportunity to do that today. But if you will not, let me say this to every member of the government in this chamber: your names will be recorded. Your vote will be on the record and it is you who will need to go back to your electorates and explain yourselves.</para>

</talk.start>

<para>We are proposing a sensible amendment. It does not open the floodgates to employers exploiting their staff, and it does not allow bosses to get secret kickbacks for misleading advice. It simply says if any employer gives an employee advice about their superannuation at their request and they have no pecuniary interest in the advice given then they will not be subject to the penalties of a fine or a jail term. Why wouldnât the government accept it? Why wouldnât you accept that as a simple proposition? I cannot understand why members of the Liberal and National parties plan to vote against this. I cannot imagine how they are going to explain it to their local chamber of commerce next time the issue comes upâand it will come up.</para>
<para>Local businesses will not take much comfort from the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer in this House last Wednesday, when he argued:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... there are no jail terms prescribed in the superannuation choice legislation.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This is a typical example of this governmentâs deceptivenessâit is technically correct, but totally misleading. It is true there are no jail terms in the superannuation choice legislation. But there are jail terms in another piece of legislation, and the superannuation choice law activates the provisions relating to penalties and jail terms. It is highly deceptive to argue these jail terms are not in the super choice laws without admitting they are a consequence of them. What really matters: the location of a clause that imposes a fine of up to $22,000 and a two-year jail term for helping an employee, or the penalties themselves? It is no comfort to employers that the threat of a $22,000 fine is based on the Corporations Act and not the super choice legislation.</para>
<para>These amendments also exempt small businesses from the super choice laws. It is tough enough for small businesses without the extra burden of the super choice laws. Small businesses are already on the front-line of the economy, and more than anyone they have to cope with the effects of the Howard governmentâs neglect of Australiaâs long-term needs. Small businesses are suffering the most from the skills shortage, because they often have a much harder time luring talented staff. They cannot offer the same career progression, and often they cannot offer the same rates of pay as bigger enterprises.</para>
<para>Small businesses are also losing out from our ageing, creaking infrastructureâlike unreliable communications systems, difficulties in accessing high-speed broadband connections, and bad transport links. While they are paying a price for the governmentâs policy failures, small business owners still have their shoulder to the wheel, playing an important role as unpaid tax collectors for the government through the GST and business activity statement system. After all, for the 56 per cent of small businesses who have no employees other than the operator, when the paperwork lands on your desk you cannot pass it on to someone else. For many of them, paperwork is what they have to do outside of normal business hours when they are not doing the hands-on management of the business. So more layers of red tape just means more time buried in paperworkâand, for many of them, more time away from their families. Small business operators do not need more of the Treasurerâs dead hand of regulation. They need relief, and they deserve an exemption.</para>
<para>If their need for an exemption is not clear enough, just look at some of the detail of the implementation of the super choice regime. Look also at the burdens on employers when a fund merges with another. This is significant because it is very likely the next few years will see a big shake-up in super funds management. We can expect a lot of mergers and consolidations. Why then does the law require small business owners to know about every merger and change of fund name, and why should they be in breach of the act if they do not get their employees to fill in a new form within 28 days? What if the business owner is on holidays? How is this provision reasonable?</para>
<para>Look at another aspect of the implementation of the super choice regime: while the government imposes rigid 28-day deadlines on small business owners, it is much softer on itself. It is now less than a month before the super choice regime comes into effect and the government is still making amendments to the act. The Assistant Treasurer flagged this legislation back in March, but it took him another two months to bring these changes into parliament.</para>
<para>While business must jump through hoops to comply with the rules, the government shows a cavalier disregard for business concerns with its tardiness in finishing changes to this law. It is hard not to see this is as another example of where there is one rule for them and another rule for the rest of us. Small business operators will have to print the forms, distribute the forms, make the payments to multiple funds, upgrade their software where necessary, and then go through the whole process again if someoneâs super fund merges with another.</para>
<para>Take just one more example of the high-handed, arrogant attitude behind the implementation of these laws. It concerns the forms that must be handed out to employees within 28 days of 1 July. Five million of these forms need to be returned, but guess what? They have only bothered to print 1.2 million. They advise small business to print the forms themselves. It is quite a different practice, for example, to the Australian Taxation Office, which freely provides tax file number declaration forms. Perhaps this is just a small thing, but perhaps it says something more about their attitudeâthey cannot even be bothered to provide small business people with copies of the forms that must be filled in.</para>
<para>Small business people have long since tired of government ministers chattering about their concern for them and then loading them up with extra burdens. This government has sent enough bureaucrats scurrying off to write reports about compliance burdens. It has made enough flamboyant promises to make things better, like its promise to cut red tape in half, made in 1996. After almost 10 years in power it is about time it delivered, or at least stopped making things worse. But instead of taking these concerns seriously, it thumbs its nose at them. As small businessesâ burdens build, the government blithely ignores their cries.</para>
<para>Its response to Laborâs proposed amendments is a case in point. We are told that small businesses are not concerned about the legislationâit is only a two-page form once per year. We are told that these laws really do not bother small business owners and we are told that, if people are concerned about them, then it must be Laborâs faultâthat Labor must be running a scare campaign. All we are doing is talking about what they have put in their legislation. It was not Labor that invented this regime. It was not Labor that created the 34-step process to comply with the governmentâs super choice regime. It was not Labor that created the 55 pages of explanatory notes, the five million forms to be handed out this year, the extra million forms to be filled in every year afterwards, the need to keep records of the businessâs compliance for tax office inspection for a period of five years and the fines of up to $500 per employee for not complying with the super choice laws.</para>
<para>We did not dream up the idea of threatening mums and dads who run small businesses with jail terms, when they are only trying to be helpful to an employee, because we do not believe in quenching the flames of the entrepreneurial spirit that fire up small business people. Even if they dismiss what Labor is saying, why doesnât the government listen to other voices of small business? Listen to the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia. It says that the super choice regime is complex and expensive, and small businesses should be exempt. I quote from the media release of CEO Tony Stephen dated 4 May 2005:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Shadow Small Business Minister Mr. Tony Burke is right when he calls for exemptions for small business.</para>
<para class="block">â¦Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â¦Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â¦</para>
<para class="block">... informal conversations in the small business workplace could very easily lead to advice being provided which in turn could potentially see the harshest penalties being applied, for a breach of the regulations. A possible two year jail term for giving advise to an employee is a more substantial penalty than courts often impose for more serious crimes, such as shoplifting, most break and enters etc. Iâm sure the community would view these types of crimes as much more serious than offering some advice to an employee/friend within a small business workplace.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Or listen to columnist Peter Switzer in yesterdayâs <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, who wrote of the âmadness that super choice has createdâ, describing it as a ânightmare for employersâ. Listen also to John Hanrahan, the specialist commentator at the Small Business Centre on the popular ninemsn web site, who recently commented:</para>
<quote>
<para>It was the major platform of the Howard government when in opposition in 1996âcut red tape by 50 percent. They either lied or have deliberately ignored small business pleas. Today, small businesses estimate red tape has between doubled and tripled.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I say this to the government: stop blocking your ears to anyone who disagrees with you. You might only be weeks away from the ability to exercise unchecked power. You might now think you can get away with anything. But you should still listen. If the government were listening, they would never have come up with this ham-fisted scheme, but instead we have this red tape mess. Usually, late-term governments go in one direction or another: they either freeze up altogether with sclerotic bureaucracy or they run away with ideological excess. Only the Howard government could do both, with this indulgent, ideological, bureaucratic bungle. Just two simple amendments today could put away the worst of the super choice scheme and let small business operators sleep a little easier tonight. Labor stands by Australiaâs hardworking small business operators today because they deserve a better deal from this government. We invite all members of the House to join us.</para>
<para>I am very proud of the small business spokesperson that we have in this place. He has one thing in common with a large number of the people newly elected to our Labor Party backbench. Almost all of them at one point in their lives have been engaged in small businessâalmost all of them. All of them have a thoroughgoing understanding of this, including our spokesman, who was himself a small businessman. Unlike those on the Liberal Party front bench opposite, they know exactly what goes on inside a small business and they know exactly what confusion, difficulty and fear this is going to create in the hearts and minds of many small business people. So for just once in your lives listenâlisten to somebody who knows something about what goes on in small business and respond decently and amend the proposed legislation in the way in which we have suggested to you.</para>

<para>âin replyâThe <inline ref="R2361">Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2005</inline> has its origins in 1995. This is not new policy from the coalition; this is something that we took to the people in the election of March 1996 and that we were elected on. This is the end of a process that the Labor Party has stymied for nine long years. Today the very last speaker in the second reading debate on this bill, the Leader of the Opposition, made a last-ditch attempt to fight a rearguard action to prevent many Australians from having the opportunity to decide where their second largest investment is going to be placed. Why? Because Labor are ideologically opposed to giving Australians the choice, the capacity and the benefit of being able to decide where their own money is invested. That is the basic principle and you have to ask yourself why that is.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The reason for that is that the Labor Party do not think the workers in the small business community, who they are aligning themselves with today, have the capacity to decide where this money should be invested. The Labor Party know who is best placed to make that investment for them! They do not believe it is financial advisers, small business people or individuals; they think it is the unions. The bottom line is that the Labor Party are all about carving out nearly 50 per cent of the private sector employees in this country from deciding who invests their retirement incomes, what fees they pay and what returns they get, and from having the security that is gained by being involved.</para>
<para>If you take away all of the trappings, the rhetoric and the longwinded explanations of the Labor Party for their somehow newfound love of small business, it comes down to one thingâthat is, preventing 50 per cent of private sector employees from having this opportunity so that the unions can decide where their money goes. That is purely and simply what this is all about. The Labor Party have denied Australian workers this opportunity. We heard them last night and again today in this place saying how this is going to be too confusing. How belittling they are of Australian workers. I am not going to belittle Australian workers. The government have faith in their capacity to make these decisions and, in doing so, we will provide the information that they need. When you take away the rights of people and you say, âYou are not capable but weâbig brotherâare,â you alienate them from one of the most important decisions they make in their lives: the sort of retirement they wish to have.</para>
<para>Before going on to some of the amendments I would like to deal with a couple of the issues that were raised, particularly by the honourable member for New England, who has expressed a genuine concern about the penalties that apply should business people provide advice to an employee who is seeking to make a choice. As has finally been recognised by the Leader of the Oppositionâwhen he stood up in this place to give his budget reply speech he clearly did not understand itâthe laws that apply to penalties are not part of this legislation. They are a separate issue. They were strongly supported by the Labor PartyâI think it was in 2000-01. The point of those laws is to prevent individuals profiting in an unreasonable fashion by giving misleading information or by not declaring that they have a pecuniary interest et cetera.</para>
<para>No small business needs to fear that legislation. Let me put the scenario to you in this way. The employee says to the employer of two or three people in Tamworth, âBoss, this super choice thingâwhat do I need to do about it?â The employer can tell him a number of things quite openly. Firstly, he can say, âThis is a choice that you have. Youâve never had it before.â There is no penalty for that. Secondly, he can say, âThere is a booklet that the government has put out. We have it here for you and you can take it.â This is the book that the opposition have been railing about. It is entitled <inline font-style="italic">Super Choice. Think about your future.</inline> This is the book about which the opposition has said, âThey have to go through 54 pages.â</para>
<para>Let me walk you briefly through some of the things the booklet talks about. It talks about getting super before your preservation age. That is stuff that we, as local members, hear about quite regularly. This book explains how you can get it and what you need to do. The booklet covers how to complain about your fund should you need to do so. It covers what to do if you want to recover lost superannuationâanother issue that is important to a lot of small businesses.Â  The booklet covers keeping track of your own superannuation and what you can do when you make job changes. It also goes into how to make a worthwhile investment. It explains to employees things such as pre-tax contributions and salary sacrificing. These are not things that we expect small business people to be giving lengthy advice about. These people want to get on and do their business. So the best advice a small business person can give an employee is to provide them with this booklet and say to them, âThe ASIC web site shows every fee of every super fund. Have a look at that and compare the one we have as our default fund with one that perhaps someone else is touting to you.â</para>
<para>There is nothing wrong with any of that sort of advice. What is wrong and what this government stands ready to ensure that people are penalised for is when the small business person says, âListen, mate, what you should be doing is going into this fund because it does this, this and this,â when it turns out that that person is receiving kickbacks or has some other association, maybe a loan, through an associated business. That is improper behaviour and we do not believe that that should be carved out in any way, shape nor form. So the bottom line is that the employer has nothing to fear other than the fear that has been placed on the small business community by the press releases of those opposite. I will read the words, for the member for New England, of ATO and ASIC, who will be in charge of this particular regime.</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Although there are penalties for breaching the legislation, both the ATO and the ASIC have made it clear that during the bedding down period they will exercise a sense of balance where employers are making a genuine attempt to comply.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">They are referring to two things there. Firstly, they are referring to the fine of up to $500 for not providing choice. If someone has inadvertently done the wrong thing, just like when the GST came in, we will make people aware that there are periods of time during which people can become used to the new process. This is a substantial change and the ATO and ASIC have made it abundantly clear that they are not out to punish employers who are genuinely attempting to do the right thing. Secondly, they are saying that no-one in this place should, for one moment, run away from the proposition that we should somehow give comfort to an individual, whether they be an employer or some other body, if they try to pull the wool over the eyes of en employee or if they try to benefit from it. The legislation that is before us today reinforces that by stating that an employer cannot charge an employee for any of the services that they provide in providing choice to them.</para>
<para>Let us go to a couple of the other charges made by Labor Party here today. The Leader of the Opposition was fundamentally wrong in so many things that he said. Firstly, you are not required to print off the five million forms he spoke of. The ATO will send them out. They continue to send out the forms. Secondly, overwhelmingly the superannuation companies are filling out this two-page form with their own information on it, giving it to the employers and the employers are passing that on to the staff so that it is there. That is all they have to do. Then they say, âWhat happens when the 20 employees I have all want to make a separate contribution to 20 different funds?â I grant you that that would be an onerous thing to do, if that were the caseâexcept for one thing. Under swimEC, and many other software operations, they will be required to write out one cheque for 20 employees to 20 different funds and deliver it to one fund which will distribute it for them.</para>

<para>âI welcome the interjection from the shadow minister. If he had read the legislation he would know they are not one of the things included in the kickbacks. They are provided free of charge by the super funds. swimEC is a protocol that has been developed by the ATO and the industry over many years, and that is free as well. So there is no charge for that. There is no requirement to send cheques to everyone, as has been made out. The legislation is quite clear about penalties. They are for misleading behaviour which tries to defraud your employee. Quite frankly, if your employer is that way inclined that they want to defraud you, God help you with everything else you are doing with that particular person. Your superannuation is probably not even being paid, let alone anything else, and that is the sort of issue you need to take up.</para>

<para>âThe Leader of the OppositionâI always get confused when I refer to him, because I never know whether he is Leader of the Opposition, sitting on the back bench, here today or gone tomorrow. We have had Simon Crean, Mark Lathamâand Kim Beazley again. Who is it going to be next week? I am sorry I get confused on that issue. The Leader of the Opposition talks about the confusion for small business. He rightly pointed out that, some time ago, I highlighted and made sure the industry was aware of the amendments that are before the House today. What the small business community does not know today, 29 days before the end of the month, is whether or not they will have to deduct withholding tax, and at what rates, after 1 Julyâbecause the Labor Party cannot make a decision. If the shadow minister for revenue, the shadow minister for small business and the Leader of the Opposition were genuinely concerned about small business they would get out of the way and make a decision on that issue today. But they simply cannot.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I come back to where we are at. The Labor Party is fighting a rearguard action on this issue not because of a newfound fundamental respect for small business but because they are trying to protect the unionsâ right to choose. Because they lost the main battle, they are now trying to regain a little of the ground that was given up earlier on. I have faith in the capacity of the Australian worker. I have pointed out and made very clear that this is not an onerous process for small business, and if the shadow ministers wish to ask the superannuation funds who have been going around the countryâI am talking about ASFA, the industry funds and the retail fundsâthey will tell them their experience with small business was not shock horror at all. It was quite the contrary. The only concerns raised have been the press releases put out by the Labor Party with their typical scaremongering tactics of threatening people that they will end up in jail.</para>
<para>The bill before us today takes into account many of the concerns that small business raised with us. This government does listen to small business, and as a result has made amendments to the legislation to make sure it is not onerous on them at all. Once again the Leader of the Opposition got it wrong in his final address. He said that every 12 months they are going to provide a form to employers. That is not correct. If he is going to come in here and give a speech on such a fundamental issue, which we have been fighting on as a matter of principle on behalf of workers for nine years, he could at least get the facts right. The facts are that you are required to give eligible employees a form within 28 days of 1 July and within 28 days of them joining your firm, not annually. The employee has a right to change funds should they wish to. Labor says they can change only once a year. The facts are considerably different.</para>
<para>This brings us to a confusion within the Labor Party that still has not been cleared up. Every time we have a debate on super choice I ask them if they can please clarify what they mean when they rail day in and day out about superannuation choice being too confusing for employeesâthat they should not have the right and that we should carve these people out. How can they reconcile that with their position prior to the last election, when the shadow spokesman stood up on the Gold Coast in front of the ISFA conference and stated unambiguously that it is Labor Party policy to require the states to fall in line with the federal jurisdiction and offer choice to their employees. If you have not run away from that you should embrace it, and if you are going to embrace it then embrace it for what it is.</para>
<para>The Queensland Labor government have not only maintained the status quo on super choice but have also reduced the rights of employees. Laborâs fundamental opposition to this is that the unions know better than employees. No wonder they languish in the polls and no wonder the public has rejected them at the last four elections. Not only are more Australians workingâwhich means more Australians are having super guarantee paid into their accountsâbut more Australians are earning more because they are paying lower rates of tax. They will pay even lower rates of tax from 1 July, and therefore will have more take-home pay and will be making more contributions to superannuation. We say to the Australian work force: âIt it is your right. If you are engaged in this process then more Australians will take up the very generous offer under the superannuation co-contribution of $1.50 for every one dollar they contribute to their super. You will be taking up the most tax-effective investment you can make. You can make provisions for your own retirement, and you can do it with security.â</para>
<para>The small business community has absolutely nothing to fear. The shadow ministers and those opposite rail against a booklet which asks you to think about your super choice and gives you clear and concise information about choosing investment strategies. This is a booklet you can look at in your own time. It tells you how to look at growth options, what the risks are and whether you should be looking at insurance. It is all there.</para>

<para>Let the employee sit down and go through what is very detailed information. We do not want one Australian to take this decision lightly. We do not expect every Australian to take super choice on 1 July. It is not only for one moment in time that people will have this option. This option will remain open for as long as this policy remains in place and the coalition remains in government. Therefore, the Australian public can take their time. They can read these booklets and decide at any time that they want to make a change.</para>
<para>Let us not forget some of the positives that have already flowed from this policy: fees are coming down and funds are now engaging with the people who invest their money with them. Funds are keeping phone lines open and giving people advice. Glory be, they get nine per cent of their payâday in day out, week in week out, year in year outâand in the past the poor old employee hardly had any connection with them. As a result of this positive initiative those super funds are engaging with them and getting them involved, and as such we have a sounder financial basis going into the future.</para>
<para>Let us not forget that we have an ageing population. The Australian population is growing older and living longer. It is incumbent upon all of us as policymakers to ensure that we engaged with the public to ensure that they are making provisions to have the lifestyle they want with security into their future. All the measures in this bill are appropriateâthey respond to the needs of small business but most importantly they empower the Australian worker. That is what the coalition stands forâproviding workers with incentives and empowerment to make decisions for themselves.</para>
<para>The Labor Party says that employees get their advice from small business people. I wonder how many employers sitting out there provide detailed advice to employees when someone is about to take out a mortgage. Do they go along and ask them which is the best? I do not think so, and we would not expect them to and we do not expect them to do this. That is why the government has provided such comprehensive information to the business community, to the employees and to the super funds. I commend the bill to the House.</para>

</amendments>
<para class="block">What an interesting summation from the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Mr Brough. I invited him last night to give the opposition and the more than one million small firms in Australia an ironclad guarantee that they would not face jail terms and penalties for inadvertently giving advice under the FSR Act as it relates to the <inline ref="R2361">Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2005</inline>. I invited him to do so and he did no such thing. Instead we got the sleight of hand once againâthe trick we get from this government all the time, the doublespeakâwhich gave us no assurance at all. It certainly did not give any assurances to the small business community in this country.</para>
<para>I move this amendment to protect small business employers. This is the point the minister missed; he obviously did not take the time to read the amendment, which I generously circulated earlier than was planned for his benefit. The amendment makes it quite clear that the small business employer is only exempt from the FSR rules, that is, from the heavy fines and jail penalties, if he or she has no pecuniary interest and only if he or she was asked for the advice by the employee. We make that quite clear. Let us not have the government say that we are opening up some opportunity for an employer to abuse the laws and receive kickbacks. Nothing could be further from the truth. We are saying that if an employer, when asked and without a pecuniary interest, inadvertently gives advice about which super fund might be best for an employee he will be protected. That is eminently reasonable.</para>
<para>The minister kept avoiding the question. The obvious simple situation is when the employee has been given the glossy bookletâalthough probably not; he has probably had to download it if he has access to the internet because no doubt, like the forms, not many glossy booklets will be printedâand typically says, âThatâs all great, boss, but just between you and me, really, which fund should I sign up to? I donât understand all this stuff? This is all new to me.â It is probably just as new to the employer. âItâs all new to me, boss. Which fund should I sign up to? You know more about this than I do.â Of course, under the ministerâs proposed law, if the employer gives that advice he is in breach ofÂ  the FSR Act.</para>
<para>Let us be clear: the bill we are seeking to amend today has been brought in to amend an act which is not even law yetâit does not come into effect until 1 July this year. This is the complexity that is involved in this super choice area. The government brings in a bill and, before it even becomes law, here we are with government amendments to make that bill more efficient and, I assume they would argue, to ease the red tape burden.</para>
<para>They are not doing a very good job of it. I am disappointed that the member for Greenway has now left the chamber. When she wandered in here I thought that just maybe, for the first time, she was going to stand in this place and defend the small businesses in her electorate. She has already, since coming into this place, given them interest rate rises. She has already given them rises in their private health insurance premiums and she has already presided over record high petrol prices. I thought she might have come in here just once and given them something elseâjust simply have given them a break. That is what we were hoping for from the member for Greenway. I am not sure whether the minister just bored her to tears and she could not sit there any longer, but unfortunately she chose to leave the chamber before she was given the opportunity to participate in debate over these important amendments.</para>
<para>This government went into the 1996 election promising to cut red tape for small business. Indeed, it promised to cut red tape by 50 per cent. What a laugh that now is. As the Leader of the Opposition says, maybe we could simply ask it to stop adding to the burden. If you are not capable of reducing it, Minister, how about considering just stopping adding to the burden? That is all the opposition is asking of you today. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> By supporting the amendments I have just moved and by supporting the amendment that will be moved by the member for Watson in a little while, the government could take the opportunity to do so.</para>
<para>The Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer stood here and made a very weak attempt to assure small business owners they would not be in breach of the FSR laws. He made a very ordinary job of it indeed. The Leader of the Opposition referred to the âEmployees and super choice: time is running outâ advertisement in todayâs newspaper. Why else would they be making it so clear in this advertisement if they were not prepared to now concede the risk there is for the small business owner in giving advice? The FSR makes it quite clear that, if the small business owner is not a registered, licensed financial adviser, he cannot give that advice. If he does so, he could be subject to heavy penalties up to $22,000 and two years in jail.</para>
<para>I ask the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer: why would you not support Laborâs amendment, which is quite clear, obviously free of any technical difficulties and could not be any plainer? Why would you not send an assurance to small business owners in the Australian community that you will protect them? Is it because it is a Labor amendment? If that is the case, we are happy to withdraw it on the ground that you give a written guaranteeâand you can do that now; your handwriting will be fine, although I would of course expect it to be signedâthat you are prepared to move a government amendment to this effect. We do not mind giving it over to you. We are not precious about these things at all. We will withdraw this amendment if you are prepared to give that written guarantee, and at some time in the very near future you can stand up in this place and move the amendment. You do not have to draft it. I can just hand it over to you. It is all correctly and perfectly done. We will be happy to support it. We do not care, Minister, who moves the amendment. We do not care who corrects the law. At the end of the day, we do not care who it is that gives the assurances and protection to small businesses that they require. If you want to do it, we will be more than happy for you to do it, Minister.</para>
<para>You talked about rogue employers. Gee, that is the first time I have heard a government minister admit that such a thing as a rogue employer exists. I seem to recall those on this side talking about rogue employers for a whileâand they do exist out there. The overwhelming majority of small business employers and employers generally are good employers who invest in their employees and like to take care of them because, financially and economically, it is good for them to do so, but there are rogue employers out there. That is why we have opposed the exemption for small business for the unfair dismissals law. It is pure and simple. We know the overwhelming majority of small business employers do the right thing. But there are some rogue employers out there who, given the opportunity, will do the wrong thing.</para>
<para>I will not speak on the amendments at length now. I will wait until the member for Watson goes to them in detail. But this brings us to the inconsistency. The government will not support a carve-out from FSR under this Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill for businesses with 20 or fewer employees but will support an exemption for small businesses with 20 or fewer employees. We did not take this arbitrary figure of 20. It is not an arbitrary figure. We copied itâ</para>

<para>âOh, it is 100 now. I am a bit a behind the times. I forgot for a moment the Prime Ministerâs statement of last Thursday. It is about to get a whole lot worse, so I appreciate the intervention of the parliamentary secretary. We did not take 20 as an arbitrary figure just plucked out of the sky. We took the governmentâs original figure of 20 employees, acknowledging that they do not have a human resources department and those other resources to handle these matters. We say that under super choice those with 20 or fewer employees should be carved out, consistent with what the minister has been saying for almost the last 10 years. So here is your opportunity, Minister, to get up in this House. I will withdraw the amendment; I am happy to do that. You can take ownership of it. You can do a media release claiming all the credit. Just do it, Minister. We are giving you the opportunity to just do it.</para>

<para>âI had been listed at one stage to speak in this debate and, having already spoken in the public servant debate, I thought it was appropriate to let the House get on with its business. Having discovered that that is not going to be the caseâand even the Leader of the Opposition has entered the debateâI return to look at these amendments which are being dealt with at the consideration in detail stage. I was interested to hear the member for Hunter make the point in his speech that there are many good employers in small business. I have repeatedly said in this place and at doorstops over the years that most, if not nearly all, small business people do not wake up in the morning thinking, âI wonder who I can sack this morning.â They see their staff as a very valuable asset in their business operations. For example, I had in my electorate a machinery dealer with tears in his eyes explaining how he and his wife would carry on their business in the drought but not knowing where he would get his staff from when things turned up again because they would all have to leave.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I am astounded at the debate on issues such as unfair dismissal. Let me overcome a myth: an employer of 100 people in this day and age of casual employment is not a big employer. The average farmer in my electorate would not have one full-time employee but in a year would have 20, 30 or 40 casual employeesâshearers and others who come in at different times of the yearâand they would be subject to this superannuation requirement. If a shearing team comes onto a farmerâs property and it is not run by a contractor who is a full-time employer and who sends your money into a single account, the farmer is obliged to, amongst other things, pay superannuation to each and every one of the workers involvedâbe they shed hands, shearers or whatever.</para>
<para>I have taken a great interest in this aspect of the responsibility of an employer to provide choice. As I said the other day when I spoke about the first union super, the issue of portability was not considered. Shearers wrote to me, saying: âI shear this time of the year; I am a truck driver that time of the year. I have now got three or four super funds and I have no control to insist that it be aggregated to one fund.â</para>
<para>There is no need for these amendments. As the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer pointed out, having heard the rhetoric of unfair dismissal when every employer was a crook, we suddenly heard the Leader of the Opposition come in here and say words to the effect, âEmployers and employees get along so well in small business.â Of course they do, but the opposition better make up its mind. Either they are a mob of crooks or they are very decent people, and I am of the second position.</para>
<para>My wife is a small business person. Having sighted the documents she has received and havingâas I am sure the minister is prepared to admitâquestioned the minister in the party room on some of the administrative details, the minister satisfied me that, for instance, you do not have to send a cheque to five, 10 or 50 different superannuation funds when the shearing team comes on your property. You can send one cheque to a nominated insurer, who will have the responsibility, on receipt of a list, to distribute the funds.</para>
<para>The opposition has not been standing up in here saying, âLook, there might be other minor administrative arrangements you should consider under regulation, such as the issuance of a plastic card.â I think the super funds might find it good idea in due course to send their contributors a card. But we cannot look past the simple fact that union super is a huge area; it originated in award super. The 50 per cent of preselection voters have sent a message to these people, âFor a short period, we would like you to like small business,â and use that as the excuse to protect our big business operation. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThe Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer referred during this debate on the <inline ref="R2361">Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2005</inline> to the situation where he thought prison terms were a fair go and ought to apply. If these amendments are carried, the exact scenario referred to by the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer would still apply. The employer who acts to its pecuniary interest is not carved out of jail terms by our amendments. The employer who is pushing a super fund onto employees is not carved out by our amendments. These amendments before the House are simply so that a request for advice can come from the employee and the employer can give advice with no pecuniary interest. In that scenario it is outrageous to say a possible prison sentence and a maximum $22,000 fine should be on the table at all. That is the precise wording of the amendment. All that is carved out from this is the question that we know will be asked.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The minister used the line âOh, look, do people go to their boss? Do they ask the butcher about their mortgage?â Yes, they do. Employees regularly ask their employer for financial advice. Interestingly, on the precise example given by the Minister for Revenue, if the advice they asked for was about a purchase of property and the employer had a financial interest in itâa pecuniary interest that they did not discloseâand they gave advice, it would be completely legal. Jail terms do not apply to that. But, if the employer says, âI reckon this is the best fund of the ones that you are looking at there,â the Corporations Act is activated.</para>
<para>This is the great disappointment. I could only be impressed with the spin but, as a fair dinkum argument, to argue that there is nothing in the super choice legislation that carries jail penalties is about as dodgy as this debate could be. Of course it is not in the super choice legislation; it is in the Corporations Act. When we had the system where the employer simply put forward a default fund and that was the end of the matter, the only time there would be the choice to have a different fund would be at the instigation of the employeeâand some small businesses would do it voluntarilyânot because material had been given to them by the boss or they had been told it was time to make a choice. When there were simply default funds, the employer was not going to be asked the question. In the present situation, we know that the employer will be asked, âWhat do you reckon I ought to do?â If the employer answers that question to their own pecuniary interest, I agree that serious penalties ought to prevail. If the employer pushes an opinion onto employees without them even requesting it, I agree that serious penalties should be there.</para>
<para>But the scenario of this amendment is that the advice is given at the request of the employee and with no pecuniary benefit to the employer. When that is the situation I want to hear from the minister why, in the scenario that the amendment refers to and not in the scenario we agree on, a criminal penalty should be on the table at all. If we all agree that it should not be there, then why do we say that we will just leave it to the courts and let them sort it out? It should not be hanging over the head of the employer at all when it is at the request of the employee and there is no pecuniary interest in the answer given by the employer. I want to hear from the Minister for Revenue, when he pops up a little bit later, why in that scenario those penalties ought to prevail. I am quite happy to lose traction on this issue if the government just fix it. I am surprised this issue has survived as long as it has. When we first put out the media statement I said to Senator Nick Sherry, âI suppose this will have a run for about a week and then it will all be over.â I am amazed that the only issue standing between a very reasonable policy position and a draconian alternative appears to be the pride of the minister opposite. Maybe just swallow that pride, Minister, and decide that it is not too big a call to say that when someone acts fairly on a question that we know they are going to be asked criminal penalties should not prevail. Do not force your backbench to come in and vote otherwise.</para>

<para>âI would like to answer that question and I will do it in full. Firstly, the whole principle behind this is that we took the position that employers should not have an imposition placed on them so that they felt they had an obligation to provide advice; hence, the actual law as we have stated it reassures them that they do not. Secondly, the reason we are having this debate today is that, as the shadow minister alluded to, he put out a press release trying to heat the issue up a bit and now he has to try to defend it. So let me put it on the table for the member for New Englandâand I hope you two members across the table listen so that you understand exactly what is required. Firstly, the instance that was given by the member for New England is that a staff member asks for advice and the employer provides that advice.</para>

<para>âThere you go being judge and jury. That is pretty typical of the shoot-from-the-hip reaction that you get from the shadow minister, who quite clearly does not understand what happens. There would then need to be a complaint to ASIC. I guess it would have to be from the person that actually asked for the advice in the first place. Secondly, with the person having provided that information to ASIC, ASIC then has to actually conduct a criminal investigation and at the end of that investigation, if they find that there has been no criminal intent, they have to decide whether or not to provide that information to and refer the matter to the DPP. So the discretion is with ASIC.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Let us go through it again in the absolute terms as provided by the member for New England. A person, as the shadow minister has alluded to, asks for some advice. The person does not realise they are breaching the FSR. The employer provides the advice. In the event that the individual complainsâI imagine that is the only person that is going to be involved here; I do not know who else is going to complain but let us say someone complainsâASIC then has to go and investigate the matter and deal with a criminal investigation and deem whether or not there has been a fundamental breach. It then has the discretion to determine whether or not that has to be referred to the DPP, and then the DPP decides whether any further action is to be taken.</para>
<para>So, from all of the examples that have been provided by the shadow minister and through the information that has been sought by the member for New England, it is quite clear that this law (1) protects the business person in general, (2) does not water things down or carve out people who may find themselves using those loopholes for their own interests, and (3) also takes away from the employer the obligation, whether it be stated or presumed, that they somehow have a duty and obligation to provide advice. That is one of the things that comes back to me from time to time. If I am asked to provide advice to my employees I will have to say, âNo; in fact, I am not allowed to.â It will give them great comfort to know that they do not have to and that they can point to it. That is why it is on the two-page form and in the adsâso everybody is clear that the person you do not go troubling about these issues is your employer and that there is advice available via ASIC, advice available on the 013 number and advice available on a web site. You can also go out and get financial advice as well. I hope that answers the question of the member for New England.</para>

<para>âI thank the minister for his answer. So I understand what he said, in that situation where an employer who does not have a pecuniary interest gives advice to an employee, the employer is in technical breach of the Financial Services Reform Act. I think the minister is saying that it is an extremely unlikely event that, when that inadvertent advice is given, because of the processes that the minister talks about, the small business owner would be pursued. But it is an event that could occur. My question now to the minister is: if that event could occur why can the government not accept the amendment of the opposition and remove that possibility and all of the red tape and time that would be consumed if in fact it was pursued through ASIC and the various channels and then, on the advice of the DPP, dropped? If the parliament seems to be that close to agreement on this issue, why not remove that aspect of the red tape from the legislation of choice and there would be no argument?</para>

<para>âIt is probably my fault that I have not made it clear enough. The fact is that the advice has to be on a specific financial product. I put the scenario to you that, if the person who has sought that information feels so dudded by that advice, because the advice provided is on a specific financial product and not in general terms such as, âYes, that looks like a pretty good company,â then there is technically a breach and the processes come into play. Let us be realistic about this: a person seeking advice would only go to the trouble of contacting ASIC and the appropriate authorities if they felt absolutely aggrieved, in which case there is potentially an issue.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I come back to the point about putting holes and carve-outs in the legislation. I will take you in good faith, against my better judgment. You talk about direct pecuniary interests. What about financial products they may have elsewhere, through third entities that are unrelated? There are so many ways in which people can influence it. They do not have to have a direct interest in it to make it worth their while. Why create that when we have absolute certainty? A uniform code was agreed to by everyone in 2000 or 2001. This means that small business is protected from having to provide advice. The advice small business gives to me constantly is this: âPlease, I am not in a position to do that.â</para>
<para>The member for Werriwa is a small business man and I listened to him carefully. The last thing an employer would want to do is to try to provide advice to their staff that they are not qualified to give. You used an example of a butcher. Employers do not want their staff to think that the boss does not want to help them. They can say: âHey, listen. I am not allowed to help you; it is clear-cut. Besides, I really donât have the capability. The best advice I can give you is to read this booklet. There is a 13 number, which you can call and talk to someone who understands. If you have access to the web, here it is.â Employers can say: âGo and talk to a financial adviser. Talk to your superannuation fund.â That is not a breach of the law. It would only be a breach of the law technicallyâand then those other processes come into playâif an employer provided advice about a specific financial product. You would have to be awfully aggrieved to go through those processes.</para>

<para>âWhat an extraordinary contribution from the minister at the table. I would like to thank the member for New England for his sensible and reasoned approach to this matter. The minister at the table said, in effect, that the law does not matter: âYes, we are making it illegal but nobodyâs ever going to enforce it, so donât worry about it. Itâs okay.â I am sure the honourable minister will be happy to give evidence on behalf of anybody who is charged in coming years. He will be subpoenaed regularly to give evidence: âI was the minister when we passed this, but we didnât actually mean to catch people. Itâs all very technical. I would have accepted the Labor Partyâs amendment but for their thinking of it first. Then I was painted into a corner. Iâm sorry, Your Honour, itâs all a big mistake.â If the minister really believes that, why is the government advertising in todayâs newspaper that you must not give financial advice unless you are licensed to do so? That is what the governmentâs advertisement says. Now the minister is saying that if somebody asks for the advice and nobody gets upset about it that it is all okay: âASIC wonât prosecute and the DPP wonât prosecute. Donât worry about it.â That is a fine approach. It is most extraordinary for the government of the Commonwealth of Australia to say, âItâs the law; donât worry about it.â</para>
</talk.start>
<para>If this bill is passed unamendedâwhich I suspect it will beâwe will have an extraordinary situation. Somebody who gives dodgy property investment advice will not be covered by the Financial Services Reform Act or the Corporations Act, but that is okayâyou can give dodgy property investment advice but you cannot help out your employee, in good faith, by giving them advice when asked. The minister at the table said that people would only make a complaint if they were upset. Advice can be given in good faith but still be bad advice. An employee can go to their employer and ask which fund they should join. An employer may say: âIâve been a member of this fund for a long time. I have had very good returns and I would recommend it,â but something could go wrong, such as the fund giving very bad returns. If the employee gets very upset and someone says to him, âYour boss shouldnât have given you that adviceâthatâs wrong,â he may then lodge a complaint with ASIC. But it is okay. The Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer said: âDonât worry. Nobody is ever going to prosecute you. Nobody is ever going to chase up the law.â That is an extraordinary situation. As I have said, there is a massive inconsistency. Property investment advice can be shonky but that is not a problemâno penalties, no prosecutions.</para>

<para>âFollowing on from the member for Prospect, I think it is important for us to ask the minister specifically the circumstances in which employers may well be liable for jail or a fine in the event that they provide advice, wittingly or otherwise, to their employees. When the minister gets an opportunity to respond, I would like an answer to my question, which follows on from the questions that were asked by the member for New England. I am trying to get to the nub of the concern that the amendments seek to fix. If an employer provides advice to his or her employees on a particular fund they may ultimately choose to place their superannuation contributions and if that employee subsequently complainsâthat is, the employee is not happy with the choice that he has made on the advice of his employerâwill that complaint attract the provisions of the FSR Act and then set in motion the capacity for that employer to be fined or jailed? That is the central point, and that is why the member for Hunter has moved the amendments.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>If the minister can give an unqualified answer in this place that there would be no possibility that, upon providing advice to an employee and upon that employee subsequently complaining about that advice, an employer could be imprisoned or fined then we would be satisfied. If that is the ministerâs answer we would be satisfied. But I really need to know specificallyâand I am sure that all members and, more importantly, all small businesses wish to knowâexactly what the situation is. If this bill is enacted without the amendments being proposed, is there a possibility in those circumstances that I outlined that an employer could go to jail or be fined?</para>

<para>âI welcome the amendments to the <inline ref="R2361">Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Choice of Superannuation Funds) Bill 2005</inline> proposed by the member for Watson and the member for Hunter. This is the opposition attempting to do our job and improve as best we can from this side of the House a very bad piece of legislation. Welcome to another small business red tape nightmare courtesy of the Howard government! On behalf of the many thousands of small businesses in Geelong let me register my strong opposition to this super choice legislation which is going to swamp them in red tape.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This red tape burden is being imposed for one simple reason: the governmentâs ideological obsession with the issue of super choice. It is now a matter for the public record that the Howard government has turned Geelong small businesses into unpaid tax collectors for the government. Under the Howard government the tax act has doubled to over 9,000 pages. Now we have an extra burden being placed on businesses that are struggling to remain competitive in a very highly competitive environment. This particular bill will impose extraordinary burdens. It is costly and complex, and it is unsafe. For 400,000 employers it represents a massive new compliance burden, with some 34 steps needed to comply, including five million forms to be handed out to existing employees and over one million each year thereafter. It requires ongoing record keeping for five years to be made available for tax office inspection and enforcement; payments to multiple super funds, with thousands of them in existence and funds nominated able to be changed every 12 months; and fines of up to $500 per employee for employers if they get it wrong. And, of course, there is the subject of this particular amendment we are discussing: employers will face significant legal liability if they give advice to employees even if they are asked. Small business forms the backbone of the Geelong economy. It is a major employer. It does not need this burden at this time. I commend the amendments that have been moved. They have been moved in good spirit to advantage small business in the light of the very bad piece of legislation now before the House.</para>

<para class="block">Members of the government have just come into this chamber to vote specifically on the issue of jail terms for employers who try to be helpful in giving advice. The last amendment applied to employers generally. The next ones say that if this government is determined to allow serious penalties to apply to employers generally, at the very least allow a carve-out of small business. We have had extraordinary arguments run previously as to why you could not have a carve-out of small business. A spokesperson for the minister at the table, the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, said previouslyâand I have quoted it beforeâthat the problem with carving out small business from the super choice legislation would be that you would âcreate a competitive disadvantageâ for small business in taking on extra employees. A competitive disadvantage! As though exempting them all from unfair dismissal and allowing employees to be hired and fired at will did not in some way create a much greater competitive disadvantage for small business in employing people. The real issue here is one of paperwork. The issue is not about a competitive advantage or disadvantage in getting staff on.</para>
<para>The minister has acknowledged that, at first, most employees will not be exercising choice. Most employees will not choose to. They have already introduced a scheme starting on 1 July. Will it apply to people on state awards? No. Will it apply to people on AWAs with a super clause in their AWA? No. Will it apply to people on collective agreements with a super clause in their collective agreements? No, it will not. There are already a whole series of categories for which exemptions have been given. Why on earth will the government not extend those exemptions to small business?</para>
<para>It is a reasonable call to say that there is a higher burden on small business with compliance with this legislation than there is on larger businesses, for the very simple reason that they do not have an administration department to deal with this. They do not have a personnel department to deal with it. Every extra piece of paperwork lands on the desk of the employer. Every moment they spend having to attend to that paperwork, having to learn new sets of regulations, takes them away from their business. We have had the extraordinary comment from the minister earlier saying that he knows that small business is not unhappy about this. Why? Because the super funds are telling him. Not that they are consulting directly with small businessâ</para>

<para>âThe consultation that the minister refers toâthe minister who now says, âYes, I have too; I just didnât happen to mention it in my speech a bit earlierââwas done by the superannuation funds. These are the superannuation funds with a huge vested interest in saying there is no compliance burden. He ignores the comments from COSBOA, ignores the comments from the small business organisations, ignores the comments from the small business writers and ignores the comments on the ground, where there are few things more offensive you could say to a small business operator than, âItâs just another two-page form.â</para>

<para>Every extra piece of compliance burden that lands on the desk of small business is a real problem. It is a real problem in taking them away from their business and it is just plain downright offensive coming from a government that promised to reduce red tape by 50 per cent. They could now reduce red tape by 50 per cent by taking red tape back to 1996 levels. It would actually be an easier promise for them to deliver on now than it was when they first made it, but a carve-out of small business is a completely reasonable call. I do not understand why the government are so obsessed with creating extra red tape or why in every idea they have they decide that they will not pay for the extra compliance burden, that it can land on the desk of small business. Just this once, let us give small business a break. Just this once, let us say: âEven if this government will never reduce red tape, letâs at least stop making it worse.â</para>

I thank the minister at the table, the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, for confirming for the chamber this morning that under his proposals a small business employer will be able to sack an employee unfairly without sanction but, if that same small business employer dares to give advice without pecuniary interest to a small business employee on super, he may go to jail.

<para>âAbout 40-odd times, I am reminded by the parliamentary secretary. They have rejected choice. With 29 days to go, they have not made a decision about the tax cuts to allow small businesses to get on and make those decisions. The Labor Party are no friend of small business. Most importantly, what they want to do here is in fact carve out 50 per cent of private sector employees from super choice. That means they cannot benefit from this legislation. This is about Australian employees being empowered by having the capacity to determine where their second largest investment goes. There is only one reason for Laborâs stymieing of these bills. Their intransient position is because they want to make sure that the union based funds continue to decide where peopleâs money goes, not the people who own it themselvesâthe Australian workers. The Liberal Party remain the best friend of small business and the best friend of Australian workers. We will deliver tax cuts, we will deliver super co-contributionâwhich the Labor Party have said no toâand we will deliver super choice.</para>

<para>âMr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. This is not anybodyâs fault. There was a hubbub in the chamber, to which you referred, and 20 or 30 members were milling in this area. I must admit I was finding it very difficult to hear what the Clerk said. I think the member for Adelaide laboured under the same difficulty and thought she had risen at the change of business.</para>

<para>âThe <inline ref="R2365">Asbestos-related Claims (Management of Commonwealth Liabilities) Bill 2005</inline> and the <inline ref="R2363">Asbestos-related Claims (Management of Commonwealth Liabilities) (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005</inline> deal with asbestos, which is a tragic and emotional subject. I start by indicating that Labor supports these measures with one very serious reservation, which I have raised directly with the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Mr Andrews. I will come to that in due course. I will start with a neutral explanation of the bills to the House and an examination of their content.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The purpose of these bills is to ensure a more efficient handling of asbestos related condition common law claims against the Commonwealth. These bills centralise the management of asbestos related condition common law claims against the Commonwealth within Comcare. To achieve this, the legislation would make Comcare rather than the Commonwealth, Commonwealth authorities or government business enterprises liable for all asbestos related condition common law claims, provide Comcare with the additional function of assuming and managing all Commonwealth asbestos related condition liabilities and provide financial arrangements for Comcare to meet all its assumed liabilities.</para>
<para>The Asbestos-related Claims (Management of Commonwealth Liabilities) Bill 2005 will allow Comcare to manage all asbestos related claims brought at common law against the Commonwealth. It will achieve this by transferring the liability for such claims from the Commonwealth and Commonwealth authorities to Comcare. This bill will give Comcare the legislative authority to manage common law claims against the Commonwealth. Comcare will also have the authority to manage claims from former waterside workers whose asbestos claims are currently managed by the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee, which is the subject of the serious issue raised by these pieces of legislation.</para>
<para>The majority of common law asbestos claims against the Commonwealth are currently managed by the particular agencies against which the claims are made. Inefficiencies and inconsistencies in case management across portfolios have arisen as a result. Comcareâs current legislative authority allows it to manage asbestos related disease claims only from current and former employees of the government and their dependants.</para>
<para>The Commonwealthâs asbestos liabilities over the next 50 years have been estimated to be nearly $1 billion, the majority of which will be common law claims and Comcare will be fully funded for the cost of managing these claims. The legislation is not expected to have any significant effect on the level of asbestos liabilities.</para>
<para>Integrating the management of asbestos claims against the Commonwealth will lead to more consistent decision making and more equitable and efficient outcomes. It will result in a standardised approach to management of asbestos claims. Transferring the liability for such claims from the Commonwealth and Commonwealth authorities to a single body, Comcare, will facilitate a better understanding of the nature of asbestos claims through improved knowledge and experience.</para>
<para>It should be noted, however, that the government has proposed that defence related common law asbestos claims continue to be managed by the Department of Defence as delegated to by Comcare. These arrangements will be reviewed by July 2006. It is this aspect which is of particular relevance to the issue I have raised with the minister and will raise with the House.</para>
<para>Statutory claims made under the Safety, Compensation and Rehabilitation Act 1988, the Veteransâ Entitlements Act 1986 and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 are not included in the application of these bills, and claims made under these acts will continue to be managed by Comcare and the Department of Veteransâ Affairs.</para>
<para>From that neutral analysis members of the House can see that, so far as claims are concerned, there are three specific or specialised areas which the Commonwealth and the parliament have previously drawn attention to. One is in respect of asbestos claims in the stevedoring industry, another is asbestos claims in respect of the defence department and the third is asbestos claims in respect of veterans. For good reasons in the past the Commonwealth has treated these areas as specialised and separate areas and it is proposed that two of them continue.</para>
<para>The bills were presented to the House a week ago todayâon 25 Mayâby the Minister for Workforce Participation, Mr Dutton, representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. As I indicated at the outset, the substance of these bills is positive and is welcomed by Labor. As I have indicated, I will raise a serious reservation concerning asbestos related claims in the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee.</para>
<para>The stated aim of the Asbestos-related Claims (Management of Commonwealth Liabilities) Bill 2005 is to:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... allow Comcare to manage all asbestos related claims brought at common law against the government. It will achieve this by transferring the liability for such claims from the Commonwealth and Commonwealth authorities to Comcare.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This is in effect a simple implementation of a recommendation made by the Asbestos Related Diseases Interdepartmental Committee that was established in 2002 to review the management of asbestos related compensation claims against the Commonwealth. The explanatory memorandum for the management of the Commonwealth liabilities bill says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Inter-Departmental Committee recommended the establishment of a central asbestos claims unit within Comcare to manage all ARC common law claims against the Australian Government. The IDC made this recommendation based on the view that the decentralised approach was resulting in some inefficiencies and inconsistencies in case management across portfolios, including inconsistent admissions of liability.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In principle then, there are obviously clear benefits in centralising common law asbestos related disease claims against the Commonwealth. Under the current system common law asbestos claims have been managed by each particular Commonwealth agency against which the claims have been made. As the explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech by the minister indicate, this has often led to extra administrative cost, but perhaps more importantly, has resulted in some inefficiencies and inconsistencies across the range of portfolios.</para>
<para>Centralising the Commonwealth liabilities under Comcare potentially offers an alternative, consistent, equitable and sensible approach to the management of these liabilities. That is the administrative or public policy upside, and there are safeguards against any downside risks for asbestos victims who make a claim in the future. This is why in the explanatory memorandum we see:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Bill would not alter the fundamental ARC liability of the Australian Government. The Bill should have no impact on the ability of a current or prospective claimant to recover damages for an ARC from the Australian Government.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">On my reading of the legislation, that is certainly its intention. I cannot see anything in the legislation which would have an adverse impact upon that fundamental position. So it is a change which allows greater consistency of settlements and does not alter the rights of asbestos related disease victims, current or future, to pursue their claims.</para>
<para>The area, as I have indicated, where I do have a serious reservation is the proposed repeal of three pieces of legislation which support the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee and the proposed abolition of the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee itself. Those three pieces of legislation are the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee Act 1977, the Stevedoring Industry Levy Act 1977 and the Stevedoring Industry Levy Collection Act 1977. The Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee currently resolves common law claims from waterside workers or their widows which arise from exposure to asbestos related cargoes. It is proposed under the legislation that these claims would become the responsibility of Comcare.</para>
<para>It is here that I think there is a serious issue for the parliament and the Commonwealth to consider. It is whether the stevedoring industry and the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee are dealing with claims of such a specialised nature that they should continue to be so conducted. As I have indicated, the legislation carves out an ongoing specialised attention for claims in the Department of Defence and an ongoing specialised role for claims in the veterans area. There is a serious issue as to whether good public policy grounds remain for continuing specialised attention in the stevedoring industry.</para>
<para>When one goes to some of the work that was done in the run-up to the preparation of these pieces of legislationâand I refer to the interdepartmental committeeâTrowbridge Deloittes prepared a report on Australian government asbestos liabilities for the Department of Finance and Administration which led to the establishment of the interdepartmental committee. That report made it clear that stevedoring related claims are a very specialised case of asbestos claim. That October 2003 report at page 55, attachment 1, states:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... the vast majority of the Australian Governmentâsâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">or the Commonwealthâsâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">claims costÂ  is managed in ... two places â the Defence Asbestos Litigation Cell (ALC) and the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee (SIFC).</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The government has obviously found good reasons to keep the Defence Asbestos Litigation Cell, or the defence area, compartmentalised and specialised. I am not sure that the Commonwealth government has put its mind carefully enough to whether that should also be the case for the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee. It is estimated in the Trowbridge Deloitte actuarial report that the ongoing potential liability to the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee is over $230 million. That is out of a total estimated cost of $900 million to $1 billionâeffectively a quarter of the Commonwealthâs liability. As I have indicated, this is an issue which I have raised with the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations for him to give some consideration to. I made the point that these bills were introduced a week ago, and I did so because what has come to attention in the last couple of days is that there has not really been adequate consultation with the stevedoring industry or with the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee on this point.</para>
<para>It is worth while paying some attention to the history of the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee to seize in the mind of the House some of the reasons why this may well be an area for ongoing specialised activity. The Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee was established as a statutory committee in 1977 under one of the bills I referred to earlier. That coincided with the winding-up of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, the ASIA. The Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee, under that transfer, also inherited obligations from the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority. Those obligations included obligations that had been vested in or imposed upon the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority by the High Court in the Crimmins case and by the courts of appeal in New South Wales and Victoria in the Gibson and Crimmins cases respectively. So this is a specialised area which has been the subject of High Court attention.</para>
<para>As a result of those cases, the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee inherited the liabilities of the former Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority. The High Court and those courts of appeal cases effectively determined that the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority had a liability and an obligation as a result of exposure to asbestos related disease by stevedores and former stevedores. The Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee is made up of an independent chairperson, representatives of both stevedoring employers and stevedoring employees, and a representative of the Department of Transport and Regional Services. So, essentially, it is what I would describe as a tripartite committeeâemployer, employee and government. The Department of Transport and Regional Services provides secretariat support on a cost recovery basis.</para>
<para>The predominant function of the committee is set out in sections 6 and 7 of the act, which provide that the committee is responsible for resolving common law claims from waterside workers or their widows on fair, just and responsible terms arising from exposure to asbestos related cargoes. In the course of its activities, the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee attempts to recover contributions from industry third parties or their insurance companies. The record of the committee is well regarded and it has established a well-earned reputation, amongst both employers and employees in the stevedoring industry, of resolving claims quickly and fairly. This is one of the great strengths of the specialised nature of activity in this area.</para>
<para>In our former lives, some of us in this House had experience with asbestos related diseases and take an ongoing interest in the legislation, public policy and common law which surrounds these issues. I was Principal Private Secretary to the Attorney-General of Western Australia when we had to grapple with the aftermath of the Wittenoom asbestos disaster. I was intricately involved in the drafting of legislation to remove the statute of limitations from asbestos related common law claims in that state. I make that point because one of the great tragedies and traumas of asbestos related diseases is that the incubation period is long but, once the adverse consequences of the disease come to light, it is a terribly debilitating disease and affliction. We have learnt over the years to, firstly, bring to those victims a degree of certainty, and, secondly, do our best to ensure that liability and damages are assessed by negotiation, by agreement or by settlement rather than by having ongoing adversarial claims. In the case of Western Australia and the Wittenoom disaster, it became pretty clear after one or two test cases that liability had been established. Very many of the casesâif not the vast majorityâfrom the Wittenoom disaster are now effectively settled by negotiation and settlement. Liability having been assumed long ago, the matter is simply one of calculation of damages.</para>
<para>The great strength of the activity of the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee is that it deals with these matters quickly, fairly, equitably and in a way which minimises the ongoing trauma for the victims of these terrible diseases. It has become clear in the last couple of days that, when the legislation was introduced a week ago, there had not been any appropriate consultation with the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee or its respective constituent bodies. I do not mention that to score any points. The minister, to his credit, when I approached him on this matter, quite happily agreed to put his mind to this issue and consider the fundamental and substantive question as to whether there remained good reasons in public policy and public policy administration why this area should be carved out for special treatment, as Defence is. Whilst I am sure the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee would want to be carved out ad infinitumâforeverâI am sure that if the government put the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee on the same basis as the defence department it would be regarded as sensible progress.</para>
<para>The minister and I discussed an approach he had received from the Maritime Union of Australia and which had been copied to me. I think it is worth while to read into the record the substance and the thrust of that approach. This is from a letter from the National Secretary of the Maritime Union of Australia to Kevin Andrews, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, dated yesterday:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Bills have only been brought to my attention quite recently and I have consequently held discussions with senior executives of the two major national stevedores who presently nominate an employer representative to the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee (SIFC) in conformity with the legislative requirements pertaining to that Statutory Authority.</para>
<para class="block">The stevedores advise me that they were totally unaware that the Commonwealth were proposing any alteration to SIFC and they are not aware of any discussion or correspondence with or from the Government proposing to repeal legislation (SIFC Act 1977) and abolish the Committee.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">â¦Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â¦Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â¦</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I am sure you are aware of the work the Committee undertakes in dealing with Asbestos Related Claims. SIFC provides Annual Reports and Audited Accounts to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The secretary then makes the point that the work of the committee constitutes a specialised forum:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... it is essential that the accumulated knowledge acquired over many years is retained to continue to assist claimants to achieve prompt, just and reasonable treatment in the processing of claims.</para>
<para class="block">You would appreciate the nature of the illnesses that sustain such claims and the importance of responding in a manner that treats these workers with care, dignity and respect.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">â¦Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â¦Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â¦</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">In the absence of prior consultation with the Stevedoring Industry Participants, we request that you take steps to withdraw the above named Bill currently before the House to enable tripartite consultation ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He calls on âa cooperative and bipartisan approachâ and makes the point that it is understood that âstevedoring employers endorse this approach and support consultation with all relevant stakeholdersâ.</para>
<para>I am sure that neither the minister nor the government would want to withdraw the bill, but I do think it is absolutely essential that the minister, in the cold light of day, puts his mind to that point. It is a serious public policy and there is no attempt here at political point scoring. It is a straightforward question as to whether, given the ongoing specialised nature of the stevedoring industry and the well-regarded success of the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee in dealing with these claims in a prompt, efficient and just manner, the same arguments for specialised treatment for Defence and veterans claims will apply to this industry. The lack of consultation, the oversight, makes it all the more important for this issue to be considered seriously. Having raised the matter with the minister, I am confident that he will do precisely that.</para>
<para>Given that very serious reservation, the central thrust of the legislation is supported by Labor. We support the central principle that asbestos related common law claims be consolidated, as far as the Commonwealth is concerned, into Comcare so that there is one entry point for those claims and one treatment of those claimsâall of which is expected to bring greater efficiencies and greater consistencies. But I do urge the government to respond to the representations it has received directly and the representations that I have made on behalf of the stevedoring industry. Just as it has carved out Defence, even if only for a subsequent review in 2006, it should do this for the stevedoring industry. I commend the bills to the House.</para>

He highlighted the fact, not putting it in strong terms, that there may have been a discourtesy arising from the ministerâs office not consulting the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee. But the reality is that the Minister for Workforce Participation made it clear in the second reading speech:</para>

<para class="block">the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committeeâ</para>

</quote>
<para class="block">which are also being dealt with under this legislationâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">have been redundant for several years.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In other words, there seems to be a very good reason to repeal this legislation and dispose of a committee which possibly has costs to the stevedoring industry or the taxpayer that will perform no functions. What is more, the funding processes under the levy acts have not been applicable for years. I note they have $24 million in the bank, which will be recovered to consolidated revenue. That also seems to be a practical and sensible solution.</para>
<para>While I express sorrow that there was not some appropriate consultation as a matter of courtesy, I would not suggest that there needs to be any opposition to repealing the two acts that become redundant simply because of the governmentâs decision, under the principal act, to transfer common law liability to Comcare. If I were somebody who might be making a claim some time in the future, I would like to have the comfort that Comcare, with its virtually bottomless pockets backed by the taxpayer, was an appropriate place to go. The explanatory memorandumâand this is the matter that I really came to this House to raiseâindicates that the taxpayer funded operation, which is quite necessary for workers compensation, anticipates claims in the order of nearly $1 billion over the next 50 years. So it is a very significant cost and it is a very significant issue.</para>
<para>I have spoken in this House before on asbestos and have attracted some criticism as to my views on it. Asbestos remains in my mind as a wonderful product which served the community well but which was eventually proven to be unsafe to people who might be in contact with it in various ways. I am interested to know, as compensation under common law progresses, at what stage the Commonwealth might be held responsible for the regulations it requires on brake parts on imported vehicles, which until quite recently had brake linings containing asbestos. They are wearing parts and quite clearly asbestos fibres must have been found in any busy intersection where vehicles stop for red lights. So one can only worry. But this bill deals typically with workers compensation, although I am not sure that is entirely so. If I remember correctly, there is a list in the explanatory memorandum which is more extensive than just covering the role of a worker. It covers properly spouses and others. I think it also talks of secondary causes that might arise.</para>
<para>I chose to come here to speak briefly on this issue because I think it is a classic example of government accepting responsibility and creating an opportunity for compensation to be paid. I sincerely hope that will be compensation for appropriate losses, although it seems that some of the common law claims will not be for clear lossesâthe loss of a breadwinner and people of that nature, which is frequently not the occurrence with asbestos related diseases. They typically occur in later life at a time when, for instance, oneâs dependants have gone their separate ways. It is one of those things that can be judged on that basis. It is clear from looking at the people on the list that there can be claims other than in relation to employees. The explanatory memorandum for the prime bill, the <inline ref="R2365">Asbestos-related Claims (Management of Commonwealth Liabilities) Bill 2005</inline>, says:</para>

</quote>
<para class="block">I think my example of brake linings is quite significant when one reads that list. It is a hysterical approach to occupational health and safety when state governments, egged on by unions, talk about putting directors in jail. Given the role of this parliament and state parliaments in imposing the regulatory requirementsâfor instance, brake liningsâwould there be a case, if that were taken to the nth degree, for members of this House, as the directors of âAustralia Inc.â, to be called upon to show cause why they should not go to jail because of their negligence? It is a form of negligence that is totally beyond the capacity of the people and/or company directors to know or to understand. Asbestos is a classic example. The debate about James Hardie probably focuses on that intervening period after it became apparent that their product could deliver these outcomes. However, for many years asbestos was considered to be not only benign but very valuable. Even in this town of Canberra, which was technically a remote area, I would imagine that thousands of houses were built out of asbestos and weatherboard.</para>
<para>I think we have allowed this issue to go a little too far. I have said publicly many times that, if somebody with young children loses a supporting spouse as a result of an asbestos related disease, clearly there is a role for compensation. I am not sure that I agree with compensation being awarded after a person is deceased which then passes to quite healthy relatives. That is my criticism.</para>
<para>In closing, the Commonwealth has admitted that it has a liability under various acts associated with its employmentâfor example, the construction of buildings and the operation of ports. It is expected to cost nearly $1 billion, which the taxpayer must provide. The legislation quite sensibly transfers future liabilities for common law claims to Comcare. It makes separate arrangements for Defence, which is quite a significant area. In the Navy, huge amounts of asbestos were used so as to avoid other injuries, such as very severe burnsâalbeit unwisely, as we now know. This is an excellent piece of legislation in that regard. However, when we had an understanding of a productâs safety and we did not believe it presented a risk to others, I think it would be very unwise to revisit the issue and suggest negligence was involved. I make that point because of the occupational health and safety penalties that are constantly proposed by state governments. There are some very large businesses, and to talk about the role of directors or senior management in a workplace that could be quite remote from their point of operations is silly and unfair. If that is going to be concluded then this is a classic example of how everybody in this House would be liable in that regard, and I do not think any of us would think that is a good idea. I support this legislation. The repeal of the other legislation is sensible, particularly when one considers that the only function that councillors have had for some years was dealing with a matter they will no longer have to deal withâin fact, the levy support they had for other purposes has been redundant for several years.</para>

<para>âI rise this afternoon to speak on the <inline ref="R2363">Asbestos-related Claims (Management of Commonwealth Liabilities) (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005</inline> because of the importance that we as a community must place on ensuring that the victims of asbestos have access to fair compensation. With respect to the member for OâConnor, I wish he would stay in the House for a minute. He raised the issue of directors, but perhaps he should acquaint himself with the James Hardie agreement in New South Wales which is supported by the New South Wales government, asbestos victims, community groups and the trade union movement. That agreement is now being criticised by some business groups, by ASIC and by the federal Treasurer. Unlike what the member for OâConnor suggested to the House, it is on the basis that indemnities were included in this agreement that people such as the Treasurer are seeking to open the door with respect to civil penalties against directors and executives that, potentially, had been closed. It is not on the heads of the New South Wales or any state government to pursue directors. That initiative is being pursued by the Treasurer, the member for Higgins. Maybe the member for OâConnor should acquaint himself with the full details of the New South Wales agreement.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The government suggests that the bills before the parliament today will streamline the handling of common law asbestos-related claims against the Commonwealth by centralising these claims with Comcare. Under the new arrangements it is expected that Comcare would manage claims by former and current employees as well as those from former waterside workers, contractors and subcontractors. It would also correctly cover tenants of Australian government owned or constructed premisesâfor example, there is a major question mark about a former Australian government building in Melbourne. It would also cover family members of employees who were exposed through contaminated clothing et cetera, visitors, bystanders and dependants of persons in any of these categories.</para>
<para>Under existing arrangements non-employee claims are managed by portfolios requiring a case management capability in each portfolio. Claims by former waterside workers are managed by the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee, details of which were touched on by the member for Perth, Mr Smith. This decentralised approach is thought to lead to inefficiencies and inconsistencies in case management between agencies including inconsistent admissions of liability. The bills before the parliament today will mean that Comcare will also have the authority to manage claims from former waterside workers whose asbestos claims are currently managed by the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee, which will be abolished.</para>
<para>The legislation does not propose changed arrangements for defence related common law asbestos claims, which will continue to be managed by the Department of Defence at the delegation of Comcare, subject to a review of these arrangements to be completed by July 2006. Importantly, the bill also has no effect on statutory claims made under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, the Veteransâ EntitlementS Act 1986, and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004. Claims made under these acts will continue to be managed by Comcare and the Department of Veteransâ Affairs.</para>
<para>In addressing the bill the government suggests that integrating the management of asbestos claims against the Commonwealth will lead to more consistent decision making and more equitable and efficient outcomes, resulting in a standardised approach to the management of asbestos claims. The government also claims that the new arrangements will facilitate a better understanding of the nature of asbestos claims, and improved knowledge and experience.</para>
<para>In the background material provided for these bills the government claims that its asbestos liabilities over the next 50 years are in the order of $900 million, the majority of which will be common law claims. This is something I want to touch on and I am seeking further clarification from the government as a result of this debate. Under this legislation Comcare would be fully funded for the cost of managing claims, and rightly so. While the governmentâs 2005-06 budget proposals provided $86 million to the Employment and Workplace Relations portfolio over a five-year period for the cost of asbestos claims, this bill is not expected to have a significant effect on the level of asbestos liabilities.</para>
<para>As we all appreciate, asbestos claims are a serious matter in this country and cannot be taken lightly. Last year the Commonwealth was forced to bring in legislation to protect James Hardie victims. That legislation was about ensuring that mechanisms are in place to force corporate Australia to take responsibility for its actionsâin essence, to ensure that everyday Australians are protected from the damage done by large faceless organisations. The community is now well aware of the actions of James Hardie. It has been an issue out there in the public arena and very much at the front of debate concerning James Hardie, especially over the last 12 months. The problem was that, in an attempt to absolve itself from financial responsibility for the pain and suffering that would result from its products, James Hardie engaged in a complex corporate restructure. That restructure was clearly about separating subsidiary companies with liabilities and transferring assets offshore to a Dutch registered legal entity. At the same time, as history will show, James Hardie established and underfunded a medical research foundation. This foundation was ostensibly established to deal with the claims by innocent victims of the asbestos related diseases against the various companies that made up the James Hardie operation.</para>
<para>It is now clear as a result of the debate in the Australian community and the discussions occurred between the parties that this foundation was unfortunately underfunded to the tune of $1.5 billion. That is a significant amount that James Hardie was basically seeking to walk away from with respect to its responsibilities to asbestos victims and their families. It was a shame in terms of what was once a proud companyâs corporate standing in the Australian community. I am aware of that proud history because I actually dealt with the company as a trade union official over many years. Rather than facing up to its corporate responsibilities, James Hardie moved offshore, leaving only $293 million to fund estimated compensation costs of some $2.3 billion. I raise these issues because such an abrogation of corporate responsibility is clearly unacceptable.</para>
<para>The James Hardie company, as the record will show, was regarded as producing good products. History shows that those products damaged Australian workersâ health and also had a major impact on standard of living and lifestyle over many years. Putting that aside, history also shows that the James Hardie company made good profits in this country for over 80 years. It might have produced and sold potentially deadly products but it made good profits. These products, as we now know, produced an insidious form of cancer, mesothelioma, which has no cure and kills its victims within 12 months of diagnosis. To date, mesothelioma has killed almost 7,500 Australians since 1945. This number is unfortunately expected to rise to some 18,000 by 2020. More than 500 Australians contract this disease every year and the peak of its incidence is not expected to hit until around 2010. In addition, the incidents of other asbestos related cancers are estimated to be around 30,000 to 40,000 by the same time.</para>
<para>The member for OâConnor is right about the use of asbestos in Australia. Australia had the highest use of asbestos in the world from the 1950s until the 1970s on a per capita basis. It was regarded at the time as a safe product and used in a range of activities, not just in the building industry but also, as the member for OâConnor referred to, in brake linings. I can personally remember, when I was thinking about doing an apprenticeship, willy-nilly drilling off brake linings that contained asbestos because we were not instructed in any other way.</para>
<para>It is estimated that, prior to 1982, approximately one-third of domestic buildings in Australia contained asbestos. It is not surprising therefore to hear that Australia has the highest per capita incidence of mesothelioma in the world. However, it is the perseverance and determination of the union movementâsomething that, unfortunately, the current government is not prepared to give credit toâthat actually brought the Australian government to the fore in facing up to its responsibilities to act to bring James Hardie to account. The union movement through the ACTU and the leadership of its secretary, Greg Combet, was successful in negotiating an agreement with James Hardie management to ensure that the company accepts its responsibilities. I simply say that the House should be commending the ACTUâas is the view of the Australian communityâfor its leadership and good work on the asbestos fight in bringing James Hardie to heel.</para>
<para>The union movement correctly was committed to the fight to ensure that justice is done. I think that is important. The union movement is not an organisation with two heads and neither does it have its head in the sand. It is an organisation which is about getting justice for the community. It is about guaranteeing that proper compensation was made available by the company that is in essenceâ</para>

<para>âIn coming to that issue, we should note that the Australian government is now involved in legal action with James Hardie with respect to seeking to reclaim some of the compensation that it has been forced to pay as a result of the actions of James Hardie. I intend to deal with these issues so, with respect to the honourable memberâs intervention, patience will bear fruit.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>As I was saying, it is about proper compensation being made available by the company that was responsible for the pain and suffering of many innocent Australians. The record shows that the federal government was prepared to sit on its hands and let thousands of innocent people suffer, while the company was let off its obligation to offer compensation for their injuries. Following its own commission of inquiry into the James Hardie affair, the New South Wales government announced legislation aimed at allowing asbestos victims to take legal action against related corporations, including the Dutch registered entity. This goes to the potential reclaim of revenue paid by the Commonwealth with respect to these bills and their operation.</para>
<para>In light of the importance of asbestos claims in this country and the need to ensure that we as a society protect the innocent victims of asbestos, I have a number of questions that I would like the minister to answer in his response to this debate. I call on the government to address these concerns, lest it disadvantage a group of Australians who are in no position to protect themselves. As those who have participated in the debate have indicated, the intent of the bills appears to be straightforward. The legislation is simply about centralising the defence of all asbestos claims within one government agency, Comcare.</para>
<para>At the very least, this is likely to have defence cost implications. The Commonwealth has already spent a considerable sum on legal costs, preparing third-party claims against a range of parties in an effort to limit the total payout of the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee to waterside workers and their families. Will the passage of this bill today result in additional legal costs being incurred by Comcare to rerun this exercise? I am looking for a response from the government on that issue.</para>
<para>I am also concerned about the actuarial assumptions used to underwrite the governmentâs reforms. I understand that there is concern within the industry that these assumptions have been overstated. The predicted future cost of asbestos claims for the Commonwealth has a net present value of some $850 million, based on a Commonwealth Auditor-Generalâs report which in turn was based on a report done by actuaries. Those same actuaries, Trowbridge Deloitte, were discredited by the Jackson inquiry set up by the New South Wales government to look into the liabilities of James Hardieâa rather pertinent point. What is of major concern to me and many in the community is that, at the time of the Commonwealth Auditor-Generalâs report, those actuaries were also part of James Hardieâs lobbying team seeking to convince state and federal governments that the rights of victims should be sacrificed.</para>
<para>The basis of the Hardie strategy was to claim, based on the actuarial forecasts, that the combined liability of those state and federal governments was so large that it exceeded that of Hardieâs, meaning that therefore it would be uneconomical to sustain payouts of all claims. At the same time as the assessments were made, a large number of waterside workersâ claims were being settledâmany of which had been in the system for some 20 years. This settlement of a bulk number of claims had come about as a result of the Crimmins High Court decision and the subsequent change to the statute of limitations.</para>
<para>Clearing of these cases eliminated a significant defence cost against the Commonwealth. It can now be reasonably expected that there will be a relatively small number of mesothelioma cases emerging from the wharves and, further, that the number is likely to decline over the next 15 years, given the containerisation of the wharves that took place in 1969-70, thereby reducing dramatically the asbestos risk. It is also likely that, given the profile of waterside claims and claimantsâthat is, their ageâthe net present value for these claims is in the vicinity of some $103 million, assuming five per cent interest. In addition to the claims related to the waterfront, the remaining claims against the Commonwealth ought to have a similar age and claim profile to the waterside workers.</para>
<para>In contrast, James Hardieâs claims continue to grow. James Hardie continued to manufacture products containing asbestos until 1987, many of which were for domestic and commercial applications. These products remain in place in many Australian homes and workplaces, and unsuspecting tradespeople and renovators remain at risk. Despite this, the most recent estimate of liability against James Hardie is $1.685 billion. Can the minister therefore explain how the Commonwealth would have a liability that equals some 60 per cent of the projected Hardie claims, despite their significantly different profile?</para>
<para>In closing, I would like to again touch on the historic agreement struck by the ACTU which brings the Hardie corporation to account and, importantly, ensures that victims receive the compensation that is due to them. This agreement was, I noted in the media, recently criticised by business groups, ASIC and the federal Treasurer on the basis that indemnities were included in the agreement. Those indemnities effectively exempt the directors and executives from civil liabilities. These groups have also seen fit to criticise the unions and the New South Wales government for their role in the agreement. In responding to these criticisms, I would simply like to quote the vice-president of the Asbestos Diseases Foundation of Australia, a man suffering from asbestosis. That man, Mr Bernie Banton, with whom I agree wholeheartedly, recently stated: âAs much as I would like to see all the Hardie people crucified, the payment to the victims is of the utmost importance.â</para>
<para>I am sure many of the listeners would agree with Bernie Banton with respect to his objective of looking after the victims who have suffered the end result of asbestos production in Australia. Sadly, whether we like it or not, the only way to look after those victims and the only way to get an agreement from James Hardie so that it would voluntarily meet its obligations was to put the victimsâ interests first. I commend all those involved in the negotiation of that agreement because, without it, many Australians would have been worse off over time. I commend the bill to the House but also seek a response from the government with respect to the issues I have raised during this debate.</para>

<para>âIn supporting the <inline ref="R2365">Asbestos-related Claims (Management of Commonwealth Liabilities) Bill 2005</inline>, I firstly want to draw an analogy between asbestos and a topic that we have already discussed this weekâand that is, HIV. It is probably not well understood that the number of people affected are fairly comparable. I am glad that the member for Batman provided some of those epidemiological figures, because the number of people affected by asbestos is in fact very close to the figure we see quoted for HIV in Australia. The number of deaths is fairly similar, as is the number of new cases. With cases in the hundreds every year, it is interesting that asbestos often does not receive the attention that it deserves, and particularly so because so many people affected were from the construction and other industries from the 1950s onwardsâas late as the 1970s and, in some cases, through to the 1980s. That was a time when, in many cases, there were no protective avoidance or occupational health and safety policies in place for those who were ultimately affected.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This bill today goes a long way to doing what those people affected could only ask from the Commonwealthâand that is, to take a very streamlined and efficient approach to the processing of claims that are currently under their control. Those who have been affected by the bill are waterside workers, contractors and tenants of government owned buildings and their dependants, but it even extends to those in clothing manufacturing, those who visited or even those who were bystanders. In simple terms, three things are being done with this bill: there will be a more streamlined approach, more consistency with the handling of claims and a more equitable and efficient approach.</para>
<para>I want to very briefly compare this approach with what we are seeing at the moment with the clearance of asbestos from Queensland schools. It is quite the opposite. We are seeing a protracted and delayed time line, which I raised earlier this week, in a plan to remove asbestos from Queensland schools over 10 years. I do not regard that as a streamlined approach. Nor is it consistent, in that I have 26 schools in my electorate and only one of them will be cleared of asbestos in the next 12 months. I regard that not only as inequitable and inefficient but as taking way too long to get us to the point where we can say there is no asbestos in Queensland schools.</para>
<para>To get back to the bill before us today, what we hope to have with the establishment of a central management unit is, firstly, a single point of contact for families that are currently having their cases considered. Secondly, there should be better management of those cases because of the increased level of experience that will be found in the unit. Thirdly, we can hope for prompter settlement because of the dedicated work of this unit. There will be a better understanding of the nature of claims because this group will be working full-time in that area, and that also means more transparency around the cost of asbestos claims and better understanding for those who are having their claims processed.</para>
<para>I note that there were some comments made in the media by the Greens and I was concerned that they really had a limited understandingâor perhaps they made a mistakeâof how the bill functions. I have the press release here. There appears to be a misunderstanding by the Greens regarding the interaction between the provisions of the bill we are debating today and the operation of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation ActâI will refer to it as the SRC Act. For Commonwealth employees and their dependants, should they choose to sue at common law and the date of injury is prior to 1988, as it almost always will be, there is no cap except for any particular cap that may exist under state law. For non-Commonwealth employeesâand former waterside workers are an exampleâthe cap in the SRC Act does not apply.</para>
<para>If a dependant does in fact make a claim under the SRC Act it should be noted that they can expect to receive in the order of $320,000. That is divided up into a permanent impairment payment, a death benefit and, in addition, there are funeral and health benefits as well. That figure compares very favourably with what would be received through common law. I wanted to make the point that the cap is not necessarily relevant to claims made by dependants, and obviously a dependant can choose to sue at common law and they will not be limited to that $110,000 cap for non-economic loss under the SRC Act. My final point is that the cap will only apply if the estate chooses to sue for non-economic loss in lieu of accepting statutory benefits for permanent impairment. That is probably a fairly unlikely scenario, given that the current statutory benefits are quite generous.</para>
<para>There are very good reasons for this bill. We have already pointed out how important it is to have a centralised process for all of these claims. Obviously, the Department of Defence will be running their own cell for handling these claims. Australia Post and Telstra will not be included under the bill. It is my hope that, with the creation of a centralised claims management unit, we can do everything we can in the processing of claims to make them efficient, equitable, streamlined and consistent. Comcare will be managing asbestos related common law claims from non-employees. At present, Comcare can only manage those from current and former government employees and their dependants. The problem with that has been that managing these claims has been spread right across a range of Commonwealth portfolios and authorities. It is my hope that this legislation will be passed with the strong support of all speakers.</para>

<para>âin replyâI thank those members who have made a contribution to this very important debate, and I particularly thank the member for Bowman for his considered words. The <inline ref="R2365">Asbestos-related Claims (Management of Commonwealth Liabilities) Bill 2005</inline> will enable Comcare to manage the governmentâs asbestos liabilities, which is an essential component of the governmentâs decision to centralise management of its common law asbestos claims. Comcare already has responsibility for managing statutory asbestos claims from current and former government employees under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. Under this bill, Comcare will also manage common law claims from former waterside workers, contractors, subcontractors, tenants, visitors and bystanders in relation to government premises.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Centralised management will lead to more consistent decision making and more equitable and efficient outcomes for both the government and claimants. There will also be benefits for the claimants. They will no longer have to identify which government agency is currently responsible for their asbestos exposure, which in some cases may have occurred 40 years ago. Centralised management will bring about efficiencies which will result in quicker processes and prompt settlement. That is important for those claimants who, sadly, are close to death.</para>
<para>The <inline ref="R2363">Asbestos-related Claims (Management of Commonwealth Liabilities) (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2005</inline> provides for the repeal of the stevedoring legislation, as it will become redundant with the transfer of asbestos liabilities to Comcare. Amendments to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act will take account of Comcareâs new function.</para>
<para>In conclusion, I note the several points made by the member for Batman and others in relation to this matter and, in particular, to the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee. There are coherent reasons for the repeal of the stevedoring legislation. With the transfer of SIFCâs asbestos liability to Comcare, SIFC itself will become redundant. At present, its only remaining function is to manage asbestos claims from former waterside workers.</para>
<para>Integration of management of the SIFC claims with management of other asbestos claims will be an essential component of achieving the goals of centralisation. It will of course mean less duplication of effort and more consistent outcomes for the government and the claimants. The SIFC board comprises a chair and one representative each from the Department of Transport and Regional Services, stevedoring employers and the Maritime Union of Australia. SIFC provides policy advice for the management of claims. That role is not compatible with the establishment of the new policy unit within DEWR. Whilst it was appropriate for SIFC to manage claims when its liabilities were funded by industry levies, SIFCâs liabilities are now funded directly by the government. Therefore, it is appropriate for the government to be fully accountable for expending its own funds as a matter of good governance.</para>
<para>DEWR already has a statutory tripartite consultative bodyâthe National Workplace Relations Consultative Councilâshould there be a need to seek industry advice. SIFC currently utilises a settlement protocol, which has contributed to the efficiency of its management of asbestos claims. This protocol has similar principles to the Commonwealthâs model litigant guidelines. I am advised that Comcare and my department will be developing an asbestos litigation policy statement which will also have similar principles to those of the model litigant guidelines.</para>
<para>In response to honourable members who have raised concerns in relation to previous matters concerning asbestos claims in this country, the Australian Government Actuary has looked at the Trowbridge assumptions and has deemed that those assumptions are appropriate and provide for an adequate assessment of the liability of the Commonwealth. On that basis I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para>âAs we understand the position, the regime to be implemented by the <inline ref="R2357">Import Processing Charges Amendment Bill 2005</inline> and the <inline ref="R2348">Customs Legislation Amendment (Import Processing Charges) Bill 2005</inline> must be up and running by 20 July this year, which means that there is some urgency in the passage of the legislation through the parliament. Labor will certainly do everything in our power to pass the legislation, subject to some points of clarification that I understand we are obtaining from the ministerâs office. We understand that the reason for the deadline is the cut-over date for the start of the integrated cargo system for imports. The integrated cargo system is an electronic portal through which importers and exporters can make their declarations and generally conduct business with Customs.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The integrated cargo system is a product of the cargo management re-engineering project, which has been the subject of some controversy, though it must be said that as a system it is to be welcomed. Obviously, it is in the interests of all participants to avoid excessive paperwork. Indeed, we understand that there was also a rationale of trying to cut costs for industry participants and public servants engaged in the work on behalf of the deputy of Customs. But it is hard to see how these cost savings could eventuate. The reason is simple: the cost has increased tenfold from an original guesstimate of about $20 million to somewhere in the order of $200 million. It appears that the increases keep coming. Not only is this project over budget but also the news of the consequences for industry is late.</para>
<para>Industry have been wringing their hands for about three years now, waiting to test the final product so they can integrate their own information technology systems and train staff. To those importers who went out and invested in the new IT hardware in anticipation of this system being available sooner, I hope that they will be able to compensate by the depreciation that they have already been able to claim. But, despite three years of depreciation when the system should have been up and running earlier, obviously we would have liked to have seen things happen in a timelier manner.</para>
<para>The Minister for Justice and Customs has tried to portray what can only be described as quite a disastrous administration as the fault of the service. We now have a tenfold budget blow-out and the system is three years late, and the minister is yet to acknowledge responsibility. Regarding the latest delay, the system is supposed to be up and running by 1 July with a transition or cut-over period until 20 July. However, it now looks as though the Australian Customs Service may be unable to meet even this date, and who does the minister blame? Not himself, of course, but industry. The minister says industry has clamoured for an increase in the length of the transition period, and perhaps he is right. What he has not told the Australian public is why there is this call for an increased cut-over period. The reason is that the minister did not have a finished product for industry to test.</para>
<para>To reiterate, the product will not be ready for industry testing until it is too late. The minister has got the timing completely wrong. It now looks as though special legislation may be required to allow an extended cut-over period, and, of course, the final date for crossing to the new system is up in the air to a considerable extent. When can industry be confident the final cut-off date will beâSeptember, October, November? They cannot be sure but they have to run at these potential deadlines as hard and as furiously as they can, with all the required overtime and stress that is involved. We do not know precisely and the minister cannot give us answers. It is an issue of tremendous concern, as I have indicated, to the industry.</para>
<para>I would like to move to the technical matters contained in the bills. The bills deal with legislative change and appropriation to bring about the revenue measure outlined in the 2005-06 federal budget. In the coming financial year, it is estimated that approximately 222,000 importers will generate 3.6 million customer declarations, 99 per cent of which will be electronically lodged. Each of these declarations will attract a processing charge, as they currently do. These bills provide the legislative authority for the structure of the import declaration and the warehouse declaration processing charges contained in the Import Processing Charges Act 2001. Under the existing legislation, these charges are calculated with reference to the value of the goods. Currently, imports valued at less than $250 are self-assessed by the importer. The bills will amend the Import Processing Charges Act so that the charges will be assessed by mode of importationâair, sea or postâwithout reference to the value of the goods. Further, the bills modify the Customs Act 1901 and the Import Processing Charges Act to remove references to the old system of self-assessed clearance declarations and charges. Considered together, the bills remove the self-assessed clearance declaration charge from lower-value imports of below $250 in value. Instead the revenue will be collected through increases in the processing charges.</para>
<para>As I understand it, industry has been consulted quite extensively on this matter and generally supports the move as a way of freeing itself from unnecessary red tape. Labor will therefore support passage of the bills in the House, but not before saying that we have some further queries concerning the amount of revenue that will be collected from industry. As I have indicated, we understand that the bills will be the subject of a further briefing from the minister tomorrow and, while we will be assisting in the expeditious passage of the bills, we will reserve the right to perhaps move amendments to the bills in the Senate, subsequent to the briefing that we receive from the minister.</para>

<para>âIn recent times the importation of goods into Australia has become an increasingly sensitive issue for this country. In the government publication <inline font-style="italic">Trade 2005</inline> it was revealed that imports continue to grow. In fact, last year, 2004, total imports into Australia were valued at $178,000 millionâa rise of eight per cent over the previous year.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The need for effective inspection of goods and quarantine safety measures has been, and always will be, a vital aspect of importation, to ensure that our laws are adhered to and that dangerous and unwanted items are kept out of our country. After all, importation that potentially has a negative impact on our way of life will also have a greater cost for this country in the long run.</para>
<para>The <inline ref="R2357">Import Processing Charges Amendment Bill 2005</inline> has a simple aimâthat is, to further streamline the cost recovery measures related to those government services devoted to imports. It will also have a somewhat positive spin-off in relation to the paperwork associated with importing. The bill is designed to repeal two customs charges. The first is the self-assessed clearance declaration charge. This is an amount of $3.60 that relates to an importerâs function whereby he or she is responsible for assessing their compliance to import regulations and requirements. The self-assessment is essentially based on an honour system: the importer is given that responsibility by the Australian government. The government monitors the reliability and accuracy of those self-assessments.</para>
<para>The second charge is a fee of $67.50 relating to screening of imports. The screening charge is made up of various costs involved with import processing, inspections and quarantines. Both of these charges apply mainly to low-value consignments into Australia. The majority of these low-value consignments come into the country by air. While the bill facilitates the removal of both these charges, the costs incurred by the government in the provision of its various services will still be recovered. They will instead be collected through the restructuring of charges imposed on processing electronic import declarations and charges for warehouse declarations.</para>
<para>It is appropriate to note that upwards of 98 per cent of import declarations are now carried out electronically. Under the Import Processing Charges Act 2001, the customs fees required from importers are based on the value of the imported goods rather than the method used to get them into the country. It is clear that logistics and the costs involved with physically importing goods in a container by sea will be much greater than those involved in importing an item by air. The value of the actual items becomes somewhat irrelevant. It follows that customs and quarantine inspections for a container load of imports brought in by ship will, on the whole, be more time consuming and costly than for those brought in by air or through the mail.</para>
<para>It is important to have effective customs and quarantine barriers. The quarantine barriers prevent the spread of disease and also aid in the protection of Australian native animals and plants. We have seen, from mistakes in the past which have resulted in the proliferation of the myna bird and other imported species, that we have to be extremely wary of exactly what is allowed into our country. In that context I also mention the problem we have particularly in Queensland, but increasingly also in other parts of the country, with the presence of the cane toad.</para>
<para>The bill will see anomalies rectified. The cost recovery method will be returned to that of the Import Processing Charges Act 1997, whereby charges for government services are based on the mode of importâwhether it be sea, air or through the postage system. The changes reflect the logistical and administrative differences in the various import methods. A streamlined charging system will bring some welcome relief to importers, as the changes will bring with them a reduced administrative burden.</para>
<para>The government consults widely in the community and has kept in touch with the import sector, and it is important to note that the suggested changes to the import processing charges cost recovery regime are supported by the import industry. The <inline ref="R2348">Customs Legislation Amendment (Import Processing Charges) Bill 2005</inline> and the <inline ref="R2348">Customs Legislation Amendment (Import Processing Charges) Bill 2005</inline> are non-controversial legislation. I am pleased that we have the support of the opposition. I commend the bills to the House.</para>

<para>âIn rising to speak in the second reading debate on the <inline ref="R2357">Import Processing Charges Amendment Bill 2005</inline> and the <inline ref="R2348">Customs Legislation Amendment (Import Processing Charges) Bill 2005</inline> I note that the member for Fisher has been an excellent minister in all respects and some of the problems that are occurring in his old portfolios demonstrate how enormously and awesomely capable he was. As I understand, these bills abolish small item charges. It is difficult to oppose bills that take away small and petty charges which are costing more money to raise than the money we receive from the charges. By itself, that sounds like a very good argument and one we should supportâand I suppose I do support it.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Having said that, there is a philosophy here that seems to say we should make it easier for goods coming into the country. I remember asking why we were building the railway line from Adelaide to Darwin. At the time I was at a table with members of parliament who were also members of the government. They told me that it would cut dramatically the amount of the demurrage time at southern ports after taking goods off at Darwin. I said that there are no export industries in Adelaide or anywhere along that route. They said: âNo, itâs for imports. You understand it dramatically reduces the cost of imports.â I represent an exporting electorate and I know the business of the Europeans is to dramatically increase the cost of imports. Time after time, and in case after case, the Europeans, the Americans and the Chinese do everything humanly possible to put hurdles up in front of you if you try to get imports into their countries.</para>
<para>I cannot help but go sideways for one moment and bring to the attention of the House one of those cases, which occurred in my hometown area of Mount Isa-Cloncurry. A man called Russell Peters, by the strength of his own hand and his own intellect, put together a game meat processing plant that concentrated on pigs. Wild pigs are a terrible pestilence throughout western Queensland, and a very dangerous pestilence too; they are very destructive animals in respect of flora and fauna, and to the landscape itself. It was a very worthwhile project from every point of view and it created 20 to 30 much-needed jobs in Mount Isa at the time. After years of activity in putting this $2 million or $3 million plant together, he sent two containers over and they were rejected because the wash down watersâwhich do not touch the carcasses of these animalsâhad a high pathogen level. I emphasise my point that while we are reducing the difficulties of getting items into this country, other countries are in the business of increasing the difficulties of getting items into their countries.</para>
<para>Returning to the story, the containers were rejected because the wash down water had too high a pathogen level. I said to Mr Peters, âBut itâs town water, isnât it?â He said, âYes.â So I said: âThe town water that we drink in Mount Isa doesnât meet their requirements for wash down water? This is ridiculous.â He said, âWe know it is.â I said, âBut thereâs a second point here: the wash down water is not allowed to touch the carcass.â He said, âAbsolutely.â I tell this story to indicate to the House the enormous difficulties created for a great Australian, Russell Peters. But that is not the importance of the story. The importance of the story is to illustrate the lengths to which other countries go to keep product out.</para>
<para>I do not wish to denigrate the minister in any way, nor what he is doing in this bill, but I use the bill to highlight and illustrate a most serious problem that we have in Australia: we have a culture of making it easy for people; we are the great advocates of free trade. Free trade means that everyone can bring everything into the country, but when we try and get anything out then people like AQIS and Customs drive us crazy. For example, there is the ridiculous case of flowers. Those flowers coming into the country were not inspectedâthis is AQIS; the quarantine is supposed to be protecting usâbut those flowers going out of the country were inspected. There are thousands of cases like that. If you put a charge on things coming into the country then why not charge primage? The great Billy Wentworth, one of the finest people who ever went through this parliamentâand Billy came back and had another shot after he had left parliament; I think he was in his 80s at the timeâput forward the idea of primage. He wanted charges on everything coming into the country. I ask the minister to consider this, because it was not put up by an intellectual lightweight; it was put up by an intellectual heavyweight, and a great Australian to go with it. Billy used the word primage, but that is simply an across-the-board charge on everything coming into the country of, say, 10 per cent.</para>
<para>If we have a coastline larger than any other country on earthâI think that is correct; most certainly it would go close if it was notâthen we have got to look after that coastline. The cost of protecting our Customs duty and our quarantine services and protecting that entire coastline is ginormous. Australia is not spending even four or five per cent of what it should be spending if it were serious about protecting that coastline. When we talk about Customs, we are really talking about defending our country. That is what Customs are about. Customs say: âThis cannot come into this country unless you pay this amount of money upon it.â But the greatest protection for a country is to occupy the country. I represent many hundreds of kilometres of the coastline of Australiaâmaybe 1,000 kilometres or moreâand the part of it in the Gulf of Carpentaria is almost completely unoccupied and totally undeveloped, except for a few heroes at Karumba and Normanton and a few little towns. Really there is no population there at all. It is a huge landmass with 1,000 kilometres of black soil plains stretching back from itâit should be the farm bowl of the worldâand massive river systems.</para>
<para>In this country we keep trying to do all of our farming in the Murray Darling, where 50 per cent of our farming takes place with only a tiny little bit of Australiaâs water, and yet we leave the Gulf Country, with all of Australiaâs water and all of Australiaâs arable land, alone. At the moment the government of Queensland, in a massive piece of disastrous decision making, has declared that wild rivers will always stay wild. The only wild thing here is the wild fantasies of the Queensland government, and this comes back to our Customs issue of protecting Australia and Australians. If you think that you can sit upon resources that can feed, quite literally, 100 million peopleâI am not plucking that figure out of the air, but I have not got time today to go into the detail of why that figure is correctâand you are determined to do nothing with it or, if you are the government of Queensland, you are passing laws saying that no-one will ever be allowed to do anything with itâ</para>

<para>âIf ever there were a truism in history, it is the one used by the opposition spokesman: âUse it or lose it.â Not so very long ago, in our last international stoush of significance, we decided in our wisdom that there would a golden boomerang, and only Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Adelaide were to be protected. All the rest of Australia was to be given over to the enemy. After all, if nobody is living there and you are not using it, why the hell would you ask your kids to fight for it? It was fairly logical. Also, strategically, there was so little infrastructure there that it would have been very difficult to defend it anyway.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Nothing much has changed. In fact, the population of 90 per cent of the surface area of Australia is much the same as it was when Captain Cook arrived in 1770 or whenever it was. There were about 300,000 or 400,000 Australians here thenâmaybe fewerâand we have about 500,000 people living in that area now, so we are not in any way in occupation of this continent. I ask the ministerâand he has been a very fine one; one of the most excellent ministers I have seen in this House while I have been hereâto consider Billy Wentworthâs proposition seriously. I think he knew Billy Wentworth, but it was not only Billy Wentworth who put this forward; I have heard the proposition put forward many times.</para>
<para>A 10 per cent charge on everything coming into this country would enable us to provide 100 patrol boats with guided missile capacity and interception capacity, and helicopters with radar that can see a great distance. That would protect us from people-smuggling and from smuggling of any type, including smuggling of arms. It would protect us from people who are violating Australian fishing laws, wrecking our Great Barrier Reef and bringing disease in by landing on Australian shores without authority. All of those things could be overcome by an adequate system of protection.</para>
<para>The Americans call theirs the Coast Guard. They have no necessity for it really, because all of their coastal areas are protectedâbut ours are not. But where will we get the money to do this? I venture to submit that a 10 per cent charge would also greatly assist Australian industry by providing some protection. I think everyone in this House is beginning to realise that tariffs are about picking winners. A base charge on everything is not about picking winners. That is about your balance of payments, and I think there are very few people in this place now who are not conscious of that.</para>
<para>That money could be used for patrol boats which are small enough for it to be economically viable for them to go out and intercept people smugglers and people violating our reefs and fishing waters. There are a thousand other reasons why we need people to police these areas, and there are national parks people and fisheries inspectors out there. But these jobs are being done by small and inadequate boats, entirely unacceptable for the purposes. In a lot of cases, people are simply dodging customs and tariffs charges. While some of these people are involved in drug running, a lot of these people who are coming in by boat are simply bringing in materials and dodging customs charges. So there is great logic in looking at a proposal for an across-the-board charge on everything that comes into this country. Yet, while I understand and probably back the proposal being put here, it is in sharp contrast to other countries that are lying awake at night trying to figure out ways of keeping Australian products from coming into their countries.</para>
<para>We also have the potential to do a really marvellous job of protecting Australia from disease through our customs and quarantine inspections. Australia is unlike any other country on earth. In 1788 we had no agriculture in this country. The nearest thing we had to it was farming with fire to get wild animals to come in. You picked up the wild animals when they came in with the fire. But there were no domesticated agricultural products. We were not growing wheat or maize or anything like that, and Australians also had no domesticated animals that they ate. They had dogs, but they did not eat the dogs. So we did not have that and consequently we did not have any of those pathogens, bacteria and diseases that exist in other countries. To our north, there is spiralling white fly, foot-and-mouth disease, bird fluâthere is everything known to man in South-East Asia, and we really have to be very proactive.</para>

<para>âWell, I have. You must not be as important as I am, because I get them coming to me. They come and ask for this, and I feel very embarrassed. One of them, a very clever fellow, spread out a map of Australia and said: âWhat part of this coastline of Northern Australia are you not using that maybe we could use? What part of it are you not using?â If you draw a line from Cairns around the Australian coastline all the way to Broome, there is nothing there. Yes, there is Darwin and Weipa and maybe 100 kilometres showing some signs of civilisation, but for thousands of kilometres there is nothing there at all. And our nearest neighbour has 100 million people going to bed hungry of a night, and let me tell you that they are not particularly well disposed towards us, for a number of reasons that do not need to be put on the public record here.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>If you came from one of the countries in South-East Asia and you looked down here and saw the resources of the Gulf Country that could feed 100 million peopleâ126 million megalitres of water, when we are trying to do all of Australiaâs farming on 20 million megalitres of water in the Murray-Darlingâthen you would say: âWhat are these people? Are they dogs in the manger?â I do not wish to be moralistic, but the good Lord did talk about talents. He talked about the bloke who went out and used his talents and made a lot more and he talked about the bloke who hid them under a rock because he might lose them. That is what the Queensland government are doing. They are saying, âWe do not want to use these rivers because we might damage them, so weâd better hide them under a rock called the wild rivers protection legislation.â</para>
<para>If you were an Indonesian, you would find it very hard to live on your $800 annual income. It used to be an annual income of $2,000 until the intervention by the American banks, which we participated in. None other than Rupert Murdoch himself took a page in his own newspaper to castigate the Australian government for backing the intervention by the international banking fraternity under a number of guises into the Indonesian economy. These poor people saw their own incomes cut clean in half. Understandably, they are not friendly or disposed to people that participated in the destruction of their economy to this extent and they would not be happy that the resources of the Gulf Country could feed 100 million people. It is a giant black soil plain stretching all the way down to Blackall with 126 million megalitres of water, versus 20 million in the Murray Darling, where half of Australiaâs agricultural production comes from now.</para>
<para>You have to ask how you overcome these problems. Funnily enough, the Customs charge is a way of looking at those problems. I tell many great and wonderful stories about Billy Wentworth. That great and wonderful man used to passionately commit himself to try and convince the Australian people of the necessity for an across-the-board charge on everything that was coming into the country. Not only would this be a tax that would help our government revenues, but it would also be a disincentive for people to import and an incentive for them to produce those same commodities here in Australia. More importantly, and relevant to this debate, it would enable us to have a fund of money from our Customs charges for the protection of our country, to properly protect the people of Australia.</para>
<para>The current minister, wearing another hat, would be well aware of the enormous difficulties in trying to keep out of this country people who have no right to come into this country. The way to do that is by a policy that I cannot remember the technical name for, but it is a policy with respect to pigs and cattle. If we put pigs and cattle in the Torres Strait and Cape York Peninsula then there will be no necessity for pigs and cattle to come down from New Guineaâcattle do not, but pigs do. That is a strategy that was put forward. It was not a strategy that I agreed with but, all the same, one can see the logic in saying that if you occupy an area and you have people living there then you have a right to own that territory. If you do not have people living there and it is a big empty wilderness and people are going hungry then they most certainly have some moral justification in looking with hungry eyes over the backyard fence. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âin replyâI thank the members for Barton, Fisher and Kennedy for their comments during this debate on the <inline ref="R2357">Import Processing Charges Amendment Bill 2005</inline> and the <inline ref="R2348">Customs Legislation Amendment (Import Processing Charges) Bill 2005</inline>. In thanking the member for Kennedy for his contribution, I recognise his very polite references to me. I thank him for that. I also recognise that he spoke of the late William Charles Wentworth in very favourable terms. I knew the late Bill Wentworth very well. He was a very close and dear friend. I took a great deal of notice of much of what he had to say, particularly in relation to the need for a standard gauge rail in Australia. He was a person for his time in relation to mineral developments and the use of nuclear power. He was a man of great foresight.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As I have often said in commending other individuals and organisations, they can be very estimable in their qualities and their contributions but they do not always get it right. I am not sure that imposing upon the Australian community as a whole a very substantial increase in the overall cost of living is something that I would be keen to advance. In this legislation we are dealing with something that is much more narrowly based than the member for Kennedyâs comments might have suggested. It is a package of legislation which restructures the cost recovery regime for import related services that will operate once new management and processing of inward cargo by Customs are in place.</para>
<para>The Import Processing Charges Amendment Bill 2005 provides the legislative authority to restructure the import declaration and the warehouse declaration processing charges contained in the Import Processing Charges Act 2001. The second bill in this package will repeal two cargo reporting charges relating to low-value consignments which will be incorporated into the restructured import declaration and warehouse declaration processing charges. Industry representatives support the requirement to restructure the charges as proposed and strongly support the amalgamation of charges for low-value consignments into the import declaration and warehouse declaration processing charges. The bills ensure that import processing charges are equitable in their application to users of import processing services.</para>
<para>The honourable member for Barton raised some other issues in relation to both the cargo management re-engineering program and the integrated cargo system, particularly in relation to costs and implementation. I will outline some of that for the sake of completeness. The cargo management re-engineering program is a major re-engineering project that has spanned several years. It involves the modernisation of Customs legislation, business processes and cargo-related IT systems. It incorporates not only an integrated cargo system to replace the range of legacy systems but also a new and sophisticated electronic corporate gateway, known as the Customs connect facility, and a range of internal IT modules supporting Customs business processes. The technical development of these separate components in parallel and their subsequent integration and testing is one of the largest IT undertakings of its type in the country at the moment. It was first announced in 1996 and it was seen as a means of streamlining importing and exporting.</para>
<para>In December 1997 outsourcing was approved and Customs entered into a contract with the firm EDS. Significantly, Customs believed the project was modest enough not to require budget appropriationâthat it could absorb the expense involved. In March 1999 mention was made of $30 million for a cargo computer application and hardware and the development of migration costs. In 2000 legislation was passed allowing the new cargo management re-engineering scheme to be implemented. By March 2001 the estimate had risen to $55 million, reflecting the realisation that this was an extraordinarily ambitious and complex project. This cost estimate did not include other non-system development costs associated with organisational re-engineering, communications with industry and development of the trade modernisation legislation. In February 2002 a further contract of $29.7 million was signed with Computer Associates for the ICS component of the project. In February 2003 there was a contract variation of $15.4 million in relation to that componentâagain, a reflection of the immense complexity of the project. Neither Customs nor the consortium could have foreseen at the time of tender the complexity which resulted in a doubling of the expected size of the application.</para>
<para>The cost of the cargo management re-engineering project in June 2004 was $149 million, and next financial year will see further development and transition activity. The total development and implementation costs to the point of the import cut-over will be close to $188 million. This represents about $133 million for the ICS development, including contract payments, staff costs, industry training, publications and infrastructure support, and $55 million in CCF infrastructure development and contract costs over the six-year life of the project. To gauge the complexity of such re-engineering projects one can look at the United States, where a similar re-engineering project is being undertaken. The project will cost no less than $1.7 billion and will have taken seven years to develop and implement.</para>
<para>The government has decided not to change the commencement date for the international trade modernisation legislation. It will remain 19 July. The exports part of the legislation and the exports module of the integrated cargo system were successfully implemented in October 2004. Industry and its software developers have now asked for a longer transition time for reporting in the current Customs legacy systems, until it needs to report in the imports part of the ICS. This is because the majority of the industry software developers will now be delivering their systems in July 2005. Industry has asked for three months to fully test that software, to train staff and to adjust the business processes. All sectors of industry have agreed that the existing implementation dates threaten to compromise the quality of the final product.</para>
<para>At a roundtable meeting the Minister for Justice and Customs told those present that he wanted to keep the pressure on finalising the systems in preparation for the legislated transition period. From the limited testing done so far, industry is unsure if they and Customs will be ready for the cut-over to the new system at the planned time of 28 August. They have therefore asked for an extension. There is a need to strike a balance between producing a world-class, well-tested, user-friendly cargo-reporting system and ensuring that the system is delivered in a timely fashion. At the recent roundtable, the minister advised industry that the government would take into account their concerns and would respond formally to their request. We have considered that request and the minister has issued a press release stating that the government has announced that it will provide an extension of the transition phase for the integrated cargo system in response to industry concerns that insufficient time was available for its introduction.</para>
<para>The imports component will be available for use by 19 July 2005 under existing legislation, but industry will not be required to report in the ICS until just before the cut-over time. However, if, in further industry consultation in June, Customs and industry believe that more time is needed, legislation will be introduced during the spring sittings to extend that transition period. The minister will be convening another meeting with industry in June to check readiness. If the government then decides that a longer period is critical for all parts of industry to achieve compliance and a stable business setting, the government will introduce an amending bill, as I mentioned earlier. I commend the bill to the House and thank the opposition for the support that has been offered.</para>

</talker>
<para>âI rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2359">Crimes Amendment Bill 2005</inline>. My comments will be brief. The bill is straightforward but nonetheless very important. It seeks to amend part 1AC of the Crimes Act 1914 that deals with assumed identities. Assumed identities are vital for police and law enforcement work in controlled and undercover operations. The reality is that while those who are engaged in crime can, through the very fact of engaging in that activity, represent to some extent how naive they are, they are not entirely naive in wanting verification of the identity of those who may impact on their operations. In that context, fake identification is occasionally necessary to substantiate before those criminals that an undercover officer is the person that they are purporting to be.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This is not something that is used lightly, and there is a reporting mechanism in place and criminal punishments for the misuse and abuse of the system of assumed identities. For the financial year 2003-04, for example, only 71 authorisations were issued. Perhaps in the coming year we may see a more widespread use of these identities as security issues come to light. In particular, the controversy that was before the parliament and the media yesterday concerning controlled operations at our airports is perhaps a continuing trend and a situation where we will see these assumed identities being necessary to assist those officers who are operating under cover. However, that is obviously going to be an operational matter for the Australian Federal Police to determine.</para>
<para>The measures relating to assumed identities were passed, with Labor support, under the Measures to Combat Serious and Organised Crime Act 2001. This bill does not seek to modify either the existing requirements for authorisation or the offences, reporting or accountability measures of that regime. There are already provisions in the act that criminalise the misuse of assumed identities under section 15XR of that act. We believe the provisions introduced in this bill will strengthen the regime that is already in place.</para>
<para>Previously, requests by the Commonwealth for false identification for the purpose of assumed identity were handled in an informal manner. However, the states are now formalising this process through their own legislation. Accordingly, the Commonwealth must now clarify its legislation to recognise the new state regimes and to ensure, for instance, that there is not a situation where an officer operating under an assumed identity is, as a result of oversight, subject to some liability under the new state regimes. Therefore, the bill introduces definitions of âstate agencyâ and âterritory agencyâ and a new section 15XMA to ensure that any request for this type of false-identification assistance from a state or territory issuing agency must be complied with at the request of the Commonwealth to the extent that the laws of the state or territory require that to occur.</para>
<para>Importantly, these arrangements are reciprocal. The states and territories police authorities can also gain access to federal documentation for the purpose of undercover law enforcement work. That is something that I think all Australians will recognise as cooperation that is certainly highly desirable. In summary, this bill is relatively straightforward. While it is straightforward, it is nonetheless important and Labor is pleased to be able to assist the government in securing its passage through the houses.</para>

<para>âI too will speak briefly on the <inline ref="R2359">Crimes Amendment Bill 2005</inline>. This is, in some respects, a tidying-up exercise. Part IAC of the federal Crimes Act deals with assumed identities and permits officers of a number of Commonwealth agenciesâthe Australian Federal Police, the Australian Customs Service, ASIO, ASIS, the Australian Taxation Office and any other agency specified in the regulationsâto obtain documents establishing an assumed identity from Commonwealth agencies. These assumed identities are designed to facilitate intelligence and undercover operations and are a vital part of our continuing battle against crimeâin relation in particular to organised crime and more recently the battle against terrorism. They are a vital part of the law enforcement exercise and a vital part of the governmentâs commitment to defending the security of all Australians. On that note, I welcome the member for Bartonâs remarks and the oppositionâs support for the bill.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>However, the most common form of identification document, the sort of document that people typically produce to prove their identity or, in this case, to establish an assumed identity, is of course a drivers licence. They are issued by state governments for the most part, and the current legislation does not provide a legislative framework for those to be obtained by Commonwealth officers. They have been obtained with a degree of informality in the past, as the Attorney-General said, in the absence of a legislative framework. That obviously is no longer feasible, as each state is now passing and debating in its respective parliamentâin great detail in some casesâthe regulation of the provision of assumed identities.</para>
<para>This bill will enable duly authorised Commonwealth officers to obtain documents establishing assumed identities from the states. The legislation already enables state participating agencies to obtain such identity documents from the Commonwealth. This bill will provide the link that completes the chain and will ensure that those officers who are undertaking undercover workâand, in doing so, need to have evidence of their assumed identityâwill be covered by legislation both on the Commonwealth side and on the state side. Those officers will be duly indemnified and protected from any suggestion that they may be incurring any liability or committing any offence simply because of their use of an assumed identity. This is an important bill. It is an important part of our continuing battle against crime and terrorism and our continuing defence of the security of Australia and its people. I commend it to the House.</para>

<para>âI rise to support the <inline ref="R2359">Crimes Amendment Bill 2005</inline>, a bill to amend the Crimes Act 1914. I support the bill because it formalises arrangements and long-established operating protocols with respect to state, territory and Commonwealth law enforcement agencies. The provisions of the bill will act to strengthen the regime that governs the assumption of an identity. As the Attorney-General noted in his second reading speech:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para>Assumed identities are false identities adopted to facilitate intelligence and investigative functions, or the infiltration of a criminal, hostile or insecure environment with a view to collecting information and investigating offences.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The ability to assume a false identity is a necessary condition for police to conduct their daily investigations, particularly targeted operations, required to combat crime and improve community safety.</para>
<para>As I noted earlier, this bill formalises arrangements between the states, territories and Commonwealth agencies. The bill contains amendments necessary due to the introduction of state based regimes for assuming identities. State governments throughout the country have been going through the process of formalising and codifying their practices through legislation and, as a result, consequential amendments are being proposed in this place.</para>
<para>The bill introduces definitions for âstate agencyâ and âterritory agencyâ. It also includes a requirement that any request for false-identification assistance from a state or territory issuing agency must be complied with at the request of the Commonwealth to the extent that the laws of the relevant state or territory require the agency to do so.</para>
<para>The bill does not alter existing provisions that control the use of false identities. Authorisation requirements, offences, reporting and existing accountability requirements remain the same. This is an important aspect of the bill. All other provisions surrounding the acquisition and use of false identities remain the same, and this merely formalises a longstanding but informal arrangement between law enforcement agencies at different levels of government.</para>
<para>It is important because often people suspect that, hidden in the detail of minor or technical amendments, there is some more malicious agenda. Given the circumstances we face in a modern society, people suspect that hidden in the amendments, particularly in national security and policing bills, is an attempt to extend police powers or to erode civil liberties. That is not the case with this bill.</para>
<para>This bill is about equipping police with the necessary tools of their trade. It is about formalising arrangements at a Commonwealth level so that the actions of state and territory governments in formalising their processes through legislation do not impinge on the ability of law enforcement officers to go about their business. These are consequential but nevertheless necessary amendments.</para>
<para>As members would be aware, I have some background in working with the various police agencies throughout Australia. As I outlined to the House in my first speech, I have worked as an adviser to the Police Federation of Australia, representing both the industrial and professional interests of police. It gives me great pleasure to rise here today to support the professional interests of our police once more.</para>
<para>Police need the assistance of tools to do their jobs, just like any other tradesmen or members of a profession. While many would have in their minds that the main tools for police are handcuffs, firearms and possibly a paddy wagon, there is much more to policing than that. The certainty that police can obtain assumed identitiesâwhen justified and when requiredâis just as important a part of policing as ballistic vests or purpose equipped vehicles.</para>
<para>When Mark Burgess, the Chief Executive Officer of the Police Federation of Australia, heard that the amendments to the Crimes Act 1914 were being introduced into the House, he contacted me. He hoped that I would be rising in support of this bill and in support of making sure that his members would be able to go about their business with certainty and with greater legal clarity.</para>
<para>I pointed out in my first speech in this place that crime knows no boundaries, whether they be physical or technological. Crime is a serious issue for our society and a concern for all our constituents. I know that certainly crime is a concern to my constituents in Werriwa, as I have commented on in the past. My constituents want the police to have all the necessary tools to combat local crime. They want to be certain in the knowledge that the law-makers are allowing police to keep up with criminals.</para>
<para>As many members would be aware, one of the fastest growing areas in criminal activity is identity theft. In an electronic age where personal information is traded over the netâwhether it be as the result of purchases on eBay or through international credit card scamsâthe protection of identities is becoming more and more important. As the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration heard in 2002 when attempting to quantify the extent of identity theft, the use of electronic commerce increased the level of identity fraud and increased the difficulty in identifying and apprehending culprits. In evidence to that committee, the Australian Federal Police reported that, at that time, 25 per cent of frauds reported involved the assumption of a false identity. I do not bring these matters to the attention of the House to scare the public, nor am I suggesting that Australian police officers will commit identity fraud by assuming false identities. I am making the point that, as criminal activity becomes more sophisticated, police operational procedures need to keep pace.</para>
<para>Australian policing agencies are involved in a vast number of different areas of law enforcement including local crime, fraud, the domestic and international trade in drugs and national security. They also play a part in preventing international organised crime in association with the police agencies of other countries. As you would expect, they do not necessarily mix with the best in society. As a result, their lives are often put in danger when they are on duty. Accordingly, this bill is as much about equipping police as it is about protecting police. It will not protect police officers who are injured trying to settle a domestic dispute, it will not protect police officers who are injured in a car chase and it will not protect police officers who are the victims of random acts of violence. However, it will protect police officers who live and mix intimately with alleged criminals while accumulating sufficient evidence for charges to be laid. Police need any additional protection that we can afford them in such circumstances. Assumed identities are required by law enforcement agencies for the purposes of conducting targeted undercover crime operations. I believe that this bill provides all the necessary requirements to protect the officers conducting such sensitive operations. Without reservation, I support the bill.</para>

<para>âin replyâI thank the members for Barton, Wentworth and Werriwa for their support for the <inline ref="R2359">Crimes Amendment Bill 2005</inline>. The support has been fulsome. That is something that I appreciate; it is not always the case, obviously. In this matter state and territory governments are seeking complementary legislation at a national level to support the measures that they have in place to enable the investigation of very serious criminal offences. I think it is incumbent upon us to do our part to ensure that the legislation that will support those efforts is put in place quickly.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This bill has been developed with state and territory officials to meet their needs, as outlined during the course of the debate and in my second reading speech, and it is important that the bill is able to be implemented before 30 June. We would like to see the bill secured not only in this place but also in the Senate. I hope that those who have spoken so fulsomely in the passage of this legislation will ensure that their colleagues in another place give the same support to this measure.</para>
<para>As I have said, the bill aims to enhance the ability of our law enforcement and national security agencies to combat serious and organised crime. It will amend the Crimes Act 1914 to enable Commonwealth agencies to request evidence of identity from state and territory governments in accordance with legislation in force in those jurisdictions. This means that law enforcement and national security agencies will be able to obtain state based evidence such as birth certificates and drivers licences in order to support their undercover operations. Previously, there was no need to have a legislative framework to address the issue because of the absence of state and territory legislation, except in New South Wales. Now that the states and territories are in the process of implementing assumed identity legislation, the proposed amendments make necessary consequential changes to the Crimes Act so that the Commonwealth agencies can take full advantage of those schemes as well. I commend the bill to the House and wish it a speedy passage in another place.</para>

<para>âI rise to state the position of the opposition on the <inline ref="R2352">Aged Care Amendment (Extra Service) Bill 2005</inline>. This bill removes the requirement for aged care providers to reapply for each extra service place they have every five years. This will decrease red tape for aged care providers and increase their ability to obtain capital for building and refurbishment. It also gives people going into aged care facilities more choice about the type of service they wish to receive, although obviously there is a question of payment and what people can afford.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This legislation should not affect disadvantaged older Australians, because the current maximum of 15 per cent of extra service places in each state and territory will remain. The extra service status allows aged care consumers in residential aged care facilities increased choice. Consumers can pay for hotel type services such as enhanced accommodation and a greater range and quality of food, as well as the provision of non-care services, including recreational and personal interest activities. An example of that may be the daily provision of newspapers so that people can follow current affairs.</para>
<para>The government and the aged care sector claim that the regulation of the extra services program has constricted the expansion of services and that by removing the need to reapply every five years providers will be saved excessive and expensive paperwork. Additionally, aged care providers say that the expansion of extra services will enhance longer term planning and capital-raising capabilities. I think it follows from what I have said that this bill is viewed as noncontroversial from the point of view of the opposition. This bill is directly within the purview of my colleague Senator Jan McLucas, the shadow minister for ageing, disabilities and carers. It is the intention of the opposition for Senator McLucas, when this matter comes before the Senate, to make a substantive contribution in the debate. It is not the intention of the opposition to in any way delay passage of this matter before the House today. On that basis, that concludes the oppositionâs remarks in relation to this second reading debate.</para>

</talker>
<para>âI too support the <inline ref="R2352">Aged Care Amendment (Extra Service) Bill 2005</inline>. I have had a number of calls from my electorate about the importance of what this bill will deliverâthat is, an improvement in the range and quality of services that can be purchased individually by those who are living in aged care. I think the bill demonstrates once again without doubt the governmentâs strong commitment to ensuring a truly robust and viable aged care system. I recently opened the Netherlands Retirement Village extensions and a major component of that opening was extra services. There was a great deal of excitement at that opening about the provision of those services, and this bill goes towards ensuring that these things are possible. Expansion of that service will also allow the sector to respond to rising community and consumer expectations.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This bill provides extra choice around hotel servicesâthe range of food and other accommodation services that are available. It includes recreational and personal interest activities as well. That delivers for residents extra certainty. It allows them to know that, in their own places of residence, the same levels of recreational serviceâfood and other servicesâthat they expect will be continued. So there will be no change in that respect. Importantly, as far as red tape goes, this legislation removes the requirement that every five years providers be able to access capital for rebuilding and refurbishing. That renewal requirement existed up until the introduction of this bill. At the same time, the expansion of extra service programs will allow the sector itself to deliver increased choices around hotel type care. The removal of that renewal requirement occurs on 1 July 2005.</para>
<para>The extra expansion of services does not make it any more difficult for pensioners or anyone else who cannot afford those extra services. In fact we had a situation where additional places were provided in one of the aged care facilities in my electorate. There was a concern that they were filled by those who were not necessarily paying for extra services and that it was possible in these situations when new extra service positions became available that people taking up those positions could slowly fill those beds as that became possible. So it is important that we state here today that those who cannot afford the additional cost of service will continue to receive access to quality aged care. That really has been a change that we have witnessed between today and prior to the term of this governmentâthe consistent high quality of aged care through an absolute focus on quality assurance and accreditation.</para>
<para>A maximum of 15 per cent of all aged care places in each state and territory can be used to provide extra services. Socioeconomic profiles of each region are taken into account by the groups that make those determinations. That really means that for those who live in areas where access to aged care by the less affluent is required that will not be impeded by this bill. Obviously there are opportunities for those who are interested in extra services to learn more directly through the departmentâs web site. Prospective residents and their families should be encouraged to go and learn more about those extra services. This bill can have a significant impact upon the services that are available to those who choose those places. All residential aged care services that are granted extra service and have extra service status in operation will be listed on the web site so consumers can find that information directly.</para>
<para>In the three minutes that I have left I want to emphasise how extra services fit into a greater package of aged service delivery. As I said before, we are seeing rising consumer expectations for the provision of services for aged care residents and, in Bowman in particular, for a greater range of hotel type services. This comes at a time when many facilities are having to renew their extra service status after five years. The removal of that red tape was warmly welcomed in Bowman. The individual needs of older Australians are this governmentâs priority and that is why this bill has been put forward to further broaden their opportunities. Those extra status positions allow residents to pay for, if they choose, a higher than average level of hotel type services. There are restrictions around how that is done. These units have to be self-contained parts of larger aged care facilities. I know that that is not proving any difficulty for those in my electorate who are choosing to access those positions. Aged care providers have long felt that the level of regulation was high. I think this removal of red tape demonstrates the governmentâs commitment to lessening the burden on aged care providers. In particular, the reapplication for extra services on a regular basisâeven though it was only every five yearsâwas causing an additional burden.</para>
<para>Considerable investment in infrastructure is obvious. In Bowman, doing the basic calculations for the number of aged care placesâeven though calculations for aged care facilities are done over a broader south Brisbane areaâreveals that the number of aged care places is very close to the federal governmentâs objective of 1.08 aged care positions per 1,000 people over the age of 70. I congratulate both the Department of Health and Ageing and the minister for achieving those objectives for my seat and the region of south Queensland. That region is probably the fastest-growing area of Queensland. For that reason it is one of the hardest areas in which to ensure that those ratios are achieved. That does not mean that we are not going to need substantial extra investment in infrastructure over the coming decade. I join with the federal member for Bonner, Ross Vasta, in pushing hard for those additional services so that we keep up with the rapidly growing population. I remind members that the bayside suburbs of Queensland have the highest intra-state migration within Queensland. That means there are a large number of people looking for aged care places, and that really does stress some of the local ratios. I congratulate aged care providers in my seat for meeting those ratios and bringing those beds forward so that they are available for the aged and their families seeking those positions. I support this bill.</para>

<para>âMy question is to the Prime Minister and relates to the Treasurerâs claim yesterday that our record foreign debt poses no threat to interest rates. Is the Prime Minister aware of reports today that Australiaâs snowballing foreign debt could pose a threat to the governmentâs credit rating? Credit rating agency Standard and Poorâs says Australiaâs foreign debt is âpretty high for a AAA-rated countryâ and our foreign debt is â50 to 60 per cent more than any other country with a AAA ratingâ. In the light of these warnings, how much longer will the Prime Minister allow Australia to sink into unsustainable debt?</para>

<para>âI thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question and point out that, as a proportion of the economy, foreign debt actually fell yesterday, which means the premise of his question is completely wrong. The Leader of the Opposition is running off a story in todayâs <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> with credit rating agency Standard and Poorâs. If he had read the full report he would know that the spokesman from Standard and Poorâs said that, with the strength of its government finances and with nearly all its foreign debt held by the private sector, Australia gives reassurance to international lenders and its government has the capacity to support the private sector if there are any problems. That says precisely what I said yesterdayâthis government, almost alone amongst the economies of the developed world, has a budget surplus.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In his sotto voce interjections the Leader of the Opposition says this is complacent. No, it is not complacent to run a budget surplus. Let me tell you what is complacent. It is complacent to have a finance minister who has a deficit of $10 billion, or nearly three per cent. That is what complacent is. I remind the Leader of the Opposition of his own record when he was finance minister. Almost alone amongst the developed economies of the world, the Australian government runs a budget surplus. On projections in the budget, it will have net debt to 0.7 per cent of GDP by the end of the next financial year. That means that the Commonwealth government will be carrying nearly no debt. The OECD average is around 40 to 50 per cent, putting Australia in a very strong positionâa point that was noted by Standard and Poorâs.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Bowman for his question, and I can tell him that the national accounts released today for the March quarter show that the economy rebounded in the March quarter, growing at 0.7 per cent. That comes off a lower than expected growth rate, which was revised up to 0.3 per cent for the December quarter, and means that, through the year, the Australian economy has grown at 1.9 per cent.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Although consumption remains solid at 3.4 per cent, it is in fact lower than it was last year, which shows a moderation in consumption. The dwelling sector continues to experience a mild downturn, with dwelling investment falling 3.8 per cent through the year. This is not unwelcome. I have said on a number of occasions that the kinds of price rises we were seeing in 2001, 2002 and 2003 were unsustainable and that the government would welcome a moderation in the housing sector. We see clear evidence that this is now occurring. Business investment continues to be supported by strong profit growth. The profit share of the economy is at nearly an all-time recordâI think it is within 0.1 per cent of the all-time record.</para>
<para>The worrying part of the national accounts is the rural sector. It is clear that farm incomes have not returned to where they were before the 2002-03 drought. We had the fourth quarter of downturn, and agricultural production is 16.1 per cent lower through the year. I am sure that those in rural Australia know the heartbreak that is occurring at the moment, particularly on the east coast. We are now seeing that in agricultural production feeding through to the national accounts. But, overall, we have a rebounding economy with low inflation, good business investment, unemployment at 30-year lows, interest rate lows, a budget in surplus and the prospect of the Commonwealth freeing itself from net debt in 2005-06. We should not be complacent about this. We need to continue economic reform in this country. As I have said on a number of occasions, no economic reform is more important to Australia than labour market reform. This parliament has the opportunity to accomplish it, and we should accomplish it.</para>

<para>âMy question is to the Treasurer. Does the Treasurer recall his comments in this House yesterday to the effect that Australia, now AAA-rated for foreign currency bonds, no longer pays any premium in relation to interest rates? Does the Treasurer still stand by that statement? Can the Treasurer explain why Australians are paying some of the highest interest rates in the worldâhigher than the US, the EU, Japan, Canada and Britain? Is it a fact that Australian homebuyers are paying higher interest rates than other countries because we have consistently high current account deficits and foreign debt?</para>

<para>âLet me make this point: there is one clear difference between now and 1996. It is this: in 1996 the budget was in deficit nearly three per cent of GDP and today it is in surplus. In 1996 Australia owed $96 billion and by 2005-06 we could have that as low as $6 billion. This is the government that took $96 billion of Labor Party debt and will retire $90 million of itâ</para>

<para>âforever taking that load off future Australians. Let me make this final point: all other things being equal, if a government is borrowing, it is driving up interest rates; if a government is saving, it is driving down interest rates. When Labor was in office Labor was borrowing and driving up interest rates. Interest rates peaked at 17 per cent and in 1996 they were 10.5 per cent. This government has not borrowed a dollar in net terms since 1996 and by paying off $90 billion of Labor Party debt this government has put downward pressure on interest rates, which are now at 7.3 per cent, a level which was unheard of under the Australian Labor Party.</para>

<para>âI thank the honourable member for Hasluck for his question. As a recently elected member he, along with the other members on this side of the House, is supporting a tax cut for every Australian on 1 July, and that is a month away. There is no reason why within a month every Australian cannot have an income tax cutâexcept for one person. One person stands between now and every Australianâs income tax cut on 1 July, and it is the member for Brand, the Leader of the Opposition, I regret to inform the House.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The schedules which deliver these income tax cuts were tabled in this House last Thursday. Thursday has passed, Monday has passed, Tuesday has passed and Wednesday has passed and the Labor Party is yet to announce whether it will be moving disallowance. They will be tabled as soon as the Senate sits on 14 June. If the Labor Party does not disallow then every Australian will have their tax cut. But the Australian Labor Party, I regret to inform the House, still refuses to disclose to Australian business whether it intends to proceed with its sabotage attempt on these tax cuts.</para>
<para>I have come into possession of a letter from MYOB to the member for Lilley dated 31 May 2005. MYOB is a provider of software that is used by a very large proportion of Australian small businesses to do their payrolls. This letter reads as follows:</para>
<quote>
<para>As you know, the ATO recently responded to a looming crisis for small business by gaining approval for the release of two tax tables. The fact remains that releasing two schedules to the business community is far from ideal. Businesses who insert the MYOB payroll upgrade will automatically install the tax tables approved from the 2004 budget. They will then need to manually override this automatic process and insert the password to access the 2005 tables should they be approved.</para>
<para>I must emphasise this is a solution of last resort for our customers. In our experience accurate payment of employees is a role business owners take seriously. It is highly sensitive. Mass frustration will be felt not only by business but by their 1.5 million employees if this cannot be worked out. MYOB begins producing upgrades for our customers on 6 Juneâ</para>

<para>âI will table it; of course I will table it. This is the organisation that is advising small businesses on their payrolls. MYOB says that unless the Labor Party announces by 6 Juneâtoday is 1 Juneâthere will be, in its words, âa looming crisis for small businessâ. Those schedules are in the House. If the Labor Party wants to disallow them it can move in this House today to disallow them. It will not succeed but at least we will know where the Labor Party stands on this issue.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I say this to the members of the Labor Party backbench, now held hostage by the member for Lilley and his failed strategy: Labor lost the last election because it did not understand the economy and it did not understand business. The argument which the member for Lilley and his compatriot the member for Perth put forward as to why they should be entrusted with economic policy on behalf of the opposition, rather than the member for Lalor, was that they could build responsibility and relationships with business. They said they could put aside Laborâs untrustworthiness on economic issues.</para>
<para>Today, as their first step, they are holding to ransom 850,000 Australian businesses. I want to say this: do not let it ever be said that the Labor Party can build a relationship with business when it engages in a stunt like this. MYOB is writing to the member for Lilley asking him to avoid a looming crisis. All he has to do is walk to that despatch box and say: âWe will not hold them to ransom. We will let businesses get on with employment. We will give employees their tax cuts. We the Labor Party have turned over a new leaf. We will try and show some understanding.â Until they do thatâLabor do not understand businessâLabor will never be trusted by business.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Jagajaga for her question. The first thing I can say to Australiaâs universities is that had there been a change of government last year they would have lost $1.4 billion over the next four years. The second thing is that the responsibility of those of us in government is to do what is right for Australia. It is critically important that we invest an additional $11 billion in universities over the next 10 years, which is what this government is committed to doing. But before we hand over that hard-earned taxpayersâ money we are saying that two things will happen in universities. The first is that there will be changes to the way in which they are governed and administered, and I thank the states and territories for their cooperation in reforming their enabling acts in that regard. The second thing is that the working arrangements in Australian universities and TAFEs should be no different from those enjoyed by working Australians right throughout the country.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The last bastion for industrial relations reform exists in Australiaâs TAFEs and universities. Just so it is absolutely clear to the average Australian what the government requires, before an extra $838 million is given over three years to Australiaâs universities we are requiring that the university management will offer to its employees an Australian workplace agreement and that every employee in a university or a TAFE should be free to join and be represented by a unionâif they want to. These are intelligent, educated people. If they want to, they should have the right to say that they do not want to negotiate an individual agreement, and they should only have a third party involved in industrial relations negotiations in relation to their working arrangements if they want them involved. There is nothing so remarkable about that. The average, everyday Australian would ask, âWhy is it that these people have been so cloistered for so long?â and one of the reasons is they have been protected by the people right across the benches of the Australian Labor Party.</para>

<para>âI thank the honourable member for McPherson for her question and tell the House that the Australian delegation, with officials from both the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Attorney-Generalâs Department, will be in Jakarta next week to discuss a bilateral treaty on the transfer of prisoners between Australia and Indonesia. We have arrangements with a range of states of this kind. We have 57 countries we have arrangements with through the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons and we have recently finalised a bilateral agreement with Thailand. It is important to recognise that, in the case of the other agreements we have, transfer of prisoner arrangements allow for a citizen convicted of a crime overseas to serve their sentence in Australia. They do not permit the offender to be released on return to Australia. Such agreements also require that all appeals processes must be exhausted before a transfer can be considered.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Indonesia currently does not have any bilateral prisoner transfer treaties, not with any other state, so it is important to recognise that these negotiations may be complicated and it may take some time to reach agreement. But it also worth remembering that, once that agreement is reached, assuming it is, between the Australian and Indonesian governments, it is likely that that agreement will require some amendments to legislation, including in Indonesia, and it is certain that that agreement would have to be ratified by the Indonesian parliament. I say that because I know a lot of people in Australia are upset about the Corby verdict. But I would say this: to continually attack Indonesia and denigrate its institutions and leaders will build up a good deal of anti-Australian sentiment in Indonesia and it will make it very difficult to conclude agreements of this kind, particularly through public institutions like the Indonesian parliament.</para>
<para>I am aware that today the Australian Federal Police and the ACT Fire Brigade are investigating a possible suspicious package that was received this morning by the Indonesian embassy. The embassy has been closed. It is surrounded by fire engines and other emergency services equipment. This is a matter of great concern and it is the sort of thing that is very unhelpful, to say the least. I make the point that as a government we condemn this sort of behaviour, we condemn this sort of abuse and we would urge people who are concerned about Schapelle Corby to ensure they put their energies into supporting the legal defence team and not put their energies into abuse and denigration of Indonesia, its institutions and its leaders and not to undertake these sorts of activities which, at least, are potentially threatening to Indonesian staff working here in Australia.</para>

Minister, is it not the case that, at the height of the public debate in this country on the Vivian Alvarez matter, on 16 May you misled the Australian people about when your department first knew that Vivian Alvarez was an Australian citizen, and why have you not corrected the record?</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Tangney for his question and can indicate to him that the response from business groups, including those many small businesses that operate in the electorate of the member for Tangney, has been overwhelmingly positive. We have also seen this deliberately misleading campaign run by the ALP and the ACTU against these reforms. Last Friday, as I told the parliament recently, we had Fran from Lane Coveâa supposed battler, who pretended to be on the minimum wage. Then, last Sunday, the ACTU released the results of a survey which showed apparent opposition to the reforms. There are some interesting things about this survey. The first thing is that the reforms were announced on 26 May. The survey was conducted from 23 to 26 May. So this was a survey showing results about reforms that had not yet been announced.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>One will also notice from the ACTUâs press release that the questionnaire used in the survey was developed by a firm called Essential Research. Essential Research is a business name for a company by the name of Essential Media CommunicationsâEMC Pty Ltd. I looked into this a bit further, and what I discovered was that EMC in Victoria operates out of a building in Carlton which is also occupied by the Communications Electrical and Plumbing Union. This union group includes the well-known Electrical Trades Union and such well-known characters as Dean Mighell. In Sydney, EMC operates out of a building in Sussex Streetâthe same building that is occupied by not just the Labor Council of New South Wales but also the New South Wales Labor Party. A search of the ASIC database reveals that EMC is owned and operated by four people. One of these people formerly worked for three unions: the ANF, the FSU and the AEU. Two of them previously worked as media officers for the Victorian Trades Hall Council; one of them, Mr Lewis, is currently a media officer for the Labor Council of New South Wales; and all four are shareholders of a company by the name of Auspoll Pty Ltd, which has been accused in the past of push polling for the Victorian ALP.</para>
<para>In addition to this, EMCâthe company that has conducted this surveyâhas donated money to the Australian Labor Party, it has worked on a number of ALP campaigns and it has received over $100,000 in consultancies from the Bracks Labor government. I invite members to go to EMCâs web site. They can find it at www.essentialmedia.com.au. If they are looking for a job, they will find this job description for a job which is currently going for a journalist/media relations personâsomeone, according to the job ad, who has demonstrated âa commitmentâ to social campaigning. The job ad also says:</para>

<para>âThe honourable member for Riverina, like all other representatives of rural electorates in Australia, is receiving positive feedback about the governmentâs $250 million boost to exceptional circumstances assistance. It has certainly been widely appreciated by rural and regional communities. It provides improved access to EC business support, a more generous assets test for the relief payment and better payments for those people who are eligible to receive this support. But the package also includes significant additional help for people in rural communitiesâ$4 million towards the family relationships program, $3 million to help the CWA with their aid program to families urgently in need and $2 million to boost financial counselling services.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Another important part of the announcement that was made by the Prime Minister earlier this week was the commitment of $1 million a year to continue our Young People in Rural Industries Program. That is a very important initiative that has now been in operation for a few years to support young people who have in mind a career in agriculture, to help support them to develop the skills that they need to be leaders in rural communities into the future. I am delighted to welcome in the gallery today 40 participants in the fifth Young Rural Leaders Course, which is being held in Canberra at the present time. These are some of the young people whom we can expect to lead rural industry organisations in the years ahead.</para>
<para>I have no doubt that through this program and some of the other elements of our youth support arrangements, such as the study scholarships and the capacity to participate in projects to benefit their industry around the world, we will have a generation of young people who can drive agriculture forward. I think that young people can make a contribution to agricultural policy now. It is not just a matter for the future. They can provide a lot of the innovation and the good ideas to help build a progressive rural sector. For that reason, two young people have been included in the reference group that is looking at rural policy at the present time. In September I will convene a national forum of rural young people to talk about issues of significance and to help plan a future for agriculture in this country.</para>
<para>Next week is Future Farmers Week. I hope this will provide an opportunity for people to think about the contribution that young people are already making towards vibrant rural communities and about what more can be done to assist them to achieve their objectives. Our investment in drought relief is very much an investment in the future of farming. Certainly it will provide an opportunity for the next generation to achieve their objectives.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Canberra for her question. I will investigate that. I cannot tell you offhand, because I made those representations in September 2002. I was on my way to Nigeria for a meeting of the then Commonwealth of Nations troika, to meet the President of Nigeria and the President of South Africa to talk about Zimbabwe. I stopped off at the MaldivesâI am going on recollection hereâand I met the president. I will find out. Because there is a context to this, I make the point that, as I recall it, the manâs situation was that all avenues of appeal had been exhausted and it seemed appropriate that these representations be made. Lest anybody think that it is odd to make representations after all avenues of appeal against the death penalty have been exhausted, it is quite common for the government of this countryâthrough me, the foreign minister or the Governor-General on adviceâto make representations for a pardon.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Without labouring the point, because I do not think it is constructive, you do these things after all avenues of appeal have been exhausted. To talk about doing them in other circumstances is clearly counterproductive. If I have got the dates wrong, I will freely acknowledge that, but that is my recollection of that case. I thought what I did was proper. From recollection, when I was asked the question last night on <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline>, I said that representation had been made by the manâs family. I will find out whether that is correct but, whether it was by his family, his friends or somebody else, not a lot turns on that. I think what turns on it is that he had exhausted all avenues of appeal and I properly made representations. I stand by that. Is the opposition suggesting I should not have done it?</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Hughes for her question and for the way in which she goes about promoting the very high performance of the Illawong Primary School in her electorate. Of all of the things that parents of the 3.3 million children in Australian schools want, the two that are most important to parents are standards and values. For the very first time, before this government hands over $33 billion of taxpayersâ money for the next four years to all government and non-government schools throughout the country, the conditions of that funding will have to be met. One of the conditions is that there will be plain language reports to parents. Parents are sick and tired of getting politically neutered reports from schools about the performance of their children, written in language that they cannot understand. From next year, it will be a government requirement for all Australian school reports, however information is reported to parents, to be reported in A, B, C, D and E. Parents can expect know which 25 per cent, or which one-quarter of the class, their child falls in.</para>

<para>I was quite disturbed today when I read in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> a report of what is happening in New South Wales government schools.

It seems that the ideological bureaucrats in the education department, the hardworking public servants, the principals, the teachers unions and just about everybody else in the state of New South Wales know how every school is performing, but one group of people who are apparently cut out of the equation are the parents. The <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> said:</para>

<para class="block">That is precisely the culture in New South Wales government schools.

<para>A schoolâs performance in literacy and numeracy in years 3, 5 and 7 and teacher attendance at school will be available to parents in the broader communityâone state minister asked, âWhatâs a teacherâs attendance at school got to do with the education of children?ââas well as teacher retention rates, student attendance rates, median year 10 and year 12 results, the value added score that the school delivers and the career leaver destinations. This government is determined to see that Australian schools have high, nationally consistent standards, that the performance of the school will be known to the broader community, that parents will not be treated as mushrooms by state education departments and that parents and their children will be at the centre of the educational experience.</para>

It concerns the issues related to his departmentâs awareness a couple of years prior to when he first advised the public that they understood that an Australian citizen had been deported from Australia, effectively illegally. Is it not the case that the Palmer inquiry, firstly, is not necessarily going to make public its findings and reveal its processes and deliberations publicly, as the minister herself has announced? Is it not the case that the Palmer inquiry is only going to definitively find on Rau and is going to make recommendations on how the issues regarding Alvarez Solon and about a couple of hundred other cases as well should be pursued? In fact, Minister, is it not the case that the circumstances you so arrogantly dismissed will not be answered by the Palmer inquiry, and will you now answer the shadow foreign ministerâs questions that you so arrogantly dismissed?</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Lindsay for her question and for her strong support for the Westmead Millennium Institute for Medical Research at Westmead Hospital in Western Sydney. With four Nobel prize winners in medicine, Australia has always punched well above its weight in health and medical research. Aspro, penicillin, the heart pacemaker, the ultrasound scanner and the bionic ear were all originally developed by Australians. Access Economics has concluded that every one dollar spent on medical research generates $5 in economic benefits.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Howard government has increased health and medical research spending from $127 million in 1996 to $487 million this year. In the recent election campaign we committed an additional $85 million to medical research, principally in cancer and diabetes. There is not nearly enough private money going into medical research. That is why we have commissioned a task force to look into how we can achieve greater commercialisation of our research, but our research output is still twice the OECD average. Good research ultimately translates into better clinical practice. And that is whyâ</para>

<para>âMy question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Is the minister aware of last nightâs allegations on Seven news that airside security checkpoints at Sydney airport are rarely staffed and access by a person with ill intent can be obtained by merely swiping another personâs security card? Is this is an example of the security the minister claimed yesterday puts us at the âabsolute cutting edge internationally of aviation securityâ? Minister, why arenât Australiaâs travelling public entitled to the same standard of security that protects Australian politicians at Parliament House?</para>

<para>âI thank the honourable member opposite for his question because it gives me the opportunity to take the objective assessment of the security of our airports out of the political realm and draw peopleâs attention to independent experts who know more about this than the Labor Partyâand, dare I say it, perhaps a little bit more than one or two people in the mediaâand are able to offer an objective opinion.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This morning on Radio National Fran Kelly introduced what she described as a âleading international security analystâ and said that that person had largely dismissed a classified Australian Customs report which claims that Sydney airport is a security shambles. That person is Mr Neil Fergus. Mr Neil Fergus ran the intelligence unit for the Sydney Olympics, and I think it would be said that the world looked on at the way in which the whole thing was conducted and congratulated Australia for its security arrangements. He works internationally as a consultant with his firm, Intelligent Risks. That consulting firm has carried out security analysis for at least 40 major international airports worldwide. That is not a bad record. He says that, while no airport can ever be 100 per cent security tightâa point that I acknowledged in this place yesterdayâAustraliaâs comes fairly close. He said:</para>

<para class="block">I am hard-stretched to think of another airport internationally that is of a similar standard to Sydney or Melbourne in relation to these matters.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In the current climate, where there is always the risk of sensationalism and politicisation of aviation security, I think it is relevant to hear from a respected international observer.</para>
<para>I would furthermore note that the United States transport security agency reviewed antiterrorism arrangements at Sydney airport last year and gave it a clean bill of health. Later this year ICAO will undertake another audit at Sydney airport. Because I think it is important, in the context of community concerns, to address those issues that might be worrying people and to do so in a way that is objective and transparent, I indicated this morning on the John Laws program that I intend to engage an internationally respected aviation security expert to provide us with a comprehensive overview of security arrangements at our airports over coming weeks. I do not believe that anything could be more transparent or more reasonable than that.</para>
<para>Yesterday in this place I charged the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister, who asked the question with what I believe is an entirely legitimate point, that, while ever they come into this place ahead of seeking the briefings that we freely offer on aviation security they are guilty of the charge that they seek to politicise rather than to address security issues. Yesterday, after question time and after the MPI when they said they did not want a briefing, they wrote to me saying that they do want one. I am glad about that. We have set it up for four oâclock this afternoon. Everyone who could be relevant to this will be there, including Customs, and I am awaiting an indication from the shadow minister and Leader of the Opposition as to whether they will actually take up that offer.</para>

<para>âI think that is relevant in the sense that there have been repeated claims that this is a more recent report of September of last year. The work done, as is now confirmed by the head of Customs, was earlier and the issues raised in that report, I believe, have been comprehensively responded to. Indeed, in the press release, the head of Customs, Mr Lionel Woodward, indicates that they have responded in the areas where Customs was advised that they ought to respond. The Leader of the Opposition will have the chance, if he wants to take us up on the offer of a briefing, to pursue Mr Woodward himself on why the report was not taken further.</para>

<para>On the claim overnight in relation to an individual at Sydney airport with a previous drugs conviction, I am advised at this point in timeâand I seek to make the point clear that I am advised and I can only report to the best of my knowledgeâthat there are potentially two individuals who might have fitted that category. One no longer has an ASIC. The other does. It relates to an offence committed in about 1980. The individual involved served his time and a number of years lapsed, resulting in that conviction having been spent. In those circumstances, under state and Commonwealth lawâas I think the Leader of the Opposition and, I hope, the shadow minister who asked the former question would knowâtheir previous misdemeanours must be overlooked. They cannot be used to discriminate against people in the workplace.</para>
<para>I think the Leader of the Opposition tacitly acknowledged this morning that there are very real issues here that go to the heart of our justice system and the way in which we regard people who have served time for misdemeanours. I think the point ought to be made that ASICs are, if you like, reissued every two years. If there are further issues, and I think there are some that ought to be taken into account in the future, I make this point: it might actually require the state and the Commonwealth governments to amend their legislation. In those circumstances, I pose this question now to the Leader of the Opposition: can we look forward to support from the union movement and from the Labor Party if it becomes necessary to change that legislation?</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Macquarie for his question because, like many of us, he is acutely aware of the sacrifices and commitment of emergency volunteers in protecting the lives and homes of people, particularly in bushfire prone areas. The government has taken major steps in delivering on its election commitment to support volunteers and local councils involved in emergency management across Australia.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Following extensive consultation, today I have released the guidelines for two new funding programs under the governmentâs $49 million Working Together to Manage Emergencies initiative. The funding available in this program will include $33 million under the local grant scheme, and that assists local councils to take a strategic approach to disaster management by developing risk management and community safety strategies. There is also a $16 million national volunteer support fund to provide grants directly to volunteer organisations working at the front-line of emergency management to assist with training, equipment and recruitment.</para>
<para>The new funding programs will be managed by Emergency Management Australia. More information, including the guidelines, is now available from the EMA web site. Applications for the first round close on 29 July. I would simply say that this practical support from the government demonstrates the value that we place on local governments and volunteers in building capacity in our community to respond to emergencies of all types. I am sure that members will join with me in encouraging hardworking emergency volunteer organisations and councils committed to keeping our communities safe to see how these initiatives can help them in their very important work.</para>

<para>âThe honourable member has referred to what will be a relatively small group of people who are in their second or third year of EC declaration and who have already claimed an interest subsidy and received a 50 per cent subsidy according to the old guidelines. I can confirm to the House that those people will be entitled to a supplement, so they will receive an extra 30 per cent interest subsidy under the arrangements that the Prime Minister announced earlier this week. I will need to prepare for each of the states a new set of guidelines so that they are able to administer the new arrangements under the more generous conditions. Naturally, that has not been completed as yet, but that will be done as quickly as possible so that any doubt can be removed in the minds of those who are administering the scheme. But I can confirm to all members in the House that that small number of people who have received a 50 per cent payment in the second and third year are eligible for a top-up.</para>

<para>âI have sought some further information on the answer I gave to the member for Canberra. It does not fundamentally alter what I said, but perhaps I can supply a bit more information. It is true, as I have recollected, that during a stopover in the Maldives, in fact at Male International Airport in September 2002, I raised Mr Scanlonâs case with the Maldives foreign minister. Subsequently, a pardon was granted and, on 24 October 2002, I wrote to the President thanking him for the pardon for Mr Scanlon. In that letter I said:</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<quote>
<para class="block">I am in no way sympathetic towards drugs and consider it important that countries take effective measures against them. The Australian government and I supported Mr Scanlanâs application for a pardon, however, because of the severity of the sentence and because he has expressed remorse for his actions.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The background is that on 12 September 2000 Mr Scanlan was sentenced to life imprisonment for the importation of 57.1 grams of hashish oil. The government sought independent advice from the Judicial Commission of New South Wales, who told us that a likely sentence for the offence in Australia was not more than 12 months. The government took the view that, once that period had elapsed, it was appropriate for a pardon to be sought. Representations were made by the Department of Foreign Affairs on Mr Scanlonâs behalf. I have checked the files, and I in fact did receive a personal letter in 2002 from the manâs wife. So my recollection was correct that she had written to me. Prior to that, I understand that the lawyers for Mr Scanlon, on request from Mr Scanlonâs familyâhe had an elderly mother as well as a wife; I am not sure about childrenâhad made representations to the Department of Foreign Affairs.</para>
<para>All I can say is that broadly the recollection of the events that I gave last night was, to the best of my knowledge, accurate. As to its comparison with other casesâand I will use the genericâI simply make the point that these representations were made after there had been admissions of guilt and remorse expressed and a comparable sentence in Australian terms had been served. I think it is important to make the point that, if the pre-condition of an approach for a pardon or for an exercise of presidential or royal clemency is an admission of guilt, that ought to be borne in mind if people call on the government in particular cases to make applications for clemency.</para>

<para>âI said during the answer to that question that we were concerned about a suspicious parcel which had been received by the Indonesian embassy. I can advise the House now that an envelope was taken to a laboratory at the Canberra Hospital for further analysis at 12.25 today. The initial analysis of the powder has tested positive as a biological agent, though further testing will need to be carried out to determine what that substance actually is. As such, there is a possibility that the Indonesian embassy will be shut down for quite some period of time and that the 22 staff will remain in isolation for the next 48 hours.</para>

<para>I would like to extend the Houseâs concernâall of usâabout this, our condemnation of this action and our hope that none of the staff will have in any way been harmed.

<para>âOn indulgence, the Labor Party completely support the remarks and the tone of the statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the incident that has occurred at the Indonesian embassy. This is a disgraceful act to be condemned by all Australians. It is very necessary, I think, to learn from this, and people should view the circumstances now surrounding the particular case which may have generated this incident with a bit of calm, dispassion and commonsense. There is no doubt at all that this is a very serious thing to have happened.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>If the circumstances are that a biological agent was sent to the Indonesian embassy, it would be the first instance of that occurring in this country and would amount to an extremely serious development indeed. This is a situation which no doubt the government will want to keep the House apprised of as time goes by; but, in the meantime, there should be absolutely no doubt in the public mind at all that the House is of a combined and united view that this sort of outrageous behaviour must not be encouraged and that an atmosphere which encourages it must not be sustained.</para>

<para>âThe complacency and the arrogance of the Howard government and the Treasurer were on display today and yesterday for all Australians to see. We are now living with the consequences of their failure to invest in the future and their failure to ensure that prosperity will continue for generations to come. There is an old saying that luck never gives, it only lends. The problem we have now is that this country has borrowed too much and we are mortgaging our future. We are mortgaging our future because of the complacency of the Treasurer and the Prime Minister and their failure to admit that we have a serious problem with our current account deficit and with foreign debt.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The growth that this country has enjoyed over the last 14 years has been the product of extremely good work by past Labor governments. The reforms of the Hawke-Keating period provided the productivity that was required for wealth to double. Labor made the investments in the future, which have now been run down by this government. What is evident to all when we look at the national accounts and at yesterdayâs current account deficit and foreign debt figures is that this government is now surfing on the benefits of the best terms of trade in 30 years. In that environment how do we actually secure an outcome where we have a record current account deficit and record foreign debt? This complacent government has been living off the legacy of the past reforms of the Hawke-Keating government and is now living off the legacy of the very favourable terms of trade and squandering opportunities to invest in the future. The results of that are out there today for everybody to see.</para>
<para>In the last 12 months we have had an economic growth rate with a one in front of itâa full two percentage points less than the average growth rate of the last decade. Productivity growth has declined by 2.4 per centâthe worst figures in 19 years. Exports continue to detract from economic growth, with the last successive positive contribution coming in June 2001. Household savings still remain negative and now foreign debt has surged by a massive $46 billion to $425 billion. On top of that, we have a current account deficit which has widened from six per cent to 7.2 per cent of GDP.</para>
<para>These astonishing results have occurred at a time when we are really experiencing what you could call a 21st century gold rush, with the best terms of trade in 30 years. In that environment we can only manage a growth rate with a one in front of it and we are still borrowing more from the rest of the world to get by. Only a Treasurer as complacent, as smug and as out of touch as this one could stand up like he did today and say that that was a good result. But Labor says it is not good enough. We ought to be achieving better growth rates. Productivity growth should be growing strongly, not falling. Exports should be contributing to economic growth, not detracting from it. Household savings should be in the black, not in the red. Foreign debt needs to be brought under control and, most certainly, the current account deficit needs to be narrowed. Our future prosperity depends on these things, yet this Treasurer and his government continue to leave their heads in the sand.</para>
<para>In the last two days we have seen two releases from the ABS: the national accounts and balance of payment. As I said before, we are enjoying a historic terms of trade boom. The figures today have confirmed that, in the last 12 months, the terms of trade have lifted by 7.6 per cent. This has meant that income is growing at twice the rate of production. Despite these extraordinary positive external conditions, the economy has these extraordinary imbalances. Consumption is running well ahead of production; consumption continues to run ahead of income; and, despite the resources boom, imports continue to outstrip exports and detract from growth, taking something like 0.3 per cent off growth in the last quarter. In this period the Australian manufacturing sectorâs output has shrunk by 0.9 per cent.</para>
<para>Productivity growth has been going backwards every quarter for the past year. Productivity growth fell by 2.4 per cent in the year to Marchâthe worst result in 19 years. Yesterday we also had the announcement of the biggest current account deficit and the biggest foreign debt in the history of this country. Think about thatâthe biggest ever. Nothing highlights the lack of competitiveness of this economy as much as the external accounts. But donât take my word for it; letâs see what the Treasurer and the Prime Minister have had to say about this in the past. In 1995, John Howard told Alan Jones:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">You see, foreign debt is a direct consequence of the fact that our economy is not functioning in a modern efficient manner.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Very true, Treasurer, it certainly is. All of those imbalances are there for people to see in the national accounts today. When the Prime Minister made that comment, net foreign debt was $180 billionâless than half of the $425 billion that we see today. That foreign debt of $425 billion represents $21,056 for every man, woman and child in this country. Donât we all remember the Prime Minister and the Treasurer at the launch of the âdebt truckâ? Just imagine how big that truck has to be today. It is going to be a road train today. It is more than twice what it was when we heard these comments from the Treasurer and the Prime Minister.</para>
<para>Of course, the problem is not just with our exports or just that our imports are surging; we are borrowing more and more every year just to pay interest on our debt, with nothing from this government to fix the problem. The fastest-growing parts of the economy are increasingly being owned by overseas companies. While improved exports will help to rebalance net goods and services, the flow of profits from foreign owned exporters is worsening the income deficit all of the time. This is very clearly a serious structural problem in our economy.</para>
<para>Where does it take us? When you have a current account deficit like this and a foreign debt like this, both of which are continuing to grow, they put upward pressure on interest rates. We saw the complacent and arrogant denial of that by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer in this House today. But back in 1996 they said, absolutely, that a current account deficit of those levels would produce upward pressure on interest rates. You might recall talk about a banana republic when the current account deficit was at six per cent of GDP. Well, Treasurer, who is the chimp with the banana now? You have a current account deficit at 7.2 per cent of GDP and there is not the slightest doubt that interest rates in this country are far higher because of your neglect and your head-in-the-sand approach towards the current account deficit and foreign debt.</para>
<para>It gets worse. Let us look at what the Prime Minister had to say in February 1995. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Six per cent is a ... very bad figure. Itâs an extremely bad figure. Our foreign debt exposure is alarming. There can be no other description for it. It is alarming.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Today foreign debt is at 7.2 per cent of GDP. Listen to this one. On 10 May 1995 he said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">If you really want to fix Australiaâs current account deficit problem over the long term, you have got to fix the supply bottlenecks in the Australian economy and make us more productive and competitive.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Those who have a memory that goes back longer than a few weeks would understand that the Treasury and the Prime Minister have continuously denied in this House that there has been a problem with supply bottlenecks or capacity constraints in the economy. They could barely utter the word âinfrastructureâ until recent weeks, when they were put under considerable pressure by Labor. We heard that word, probably almost for the first time, pass the lips of the Treasurer here yesterday.</para>
<para>Of course, Treasurer, productivity is being held back by infrastructure bottlenecks in the economy and by the skills crisisâand your government fails to act. The government continually puts its head in the sand. Let us judge your actions by your previous standards. Here is another quote from the then Leader of the Opposition, the current Prime Minister. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">But look, the Government has been there for 12 years, and they and they alone, have to wear the responsibility for the mess that the current account is in, and the fact that Australian borrowers pay the highest real interest rates in the Western world.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It was good enough for you to say then that the former Prime Minister ought to bear responsibility for the highest interest rates in the Western world and a high current account, but you will not accept responsibility for it today. Treasurer, you are always happy to claim credit when there is good news around but when there is bad news around, you are missing in actionâjust as you were missing in action yesterday.</para>

<para>âThe Treasurer is absolutely responsible, but the problem goes further. I want to talk a little bit about debt servicing. We saw the hypocrisy of the Prime Minister when he came into the House yesterday and lectured us about the current account deficit and how foreign debt could be dismissed because we could afford to service it. We have done a bit of research on the claims that the Prime Minister made yesterday. We went back to his previous statements. On 28 February 1996 he said of the then Prime Minister:</para>

<para>âHe cannot get his facts straight about the state of our foreign debt. Let us put the Prime Ministerâs denial to one side. The debt servicing ratio on our stock of foreign debt is around the same today as it was in March 1996 when the present Treasurer and the Prime Minister were asserting that there was a foreign debt crisis.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The facts are these. In the March quarter 2005 interest payments on our stock of foreign debt amounted to $5.2 billion or 13.2 per cent of goods and services credits. In March 1996 interest payments on our stock of foreign debt amounted to 13.4 per cent of goods and services credits. So the truth is, in the Prime Ministerâs own terms, the serviceability of the debt is no different to that time when the Treasurer was shredding the Keating government for their alleged failure to deal with a current account crisis and record foreign debt.</para>
<para>The comments today from Standard and Poorâs expose the government. They expose the governmentâs complacency towards the risk to interest rates and the economy posed by the current account deficit. On top of this we have the government coming into the House and claiming that somehow they are friends of the workers. The Treasurer over there claims that he has blue denim in his veins and that he is a working-class man. On radio in Brisbane he admitted that workers on $40,000 to $46,000 are struggling. Treasurer, if they are struggling why donât you give them a decent tax cut? Why are you not prepared to do something about it? We on this side of the House know something about fairness in the tax system and we are not prepared to let members of your government and ministers from millionairesâ row over there pocket $65 a week while the average Australian worker pockets $6. You are so embarrassed by that imbalance.</para>

<para>âThe Treasurer is so embarrassed by that imbalance. He drags this dead cat of procedural issues across the tax debate because he does not want to debate the substantive question. He is running away from it all the time. The government is no friend of the worker. The truth is this: no Prime Minister in Australian history has done more to create the battlers, and no Prime Minister in Australian history has done less to help them. This fact has been exposed day in and day out in this parliament, particularly by the member for Perth and the Leader of the Opposition, when they rip to shreds your proposals on industrial relations. Your attack on the minimum wage says much more about where you sit and the governmentâs values than anything else. The government is prepared to rip the guts out of the minimum wage and get rid of the no disadvantage test. The government is prepared to take away the bargaining power of the Australian work force and rip away the capacity of organised labour to stand up for those who need some help.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>What follows from that is your misuse of NATSEM data. The truth is that, under your government, those on very high incomes have done very well and are doing better all the time; those on middle incomes are being splitâsome are doing well and some are going backwards; and the poor are getting poorer all the time. No amount of misuse of NATSEM data can obscure that. When you go to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the tax statistics and the NATSEM reports you can see that this government is very strong on controlling the weak, very weak on controlling the strong and failing to invest in the future. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThis is a discussion of a matter of public importance which alleges failures of policy to improve international competitiveness. The one thing the member for Lilley did not talk about was international competitiveness. He referred to no index of international competitiveness; he gave no benchmarking of Australia against other countries; he gave no analysis of where Australia is now, compared to where it was; and, of course, he put forward no policy to improve international competitiveness. The member for Lilley read out a written text which had obviously been prepared for him. It was one of those diatribes that you might get away with at the Lilley FEC in front of undoubtedly the very few branch membersâif there are anyâwho attend the Lilley FEC. They would sit there and say: âDidnât he reaffirm our prejudices today. What can we take out of that speech? He does not like Mr Howard and he does not like Mr Costello. That is what we wanted to hear.â</para>
</talk.start>
<para>People in the press who may be asking whether the member for Lilley will cut it as a shadow frontbencher might actually be asking a different question. They might ask: if the member for Lilley wanted to raise a matter of public importance on Australiaâs international competitiveness then surely, since he got to write the motion, he would raise questions of competitiveness, he would benchmark Australia on the international competitiveness index, he would find out where Australia is falling behind, he would offer policies as to how Australia could move up, and he would lay out the Australian Labor Partyâs blueprint for what should happen with the Australian economy and economic management. That is what people in the press would have been asking themselves when they were listening to his speech today.</para>
<para>The second thing they would be asking is: why was the matter of public importance today on the balance of payments and current account when those figures came out yesterday? If this was such a great crisis, if this was a matter of absolute urgency, would we not have been discussing this yesterday rather than today? I can disclose that the Labor Party tactics committee is concerned that the member for Lilley is squibbing question time. He has not asked a question about the budget since the budget was delivered. There is so much concern in the tactics group of the Australian Labor Party that the member for Lilley was virtually ordered to put the MPI on the agenda today and get down to the House to try and recover some of the Australian Labor Partyâs lost credibility.</para>
<para>Five shadow Treasurersâone with two incarnationsâhave been put up by the Australian Labor Party in the time that I have been Treasurer. I know that comparisons are odious. I do not want to compare the member for Lilleyâs performance to that of his predecessors, but I will say that not one of them failed to asked a question after a budget. I have delivered 10 budgets. This is the first time the shadow Treasurer has failed to asked a question after the budget. This will undoubtedly go down as something of a record.</para>
<para>Let me come to the essence of the diatribe that was put forward by the member for Lilley. It began with this proposition: âThe Australian economy is strong and is run well, and that is all to the credit of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating, but if it is not strong and not running well, if the current account deficit is too high, that is all to the credit of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. So weâve got you covered both ways. If itâs good, itâs all the Labor Partyâs good work, but if it is bad, itâs all the coalitionâs work.â I think that is the essence of it. Once you state that proposition, you see immediately the inherent contradictions of the whole thing.</para>
<para>The member for Lilley was full of quotes and had a preplanned joke in relation to banana republics. I remind the member for Lilley that âbanana republicâ was not this governmentâs expression, it was not the current Prime Ministerâs expression and it was not an expression of mine. It was in fact the then Labor Treasurer Paul Keatingâs description of the state of the Australian economy under his watch and his management. He was at least more honest in his assessment of how things were going when he was there than the member for Lilley is nine years after the event. Banana republic was a description which the then Treasurer Mr Keating applied back in 1986. Let me remind the House that in 1986 the budget was not in surplus; it was two per cent in deficit. In todayâs terms that would be a budget deficit of around $18 billion. We did not have inflation at two per cent in March 1986. The inflation rate in March 1986 was 9.3 per cent. Inflation! I am not talking about a mortgage rate.</para>
<para>The member for Lilley today wants to complain that interest rates are high because the standard variable mortgage interest rate is 7.3 per cent. Let me remind the House that in March 1986 the mortgage interest rate was not 7.3 per cent; it was 13.5 per cent. At least the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, was forthright in his analysis. But his analysis would not have been the analysis of the member for Lilley that he was a brilliant economic manager who nine years after the event is responsible for low inflation, low interest rates, a growing economy, a balanced budget and net debt which is close to zero. No, he was much more forthright in his analysis. The description that he gave is the one that the member for Lilley now repeats.</para>
<para>The critical point here is that when this government was putting in place the measures which locked in low interest rates, which locked in budget surpluses and which retired debt, the Australian Labor Party did not say in genuine bipartisanship, âThe Australian Labor Party will support you.â We were fought every step of the way. Let me go through it. In 1996 the budget was in deficit by two per cent of GDP. I announced that this government would balance the budget. The Australian Labor Party opposed the balancing of the Australian budget. They said that if we balanced our budget Australia would go into recession.</para>
<para>I well remember that in 1996 the opposition were not just in here; there was a riot led by building workers who stormed Parliament House after a rally addressed by the Leader of the Opposition, who fired them up. They came down to the House, they broke down the front doors and they came into the House. Why? They were protesting against the balancing of the Australian budget. That is why. Nine years after the event the Labor Party say, âWe were always in favour of a balanced budget.â You are always in favour of it after it is done, but during the work the Australian Labor Party opposed it.</para>
<para>Let me go to monetary policy. In 1996 I announced, in an agreement with the Governor of the Reserve Bank, that we would inflation target our monetary policy, with underlying inflation at two to three per cent over the cycle, and that we would put monetary policy on a new basis. When I appointed the new Governor of the Reserve Bank and entered into that agreement, did the Australian Labor Party support that? Let me remind the member for Lilley that the then shadow Treasurerâsomebody who was perhaps of a standard different from him, and I do not speak favourably of the member for LilleyâGareth Evans, announced that this was an illegal agreement contrary to statute and that the Australian Labor Party would take legal action against the government to undo it. That is what the Australian Labor Party said in relation to inflation targeting for an independent monetary policy. As it turns out, I am still waiting for the writ to be served on me. They are legal proceedings that have never been taken. After it was done, the Australian Labor Party appeared on the scene of the crime and said, âWe were always in favour of inflation targetingâand the fact that it has worked and brought interest rates down is all the good work of Paul Keating.â</para>
<para>Let us go through the unemployment record in relation to the Australian Labor Party. I hear the Australian Labor Party say, âOur economic position is all the good work of Mr Keating and Mr Hawke,â but there is one fact that appears to have been completely airbrushed out of the record. What has been airbrushed out of the record is that in 1990 Mr Keatingâs great legacy to this economy, as he said himself, was giving it the recession it had to haveâputting a million people out of work. You never actually hear that. Let me ask the member for Lilley this question because it has always puzzled me: if the low unemployment that we enjoy today is all the good work of the Hawke-Keating government, if they could produce low unemployment under a coalition government, why did they not produce low unemployment under a Labor government?</para>
<para>That was a cunning plan, wasnât it? They were always capable of producing low unemployment but they decided to withhold it from their own record and bequeath it to the Liberal party. We really do owe the Hawke-Keating government a lot. It was another one of their cunning plans. But of course the reality is that they would have produced low unemployment if they could have kept the economy out of recession in 1990. They may have been able to do it. But they could not keep the economy out of recession. In fact, they now boast that they wanted it to go into recession and produce the recession we had to have. It was not that the Keating government was against producing low unemployment under Labor; it was because they could not. It was not some cunning plan to delay all of the fruits of good economic management; it was an inability to produce these outcomes under their economic management. If you really want to go to the druthers of Mr Keating, he now says it was a good thing to produce a recession. We on this side of the House have never believed that a recession is a good thingâthat it is a good thing to put people out of work.</para>
<para>Let me come to real wages. I was in this House then. I used to sit on the opposition benches and see the then Treasurer walk to the dispatch box. His proudest boast under Labor was that they had reduced real wages. That was his proudest boast. He used to say, âWe have restored the profit share and we have reduced real wages. This will make the Australian economy a better economy.â Real wages have increased under this government by 14 per cent. Again, the member for Lilley will say that that is all the good work of Paul Keating. Wasnât that a cunning planâto delay increases in real wages until they occurred under a coalition government? They fell under Labor.</para>
<para>I do not know whether the member for Lilley actually believes these propositions. When he went to white bread training school they said to him, âRepeat endlessly a proposition even if you do not believe it until everybody else thinks that you doââas he did in relation to the $600 payment. Recall the $600 payment? It did not exist. It was not real money. After he had repeated that enough times he may have believed it himself, but the families of Australia do not believe it because they are getting that $600 on an annual basis. This is the government that increased real wages. It was not the Labor government. This was, presumably, again some cunning plan by Labor to be in favour of real wage increases, produce real wage decreases and then allow the coalition government to take the credit for that policy after Labor had left office.</para>
<para>The reality is this: that the Hawke and Keating governmentsâand I have always said itâdid some good things. The first thing they did was to reduce tariffs. But, of course, the moment Labor went into opposition and I tried to decrease tariffs the Australian Labor Party opposed it and voted against it, including the tariff cut which occurred on 1 January. The second thing that they did was to allow the Reserve Bank to float the dollar. One of the consequences of that is the dollar goes up and the dollar goes down. One of the difficulties that the exporters of Australia have at the moment is that the Australian dollar is high. Nonetheless, that is a difficulty for the Australian exporters; it does not mean we should reverse the policy.</para>
<para>In wrapping up this debate, I say that the member for Lilleyâs contribution was diatribe and sloganeering but showed no real understanding of economic policy. Labor lost the last election because they did not understand economic policy. At this rate they are well on their way to losing the next election if they do not pick up their economic policy. There is one big test for the member for Lilley: to let those tax cuts through if he wants to get credibility on the Australian economy. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI will withdraw the comment that the Treasurer is the Blackadder of the Australian parliament, despite the fact that he quoted from that show at length about cunning plans in relation to the former government and the way it operated. I would also point out that this is one of the very few occasions, if not the only occasion, when he has come to the dispatch box on an MPI to defend his government and his record supported by a group of people behind him that you could fit into a police callbox. That was about all there were. Where is the rest of the support from the government for this Treasurerâs attempted defence of his governmentâs record and what it has done economically?</para>

Treasurer, sorry, I was not in the House prior to 1996, but from 2 January 1985 I did in fact work in the then Treasurerâs electorate office, I did have a fairly close view of just what economic problems this country faced and I did note, given that I have been around the Australian Labor Party since the age of 15 or so, what we had to contend with as a government when we came to office.

<para>âI have used Treasurer, but not generically. The problem with real wages, which you, Treasurer, have distorted, is one that flowed directly out of the Howard and Fraser period. In 1982-83 there was a massive surge in wage inflation, and that surge was led by the strongest unions in Australia, and the then government allowed it to take off. That pushed Australia, firstly, into a great inflationary period and, secondly, into a massive recession. We also know that there were great problems faced as a result of debt created by the Fraser government with the member for Bennelong as the then Treasurer. By the end of his term he achieved something that no-one would ever want to achieveâthe trifecta in economic performance: double digit interest rates, unemployment rates and inflation rates. Not only did he achieve that trifecta to the detriment of the Australian economy and drive Australiaâs economy into recessionâsomething which the Treasurer points out as often as he can when dealing with this issue at question timeâbut also he created a situation where, with $9.6 billion worth of debt in one year, which is equivalent in todayâs terms to $35 billion, the Australian economy was crushed and the problems compounded.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>We, on coming into government, had to deal with it. The Treasurer was disingenuous in all the points of his arguments on what the core problems, as he sees it, were in the Hawke and Keating period. But what did the Treasurer attempt to do and succeed in doing by dealing with that catalogue of complaints that he hadâwhat he called cunning stratagems and so on? What he succeeded in doing was to move away from the key elements of this MPI. The key element is not international competitiveness. The key elements are the current account deficit and foreign debt. It is impossible for any Treasurer of this country to walk away from the fact that the current account deficit has spiralled out of control. To add $15.6 billion in just one quarter this year leads to a concern not just from this opposition but also from Standard and Poorâs, the rating agency, which indicated in yesterdayâs <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> that we should worry about that fact. Allied to that is the fact that not only have we gone to a record 7.25 per cent in the current account deficit but also we have a record $424.6 billion in foreign debt.</para>
<para>The Treasurer tells us: âDonât worry about that. There is only about $6 billion left in net Commonwealth debt.â Let me tell you, Treasurerâyou should know because you were here when last we were in governmentâthat we had it down to about $17 billion of net Commonwealth debt. When you get yourself into a precipitous situation, where you are not really careful about what you are doing, where you just blithely say, âAll care but only a little responsibility,â and where you say that no government should really be concerned about the impact of the current account deficit and foreign debt and there are not really any measures that you can take to fix it, you have to worry. Standard and Poorâs are somewhat worried about this. Their analyst Sharad Jain said that Australiaâs foreign debt is now about 2Â½ times the size of its total international earnings from exports and investments. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">This is pretty high for a AAA-rated country ... It is 50 to 60 per cent more than any other country with a AAA credit rating.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">There is your international comparison, Treasurer. The other international comparison which you, as Treasurer, are wont to give us is here as well. Which two countries does Australia compare with in current account deficit? They are Bulgaria and Hungary. The current account deficit will go to 7.3 per cent of gross domestic product next year. Bulgaria will be out and you will have only Hungary left. With Bulgaria out of the action, there will be no other countries with worse current account deficits than Australia and Hungary.</para>
<para>What did the current Prime Minister say all those many years ago on 28 February 1996 about the former Treasurer and Prime Minister?</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">He began to enter the denial stage about foreign debt. He now says foreign debt - debt really doesnât matter. He said debt is not so bad as long as you can service it. I mean that is the classic response that somebody who has been there so long and has been so unable to find a solution to something. He thinks he will define the problem away by pretending that it doesnât exist.</para>

<para>âYou have not concerned yourself as Treasurer to the key problem of how you increase Australian skills through the training of Australia people. This country could combat the current account deficit if we had trained enough people in the skilled trades area to make up for the current shortfall. Instead of this government importing people en masse from overseasânot just through the immigration program but through a specific program using the four-year temporary entry permitsâto cover that gap, this country could not only cover that problem but export our capacity, export our people into the region and earn income from overseas to balance our account. That is one key thing that this government could be doing. It has been missing in action since 1996.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The second key area that this government could be attacking is the broader problem it has in manufactured goods coming out of Australia. Part of the problem with the current account, our foreign debt and dealing with this countryâs economy is that we are coming off the back of a significant increase in commodity prices in Australia. That means a commodity driven Australian dollar has been driven up and added to those problems. One of the ways in which you can fight back against that is to produce more in this country and to sell it overseas.</para>
<para>From 1983 to 1996 the increase in elaborately transformed manufactures from Australia was dramatic. It formed the core of Australiaâs increased productivity and increased export capacity. It is not enough to flog off raw materials to China at higher prices and say, âIsnât it wonderful that we are getting products back that mean that Australian people pay less.â We should be training Australian tradespeople to work and produce in Australia so that we do not have to bring in more from overseas. We should be training those people so that they can earn foreign income to cut back the current account deficit and reduce the massive foreign debt of $424.6 billion. This Treasurer and this government stand condemned because they have not dealt with these key and fundamental problemsâand they deserve the censure of this House. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThis afternoon I follow the member for Blaxland with an element of trepidation. His record as an electorate officer for the former Prime Minister leaves me under significant pressure to come up with meaningful economic data to match the record of the previous Labor Prime Minister and the legacy he left behind. I will do my best. I will do three things today. The first is an attempt to disentangle this somewhat clumsy MPI into comments on the current account deficit and comments on foreign debt and then to finish with a few international comparisons, because I think that they have been sadly lacking today.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Hearing the two members from the other side, a term came back to me from my former career in medicine when I would sometimes examine fairly frail medical cases. There was a condition known as âshifting dullnessâ. What we are seeing today from the other side is evidence over the last few months of picking and choosing one or two pieces of economic data in isolation and attempting to build a case around it. That form of shifting dullness simply is not going to stick. What we heard from the first speaker on the other side, the member for Lilley, was effectively an attempt to clutch at economic terms such as âincome debitsâ, âproductivity being held backâ, âabsolute growth okay but growth rates fallingâ, âgoods and services creditsâ, âexternal accountsââterms that do not mean very much to Australians, terms that do not cause any real sense of concern in the household. What the other side have lost sight of in this debate, and the MPI in general, is that they really have failed, as they did in their term in government, to truly engage the issues that really matter to families. That is what I intend to do here today.</para>
<para>I begin with the current account deficit. It is divided into two portionsâand I know that reading out economic data is sometimes lost on the other side but I will try one more time. That $7 billion of goods and services is, in many ways, evidence of strong international confidence, of strong standards of living and of the ability with a higher dollar to afford imports. They are decisions being made individually by households. They are decisions to invest, as much as they are decisions not to saveâand it is a relative balance of the two. Until we can actually see exports ramping upâand we know there are delays in thatâwe can expect that there will be a larger goods and services component to that current account deficit.</para>
<para>The second part is actually largerâthat is, the income debits and credits. There were not many references to this made by the other side. That amount of $8.4 billion is, effectively, strong profits being made by companies, particularly international companies. There is the other side, which is not being mentioned, of strong tax takes and the opportunity for tax breaks for Australians. These are all the positive flow-on effects of a strong economy and strong international confidence. That is borne out by our AAA credit rating and the level of our currency.</para>
<para>The second part of the MPI goes to the notion of âspiralling foreign debtâ. It is worth noting that most of the household debt that we often refer to is household lending. What we are now talking about is the ability of a small to medium sized economy to go out and find the capital that it needs to feed a growing economy and to take advantage of the endowments this country has. We already know that the drought has slowed down a portion of our export market. But the minerals sector is extremely strong. Many mining companiesânot all of them are domestic companies; some are internationally ownedâwill be borrowing resources to optimise our use of those mineral resources, and that will be reflected. That is no surprise.</para>
<para>I will look at the current account deficit in greater detail. The figure released yesterday was primarily driven by the $224 million increase in the net income deficit that I was just referring to. That is simply a reflection of the strong profitability of Australian companies, some of which have been repatriated by foreign investors. It reflects an increase in profits of mining companies in particular. That is a very strong subsector of the economy, and we have already talked about the flow-on obstructions to exports of minerals and resources, particularly given the comments we have made about ports, including those in my own home state of Queensland. It is worth noting that when you actually take away that net income deficit there is in fact a very small nominal trade deficit improvement of $22 million. So I think it would be wrong to frame this debate as an example of imports rapidly outstripping our exports. But what we can expect over time is that there will be ramping up of exports and an amelioration of those figures. In addition, as has already been mentioned, terms of trade have improved by 1.1 per cent over the last year. That indicates a strengthening in the relative value of our exports.</para>
<para>In concluding my comments on the current account deficit, I should probably make the important point that this is very close to what is likely to be a peak in the level of the current account deficit once the effects of our mineral and bulk commodity exports flow through. Of course, export prices are increasing dramatically. We have the early upstream evidence that is occurring. We have seen coking coal contracts achieving prices of 120 per cent higher levels, we have seen iron ore contracts up and thermal coal contracts up as well. I expect that data will start to flow fairly soon. We should be watching the monthly trade data for the month of April, which is coming out this Thursday. Also outlined is the fact the export volumes themselves are increasing. That is underpinned by strong resource growth and the minerals industryâs investment of $27 billion over the last few years. This will flow through in time. But the key questions today as far as the current account deficit goes should be: are we seeing higher export prices? The answer is yes. Are we seeing increased export volumes? The answer is yes. Are we seeing moderating import growth? There is a good chance of that. That is where we will see those first pieces of evidence of a narrowing current account deficit.</para>
<para>I move to foreign debt. While we may talk about absolute figures, it is important to note that if you actually look at it as a proportion of the national economyâas a percentage of GDPâthe foreign debt figure has actually fallen since the last figures were released, down to 50 per cent. It is often forgotten that the debt that we are talking about today, the net foreign debt, is a considerably different debt picture from the one that we were left with in 1996. The proportion of government debt is very small. The ability to service it is far stronger. What we simply see now is that there are very large levels of foreign debt created by investment and a strong corporate sector.</para>

<para>âThe debt servicing ratio is very important. In fact, it is vitally important and relevant. I appreciate the interjections. That debt servicing ratio, at 9.7 per cent in the March quarter, is considerably better than it was at 20 per cent back in 1990. Of course, with the revision of history that the other side have been so effective in achievingâhistory told from their side of this chamber at leastâthose sorts of figures are not even raised.</para>
</talk.start>
</interjection>
<para>Household credit has moderated. It has been below the 10-year average throughout this year with a growth rate of 14.2 per cent. The fact that the member for Lilley cannot hide is that unemployment is 5.1 per cent and not in double figures and that home loan interest rates are 7.3 per cent and not in the high teens or in some cases even higher, as they were in his time in government. A household with a $400,000 mortgage would be today $1,000 a month better off than they were in March 1996. Those are the figures and those are the indicators that are truly relevant to families in Australia.</para>
<para>In the time I have left, I will move to some meaningful comparisons. Let us pick a time in history that you would rather have been in in this country. Whether you look at the deficit, inflation, interest rates, unemployment or the budget balance, you see they are all far superior now. Take any time under a government of the now opposition. Take the government of 1995 or 1990 or even 1986. Let us make an international comparison, because such comparisons have been lacking on the other side. Take the enormous US budget deficit: the government is held responsible for three-quarters of that. In Australia the government amount is only a very small portion of our total national debt. Let us have a look at some figures produced from taxing wages in 1996 and compare them to those in 2004. Take a family with no children. Where did they rank in 1996? Behind Belgium, Canada, Luxembourg, Switzerland and the United States. They now rank No. 1. We rank No. 1 for married families with two children with household incomes of 100 per cent of average weekly ordinary time earnings. Let us take a family with earnings even higher. In fact, we can take any cut we want of the figuresâsingle, married or otherwise, children or no childrenâand Australia is ranking No. 1 or No. 2 in the OECD. They are the figures that I think would really matter to families. They are very meaningful evidence of improvement over the nine years of a coalition government.</para>
<para>Australia has faced numerous challenges. We know of those. We have performed well against the OECD. We have a strong minerals sector that is looking to turn around the current account deficit. This opposition failed to translate improvements to Australian families and it failed to lift living conditions for Australian families. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âby leaveâThe first of the proposed works is intended to provide 80 on-base houses to meet current and future Defence Force accommodation requirements at the Puckapunyal military area. The Defence Housing Authority intends that delivery of the new homes will occur progressively between February and November 2006. The estimated cost of the project is $19.6 million. The proposed works will comprise the construction of 80 houses and associated stormwater drainage, communications, sewerage reticulation, gas and electrical services.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The committee visited the site of the proposed works and conducted a public hearing at Puckapunyal on 20 April 2005. After exploring a variety of issues relating to the need for the new homesâconsultation with stakeholders, the provision of services and amenities and the environmental management of the projectâthe committee was satisfied that the works would meet all stated project objectives and would represent an improved level of amenity for defence families. The committee therefore recommends that the works proceed at the estimated cost of $19.6 million.</para>
<para>The committeeâs fifth report of 2005 addresses works required to enhance defence research capability in respect of explosive ordnance and weaponry. This research is necessary to support the work of the Australian Defence Force and associated organisations in ensuring national security. At present, research into weapons and ordnance is conducted at the Defence Science and Technology Organisation facility at Edinburgh, South Australia, and the Proof and Experimental Establishment at Port Wakefield. Safety requirements at these sites currently limit investigations to small-size ordnance. The proposed work would address this deficiency by enabling research into a wider range of explosive ordnance and weapons.</para>
<para>Work elements to meet Defenceâs objectives consist of a control room for the remote monitoring and operation of ordnance breakdown equipment in other areas of the facility; a cutting building for the radiography and remotely controlled cutting of ordnance; a disassembly building for the safe radiographic examination and breakdown of explosive ordnance; two explosive ordnance storehouses; a storage building to house general equipment; engineering services, including power, water, sewerage, communications and sealed roads; and security provisions comprising fencing and a type 1 security system.</para>
<para>In the course of its inquiry, the committee was assured that the proposed works would take account of all necessary occupational and public safety requirements and would also entail appropriate security measures. The committee was also satisfied at the level of consultation conducted by the department with the community and other stakeholders, including the execution of land acquisition procedures. In respect of environmental impacts, members were pleased to learn that the works would result in improvements to the habitat of an endangered local bird species and, further, that the Proof and Experimental Establishment site had met four of the eight criteria for inclusion on the Ramsar list of wetlands of international importance. Having thoroughly examined the proposal, the committee recommends that the construction of an ordnance breakdown facility for the Defence Science and Technology Organisation at Port Wakefield, South Australia, proceed at the estimated cost of $8.4 million.</para>
<para>I would like to extend my thanks once again to my committee colleagues, the secretariat, the Hansard staff of this parliament and all those who helped with the inquiries. I commend the reports to the House.</para>

<para>âby leaveâI rise to supplement the comments made by the Chair of the Public Works Committee on the two proposals put before the parliament: the development of on-base housing for Defence at Puckapunyal, Victoria and the Defence Science and Technology Organisation Ordnance Breakdown Facility, Port Wakefield, South Australia. It is important to note that the Public Works Committee has a very heavy schedule. The members of the committee work hard to ensure that the expenditure of the Commonwealth in this area is properly examined. I was fortunate to act as chair, in the chairâs absence, and to preside over hearings on both these projects. The statement outlined by the member for Pearce is a proper reflection of the committeeâs findings on these proposals. The member for Pearce may have mentioned the members who were directly involved but I thank the member for Scullin and Senator Ferguson and Senator Forshaw, who attended Puckapunyal with me and had a good opportunity to see what was going on there in terms of the new housing. The proposal will ensure that the defence personnel have better accommodation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>On the other matter, I again thank the member for Scullin and Senator Ferguson, who attended Port Wakefield with me to examine the plans. Although these two projects were not particularly controversial, the departments undertook a lot of planning and due process to ensure that these projects will be done properly. On both occasions the committee found that the departments had put together reasonable proposals that the committee was in a position to accept. Therefore I support wholeheartedly the comments made by the chair of the committee, the member for Pearce. I also thank Vivienne Courto and Ray Knight from the secretariat, who attended on both occasions, and Hansard, who again did an excellent job.</para>

<para>âI rise to support the <inline ref="R2352">Aged Care Amendment (Extra Service) Bill 2005</inline>. The measures contained within it give effect to announcements made in the recent budget. It addresses two very important factors in the aged care sector: the desire for greater choice and the need for us to alleviate unnecessary red tape. Caring for the elderly in our community is one of the most important responsibilities of government. I remember visiting nursing homes in the late 1980s and my memory recalls dark and unhappy places. Under the reforms that have been instituted by this government aged care facilities have been vastly improved.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I spend a lot of time visiting aged care facilities in my electorate of Stirling and I have been very pleased to host the hardworking Minister for Ageing on many occasions at those facilities as well. The facilities I have visited have been vastly different from the facilities that I would have visited 15 or so years ago. I have been heartened by the variety and standard of accommodation and the commitment of the work force within the industry to provide the highest standards of care. One provider summed it up for me when she said she always judged the standards in her aged care facility by thinking how she wants her parents to be treatedâand I think this is testament to her and to the facility that she runs.</para>
<para>I can sense a very similar attitude in many of the facilities I have visited where I have enjoyed talking to the residents and to the hardworking staff who look after them. A fortnight ago I attended the blessing and opening of a new wing at the Hellenic Community Aged Care facility in Dianella. It is a place I have visited many times. As the name suggests, the facility caters forâalthough not exclusivelyâthe Greek community. It is a facility that is heavily supported by that community and one of which they are very proud. A large group of prominent members of that community had contributed substantially to the upgrade of the facility and I would like to acknowledge their efforts here today. It is a real testament to the strength of the Greek community in my electorate of Stirling and it is also a good indication of their commitment to caring for one another.</para>
<para>The staff at Hellenic Community Aged Care are a prime example of the commitment that can be shown by workers in the industry to the highest standards of care which I spoke of earlier. They create a friendly and caring environment that is evident to anyone who has taken the time to visit. It is a commitment that I have noted in other visits to aged care facilities in my electorate that I made before and after the election. I was struck by the enthusiasm of management and staff at Meath House in Trigg. The CEO of the organisation recounted to me a tale of a new resident who seemed less than happy to have moved in. She personally made the new resident the breakfast of his choice at a time of his choosing in an effort to make him feel at home. It is this willingness to provide a proper home for older Australians that continues to impress me as I move around my electorate.</para>
<para>In the diverse community of Stirling, aged care is an issue that people are passionate about. Children rightly want to ensure that their parents, when moving into care, are looked after as well as they would be if they were at home. In particular, we all want to make sure that people have access to the facilities and services that meet their individual needs and desires. The Aged Care Amendment (Extra Service) Bill 2005 is about ensuring that aged care is flexible enough to meet the needs and desires of particular individuals. It fulfils one of the Howard governmentâs commitments and also recognises that aged care providers need greater flexibility to respond to the growing demands of their clients.</para>
<para>Before I go into the specific provisions of the bill, I would like to comment on the value of extra service places to older Australians and their families. Essentially, extra service places allow people who are in aged care to access additional services above and beyond the excellent care already offered by nursing homes. In practical terms this means that a nursing home resident can pay additional fees if they want to access things like cable television, meals in a restaurant style environment, their own phone or tea and coffee making facilities, or to participate in activities that meet their interests. These are facilities and services not normally offered in nursing homes but are the kinds of things that many people want and are willing to pay their care service provider to arrange.</para>
<para>The electorate of Stirling is fortunate enough to have an aged care service, Shawford Lodge, run by Aegis Aged Care, which will be providing these extra levels of service to their residents. The facility has recently received an approval to offer service to 12 high-care places. Shawford Lodge is another example of excellence in aged care within my electorate. It is in the process of expanding what is already a first-class facility and I have been privileged to have spent time there on several occasions. It is another facility where I have hosted the Minister for Ageing.</para>
<para>Aged care is one of the great success stories of this government. Successive ministersâmost of whom are still members of the House todayâhave taken tough decisions to reform the sector and have provided massive further investments in infrastructure to cater for our ageing population. I acknowledge the members for Pearce, Mackellar, Menzies and now the member for Curtin for the part they have all played in creating better facilities for older Australians. Ageing is not an easy portfolio but the Howard governmentâs record on it is extraordinary, culminating in last yearâs budget when an extra $2.2 billion was invested in the sector and the process of implementing the recommendations from the Hogan review began.</para>
<para>Sadly, the Labor Party during the last nine years have shown absolutely no interest in this area, apart from the times they have exploited it for political gain. The Labor Partyâs neglect of ageing Australians comes despite the fact that we have an ageing population and that the issue remains one of the most important for Australiaâs future. They seem unaware that by 2040 there will be around seven million Australians over the age of 65, which will amount to 25 per cent of the population. It is therefore one of the most fundamental challenges that we as legislators need to address. Where we going to accommodate everyone? What services are going to be required? Where is the capital going to come from for the expansion of those services?</para>
<para>Fortunately, the coalition have not avoided these questions or shirked our responsibilities in this area. When we came to office in 1996, the government spent around $3 billion per annum on aged care. Next financial year we will invest well over $7 billion. That is an enormous increaseâalthough challenges still remain. One of them is to reduce the red-tape burden on providers and let them get on with providing care. The bill before the House today gives effect to that desire by removing the requirement to reapply for extra service status every five years. I know from discussions I have had with providers that they have felt that the high level of regulation of the extra service program has stood in the way of its expansion.</para>
<para>Under current arrangements providers need to reapply for extra service status every five years regardless of whether or not they have had any problems during that time. It is a time-consuming and expensive process and acts as a deterrent to raising capital for expansion. It is vital that we remove these barriers to expansion because investment in infrastructure will be a crucial element in catering for the future demand that will result from the demographic changes that I outlined earlier.</para>
<para>The Commonwealth is already doing its part and investing heavily in this area, to the tune of over $1 billion. But further investment through other sources will still be required to meet demand. We need to ensure that we give providers every opportunity to raise capital to build new facilities and to refurbish older ones. The passage of this bill is the result of a coalition government who are prepared to listen to providers and act when we identify changes that will be of benefit to our community. I commend this bill to the House.</para>

<para>âin replyâThe <inline ref="R2352">Aged Care Amendment (Extra Service) Bill 2005</inline> implements changes to the Aged Care Act 1997 announced in the 2005-06 federal budget. In summing up the debate this afternoon I can say it is evident, at least to the last two speakers, the members for Bowman and Stirling, that this legislation further demonstrates the governmentâs strong commitment to ensuring a robust and viable aged care sector for the future where the element of choice is a key ingredient for both residents and providers of aged care services. An aged care service with extra service status allows residents to choose and pay for a higher than average level of hotel type services, including in accommodation and food but particularly in non-care services. This legislation removes the requirement that providers of extra service reapply every five years for renewal of extra service status. In doing so it will both decrease the amount of red tape for providers and increase their ability to access capital for rebuilding or refurbishing, enhancing their ability to undertake long-term planning.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Through this legislation, the Australian government will remove the expiry date for extra service status, remove provisions covering the renewal of extra service status and remove provisions covering the continuation of extra service for certain residents in services where extra service has expired, while ensuring that extra service continues to be provided for those residents who are in homes where extra service has been continued prior to 1 July 2005. This legislation will make consequential amendments to the provisions in the Aged Care Act 1997. The Australian government will also make similar changes to the extra service principles made under section 96.1 of the Aged Care Act. So we are decreasing the level of red tape for the providers of extra service aged care.</para>
<para>These changes will ultimately provide greater choice for aged care residents through expansion of the extra service program, but this does not come at the expense of those who cannot afford to pay. Residents who cannot afford to pay for extra services will still be able to access quality care because of the safeguards this government has in place. Only homes which have extra service status can charge extra services fees and a bond for high care. Extra service status is only approved where the provider can demonstrate that the home will offer hotel type services significantly above the average aged care home and where the provider has a very good record of compliance.</para>
<para>Other requirements for extra service homes include compulsory accreditation and certification. In particular, extra service status cannot be approved where it would unreasonably reduce access to residential aged care by concessional residents or other older Australians. A maximum of 15 per cent of all residential aged care places may have extra service. All other homes have their fees and charges capped under the Aged Care Act 1997 and cannot increase their fees for extra services.</para>
<para>This legislation delivers another measure announced in the 2005-06 budget which will have the dual outcomes of decreasing regulation and increasing the standards in residential aged care. I thank the speakers in this debate: the member for Lalor, for the opposition, and the members for Bowman and Stirling, both elected in October 2004, who have already demonstrated a great interest in aged care and aged care needs in their electorates in Queensland and Western Australia respectively. By their support of this bill, they recognise that this legislation further demonstrates the Australian governmentâs strong commitment to ensuring a robust and viable aged care sector now and into the future which provides a choice in high-quality care to older Australians.</para>

</talker>
<para>âThe opposition supports the second reading of the <inline ref="R2362">Maritime Transport Security Amendment Bill 2005</inline>. It amends the Maritime Transport Security Act 2003 in respect of two issues which are summarised in the explanatory memorandum. First, the bill extends coverage of that act to offshore oil and gas facilities located within the territorial sea, in Australiaâs exclusive economic zone and on the continental shelf and ensures that all regulated offshore oil and gas facility operators and other prescribed offshore industry participants develop and comply with an offshore security plan based on a security assessment of each regulated facility. Second, the bill amends the act to allow for the introduction of maritime security identification cards. The cards will be introduced to cover unmonitored personnel who are required to access what are called maritime security zones, which may be areas in ports, areas surrounding ships or areas on ships.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The card scheme will require the prospective holder to submit to a check of their background. These background checks will comprise a criminal history check undertaken by the Australian Federal Police and a security assessment by ASIO. If required, it may also be necessary to conduct an unlawful noncitizen check by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. These cards will only be issued to persons who have successfully met background checking requirements. Of course, members will be familiar, as a result of the debate in the chamber over the last two days, with matters concerning a similar security card scheme that applies in our aviation industry, but all members will be anxious to ensure that the scheme operates successfully and not, as we would submit in respect of the aviation industry, with so many flaws in it.</para>
<para>Before I begin a discussion of the bill, it is appropriate to appreciate the environment in which we are placed as a nation and, in particular, the significance of our maritime environment. The threat of terrorism to Australia and the perceptions we have of such risks have to a large extent been shaped by recent global events including the September 11 attacks in New York and Washington and the Madrid bombings in Spain, but it was of course the bombings in Bali that drove home the devastating reality and proximity of the threat of global terrorism to Australia and Australian interests. Unfortunately, subsequent to the events in Bali, we have seen that with the bombing of Australiaâs embassy in Indonesia.</para>
<para>To a large degree, Australiaâs unique geographic location in the world has shielded us from some of the excesses of interstate conflicts and acts of global terrorism but, again, with the Bali bombings as an indication of the activities of terrorist based organisations in our region, we cannot dismiss the prospect. Indeed, when I was in the United States last year the experts there repeatedly stated, âYou guys are living in a dangerous neighbourhood,â in terms of the prospect of exposure to terrorism in the South-East Asian region. But Australiaâs unique geography as an island continent certainly makes the maritime zone particularly important to us. Unfortunately, it is a zone that is particularly vulnerable.</para>
<para>One must always guard against inflating the reality of the threat posed by terrorism so that our response is reasonable, balanced and sensible and does not, by overreactionâeither by breaking down our systems, structures and rule of law and so forth or by imposing unrealistic and unreasonable expense on participantsâitself damage either our body politic or our economy. But it is worth noting that in April 2004 ASIO reported on the threat of terrorism to Australiaâs shipping and port infrastructure. They stated in that report, in summary, that the al-Qaeda network in South-East Asia have stated an intent to attack Australian interests and that they have the capacity to conduct acts of terrorism, including maritime terrorism. ASIO stated that al-Qaedaâs capacity to conduct terrorist attacks continues to develop, but they concluded that the threat to most of Australiaâs port facilities and infrastructure was rated as low, but that some, which for obvious reasons have been left unidentified, were rated at a medium level of threat. These are issues that cannot be ignored.</para>
<para>In terms of terrorism support and operational infrastructure in South-East Asia, it is unfortunate that terrorist organisations clearly still have access, as a result of their economic circumstances, to a population that is substantially underprivileged, has its own grievances and is openly exploited by those who promote extremist views. Unfortunately, they also have access to resources, frequently from other parts of the world. Those groups that we are familiar with include Jemaah Islamiah, which continues to flourish. Since 1997 the al-Qaeda network in South-East Asia has planned and conducted terrorist attacks against maritime personnel and infrastructure on land and at sea. Indeed, as I have mentioned, our embassy has been a target.</para>
<para>Since 11 September 2001, al-Qaeda and associated groups have consistently indicated that the energy sector in particular is a target. They see the energy sector as being particularly vital to world economic prosperity. Al-Qaeda have articulated plans to âcripple the petroleum industryâ with sea based attacks against oil tankers, and the maritime capabilities can be developed quickly. We recognise that the use of speedboats packed with weapons or explosives which can be used to evade law enforcement authorities and with a suicide bomber in control unfortunately has the potential to cause great destruction, particularly to our offshore oil and gas facilities. There have also been attacks on oil facilities and personnel in the Middle East, such as the attempts on the al Basra and Khor al Amaya oil terminals of southern Iraq on 24 April 2004.</para>
<para>Al-Qaeda has in fact identified Australia as a legitimate target on seven separate occasions and has carried out threats and actions intended to damage Western economies and in particular, as I have mentioned, the oil and gas industry as a vital part of Western economies. The oil and gas sector in Australia brings in excess of $18 billion annually into our economy. The predominance of a small number of offshore oil and gas installations supplying Australiaâs domestic and overseas energy markets makes these facilities critical elements of national security infrastructure and attractive targets for terrorists in the current security sensitive environment. Because of regional and global economic independence, terrorist events in one region can impose significant flow-on costs and cause damage to other areas of the global economy. Countries that fail to combat terrorism and ensure the safety of trade can expect to incur significant costs in trade and investment opportunities.</para>
<para>Numerous studies have been undertaken to assess the economic risks from maritime terrorism. In terms of maritime trade, for example, one study found that closing down all United States ports for a period of seven to 10 days would cost the United States economy some $75 billion. By way of comparison, Melbourneâs ports handle some $70 billion in trade every year and support some 20,000 jobs, while Sydneyâs ports handle in the order of $45Â½ billion in international and domestic trade and generate more than 17,000 jobs.</para>
<para>In 2003, the Economic Analytical Unit of the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade produced a report on the overall cost of terrorism, with particular emphasis on maritime terrorism. It found that, while the cost of unchecked terrorism is significant for all economies, terrorism could pose a disproportionately high cost for the economies of the countries in our regionâin particular, those that are continuing to develop.</para>
<para>The study found that most developing APEC economies depend more heavily on trade flows, particularly with the United States and OPEC economies; many regional developing economies rely on receiving strong foreign direct investment, which would be at risk from an increase in terrorist activities; and insurance premiums may be higher on cargoes and vessels travelling to and from developing countries because of uncertainty about the adequacy of local security procedures. We must bear in mind that the majority of our cargo comes through the regions which are exposed to those sorts of threats. The secure flow of maritime trade and production is therefore essential to the economic and national security interests of Australia, the region and indeed the globe.</para>
<para>Australiaâs offshore oil and gas industry is currently not covered by the act, and therefore is not operating in a manner that is consistent with Australiaâs maritime security regime. That regime requires certain maritime industry participants, such as ships and port operators, to develop and implement risk based security plans that contain details of access controls, maritime security zones and protocols for dealing with maritime security incidents and threats. At present, there are no formal mechanisms for responding to a potential terrorist attack. There are also no adequate mechanisms for dealing with unlawful access to offshore oil and gas facilities. The bill will bring the security of offshore oil and gas facilities in line with existing maritime security arrangements, providing a regime for these facilities to reduce the risk of unlawful interference.</para>
<para>There will be two main industry groups affected by the bill. The first are the operators of the offshore facilities. The second will be the various service providers to these facilitiesânotably, helicopter charter operators and ship based equipment stores supply services. Obviously, those services have access to these offshore installations. Under the bill, offshore oil and gas facilities will be required to develop security plans, as I have indicated, that consider the risk-assessed needs of the operators, including the special nature and location of the facilities.</para>
<para>The offshore facilities vary from conventional steel fixed platforms and concrete gravity platforms through to miniplatforms, monotowers, monopods and minipods, floating storage and offtake units and floating production storage and offtake units. These facilities will primarily be to the north and, in particular, north-west of Australia. These plans will be submitted to Department of Transport and Regional Services for approval, and they should complement existing safety plans that operate on those platforms. DOTARS will be responsible for regulating the offshore oil and gas industry security plans and for auditing these facilities to ensure they comply with the regulatory regime established by the act and the regulations. The bill puts in place the same risk based security planning for offshore oil and gas service providersâthat is, contractors of specialist offshore related services or port related services, as I have mentioned, such as helicopter and supply vessel service providers.</para>
<para>DOTARS have indicated that they expect to receive 40 security plans and that they anticipate the cost of developing a security plan will be in the order of $50,000 for each facility. In accordance with the stated government policy that security is the cost of doing business, DOTARS have confirmed that industry will bear the cost of preparing those plans and that DOTARS will recover the cost of dealing with them. DOTARS have also indicated that they expect to receive draft security plans from facilities by 1 July 2005 and expect to have the security regime in place by 1 October 2005. In that sense the government claimsâand the opposition recognisesâsome urgency in the passage of this legislation.</para>
<para>Under the bill, access to what are called maritime security zonesâwhich may be areas in ports, areas surrounding ships, or areas on shipsâare generally managed by each individual port or ship operator. However, there is no common legislative requirement for how these operators should ensure that only properly authorised persons can access these zones. At present, therefore, there is no regime in place that requires background checking of people working in Australian ports, ships and offshore oil and gas facilities, as is the current situation, as I have mentioned, in the aviation industry and in the maritime industry in comparable Western countries.</para>
<para>The security card identification scheme will be a nationally consistent identification card that states that the holder has met the background checking requirements to work in a designated maritime security zone. The card, however, is not an access control card. Anyone who requires unmonitored access to a maritime security zone will be required to have a maritime security card. They will include, among others, dock workers, truck drivers and rig workers. Applicants apply for the card from an issuing body. Private companies, employee trade unions or industry associations, among others, are entitled to apply to be an issuing body as long as they have the capacity to perform the regulatory function.</para>
<para>Through publicised fact sheets the department has indicated that the issuing bodies will not be given access to personal information gathered through background checking; rather, following the background checks conducted by the appropriate government agency, the relevant issuing body will only be advised as to whether the employee can be issued with an MSIC or not. We understand that the estimated cost of issuing the MSIC is in the order of $40 to $60, including the cost of conducting relevant background checks. The legislation provides that regulations will be made to enable the issuing body to recover the costs of issuing the cards. Although the framework for issuing the cards will be set out in regulations, these regulations, unfortunately, have yet to be issued. Despite assurances by the government that the opposition would be provided with, at the very least, a draft version of these regulations, we are yet to see the content or scope of the regulations. Obviously we would be assisted in the consideration of these measures if we could have access to at least the draft documents as expeditiously as possible.</para>
<para>At present, the bill merely allows the bodies that will be responsible for issuing MSICs to recover the costs involved in administering the process, including background checks. Again, however, we are yet to see how these costs will be passed on to employees who require security checksâmany of whom, of course, will have worked in these industries for some years. MSICs are issued after the completion of several background checks, as I have indicated, including a criminal background check by the AFP and a security assessment by ASIO. If required, an unlawful noncitizen check will be conducted by DIMIA. As yet, we have not been informed as to the level of criminality that will prevent an individual from receiving an MSIC or had a chance to consider the appropriateness of how this level of criminality is determined. Of course, today in question time there was controversy as to whether or not a person who has served some eight years in prison for drug trafficking should appropriately have been issued with an aviation security card. These are issues we would like to contemplate and explore with respect to the appropriate level of offence that applies to the issuing of the maritime security card.</para>
<para>While we understand that those unions that have predominant coverage of offshore platforms have been consulted, there are concerns that a number of smaller unions representing individual trades may not have been consultedâalthough we recognise that common issues will obviously arise with respect to all unions and their members. In the context of revelations emerging around security failings at airports this week, it is worth noting, however, that the mere issuing of these security cards is no panacea against the potential for unlawful interference at an Australian port facility, ship or offshore platform. If there is simple access by a swiping system without face-to-face verification, obviously the system will be exposed to the theft or transfer of cards.</para>
<para>Given the concerns that we have raised, it is the oppositionâs view that, while a second reading of the bill should be supported in the House, the bill should be referred to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee for a short inquiry to examine, among other things, the concerns I have just raised. We will therefore be seeking a short turnaround time for the committee to conduct the inquiry so that we can ensure the expeditious passage of the bill, which we recognise is important legislation. Again, the inquiry itself and the resolution of these concerns would obviously be assisted by the government providing a copy of the draft regulations that will accompany this legislation as soon as possible.</para>
<para>The governmentâs principal approach to maritime security protection, it must be said, is by legislative and regulatory means. Essentially, it is a light-touch approach where the legislative and regulatory framework is set by the government, but how that is complied with is essentially up to the private operators. In 2003 the opposition welcomed the passage of the Maritime Transport Security Act in order that Australia could develop and implement a nationally consistent maritime security framework. However, a point we repeatedly make is that legislation and regulation alone are incapable of preventing security threats and breaches at our ports, on our ships and on our oil and gas facilities.</para>
<para>We note that in April this year the Australian Strategic Policy Institute published a damning report into the state of Australiaâs security arrangements entitled <inline font-style="italic">Future unknown: The terrorist threat to Australian maritime security</inline>. This report identified a number of failings: a lack of specialised port police as seen operating in the United States and United Kingdom; an absence of a comprehensive security framework for the supply chain of container transportation across the Australian continent; inadequate security checks of crews from foreign flagged vessels arriving in Australian portsâin 2002, a total of 115,000 foreign crew arrived; an absence of a nationwide approach to manage the security of high-risk ships, such as foreign naval vessels and ships carrying dangerous goods like ammonium nitrate and other petrochemical substances; a lack of coordination between relevant agencies including Customs, Navy, the Department of Transport and Regional Services and state agencies; a lack of consistency between state and territory jurisdictions and their legislation covering maritime security; and a lack of critical information and data to properly assess the vulnerability of Australian ports.</para>
<para>Despite its consistent and often shameless âtough on securityâ oratory, the government is undeniably failing in these key structural areas. The concerns raised by the ASPI are not new; federal Labor has been highlighting maritime security problems month after month, year after year, but the concerns are now clearly articulated by an expert body specifically established by the government to provide frank strategic advice.</para>
<para>The only response to this report that has come from the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services was:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... it was unlikely the Government would adopt the recommendations ... weâre continuing to look for any holes that might emerge in our maritime security net.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">We believe it is high time the government not only looked for these holes in our maritime security arrangements but acknowledged that the holes exist and that they constitute a significant threat to Australiaâs national security. The government must listen to this independent, expert advice and act swiftly to remedy the litany of threats to our maritime security. We need a commitment from the government that they will address these problems and assure the Australian public that their borders are secure and that the government are on the job.</para>
<para>In that context, we note that the Inspector of Transport Security, who was removed from office in February this year to conduct the Rau inquiry, also had responsibility in respect of maritime security when that office was originally established. As part of the national transport security plan it was stated that the mandate of that office would be to investigate major incidents and systematic transport security weaknesses to ensure security vulnerabilities were identified and addressed. That plan talks of a protective role and there is probably no-one better in Australia than former Federal Police Commissioner Mick Palmer to undertake that role, yet for the last four months, and despite the cost of his office being some $400,000 per annum, he has not been performing that function because he has been putting out other bushfires for the government in the form of the Rau inquiry and the immigration scandal that that matter involves.</para>
<para>Given that this regulatory regime is so light in touchâwith the obligation for implementing schemes being essentially on the operatorsâan effective inspection regime is absolutely crucial to security. Moreover it must be one that is at armâs length from the government. The minister can talk about the resources of the department of transportâs security wingâand certainly our inspection of that facility indicates that it is staffed by extremely competent peopleâbut the bottom line is that these are issues of immense concern to our national interest and should be investigated without fear or favour by an independent office holder such as the Inspector of Transport Security. If, as a result of political pressure, the minister has dumbed down or neutered that role to be a post-fact roleâthat is, investigating a terrorist event after it has occurredâwe sensibly ask the minister to revise his assessment. We ask the officials and experts that advise the minister to say, âListen, if we want to ensure that everyone is doing the very best they possibly can in this area we must restore that independence.â</para>
<para>There has been some progress in maritime security, with the creation of the Joint Offshore Protection Command. The Minister for Foreign Affairs seemed to have been given the brief, prior to the last election, of ridiculing, with all the fanfare that he could muster, Laborâs plans to establish an Australian coastguard. But irrespective of whether or not you agreed with Laborâs plan for a coastguard there was and there remains a need for greater coordination of our maritime security zone.</para>
<para>Currently we have eight Customs vessels and 15âit will be 14ânaval patrol vessels. Each of the eight Customs vessels comes under the command chain of the Australian Customs Service and obviously the naval vessels come under the command structure of the Royal Australian Navy. Essentially, under Laborâs plan they had their resources seconded from requests from the coastguard but in this case they will receive requests from the Joint Offshore Protection Command.Â  If that structure is to work effectively as a joint offshore protection command it seems logical that it should be given statutory recognition, and any vessel, crew or officer seconded to undertake work for the command should sensibly be under the control of the command.</para>
<para>We recognise that the quality of senior officers in the Joint Offshore Protection Command is exceptional but they should be given the authority to have a system of protection. The fact that it is based on the fragmented laws and agency structures that we still have in our maritime zone is unsatisfactory. Whether or not the government, for political reasons, disputes the need for the establishment of a coastguard, this needs to be refined. It needs to be coordinated and responsibility needs to be given to an authority with independent statutory control and command. Unless and until we do that there is always going to be a risk that security incidents fall between the competing responsibilities of respective agencies. In summary, we are talking about words on pieces of paper. We support these measures but our point is that words are not enoughâwe need detailed coordinated action to protect our maritime zone.</para>

<para>âI welcome the fact that the opposition sees the value of these proposals which, while they are fairly specific, are basically designed to address the problems of the enemy within. Of course, that is one of the most potent means of terrorist operations. If a single operative gets into a position of trust they can do immeasurable harm and undertake damaging activities, including destruction.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The member for Barton made comments about other issues of security which are contemporary. In relation to Sydney airport employees, who are virtually totally unionised, it did strike me from the beginning how tight the issue was that months ago, maybe years ago, the ALP were unable to stand up in this place and advise the government of what was going on. It was people who were members of a union, whether or not they wanted to be or whether or not they were officials, who were dealing in drugs and other matters that could affect security at Sydney airport, because it is virtually a no ticket, no start environment. Somebody who was honest and certainly not a crook knew about this. But what is the culture in that place that resulted in nothing coming out?</para>
<para>I am not having a shot at anyone. The Labor Party might ask themselves why they didnât tell us, if only for the purpose of giving them a political advantage. Why is it that in that area of employment, where people could not possibly fail to know that serious laws of Australia were being brokenâlaws that might extend to issues of terrorismâa culture existed in which nobody dobbed anybody in? That issue has to be resolved. We are well aware that most state legislation still prevents universal use of video cameras in workplaces. This of course should be a proponent of the issues before us today, which specifically deal with the enemy from within. I would like to make a few comments in due course about the enemy outside. To quote from the explanatory memorandum:</para>

</quote>
<para class="block">That second part more particularly deals with the enemy from within and raises all sorts of questions. A question was asked today as to whether it is appropriate to have a zip card entry to a secure area when the person carrying that zip card might not be the person to whom it was issued. I think that is a major issue where personal security is involved. Even a PIN is not appropriate, because it can be handed over. Maybe the tokens that we now have associated with our computers might go some way to answering that, although of course a person could even hand that over. So it comes down to the new biosecurity issues that are coming forward. I am reading a bookâit is fictitiousâin which someone who can use their eye to get through a particular door has his eye cut out and is killed. Is that practical? I donât know. Certainly the book suggests it was and the crooks got in.</para>
<para>One might wonder just where some of these security issues end. When there are people who are silly enough to blow themselves up, apparently to get an early pass into heaven, taking with them innocent people, one wonders where the next threat might exist in Australia. It is interesting to note that this legislation contains provisions for costs to be acquitted by the owners of particular facilities. I am surprised that legislation is required for the undertaking of these processes. In this day and age one would think that their insurance companies would be very interested in this situation and would demand extremely high levels of security to protect their investment in facilities of this nature and possibly their business cash flows. So I think it is quite appropriate that these types of security measures be paid for by those involved. Not only does it pose a very significant risk to national security and the national economy, but also in a purely business sense one would think that the operators would want to take every step to protect their interest. I did make a note to consider, as a broader comment on this legislation, that long-held Returned and Services League motto that the price of peace is eternal vigilance. I think this legislation is a progression of that in terms of the governmentâs intention.</para>
<para>Returning to identity cards, I have talked about compliance arrangements where a person might achieve access to a place through another person lending them their card, perhaps because they are running late or they do not want to turn up. That is the old time-clock syndrome. We also have to look at ease of identity theft issues. That has always worried me. I participated in the Australian identity card debate and pointed out just how simply people could steal your identity from an identity cardâcertainly as we knew them in those daysâand use it to access your creditworthiness, steal money from your bank account and break certain laws in presenting themselves as you. There are so many issues related to this matter.</para>
<para>I am also going to take this opportunity to talk briefly about external threats. The member for Barton talked about people loading up a speedboat with explosives. The typical freighter en route today would have perhaps one person on its bridge while it is on automatic pilot. I have had examples of crayfish fishermen nearly being run over in that circumstance, while they were at anchor. It means that only one person needs to be on the bridge and that person could decide to drive straight through an oil rig with a 100,000 tonne vessel.</para>
<para>These sorts of issues are also of grave importance. While I do not know the extent to which they are addressed in the north-west, I think some work is being done in Bass Strait where rigs have radar so they can have some idea of what is happening. Historically, there have been a couple of scares of a non-terrorist nature in Bass Strait. Again, what a worry it would be if the radio operator was not at work and you were screaming at them that they were on a course for your fixed asset.</para>
<para>These sorts of issues have got to be considered. I once visited some high-tech people in this town of Canberra who had invented and manufactured a phased radar for which they received a contract, I think in the Red Sea or from a nearby nation. Sitting in Canberra, they were able to monitor the working of that equipment and show me where all the boats were. They were sailing around Bahrain. If we have that sort of technology in Australia, it would seem to me that these rigs should beâif they are not alreadyâequipped with that sort of equipment to better address the outside threat.</para>
<para>The government currently has a tender out for coastal surveillance and I have had representations on that matter. I am disappointed that our tender did not commence as a call not so much for expressions of interest but for technological solutions. The representations I have received are from people who say, âWe have a better way of doing your coastal surveillance with unmanned vehicles that donât exist yet. But we are confident that we can provide this from a scientific perspective. We have financial backers who would like to be involved in this but they want to know whether there is going to be a market for the invention.â As things are managed presently, they are just going round and round in circles. I imagine that they would offer a substantially more intense service at a substantially lower cost. But the tender processes which have been in place for many decades do not, in a world of high technology, first say, âLook, we really need to know how best to do it from the private sector.â We will end up with a situation where tenders rely on people having very standard equipment for the purpose of conducting this surveillance, wherever it might be. As you would gather, I have made some representations to senior members of our party that they might consider in the future. I cannot influence the present, and I do not want to, on behalf of the people who have made these representations. It just struck me that they had a wonderful idea.</para>
<para>We need to have a different approach in some of these areas so that we can first find out what people think they can do. I guess there is some relativity to the government spending $150 million on the new strike fighter. One could say that that is virtually an investment in blue sky if we do not buy the aircraft in the end. But it is an example of how we might get better surveillance, and certainly better than a coastguard would provide. Without being smart about the coastguard and giving it other names, for such a small population we have such a huge coastline compared to the United States. I imagine their longest borders are land based. They have an entirely different situation to us and a huge population to support it. It is my view that better solutions exist and they can be managed by present-day authorities.</para>
<para>I support this legislation as a logical step. I note that the member for Barton was interested to obtain more detail about the regulations. I have always been in favour of the parliament being able to look at the regulations. We seem to have a habit of not doing that. In that regard, I sincerely hope that they deal closely with the details of the efficiency of identity documents. I do not think that the things that hang around peopleâs necks at the moment are particularly reliable. They are possibly the best that are typically available. I have already pointed out how difficult it is to upgrade them. These are circumstances in which many people could be killed and in the case of our offshore oil facilities there could be terrible environmental devastation. It could all be done by a very limited number of people or in ways that I have just mentioned. It does not have to be a speedboat full of explosives, as the Americans learned on 9/11, when four quite innocuous transport aeroplanes suddenly became flying bombs. An ordinary commercial vessel in the hands of a terrorist is much the same.</para>
<para>I have speculated before how easy it would be to invade Sydney if you had a regular tourist vesselâa cruise linerâand on one trip, without telling anyone, you filled it up with troops, pulled up in its normal berthing place in Sydney and they all came running out. I wonder how Australia would deal with that situation.</para>

<para>âNo, do not worry. When one looks at security and the things we accept, it is not that long ago that the trend around the world was to have no-visa entryâeverybody was welcome; they were tourists. Suddenly we find ourselves having to make giant steps in the opposite direction. This, of course, represents part of that. The government has definitely taken a positive step.

<para>I do repeat my comment that I hope the Labor Party, with their very close affiliation with the trade union movement, are saying to them, âThis is a job for the parliament. We cannot continue to have people arguing about privacy.â There is reference to this in this legislation. If you are in one of these highly sensitive situations, I am not really sure how much privacy you are entitled to, unfortunately, whatever the percentage that would never do the wrong thing. One can only say of 60,000 workers at Sydney airport that, if the circumstances described and raised by the Labor Party existed, some people either do not care or are guilty by association. There is no way in the world that among 60,000 people only the perpetrators of crimes knew what was going on. Yet nobody said anything. It was such a well-kept secret, even within Customs. That is a worry. It is certainly something for which the trade union movement, being right there and hands-on, have a responsibility. They have come out with a lot of statements now, but those are slightly different to their views up until this issue was exposed. It is a real issue. It is an issue for the people of Australia and it is an issue for this parliamentâand not just the government. Let us hope that together we can go on living the very comfortable and secure life we have as Australians.</para>

<para>âThe <inline ref="R2362">Maritime Transport Security Amendment Bill 2005</inline> is an important part of Australiaâs armoury in the fight against terrorism. In that context I want to make it clear at the outset that I am seriously offended by any suggestion from the member for OâConnor that any element of the trade union movement has been involved in protecting work practices or any individual who could be a threat to Australiaâs security. It is about time he fronted up to the ongoing process that has been pursued by government in consultation with the employers, with some engagement of workers and trade unions, to actually make sure that the security regime that exists in Australia is second to none in the world. His comments this evening, unfortunately, reflect more on him and his ignorance of what has been going on with respect to the fight against terrorism than on any practical understanding of what is involved in the nature of the bill before the House this evening.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I have had some ongoing involvement with this issue as the former shadow minister for transport, and I have continued that strong interest as the Labor Party spokesperson for resources and tourism because, frankly, we are about cooperation with the government to make sure that the maritime security regime in this country is second to none. As noted by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services yesterday during the matter of public importance debate, it was under my watch as shadow minister for transport that the Maritime Transport Security Act 2003 and its associated regulations came into law. In the development of that bill we closely consulted workers, employers and the representatives of workersâthe trade union movementâto work in a cooperative way with government to get the legislation right.</para>
<para>The opposition take the issue of maritime security very seriously, as we do the issue of aviation security. This is an areaâand it is about time the government fronted up to its responsibilitiesâin which there is no room for complacency at all. Complacency can lead to Australia being placed at risk. Maritime transport security is a vital element of both the tourism and resources industries, my current responsibilities. I believe it is important that we as a nation are confident in our security settings. This bill is another endeavour to get our security settings right. But it is equally important those settings protect employment conditions andâdare I suggest it in the light of the comments of the member for OâConnorâthe privacy of the people who work in the transport industries.</para>
<para>Let us go to the key objectives of the bill. Firstly, it is to extend the coverage of the maritime security regime to the offshore oil and gas facilities located within the territorial sea, in Australiaâs exclusive economic zone and on the continental shelf. Secondly, it is about facilitatingâand appropriately soâthe introduction of a maritime security identity card to ensure that personnel working unmonitored in maritime security zones and offshore security zones have been subject to thorough background checks. That is nothing new to this parliament: we have debated it previously with respect to the aviation and maritime industries.</para>
<para>On the face of it these are reasonable and appropriate additions to the maritime security regime. They are something that we knew we would have to move on at a later time when we first developed the maritime transport security arrangements in 2003. This bill represents the ongoing work that has been undertaken by the department on outstanding maritime security issues. However, I do agree with the member for OâConnor on one issue: the devil is in the detail. It is on this basis that we are concerned to ensure that adequate scrutiny of the amendments and the associated regulations is built into the process. It is for this reason that I support the bill going through the House today and also its referral to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee for further detailed consideration.</para>
<para>I am aware that the Department of Transport and Regional Services have undertaken a considerable amount of consultation on key elements of the bill, and they are to be commended for that. Unfortunately, the consultation process has not been completed, and I believe that there are a number of outstanding issues. In the case of the introduction of the maritime security identity card, these issues include but are not limited to, firstly, concern about privacy of information; secondly, transitional arrangements; thirdly, finalisation of the list of criminal offences that will be applied during background checking; and, fourthly, the ongoing issue of how similar checks can be applied to foreign seafarers, which I think is important.</para>
<para>Let us go to the extension of the security regime to the offshore oil and gas industry. In the case of the extension of the regime to the offshore industry, I am concerned that the union movement was not included as part of the consultation process. Instead, the government chose to consult with industry representatives without including any of the unions that cover the offshore industry. I make this point: this approach by the government is very short-sighted. In its zeal to demolish the union movement, particularly the maritime unions, the government fails to recognise that unions are in fact a security asset. Unions want to get the regime right because they want to make sure that the security of their workers at work is second to none, so they are entitled to be properly consulted.</para>
<para>We should also understand, unlike the government, that unions are made up of ordinary Australian citizens who have the most to gain from a secure maritime and offshore environment. They are not a barrier to making sure that we have the best security regime in the world. They are potentially the eyes and ears of the maritime and offshore industries. These individuals know what is going on on a daily basis and can monitor the environment in which they work. Why would the government choose not to include them in discussions about security? I just cannot understand why we adopt such an ideological approach. It makes no sense, and it is time that the Howard government acknowledged the important role of the unions in establishing and maintaining a strong security framework.</para>
<para>The opposition also recognises the need to further protect offshore oil and gas facilities from potential terrorist threat. That is not just about protecting Australiaâs security; it is also about making sure that workers are protected at workâthat they work in a safe environment. It is in the national interest, in their interests and in the interests of their families that they work in the safest possible environment. These facilities were not included as part of Â the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code, as this code was developed by the IMO as an annex of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, which, interestingly, does not apply to the offshore industry. These maritime facilities, dare I suggest, are a far softer target for potential terrorism than the heavily regulated mainland ports, and this needs to be addressed. I remind the House that the Prime Minister established a task force to address these matters and, despite the unions being willing to participate in this process, they were deliberately excluded. When the task force finalised its deliberations and made recommendations in respect of the extension of the maritime security framework to the offshore industry, again the unions were not included in discussions, despite their clear role in ensuring the safety of their members, their industry and their nation.</para>
<para>I now go to the issue of maritime security identity cards. The second initiative included in this bill is the proposed introduction of a maritime security identity card, an initiative not being implemented in other countries and not identified as a requirement of the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code. Again, Labor and the union movement support the need for background checking of personnel with unrestricted access into secure areas of ports, ships and offshore facilities. Clearly, this is in the national interest and in the interest of workplace safety and is a key element of the security framework. But it is also in the national interest to ensure that security checking, restricting of access and other measures to protect the security of the port are not used as de facto means of discriminating against people who have made mistakes in the past where those mistakes are not related in any way to potential terrorist activity.</para>
<para>Let us be balanced with respect to the issue of these maritime security identity cards and the standing of people in the Australian community. Many have made minor mistakes in the past and they should not be discriminated against for the rest of their lives. Labor prides itself on giving people a second chance in life. I acknowledge with respect to this issue the balanced position adopted by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services in the MPI debate yesterday concerning the background checking of aviation workers. It was a balanced approach, following the development of the aviation security regime which is now in place. For that reason, I also stand in support of the initiative to make sure that background checks are carried out by ASIO. These checks are to establish any links between individuals and terrorist groups or any previous history of politically motivated violence. This issue has been discussed widely with industry, including the unions, and has bipartisan support.</para>
<para>It is the issue of criminal background checking that needs to be carefully managed. Let us be very careful in respect of this issue, because we can ruin many peopleâs opportunities and lives. If a person has made a mistake and paid their price to society, they should not be prevented from re-establishing themselves in the community. We have always prided ourselves as a nation on giving these people a second chance in life. They must have access to meaningful work, and the waterfront, the offshore industry and the shipping industry should continue to provide employment opportunities for these people. I take the view that criminal background checking by the AFP must be restricted to criminal convictions which directly relate to terrorist activities.</para>
<para>As noted earlier, the opposition fully supports ASIO checking for links with suspect organisations. In relation to criminal history checking, the department has given a commitment to the industry that it would identify a clear list of criminal activities and provide evidence about their links to terrorist activities. The department has made a commitment, following detailed consultations, that this list would be written into the regulations and that background checking by the AFP would be based on this list. Unfortunately, the process was not completed before the introduction of the bill and will now need to be scrutinised through the committee process to ensure it is not left open to interpretation or possible abuse.</para>
<para>I also refer to the costs of undertaking background checking and producing the cards. I understand that it is expected that some 100,000 cards are to be issued across the broad industry. It is Laborâs view that the cost of obtaining a card should not be borne by ordinary working people. This is a cost of doing business, and employers must meet these costs. It is no different in my view to other on-costs of employment such as insurance, provision of workplace facilities and leave entitlements. This issue was also not finalized through the consultation process with industry and will need to be addressed through the committee deliberations.</para>
<para>The privacy of personal details is another issue which needs further consideration. I contend that this information must be protected to ensure that employers do not use this process without proper justification as a de facto means of screening out certain types of individuals. I am also concerned about the transitional arrangements after the regime has been in place for nine months. We could see a situation in which, because of a level of discretion being written into the regulations, individuals or businesses will be able to shop around in relation to the interpretation of the rules. This could lead to inconsistency in the application of the regime.</para>
<para>An area the government has seriously neglected is foreign shipping, which I regard as potentially a gaping hole in Australiaâs fight against terrorism. I want to touch on this issue because it is not covered by the legislation. It currently presents a major threat to Australiaâs maritime and offshore security framework through the increased use of foreign ships in Australian waters and the degradation of the cabotage system. As I noted earlier in my contribution this evening, the government has congratulated itself on its adoption of the International Ship and Port Facility Code and its implementation under the Maritime Transport Security Act. This bill seeks to extend that regime to the offshore industry. That is good, and Labor supports it. We clearly support this legislation in full, and we adopt a bipartisan approach to securing our coastline. However, the governmentâs approach to security is to apply costs and burdens to Australian ports and shipsâand now the offshore industryâwhile at the same down seeking to push down transport costs through the use of cheap foreign shipping.</para>
<para>The government is not only facilitating the increased use of cheap foreign shipping around the Australian coastline but has made no progress in ensuring that foreign seafarers are subjected to similar checking to their Australian counterparts. That is just plain wrong. It represents a major terrorist threat to the safety of Australia. In many cases these ships are manned by crews from countries included in the Prime Ministerâs so-called arc of instability. They are permitted to carry around the coast dangerous goods such as fertiliser, often at the expense of Australian industry. At Senate estimates hearings last week, government officials revealed that 141 single-voyage permits and 40 continuous-voyage permits were issued in the first quarter of this year. Compare this with a total of 50 permits issued in 1990 when Labor was in government. These permits are in many cases issued to flag of convenience ships. These ships are flagged in tax havens such as Panama and Liberia and, as have I mentioned, are often manned by crews from countries included in the Prime Ministerâs so-called arc of instability. What a recipe to threaten Australiaâs security! These ships are often subsidised by foreign governments, and they do not meet the safety, environmental or labour conditions of our own fleet.</para>
<para>Foreign ships and crews are not covered under Australiaâs maritime security legislation other than for the rudimentary checking of crew lists against international databases and for ship inspections at ports. Instead, they are covered by the legislation of their flag state. As if we can trust some of those flag states to be involved in guaranteeing the protection of Australia in the fight against terrorism! But the most important issue not being addressed is the carriage of high-consequence dangerous goods, notably ammonium nitrate. It is well known that terrorist groups, including al-Qaeda and its affiliates, have used ammonium nitrate as part of their deadly campaigns. We need only think of the 1993 World Trade Centre bombing, the 1995 Oklahoma bombing and the continual attacks on embassies in the 1990s. The government has made no attempt to restrict the carriage of these cargoes, despite all its security rhetoric. On the contrary, since 1 July 2004 at least five single-voyage permits have been issued for the carriage of ammonium nitrate between Australian ports. On five occasions we have been placed at risk through the neglect of the Commonwealth government. Under these five permits, 10,800 tonnes of this highly dangerous fertiliser were carried in and out of Australian ports.</para>
<para>The opposition contends that the carriage of dangerous goods such as ammonium nitrate by foreign ships must stop now if we are serious about the fight against terrorism. The safest way to transport ammonium nitrate, which we need for our economic wellbeing, and other fertilisers around Australia is on Australian ships with Australian working men and women carrying out that duty. What is so wrong about protecting Australiaâs security whilst gainfully employing Australian seafarers? It is not un-Australian, it is pro-Australian. It is about time the government got the message that, by its neglect, it is placing Australia at risk in the fight against terrorism. With a secure ship and secure seafarers, we are protected and the exposure is minimised.</para>
<para>In closing, I remind the government that we are a nation of shippers and a shipping nation. We require a strong and viable shipping industry as a key component of our maritime security. Our key ally, the United States, recognises the value of a vibrant domestic shipping industry and continues to ensure its ongoing viability through the Jones Act. The opposition believes that certainty for potential investors in the Australian shipping industry will provide great benefits in security. It is time the government listened and recognised the security and other benefits that come from a viable Australian shipping industry. Flag of convenience shipping is cheap. It represents a serious threat to Australiaâs security. The government stands condemned for walking away from its responsibility to protect Australian people with respect to the flag of convenience issue.</para>
<para>I call on the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to put his money where his mouth is on maritime security and to cease from abusing the cabotage provisions of the Navigation Act. These provisions were designed as a fall-back to ensure availability of serviceânot to destroy a vital industry and place Australiaâs security at risk. Front up, Mr Anderson. Get serious about Australiaâs security and take foreign shipping, which is a risk to our security, out of Australian coastal shipping. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI will begin by commending my colleague the member for Batman for his very comprehensive analysis of the provisions of the <inline ref="R2362">Maritime Transport Security Amendment Bill 2005</inline> that is before us this evening, and also for the chronology of the background to this second bill coming before the House. I concur absolutely with the comments he made about a number of issues that pertain to maritime security, and I will touch on some of those in my contribution this evening.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I think it is important to recognise that Australia faces a raft of systemic maritime security failures that the opposition has been highlighting for some time and failures that the member for Batman so comprehensively addressed in his contribution. In the last couple of days we have had the debate about the security lapses at airports. Let us acknowledge that we continue to have significant security breaches in our maritime sector. Essentially, there is a lack of resources available to adequately patrol our maritime borders, and we are totally underequipped in our ability to fight illegal activity in our maritime zone. The situation in port security is no less alarming. I want to draw parliamentâs attention to a recent very comprehensive report issued by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute on Australiaâs maritime security. One paragraph from that report says:</para>
<quote>
<para>A terrorist attack on Australiaâs maritime interests is a credible scenario. We have high dependence on shipping and seaborne trade, and are adjacent to a Region where terrorist groups have maritime capabilities. Australia still faces major institutional and operational challenges in reducing the risks of maritime terrorism. We havenât met these challenges fully and we lack consistency in the response across states and territories.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">They are the words of an authoritative independent body that is there to provide fearless advice to the government. Despite this governmentâs often shameless âtough on securityâ oratory, this report draws attention to the governmentâs failure in key structural areas. I will return to some of these issues after commenting briefly on aspects of the bill before us this evening.</para>
<para>I will only comment on the bill in summary because I think the arguments and limitations have been well expressed by both the shadow ministers. We do support the governmentâs intention to extend the Maritime Transport Security Act to apply to offshore oil and gas facilities. That is a very important issue, not just for our economic wellbeing but, as the member for Batman indicates, the workers on these installations are often left in very vulnerable and precarious situations. There is no doubt that there is a need for an enhanced and formalised approach by operators to the security of fixed and floating offshore oil and gas platforms. The objectives of this bill conform with the existing regime under the act for ships and ports.</para>
<para>In addition to the extension to offshore installations, the bill will, for the first time, see the introduction of the Maritime Security Identification Card. Again, the member for Batman has expressed the oppositionâs views on this issue. In principle, we agree that there is a requirement and a need for this to occur. It is probably quite surprising and amazing that currently there is no regime in place that requires checks on people working in ports, ships and offshore oil and gas facilities in a consistent national manner. The member for Batman was absolutely right in drawing attention to some of the issues that will need further detailed consideration in the Senate, and to the desire of all to see the details that will be encompassed in the regulations.</para>
<para>While in principle we support the introduction of these national identification cards, there are matters that go to the issue of privacy that are very important and matters that go to the potential past criminal records of some workers in the sector. That has to be balanced against our belief in second chance options for people who may have at some stage in the past fallen short of the law. Let us hope that the regime that is put in place is administered in a sensible way, bearing in mind the bipartisan approach to the identification cards that has been expressed in this chamber.</para>
<para>I want to touch on a couple of matters that affect my electorate. As you know, the electorate of Throsby encompasses the port at Port Kembla and I have raised in this House on numerous occasions matters that have come to my attention either through the union and the workers that work in the port or through community concerns. I reiterate the concerns that have been expressed by my colleague the member for Batman. We have at the moment a totally inadequate security regime for crews from foreign flagged vessels that come to our shores. In 2002, a total of 115,000 foreign crew members arrived. The government, by its own admission, has indicated that since July 2001, on the most recent figures, 103 crew members from foreign flagged vessels had gone missing once they reached an Australian port.</para>
<para>I looked at the answers that the government had provided and was quite concerned to see that crew members went missing, for example, from Wollongong on 6 and 15 November 2001, and from Port Kembla on 1 and 5 January 2002. One-hundred and three missing foreign crew, some of whom went missing in my local area, are 103 potential threats to Australiaâs security. The fact that the crew often went missing in groups of three or four is especially of concern. Indeed, there have been more foreign crew gone missing from foreign flagged vessels in our ports since July 2001 than there have been unauthorised boat arrivals in the same period. So I do think we need to get the balance of our concerns in proper perspective. I raise this issue again because in my view this is an open gate in our protection regime that has to date not been effectively addressed.</para>
<para>The second issue I want to touch on is the need for improved cargo reporting. In March this year I pursued a number of questions on notice with the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison. The minister advised me that the act requires vessels to report to Customs 48 hours in advance of arrival, unless the journey is shorter than 48 hours, in which case 24-hour pre-notification is required. In 2004 the proportion of cargo reports reported late to Customs was as follows: after the vessel had arrived and berthed, 7.83 per cent; and over or equal to zero and less than 24 hours before vessel arrival, 5.34 per cent. So in 2004 over 13 per cent of cargo reports reported late. The minister indicated in answer to a question:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Cargo reporting provisions of the Customs Act, currently in force, do not contain penalty provisions for late reporting.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">There is no question that potentially dangerous cargo continues to be unloaded at Australiaâs docks and left, as we have been advised by government officials, for several days before Customs establishes the contents of the cargo. Amazingly, the minister has advised me in his response to my question:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">If a cargo report has not been received by Customs prior to the discharge of the vessel, that cargo is deemed to be surplus cargo.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He goes on:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Surplus cargo is treated as high risk cargo and mayâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I repeat âmayââ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">be subject to examination or X-Ray.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">What an amazing situation. This is a totally unsatisfactory response. Cargo notified late can sit on our docks and may or may not be subject to examination or X-ray. The ministerâs answers to my questions also confirm that foreign flagged vessels, âcan and do carry ammonium nitrateâ around our coastline. I am not convinced from his reply that adequate safeguards are in place to protect our nation against potential terrorist incidents. Remember the 103 crew from foreign flagged vessels that went missing? Were they missing from ships carrying ammonium nitrate? That is a legitimate question to ask. The security breaches and potential threats are all too obvious. There is an absence of a nationwide approach to managing the security of high-risk ships, with security arrangements varying from state to state and port to port.</para>
<para>In addition to the inadequacy of screening containers, there is a huge problem in the inspection of empty containers. Of the 700,000 empty containers arriving in our ports each year, only 190 were inspected in the last financial year. As a federal member with a port facility in my electorate, I have taken the opportunity to raise my concerns on behalf of my constituents. These concerns have now been more ably articulated by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a body, as I said earlier, specifically established to give frank and fearless strategic advice to the government. The government needs to listen to this expert advice and act swiftly to remedy the litany of threats that continue to exist. It is high time for action. The bill before us, which has our support in principle, is a fairly limited response to the raft of systemic maritime security failures that continue to confront our nation.</para>

<para>âI do not propose to detain the House for long. I do, however, have some brief comments to make on the <inline ref="R2362">Maritime Transport Security Amendment Bill 2005</inline>. As previous honourable members indicated, the opposition will support this bill with some reservations and with a reference to a Senate committee. Maritime security is an extremely important matter. It is an important matter for all countries in this new high-security environment but it is a particularly important matter for Australia, which relies so overwhelmingly on maritime trade and which has such important and busy ports so close to our major cities and population centres.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In the minds of the public, airport security is paramount and it is, of course, vitally important. But maritime safety is just as important and cannot be ignored. The honourable member for Throsby referred to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. I too found their paper very enlightening and their words cannot be ignored. Their recent paper entitled <inline font-style="italic">Future unknown: terrorist threat to Australian maritime security</inline>, authored by Anthony Bergin, is a particularly good piece and I would recommend it to all honourable members. The paper in part states:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We have a high dependence on shipping and are adjacent to a region where terrorist groups have maritime capabilities.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The institute report, in relation to reducing the challenges of maritime security, goes on to state:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We havenât met these challenges fully, and we lack consistency in the response across the states and territories.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The institute recommends establishing a $100 million maritime port security program, improved coordination between national and state agencies, direct involvement of the Australian defence forces in ship and port security and the development of an Australian maritime skills database.</para>
<para>This bill makes some improvements to maritime security, and these are to be welcomed. The bill amends the act to extend coverage to offshore oil and gas facilities located in the territorial sea and the economic zone of Australia and on the continental shelf, ensuring that all regulated offshore oil and gas facility operators and other prescribed offshore industry participants develop and comply with an offshore security plan based on a security assessment of each regulated facility. That is a good thing and we welcome it. Oil facilities are very much a terrorist target. This was shown by the attacks on oil facilities such as those at al-Basra and Khor al-Amaya.</para>
<para>This bill introduces a maritime safety identification card. Again, as honourable members have indicated, Labor supports this with reservations. The card will be introduced to cover unmonitored employees who are required to access maritime security zones. The scheme will require applicants to undergo a criminal history check by the Australian Federal Police and a security assessment by ASIO.</para>
<para>It is very important that this process works well. The attention given to security concerns at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport is the opposite in this case. It is quite clear, on any objective basis, that security at Sydney airport has fallen down. It has been, on any analysis, inadequate. These criminal and security checks must work. The evidence from Sydney airport is that the checks there either have not worked or have been ignored. This is something that cannot be fixed by legislation. The government must ensure that these checks are carried out and that they work. This is not something, as I say, that can be legislated; it is something that can only be done by commitment. It is something that can only be done through coordinated action.</para>
<para>There are things that the government needs to do to ensure that this happens. The government needs to get rid of the duplication in homeland securityâand maritime security in particular. It needs to provide leadership in these matters. There are currently eight government agencies responsible for maritime safety in Australia: the Department of Defence, Customs, the Department of Transport and Regional Services, Coastwatch, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and the Australian Fisheries Management Authority. There are eightâand there should be one. A department of homeland security, charged with the development of a Commonwealth maritime strategy, would be the right approach. This bill, in many ways, tinkers at the edges. It will not be opposed, but it does not make any substantial changes. The department of homeland security should also be charged with the job of reviewing whether the resources going into maritime security are adequate. There are worrying reports about the increases in illegal fishing vessels sailing into Australian waters, reaching the Australian mainland and entering Australian rivers. If fishing boats can do this, people with more nefarious aims can do it too.</para>
<para>The government has authorised the direction of private fishing vessels to interdict and detain allegedly illegal fishing boats. We have to be reasonable about this: the Australian coastline is very big and no government of either persuasion would always be able to monitor every part of it. Nobody is suggesting that. Nobody is saying that the Labor Party in office would be able to wave a magic wand and find that we can monitor the entire Australian coast. But it is worrying that the government has authorised private vessels to do this. It is not so much worrying because they have authorised private vessels to do this but that there is a need to authorise private vessels to do it. It is a sad reflection on the resources going into maritime safety. Frankly, if this government were fair dinkum about this issue, it would create a department of homeland security, it would develop a national maritime strategy and it would properly resource it.</para>
<para>The Minister for Transport and Regional Services and Deputy Prime Minister comes into the House day after day and says in question time, âWe have a belts and braces operation, and it only comes into force after a terrorist incident,â only for it to be revealed by questioning from the opposition that not only was the Inspector of Transport Security removed from duties and moved across to the immigration inquiry but most, if not all, of his staff have been as well. This is what I found most worrying. It is one thing for the inspectorâas worrying as that isâto be transferred, but for all of the staff to be transferred as well, frankly, shows a lack of direction and a lack of high-level commitment to this issue. I think that the government has been asleep at the wheel when it comes to this issue, and it could do a whole lot better.</para>
<para>The government are normally not backwards in accepting recommendations from the United States government, which correctly created a Department of Homeland Security. There is no reason this government cannot do the same. They should have a dedicated minister for homeland security, they should have a dedicated department of homeland security and they should have not as their primary aim but as their only aim matters such as those before us in the House tonight.</para>
<para>In conclusionâas I said, I did not want to detain the House for long; I only had some brief comments to makeâthe Labor Party recognises that our oil and gas facilities are clearly targets. They have been targets overseas, and we need to do everything we can to defend the people working in very hard circumstances on those facilities and to defend Australia from economic impact if those facilities are damaged in any way. We also need to ensure that only those people who have proper business in our maritime security zones are there. These proposed identity cards seem to go some way towards achieving that, and I commend those cards; but, as I said, they will work only if they are implemented properly, if the criminal and security checks are carried out and, just as importantly, if the security people are listened to, as it appears they have not been listened to at Australiaâs airports.</para>

<para>âWhile supporting the <inline ref="R2362">Maritime Transport Security Amendment Bill 2005</inline>, which is before us in the House tonight, I believe it is imperative that I detail some of the concerns I have in relation to both this legislation and maritime security generallyâparticularly in relation to port security and the implications that single and continuous voyage permits have for maritime security.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Shortland, which I represent in this parliament, is a coastal electorate. The port of Newcastle is in very close proximity to the electorate. Many of the residents of Shortland actually work at the port of Newcastle and have a very strong association with the industry. I believe shipping is a very important industry to Australia. I concur with the reports that have been presented in this parliamentâ<inline font-style="italic">Ships of shame</inline>, by the former member for Shortland, the Hon. Peter Morris, and the subsequent report he was involved in, <inline font-style="italic">Ships, slaves and competition</inline>. These are all issues that I believe go to the security of ports. But I would like to turn first to the legislation. I will detail some of my concerns in relation to that legislation and also highlight what this legislation is about.</para>
<para>The bill amends the act by extending its coverage to offshore oil and gas facilities located in the territorial seas within Australiaâs exclusive economic zone and on the continental shelf, ensuring that all regulated offshore oil and gas facility operators and other prescribed offshore industry participants develop and comply with an offshore security plan based on the security assessment of each regulated facility. I do not think anyone within this parliament could disagree with that very important change that will go towards ensuring the security and safety of those offshore facilities. The other aspect of this legislation is maritime security identification cards. I bring the Houseâs attention to the fact that there are already aviation security identification cards and that there have been some problems associated with those. In question time today the member for Swan asked the Deputy Prime Minister a question that really raised some serious issues as to whether or not aviation security identification cards are effective. I would argue fairly strongly that there are some weaknesses associated with those and, with the maritime industry being a lot more diverse and a lot harder to police, there will be even more problems associated with maritime security cards than there have been with aviation security identification cards.</para>
<para>The government need to be very careful about their implementation. As a previous speaker stated, it is not only the legislation that is important but also the policing of that legislation that is important. At present there is no regime in place that requires background checks on people working in Australian ports or on ships, offshore oil and gas facilities, contrary to the case of the aviation industry. Therefore, the cards are a good move but, as there are serious problems associated with the cards within the aviation industry, I am not confident that the situation will be any better in the maritime industry. I also understand that some people working in the maritime industry are concerned that some privacy issues might arise. I hope the government will address those. Also, in my research I have read that some employees are concerned that they may have to bear the cost of getting a maritime security card.</para>
<para>The consultation that has been involved in this has probably not been as good as it could have been. The consultation process highlighted the fragmented nature of our maritime border control arrangements. A recent issue that has been raised by us on this side of the House regarding the transfer of the Inspector of Transport Security and his staff to an inquiry that is taking place really highlights to me concerns as to the governmentâs commitment to security and monitoring and looking after our borders.</para>
<para>In line with that, I would like to now turn to the issue of continuous voyage permits and single voyage permits and their implications for port security, as I feel the crews on those ships will not be subject to the same scrutiny as people working within our ports. Any member of this House who has ever visited a flag of convenience ship would understand the implications for security. One such ship that I have visited was sailing under a Maltese flag and had a Greek captain and a Burmese crew. I think it would be really difficult to do adequate security checks on such crews, and I know they are not currently subject to them. Some of the cargoes that these ships carry, such as ammonium nitrate, really jeopardise the safety of our nation. It is not good enough for us to have one set of rules for workers that are employed in Australia and a different set of rules for the crews of these ships. There is absolutely no guarantee as to where they have come from and no background checks are made on them. This really undermines the whole point of this legislation.</para>
<para>This is a very important issue to me because mine is a coastal electorate that is affected by these ships going up and down the coast and carrying cargoes into a port that is very close to my electorate. The government really needs to revisit the issue of these ships sailing under flags of convenience. It needs to revisit the issue of continuous voyage permits and single voyage permits. It needs to look at the implications of overseas flagged ships for our Australian shipping industry. I really believe that these foreign ships pose a greater security risk to our Australian ports than any of the things that we have highlighted today.</para>
<para>I believe that the Australian government needs to put aside the ideological problems that it has with the Maritime Union of Australia. It needs to sit down and look at what an Australian shipping industry means to this country, at the security implications associated with these foreign flag of convenience ships and at the implications of these foreign crews for our port and border security. All those things need to be addressed. I support the legislation that is before us today. I support the position of the shadow minister and I urge the government to revisit the issue and really consider the implications for the security of this country.</para>

<para>âMaritime security is of great importance to the people of Melbourne Ports. I have the honour of representing the great maritime centre of Port Melbourne and I have a large number of maritime workersâfor example, stevedores, seafarersâand their families living in my constituency. They are the people who work in Australiaâs ports and make our great export industries possible. These communities have been the target of this governmentâs attack on their employment and working conditions. I reflect on the fact that the great boom in productivity that is taking place has led to almost no decrease in the cost for importers and exporters that the government predicted with its trickle-down effect. Yes, there has been a boost in the box rate and the clearance of ships through Australian ports, but all that has done, and the government knows this, is boost the profit of the companies that have the duopoly that dominates Australian ports.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The people who work in my electorate expect the Australian government to take the security needs of Australiaâs ports seriously. It is people such as those I represent in Port Melbourne who will suffer if there is a terrorist incident in an Australia port. I want to restate the concerns of all of the people on this side of the House who have spoken prior to me about the abuse of cabotage under this government. The single voyage permits of 141 foreign flagships in the period January to March is indicative of the mentality of the Liberal Partyâs predecessor, the UAP. Its then leader Bob MenziesâPig Iron Bobâdespite the imminent threat of war with Japan, only looked at the lowest common denominatorâmaking a few pounds on exports to Japan. Saving a few dollars by having a slightly lower priced foreign ship doing what Australian ships and seafarers should be doing is the ethos now. Neither takes into consideration the national interest. And, of course, a lot of that pig-iron came back to visit us during the Second World War when, as I am sure members opposite know, hundreds of merchant ships, manned by brave Australian merchant sailors, were sunk by the Japanese along the east coast of Australia. If we were in a similar situation now, we would not have the shipping to take our coastal trade up and down the east coast.</para>
<para>Sadly, I see very little evidence so far that this government is taking the issue of maritime security sufficiently seriously. It is nearly four years since September 11, and we have no united department of homelands security or single minister responsible for coordinating Australiaâs defences against terrorism. These responsibilities are divided between the Attorney-General, the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and the Minister for Justice and Customsâand, as we now know from the missing Customs report, it would seem that reports are not even passed from one department to the other.</para>
<para>We have no coastguard with undivided responsibility for protecting our coast. This task is still assigned to our dedicated but overstretched Navy, when their real job should be to guard our sea lanes and to take part in the various combined defence and peacekeeping operations we are committed to. This government are full of tough talk about protecting Australia against terrorism, and when they take appropriate action they have the full support of the opposition. But, so far, the governmentâs response has been piecemeal, slow and inadequate. This bill is far from being the comprehensive solution to the issue of Australiaâs maritime security that the government ought to be bringing into this House, but it is a step in the right direction. For that reason, people on this side will support it.</para>
<para>As the honourable member for Barton said, the <inline ref="R2362">Maritime Transport Security Amendment Bill 2005</inline> amends the Maritime Transport Security Act 2003 in two ways: it extends coverage of the act to offshore oil and gas facilities located within Australiaâs territorial waters or exclusive economic zones, and requires that all offshore oil and gas facility operators and other prescribed offshore industry participants develop and comply with an offshore security plan based on a security assessment of each facility. Insofar as they go, those steps are welcome.</para>
<para>The second part of the bill amends the act to introduce the maritime security identity card. The card will be required by people who wish to access maritime security zones, which may be areas in ports or on ships. The bill requires those who need to have such a card to submit to a check of their background, including a criminal history check by the AFP, a security assessment by ASIO and an unlawful non-citizen check by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. Cards will be issued only to persons who have successfully met background checking requirements. The government have not informed us of the kind of criminal record that will prevent an individual from receiving a card or the criteria they intend to use to determine that issue. Today, when discussing airport security, the Deputy Prime Minister said that the government would try to make a balanced decision on these matters, balancing the legitimate need to exclude people who have criminal convictions relating to matters relevant to national security from access to secure areas, with an understanding of the fact that people have been in occupations that offer employment to people whose records in the past have been less than perfect. People who have served sentences and paid their debt to society do have a right to rehabilitate themselves through employment. Not every criminal conviction, particularly those that were 20 years in the past, should be taken as grounds for excluding a person from secure areas when it would mean that person would lose their employment.</para>
<para>People who live in port communities, such as those in my electorate, take the issues of security very seriously and they quite rightly expect me to take up these issues on their behalf. As the member for Batman mentioned in his speech, the issue of ammonium nitrate being transported through Australian ports is surely a matter that ought to concern all members of this House. That is why on 9 December last year I asked questions of the Deputy Prime Minister in his capacity as Minister for Transport and Regional Services. I asked him: for each of the last 10 years (a) how many tonnes of ammonium nitrate were carried around Australiaâs coast by single-voyage permit ships; (b) what was, firstly, the name and, secondly, the country of origin of each ship carrying ammonium nitrate; (c) which ships that carried ammonium nitrate were granted unrestricted access to Australian ports; and (d) did his department or any other agency have a record of the crew of each ship that carried ammonium nitrate and, if so, what was, firstly, the name and, secondly, the nationality and, thirdly, the security status of the crew members? What security measures were employed for handling ammonium nitrate on these ships and what assurances could he give us about their integrity? Could he say how Australian security measures for single-voyage permit ships carrying ammonium nitrate compared with those of other Western countries such as the United States of America? Was he aware that only 2,300 tonnes of ammonium nitrate caused untold destruction in the port city of Texas City in New Mexico? Did he intend to review current security arrangements with the transport of ammonium nitrate to ensure the safety of Australian ports?</para>
<para>Madam Deputy Speaker, it will surprise you to knowâthough you may have been listening to the end of question time the other day when I raised this under the standing ordersâthat nearly six months later I still have no answers to these questions. This is not a trivial issue. Ammonium nitrate is a common chemical used in agricultural fertiliser and, as the member for Batman said, we need it for our agricultural needs. It is also the most common ingredient in explosives used by terrorists to make bombs. It was used by the right-wing extremist Timothy McVeigh to kill 168 people in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and it was used in the Bali bombing in 2002 when Jemaah Islamiah killed 202 people, including 88 of our fellow Australian citizens.</para>
<para>That is one possible risk of ammonium nitrate passing through Australian ports. The other is accidental explosionsâfor example, the 1947 Texas City disaster I referred to earlier. Two thousand three hundred tonnes of ammonium nitrate was on a freighter, the SS <inline font-style="italic">Grandcamp</inline>. The explosion was one of the worst industrial accidents in the history of the United States. The official death toll was 581 and over 5,000 people were injured. The Texas City accident was caused by a small fire aboard the <inline font-style="italic">Grandcamp</inline>. In that case the explosion was accidental, but it would not be difficult for a saboteur or a terrorist to cause a similar result in an Australian port if such a person could gain access to a ship carrying this chemical. Such an explosion could destroy Port Melbourne or Port Kembla or Fremantle or Port Adelaide, just as the 1947 explosion destroyed most of Texas City.</para>
<para>I do not expect that the minister will able to tell me the name and security status of every crew member of every ship which has carried ammonium nitrate into an Australian port in the past 10 years. I asked him for that level of detail to underline the point that no such records are kept and no such security clearances have been given. That is the point of the bill we are considering and that is why we are supporting the bill. I do expect him to be able to tell me what he is doing to ensure that the importation of this potentially deadly chemical through Australian ports is going to be subject to some kind of monitoring needed in the future given events of the immediate past. That was the point of my questions and I am still waiting for answers to them.</para>
<para>The threat of a terrorist attack on an Australian port is a real one. Not far to our north are some of the busiest ports and shipping lanes in the world. Up to 300,000 ships pass through the Strait of Malacca, the Lombok Strait and Sunda Strait between Indonesia and Malaysia, including ships carrying two-thirds of the worldâs trade in liquefied natural gas, LNG. Hundreds of ships bound to and from Australian ports pass through these waters. We have already seen in 2000 the attack on USS <inline font-style="italic">Cole</inline> in Yemen, which killed 17 sailors. That was an attack on a fully-armed and operational warship. It would be much easier to attack a freighter in Sydney Harbour or an LNG carrier off the Australian coast or an oil rig in Bass Strait. In 2002 we saw the attack on the French supertanker <inline font-style="italic">Limburg</inline> in the Gulf of Aden by the Yemen franchise of al-Qaeda. Maritime terrorism is not a figment of the imagination; it is a fact. This bill is part of the governmentâs overdue and inadequate, but nonetheless welcome, response to that threat.</para>
<para>The al-Qaeda operative responsible for the <inline font-style="italic">Cole</inline> attack, Abdul Rahman al-Nasheri, was captured by US forces in 2002. He told those questioning him that al-Qaeda was planning more attacks on US and Western warships. But attacking warships will now be much harder following the <inline font-style="italic">Cole</inline> incident. Terrorists traditionally always favour soft targets such as merchant ships, oil tankers, cruise liners and undefended civilian ports which offer much easier and more tempting targets that any naval vessel. By contrast to the attitude we seem to have in Australia, where we permit the single-voyage permits for foreign ships without knowing who the sailors are aboard them, other countries take this very seriously. Illustrating that problem are the alarming statistics presented by the member for Throsby in her remarks about the 103 members of foreign crews gone missing in Australia, in groups perhaps and from ships bringing ammonium nitrate. Other countries take these issues very seriously. As the member for Batman pointed out, the Jones Act means that the United States has determined that they will produce their own shipping, that no-one will be allowed to do shipping up and down the coasts of United States apart from US seafarers. They do not have this lowest common denominator mentalityâthe cheapest-dollar ships we can buy, and people we have not checked coming into Australian ports in ships carrying loads of dangerous chemicals.</para>
<para>I am pleased to see the government taking these measures to improve Australiaâs maritime security. I am happy to support this bill, as is the rest of the opposition, but I am far from convinced that the government is taking this issue as seriously as it should. When I see a bill creating a unified department of homeland security and placing a minister in charge of domestic security taking seriously the danger of unregulated traffic in dangerous chemicals such as ammonium nitrate and addressing the issue of the increase in these single-voyage permits of foreign flag vessels, then I will be convinced that the governmentâs action is living up to its rhetoric.</para>
<para>I conclude by pointing to the very important assessment by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute on Australiaâs maritime security in its report <inline font-style="italic">Future unknown: the terrorist threat to Australian maritime security</inline>. Its assessment was quoted by the member for Throsby, but I think it is worth while to quote it again. This institute is the independent think tank that is responsible for looking at these issues and is funded by the federal government. The report said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">A terrorist attack on Australiaâs maritime interests is a credible scenario. We have high dependence on shipping and seaborne trade, and are adjacent to a Region where terrorist groups have maritime capabilities. Australia still faces major institutional and operational challenges in reducing the risks of maritime terrorism. We havenât met these challenges fully and we lack consistency in the response across states and territories.</para>

<para>âin replyâI would like to thank the members for Barton, OâConnor, Batman, Throsby, Prospect, Shortland and Melbourne Ports for their contributions and also thank the opposition for their support of the <inline ref="R2362">Maritime Transport Security Amendment Bill 2005</inline>. The comment I would like to make first up is that I had the opportunity to listen to most of those speeches and they would make you think that those opposite are the only ones who ever knew about seafarers or cared about the welfare of some of the hardest working men and women in Australiaâthose that are on the oil rigs and around Australiaâs coastline. I am sure that most honourable members opposite do not know that for almost a decade I was a member of the Firemen and Deckhands Union and the Merchant Service Guild and that I was on a 224-foot vessel with a crew of 28 for some five years. So when opposition members get up and say that this side of the House does not understand about the welfare of seafarers and ships I would like them to know that lots of people on this side care about seafarers around the Australian coastline.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>There are two parts to the amendment bill. The first part is designed to protect Australiaâs offshore oil and gas facilities from a potential terrorist attack. Such an attack could have severe consequences for Australiaâs economy and environment as well as jeopardising the lives of industry workers. The second part of the bill allows for the introduction of the maritime security identification card, the MSIC scheme. The MSIC will be introduced to cover all personnel who are required to have unmonitored access in a maritime security zone. The amendment bill requires all offshore oil and gas facility operators and other prescribed offshore industry participants to undertake a risk assessment of their facilities and then to develop and comply with security plans.</para>
<para>In developing this amendment bill the government has consulted extensively with representatives from the offshore oil and gas industry and with the state and Northern Territory governments. I am pleased to report that industry is in general agreement with the proposal to extend the act to cover the offshore oil and gas facility industries and agrees with the need to have security risk assessments and security plans for offshore oil and gas facilities. Regulations will be introduced in early July 2005 which will confirm further information for the offshore oil and gas industry on the content and form of the offshore security plans.</para>
<para>The MSIC will provide the maritime industry with a nationally consistent identification card that identifies the cardholder as having met the minimum background requirements to be unmonitored in security zones of a port, port facility, regulated Australian ship or offshore oil or gas facility. I should point outâthere seems to be some confusion on this among members oppositeâthat the MSIC will not be an access control card. Existing access arrangements as approved in maritime security plans will continue to operate. However, the MSIC is sufficiently flexible to enable employers to add access control onto the MSIC for the purposes of an all-in-one access and identification card for employees. The incorporated access features on an MSIC will not be regulated. Background checking for the MSIC will commence from 1 October 2005 and the roll-out will span nine months to 1 July 2006.</para>
<para>I want to take this opportunity to assure members that during this roll-out phase only the Australian government will have access to background checking information. Industry and employers will not have access to personal information about their employees. The MSIC issuing bodies will receive written advice from the Australian government. That advice is limited to whether an MSIC can or cannot be issued. The MSIC regulations are being prepared to reflect this commitment. From 1 July 2006 the MSIC scheme will be subject to a full audit and compliance regime conducted by officers from the Office of Transport Security. The amendment bill builds on the excellent work that has already been done in developing the Maritime Transport Security Act 2003.</para>
<para>In conclusion, the bill further strengthens Australiaâs maritime security regime, ensures that both national and international confidence in Australiaâs oil and gas facilities is retained, strengthens Australiaâs relations with international trading partners and provides the mechanism for dealing with a potential terrorist attack on oil and gas facilities</para>

<para>âFollowing the two-day National Reconciliation Planning Workshop held at Old Parliament House, todayâs debate certainly provides a timely opportunity to emphasise the role of education and training in promoting reconciliation and improving the lives of Australiaâs Indigenous communities. One of the hot topics of discussion over recent months has been the need to build the economic independence of Indigenous communities. Pat Dodson, the chair of the Lingiari Foundation and former chair of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, wrote in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> that Indigenous communities:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">â¦ must engage with industry and governments to guarantee a place for Aboriginal people at the economic table and an equal share in the prosperity that the nation enjoys.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Our role in this place as policy makers and legislators is to force a realisation on this government that in order to share our prosperity we must make sure that all Australians are provided with the basic foundations to engage as economically and socially capable citizens. Education and training are key to building this capacity but, without a doubt, Indigenous Australians remain the most severely educationally disadvantaged people in this country.</para>
<para>The divergence between the educational outcomes of Indigenous Australians and those of non-Indigenous Australians is nothing short of an outrage. Young Indigenous Australians are twice as likely as non-Indigenous students to have left school before completing year 10 and half as likely to have completed year 12. Indigenous Australians aged 18- to 24 are less than a quarter as likely as their non-Indigenous counterparts to go to university. There has been a decline in the number of Indigenous students in vocational education and training for the first time since the 1990s. Almost halfâand this is the most damning of allâof 15- to 17-year-old Indigenous Australians in the labour force are either unemployed or on CDEP. Not only are Indigenous Australians dropping out of school at twice the rate of other students, but their rates of literacy and numeracy are far below national standards. Shamefully for this government, the number attending university has gone backwards since 1999.</para>
<para>This damning evidence points to a growing crisis in Indigenous education and training. Access to a decent education is absolutely critical to improving the lives of all Australians, and this is particularly the case for Indigenous Australians. This government should have Indigenous education at the top of its list of priorities. The government should be working as hard as it can to reduce the shocking disparities in the educational outcomes of Indigenous Australians but sadly, after nine very long years, they are still falling short.</para>
<para>The <inline ref="R2356">Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2005</inline> concerns appropriations for two government measures, which Labor will support. The first is a new tutorial assistance scheme for Indigenous students, and the second is a transfer of funds from the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program to the Commonwealth-State Training Funding Agreement. The first measure is a tutorial assistance program with $7.2 million in funding providing Indigenous students from remote communities with new tutorial support in their first year of schooling when they move to a non-remote location to continue their education. These students will receive up to four hours tuition a week for up to 32 weeks in their first year away from home. The second measure gives effect to a transfer of vocational education and training fundsâ$10.9 million in totalâfrom the targeted Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program into the general Commonwealth-State Training Funding Agreement.</para>
<para>This transfer forms part of the reallocation of funding identified in the Commonwealthâs latest training agreement offered to the states and territories. Most of the money in this new offer is in reallocations of this sort. This funding is currently provided to four independent Indigenous vocational and technical education providers as transitional assistance under the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Program. Under the proposed terms of the Commonwealth-state funding agreement, state and territory governments will be required to match the funding. According to the office of Minister Nelson, the Minister for Education, Science and Training, the $10.9 million has already been included in the $4.4 billion appropriations proposed in the <inline ref="R2340">Skilling Australia's Workforce Bill 2005</inline>, which is also currently before the House. Labor would certainly be seeking a guarantee from the ministerâand I hope he will give this guarantee in his response to the billâthat the level of spending on Indigenous training will be increased as a result of these changes.</para>
<para>The net effect of these two measures is, unfortunately, to decrease the moneys appropriated by the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 by $3.7 million. This governmentâs performance in Indigenous education, as demonstrated in the outcomes I described earlier, has been nothing short of woeful. From this education minister, of course, we are used to hearing an abundance of platitudes but, I am very sorry to say, scant action. Given the governmentâs disregard for this important area, I move:</para>

<para class="block">Minister Nelson, unfortunately, could not even make it into the House to introduce this bill, but more damning than that has been his complete failure to engage with the national agenda around Indigenous education. The last meeting of Australiaâs education ministers was in Canberra just three weeks ago. They dedicated an entire day to Indigenous education, but they had to proceed without the federal education minister. His nonattendance shows a shocking lack of commitment to Indigenous education. It was an insult to Indigenous Australians, despite this very special seminar having been planned for almost 18 months. The day took place only five minutes away from Parliament House but it seems it would have taken just too much effort for him to attend. And this is the minister who has presided over the following: the national school retention rate for Indigenous students is 39 per centâ39 per cent of Indigenous students stay on to year 12. Contrast that with the rate for the whole country, where 76 per cent of students stay on to year 12. What a shameful result from this education minister.</para>
<para>But, even when Indigenous students are at school, they are not reaching the standard of education that people need to survive and prosper in this country. Of course, for many Indigenous students and their families, half the battle is just getting to school. In January, the Productivity Commission published some shocking statistics. The results of the year 3 and year 5 reading, writing and literacy benchmark testing tells us that around 20 per cent fewer Indigenous students are meeting the benchmark than the community as a whole. Whereas 90 to 94 per cent of the community as a whole meets the benchmark, between 63 and 80 per cent of Indigenous students are getting there. In his media release yesterday, the Minister for Education, Science and Training asked:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Why is it that our childrenâs reading and writing standards fall when they move from primary through to high school?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This minister should stop asking these sorts of questions and start acting like a minister and address these enormous inequalities. Seventy-two per cent of Indigenous students meet the benchmark at year 3, but only 67 per cent are able to meet the benchmark two years later. The decline is even more pronounced for numeracy where 80 per cent of students are at the benchmark in year 3 but it falls to a staggering 63 per cent by year 5. This is a massive 26 percentage points behind the 90 per cent achieved by the population as a wholeâonce again a shameful result. It is a shameful result from this minister, who talks a lot but is clearly not able to achieve any improved results.</para>
<para>The government know that they have botched the changes to the Aboriginal Student Support and Parent Awareness program and the Indigenous Tutorial Assistance Program. These programs, which were providing important resources to Indigenous schools, have been affected by major changes introduced by this government in the very recent past. This has resulted in the stopping of the flow of funds to Indigenous students, which has meant funding cuts to Indigenous students in our cities and towns. So this governmentâs changes to these very important programs, the ASSPA program and ITAS, are seriously disadvantaging Indigenous students and their surrounding communities.</para>
<para>The governmentâs implementation of the ASSPA changes have stopped the flow of money to schools, leaving Indigenous students around the country stranded. These changes result directly from the government deciding to shift funding from a per student entitlement to a two-stage bureaucratic application process. That is why Indigenous students in our schools are currently missing out on much needed funding. This additional bureaucratic red tape is alienating Indigenous communities, which means that many school services and programs that are currently in place are unfortunately now under threat. It is just outrageous that this government is making it even harder for Indigenous schools and students to get desperately needed funding support. Why is it that they have to go through these bureaucratic hoops to get money that everybody knows they desperately need?</para>
<para>The governmentâs changes to the ITAS program will result in less funding and therefore fewer students receiving assistance. Students should not have to fail the year 3 benchmark test before they get literacy support. Yet, that is the direct result of this governmentâs changes to that program. Everyone in this House should know that early support is essential for any child who is having trouble learning to read, and this is particularly the case if we are to seriously address Indigenous literacy problems.</para>
<para>Less literacy support for Indigenous students, especially in their early years, will only increase the educational disadvantage that Indigenous Australians already grapple with. We know that the scale of odds stacked against Indigenous students is extraordinary. Even when young Indigenous people leave school to undertake further education and training, their situation is far worse than that of other Australians. As I mentioned before, the rate at which Indigenous students are entering vocational education and training has dropped significantly in the last six years. It is not only Indigenous students in schools but also young Indigenous people in vocational education and training who are losing out because of this governmentâs failure to do the really serious hard work that needs to be done to turn around this shocking level of disadvantage.</para>
<para>A national report to parliament on Indigenous education and training in 2003, released earlier this year, found serious problems in Indigenous vocational education and training, including the alarming fact that the overall number of Indigenous VET enrolments fell for the first time since the 1990s. Between 2002 and 2003, when the current education minister had the portfolio, the total number of Indigenous VET enrolments fell. It went backwards. There has been a fall in enrolments of 2.8 per cent while this minister has had the job.</para>
<para>We all know in this country how critical skills training is in developing the capacity of individuals; but, in Indigenous communities, it is so important for the community and the individual if they are to build a better future. For our most disadvantaged Australians we have to do more to improve their current and future prospects. The level and quality of Indigenous engagement in vocational education and training is unacceptably poor.</para>
<para>We all know on this side of the Houseâand we have known it for a very long timeâthat reconciliation is linked to economic prosperity. Advancing sustainable economic prosperity for Indigenous Australians requires a commitment to, and investment in, building a skills and knowledge base within Indigenous communities. One way the government can make a real difference is to boost the level of skill development within these communities through our vocational training sector. Increases in Indigenous participation and outcomes must be realised if we are to move our reconciliation agenda forward.</para>
<para>Not only have Indigenous VET enrolments fallen but Indigenous students are underrepresented in course completions. These figures are also just shocking. The pass rate in VET assessment for Indigenous students is 64 per cent compared to 77 per cent for the rest of the population. While making up 3.4 per cent of the student population, overall course completions by Indigenous students made up only 2.5 per cent of the Australian Qualifications Framework level course completions in 2003. The <inline font-style="italic">National report to parliament on Indigenous education and training 2003</inline> revealed:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">One of the main measures of success in VET institutions in the IESIPâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">the Indigenous Education Strategic Initiatives Programâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">performance framework is the module or competency completion rate (MCR). In 2003 the overall MCR was 68.8% ... This compares to a non-Indigenous rate of 81.7%.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is a 12.9 per cent gap between module completion rates for Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. It is also the case that Indigenous students are much more likely than non-Indigenous students to be in AQF certificate I and II coursesâthe lower level courses. The comparison is 34.6 per cent for Indigenous students compared to just over 15 per cent for non-Indigenous students. The national report to parliament shows that, sadly, there has been little movement from lowerâthat is, certificate I and II coursesâto higher certificate III and above qualifications by Indigenous students. When Indigenous students are enrolled in higher level qualifications, their completion rates are drastically lower than the rest of the population. Completions of new apprenticeships at AQF III and IV were 49 per cent for Indigenous students compared to the non-Indigenous student rate of 74 per cent.</para>
<para>All of these figures show how this government has to get serious and back up its talk about getting young Indigenous people into TAFE with extra TAFE places and support. As the member for Lingiari will know only too well, there is absolutely no use in just giving a story to a newspaper as a cheap media stunt and not following it up with properly thought out and fully costed policy.</para>
<para>The governmentâs proposal, which was given to the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> in early April, said that the Howard government wants young Aboriginal people who drop out of school to attend training courses. That sounds like a good idea. But, of course, the minister failed to specify anything. There was nothing specific. There was no new funding, no extra TAFE places and no tailored support for Indigenous studentsânothing. Nothing went with it. He just said, âThis should happen.â He seems to forget that he is the minister and he should take responsibility for actually fixing the inequality that exists in vocational education and training for Indigenous students.</para>
<para>So, for this to be anything more than just a meaningless thought bubble from the education minister, we need to see increased funding for vocational education and training, additional TAFE places and support for Indigenous Australians, especially those in regional and remote parts of the country. We know already that 15,000 young people are turned away from TAFE each year because there are not enough places. So where on earth does the minister think these additional Indigenous students are going to go when we already have 15,000 young people turned away? If this government wants to insist that more young Indigenous Australians occupy TAFE places, it has to actually make sure they exist; otherwise, it is just another thought bubble coming out of the head of this education minister.</para>
<para>We certainly support the idea of more young Indigenous students going into TAFE and training. We think it is a terrific idea. In fact, Labor put forward a policy before the last election that said all young Australians, including young Indigenous Australians, must be in work associated with subsidised training, in full-time training or at school. Laborâs view is that no young person should be unemployed. We want them all engaged in the community. But, of course, we did not just say it; we were proposing to provide additional TAFE places, mentors in our schools, subsidised training for young people at work and so many other additional practical things that would have made our policy a reality.</para>
<para>What do we get from this government? The latest training funding offer to the states and territories does not include growth funding for additional TAFE places. There is not any growth funding; there is just the reallocation of funding that is partly contained in the bill we are debating. Not only are 15,000 young people being turned away from TAFE but there is no effort by this government to expand funding for vocational education and training to make sure that Indigenous and non-Indigenous students get the training that they want.</para>
<para>The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics report on the population characteristics of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians showed that Indigenous Australians are severely disadvantaged when it comes to accessing employment, education and training. You would hope that this report would have been a wake-up call to this government. The report found that Indigenous Australians are twice as likely as non-Indigenous people to have left school before completing year 10 and half as likely to have completed year 12. Also, Indigenous Australians aged 18 to 24 are less than a quarter as likely as their non-Indigenous counterparts to go to university. All of these facts have come out of the Australian Bureau of Statistics report just released.</para>
<para>All of these things are the direct result of this government taking its eye completely off the ball when it comes to Indigenous education and training. Indigenous people are nearly five times more likely to be unemployed compared to non-Indigenous Australians when CDEP recipients are included. Between 1996 and 2001 the total number of unemployed Indigenous Australians increased by nearly 17.5 per cent when CDEP recipients are included. I hope the Minister for Workforce Participation, who is at the table, intends to do something about that.</para>
<para>Almost half of the 15- to 17-year-old Indigenous Australians in the labour force are either unemployed or on CDEP. That is the record of this governmentâhalf the number of teenage Indigenous Australians are unemployed. Over 40 per cent of 18- to 24-year-old Indigenous Australians in the labour force are either unemployed or receiving CDEP.Â  The average weekly income of Indigenous Australians is $226 per week compared to non-Indigenous Australians who, on average, earn $380 per week. These outcomes are a disgrace and this government must know it has to do better.</para>
<para>Unlike this government, the Labor Party took to the last election many policies that demonstrated our very serious commitment to Indigenous education and training. I have already mentioned the youth guarantee. In addition to that our schools policy included an additional $179 million in targeted support for Indigenous school students. Our policy included programs to improve school attendance and basic skills. We wanted to support the development of culturally relevant curricula, teaching materials and multimedia. We wanted to support Indigenous languages in our schools.</para>
<para>Our approach of supporting education and training through mentoring is also very important in Indigenous communities. Our policy included special support for Indigenous teachers because we know that Indigenous people want more of their own people teaching their children and young people. I have no doubt that it would have an enormous impact on people to see the leaders of Indigenous communities in their classrooms. We also know that Indigenous teachers and teacher education students need support, especially if they are to return to their own communities. I thank the member for Lingiari for taking me to a number of communities in his electorate where that point was made very clear to me.</para>
<para>Labor included in our policy $46 million for new pathways for Indigenous teachers and professional support for those teachers, including the building of networks to recruit and support them. These are all practical initiatives that this government could pick up if they were serious about addressing these terrible inequalities. Laborâs policy included $87 million to improve capital and ICT infrastructure for Indigenous students. If you go out to some of the Indigenous communities in the electorate of the member for Lingiari you will see the state of some of the schools. They are a national disgrace. This government should be putting capital funding into them to make sure that the children in those schools get decent buildings in which to learn. In some places in the Northern Territory there are no secondary schools. The children have to go far away from home to go to a secondary school.</para>
<para>Those are the substantial commitments that the Labor Party made. They were substantial, detailed commitments to make a real start in addressing the crisis in Indigenous education. As Kim Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, said earlier this week in his speech to the National Reconciliation Planning Workshop:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Leadership means admitting that weâre still failing Indigenous Australians and we have to find a better way.</para>

<para class="block">I certainly hope everyone speaking here in this debate will admit that. I think the Leader of the Opposition is rightâwe have to find a better way. As a society we cannot keep ignoring the evidence that points to ongoing disasters in Indigenous education and training. This government is here now and it needs to find this better way; otherwise these horrific statistics, which indicate gross inequality in our community, will just get worse.</para>

<para>âIn her speech on the <inline ref="R2356">Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2005</inline> the member for Jagajaga made another contribution of the kind which we have come to expect from herâone of endless rhetoric and abuse. She has given us a 30-minute recital of statistics, cliches and shallow assessments but no solutions other than throwing money at endless programs. That is the only thing that the Labor Party have on their plate. It is the only answer they have. It is a further example of the policy laziness of the opposition. The Labor Party have a policy vacuum in this area and in many other areas. They have made no attempt, in this very critical area of our community, to ascertain why the Indigenous community is bedevilled with chronic societal problems which militate against successful education outcomes. We need to get beyond just throwing money at the problem. The Labor Party had 13 years of trying to find solutions, which involved throwing money at the problem. But that approach failed. This government are seeking to take a much wider view of the problems bedevilling Indigenous communities to see if we can come up with durable and effective solutions.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Education is the foundation of freedom and personal development for Indigenous Australians, as it is for the broader Australian community. Without education the options open to people throughout life are invariably narrow and very limited. Without education, ignorance and lack of opportunity predominate. The lack of education becomes a breeding ground for low self-esteem and low self-discipline, prejudice, self-justification, antisocial behaviour, the growth of a victim mentality and the non-realisation of the potential that exists within each and every one of us. For this reason, quality primary and secondary education is fundamental to tackling the chronic disadvantage and aimless circumstance confronting so many in our Indigenous communities.</para>
<para>To begin with, the simple discipline of attending school five days a week for six to seven hours a day, taking some lunch, doing some homework, participating constructively in the classroom, playing some sport and participating in other non-academic activities for 10 to 12 years, slowly but surely instils in individuals the life skills, routines, self-confidence and reading and writing skills to go on to further study, or to take on a trade or generally enter the work force.</para>
<para>Sadly, many in our Indigenous communities have for a long time been denied the chance to develop these necessary life skills. While adequate resources are a necessary and very important part of dealing with thisâand the coalition government over 9Â½ years has massively increased the money going to our Aboriginal communitiesâin many instances, other factors are operating to prevent young Aboriginal people from getting a strong educational grounding and experience. Serious disruption in the home and community, substance and physical abuse, a mendicant welfare mentality which fosters an environment where self-responsibility and self-discipline is leached out of a community, very few good role models and many bad ones, and a corresponding disregard for one another are not uncommon. This environment makes it extremely tough for Aboriginal students not only to persist in education but also to reach a standard at primary school that gives them a chance to fit in and keep up at secondary school. The seeds of failure are sown early in the lives of so many young Aboriginal people, long before they have any real say in it.</para>
<para>There are no easy answers. One initiative worth watching is a trial project at the Coen State School in the middle of Cape York. The Computer Culture trial is being run by an Indigenous organisation, Noel Pearsonâs Cape York Partnerships, with the support of a range of government and commercial interests, including very strong support from Westpac. This program is directed at primary-age school children, using multimedia digital technology to capture stories and traditional cultures, and is a core component of the curriculum. This approach has resulted in the active and regular involvement of parents and grandparents in the classroom and has prompted excitement and engagement, which is extremely powerful and constructive.</para>
<para>In the process of capturing the rich inheritance of Aboriginal history and culture in a very interactive, creative and repeatable way, this program is giving primary school students at Coen a strong sense of history and identity while educating them in literacy, numeracy and technical skills; engaging and educating their extended families; encouraging them to complete major projects and homework; and exposing them and their families to the joys and very personal achievements of learning. This can set kids up to achieve their full potential and it enables them to have a good knowledge of the history, customs and languages of their own community, while giving them the educational basis and life skills to cope within the broader Australian community and, in doing so, have the best of both worlds.</para>
<para>Programs such as these are powerful and hold great potential, but they are not enough. Money alone is not the answer. In many cases, we are throwing good money after bad, because the causes of the social and cultural disintegration of many remote Indigenous communities are not being addressed and have failed to be addressed over decades. Restoring self-esteem and personal responsibility is the key. Participation in primary education is one of the basic means of building life skills and restoring a sense of personal responsibility and obligation. For starters, regular attendance at school is a must. Parents must take responsibility for ensuring the regular participation of their children at school. Many do not, because long-term welfare dependency has fostered a state of mind which is an anathema to personal responsibility and obligation. If they do not shoulder these fundamental parental responsibilities there need to be consequences through either denial of or restrictions on financial or other entitlements. The incentives must change if these parents are to shoulder these critical obligations to their children.</para>
<para>These are the sorts of deep societal problems that have driven the focus of this governmentâs approach to Aboriginal affairs. The problems are much too broad just to throw money at them. We have to engage with the Aboriginal community and try to deal with these underlying problems, the passive dependency that has grown out of many decades of welfare without obligation. The coalition government has embarked on a wide range of reforms, including the shared responsibility agreements, in close operation with the Aboriginal community to seek to deal with the chronic attitudinal problems induced by passive welfare over three decades.</para>
<para>The bill before the House is focused on the Indigenous children from remote communities who have had parental support and the opportunity to get through primary school and have reached a standard where they can hope to fit in at year 8 in a secondary boarding school. There are many primary kids who are still struggling to reach that standard. This bill is focused on those who have had the support and opportunity to get through primary school to reach a year 8 standard and who are well equipped to go on to secondary boarding school. At the moment, only 38 per cent of Indigenous students who commence secondary school continue to year 12, compared to 76 per cent of non-Indigenous students. That percentage could be expected to be much lower for Indigenous students from remote communities.</para>
<para>In the past, boarding schools have played a prominent role in the successful secondary education of both Indigenous and non-Indigenous students from remote areas of Australia. This has been the case because the financial and practical reality is that quality secondary education is extremely difficultâin nearly all cases, it is not possibleâin remote communities. As the primary school issue is progressively addressed by both state and Commonwealth governments with the communities themselves and the leadership of the Aboriginal communityâwho are very clearly coming to understand the importance of addressing the passive welfare problem, the gross dependence and the impact that this has on the lives, attitudes, motivations, self-confidence and self-esteem of individuals within these communitiesâpolicy will focus more and more on providing scholarships for Indigenous students from remote areas to attend quality secondary schooling in non-remote areas. In this way, students will have the teachers, the facilities and the exposure to the broader Australian community which will give them the chance to meet their full potential and to make the most of their lives by equipping them with the skills and education to move more freely and comfortably between their own communities and the broader Australian community and contribute effectively to both.</para>
<para>This bill seeks to assist this policy direction by funding tutorial support for an estimated 2,400 Indigenous students in their first year of boarding school. The aim is to help these students cope with their studies and ensure they reach a standard where they can fit in comfortably with others in the class who may have had a better basis of education in their primary school years.</para>
<para>It is an important piece of legislation to complement the raft of other initiatives that this government is taking and the efforts that are being made in close cooperation with the Aboriginal community. We are not just throwing money at problems. This has been the narrow focus and the way in which governments in the past have sought to shift responsibility back to others, to unload responsibility and not take responsibility for solving these problems. There are no easy answers in this area. This government has sought to do the hard things and work with the community to find the fundamental problems and causes of the real difficulties we have with ensuring our Aboriginal children have the same educational opportunities and make the most of education in the same way as the rest of the community. I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para>âI am somewhat surprised at the contribution from the member for Goldstein, partly because I thought he knew better. The attack he has made on the contribution of the shadow minister, Ms Macklin, demonstrates not only ignorance but also failure to even want to learn about the issues. He attacked the shadow minister for illustrating the parlous state of Aboriginal education in Australia and the very poor educational outcomes that they are achieving. She painted a word picture using data about this tremendous obligation that we have in this country to address the primary disadvantage of Indigenous Australians in educational achievement. What we got from the member for Goldstein was some sort of apology for the governmentâs failure to provide adequate resources to address the issue. Apologetically, almost, he said that the answer to this question was, largely, in the case of secondary kids, to send them away from their homes to schools. It is about time the member for Goldstein actually looked, listened and learnt. Walk around the country. Go to the communities that I work in and come back and then tell the story.</para>

<para>âOh, you have been to these communities; you have obviously learnt nothing and understood nothing. What we know as a result of the contribution from the member for Goldstein is that the apologists of the government are saying that it is all someone elseâs fault. Let me ask the member for Goldstein this question: is it the responsibility of Indigenous parents who live in remote communities to provide access to schools in their communities? Whose responsibility is that? Who has the responsibility to provide Indigenous people with housing, health and education facilities? Who has that responsibility? Who has the responsibility to make sure every kid in Australia has access to a school or training opportunities? From the member for Goldsteinâs contribution, it appears that it is the responsibility of the parents.</para>

<para>I live here in Narrabundah where I was brought up as a kid. There is a state school down the road and a Catholic school up on the corner. Those schools were provided. Yet in some communities in the Northern Territory we know there are 3,000 to 5,000 young people over the age of 13 who have no educational opportunities. No service is being provided for them. Is that their responsibility? Who must accept the responsibility for provision of these fundamental civic and human rights?</para>

<para>âDo not take umbrage, my friend, just understand. The story is clear. You invited this. In the case of the Northern Territory there were 27 years of indolence and an absolute denial of the right of Indigenous Australians to educational opportunities. That is what happened. Not one state school in the Northern Territory had any secondary facilities when the CLP lost government in 2001. Minister, whose responsibility is that? You said it is the states. It might be the states. Who was in power at the time? Which state government? Which party was in power? The CLP. Look at meâthe CLP, the conservatives. They were responsible.</para>

<para>âMr Deputy Speaker Causley, you wonder, donât you? I do. The minister comes in here blissfully ignorant of what has been going on in the past and makes these absurd statements. Earlier this week we had the Prime Minister address a reconciliation conference down at Old Parliament House. He made a number of statements and I want to repeat some of them. He said:</para>

<quote>
<para class="block">I simply, along with Iâm sure all of you, want an Australia where an Aboriginal childâwhether born in a remote community or in one of our cities or in regional centresâcan grow up and reach their full potential in life. I want that child to be loved and nurtured and morally guided, to be healthy, educated, optimistic, ambitious and to feel a full part of the Australian community.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Hear, hear! Great. Tremendous. But what has he done about it? What have the government done about it? I can tell you what they have done about it: nothing. What have they done to address the parlous state of health, education, housing, employment opportunitiesâthe intrinsic thingsâfor Indigenous people in Australia? The answer is nought. They have said, âThese responsibility agreements known as SRAs will achieve everything.â They will not. I have been dealing with Indigenous Australians in the bush for nigh on 30 years and I can tell you one thing: most of the people I have met are committed to getting their children educated. There are all sorts of problems which they confront, and you illustrated some of them. But let me tell you: they are committed. They want their kids to learn. They may themselves, but in many cases do not, have an educational background. But what they do know is that they want their kids to be able to achieve. They want their kids to be able to live in the two cultures that they need: the dominant culture as well as their own culture. They understand the importance of education.</para>
<para>The member for Goldstein said words to the effect, âKids need discipline; they need to be able to go to school with lunch, to go home, to do a bit of homework and to play some sport.â Terrific sentiments. The Prime Minister went to Wadeye recently. At Wadeye, he waxed lyrical about the swimming pool that was built and that, as a result of the swimming pool, school attendance has gone up. Let me ask these questions: did he bother to look at the housing situation at Wadeye? Did he visit any of the homes where house occupancy is 17 or 20 people in a three-bedroom home? Did he then conclude that it was possible for the kids to go home and (1) to get well nourished and (2) to do their homework? Are you serious? The only way to address these issues is by dint of a partnership between the governments and the community. That is clear. The only way it will be achieved in the endâonce agreement is reached on what the solutions areâis for the government to put its hand in its pockets. Resources will be needed. You cannot provide an education without a school. You cannot provide an education without school books and teachers. You need to train these people. The member for Goldstein says: âThat is all right. We do not need them. We do not need resources.â</para>
<para>What we see in the <inline ref="R2356">Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2005</inline> is the government actually decreasing expenditure on its specific education programs. I raise this issue because I think it is extremely serious that we have this government talking about practical reconciliation and we have the member Goldstein, and no doubt other members of the government, talking about the need for people to take personal responsibility without understanding that they want to. I do not know of any community where people do not want to. But what they want is a fair share. They want their rights as citizens to the health, housing, education, and training and employment opportunities which I have spoken about and which this government is denying them. The problem for the member for Goldstein is that the word picture which was painted by the shadow minister adequately illustrates the failure of the government to address these issues.</para>
<para>You talked about personal responsibility and passive welfareâand I assume you were talking about CDEP. You may be. If not, let me give you a bit of history. CDEP was an effort by Indigenous Australians to say to the government, âWe do not like the idea of the dole. We do not like the idea of our people getting money for no purpose. We do not like the idea because we can see how people spend their money. They are not doing anything. They are indolent.â So what did the government do with a good policy response in the early seventies? It said, âLet us develop a program.â So it developed CDEP. What was it? It was an attempt by the community to accept its collective and individual obligations to the Australian taxpayers by saying to the government, âYou give us CDEP instead of unemployment benefits and we will work for the money.â Is that passive welfare? That is what the people did; that was their initiative. Let us not have any of this rewriting of history. Let us not have any of this parading of victimisation of Indigenous Australians. Let us not blame them for the governmentâs indolence, because it is the government that is responsible. We know about the responsibility of the minister.</para>
<para>The shadow minister talked about the changes to ASSPA, the Aboriginal Student Support and Parent Awareness program, and to ATAS, the Aboriginal Tutorial Assistance Scheme. Last year in this very same debate we discussed these issues. In the course of that debate I talked about the concerns the community that I represent has about the way in which the government is going about implementing these changes and what they would mean to the community. I said at the time, at least in part, that some of the parentsâ concerns were that they believed programs run by ASSPA directly affected student attendance, that parents would not have a voice in the new structure and that the new structure would not be user-friendly like the then current form in which the community was able to address issues as they arose.</para>
<para>How right they were. We know now that no funds have been released to any school in my electorate as a result of the substitute program for ASSPA this year. We know that the ASSPA committees do not operate. They are not funded to operate. So the resources that were going to schools for special programs agreed to in decisions made by the school community are no longer being funded. I ask the member for Goldstein: who takes responsibility for that? Do the parents take responsibility for that? After all, they were the ones making the decisions about how the money was to be spent. Now it is a two-stage bureaucratic process. And who makes the decisions now? Bureaucrats with no educational training, no educational background and no professional understanding of the conditions in which these kids live. Let us be very clear about it: this is what is happening. Not one of these schools has received funding this year. So the programs that were helping have now been cut.</para>
<para>Then we have the Aboriginal Tutorial Assistance Program, which is now called ITAS. We heard the shadow minister talk about the stupidity of only applying these funds after kids have failed tests at years three, five or seven. What giant brain worked out that the best way to fix the early educational problems of kids was to only give them additional resources for tutorial assistance after they have failed tests? What brilliant mind thought that up? I have been a teacherâthere are a number of teachers in this Houseâand I do not know one teacher or one person with any experience in the education system who would argue that the best way to provide early intervention is to wait until kids fail tests. What a ludicrous statement; what a ludicrous thing to even be contemplating. What we should be saying is that these children need assistance from the day they walk into the school and if the teachers identify the special need then those resources should be provided. I say to the member for Goldstein as he leaves the chamber: do not walk out blindly; listen and learn, because at some point in your life you might understand a few things.</para>
<para>The other point I want to make is about the educational framework which the government is intending to set up. I heard the minister talking in question time this afternoon about reporting on student achievements. We have had the shadow minister point out how low the achievement levels are in Indigenous communities. Let me ask this question: what contemplation has there been by the government of the cultural appropriateness of the programs they are operating? It is fine to talk about the need for mathematics and English literacy, but what about the cultural imperatives that exist in many of these communities? The tenor I get from the government is that they want Indigenous communities to suppress their cultural priorities and put them as a second-tier priority. The government want them to have the priorities that the government set, not the priorities the communities want.</para>
<para>We talk about these agreements between the government and communitiesâthis is extremely importantâbut one thing I am certain of is that the primary objective of people in the communities in which I work, in the bush, in Alice Springs and around the electorate of Lingiari, is to maintain their cultural integrity. They want to make sure that their kids understand their cultural obligations. It is very important that those people providing educational services to these communities also understand these cultural obligations. The fact is, of course, that the government show no appreciation of the cultural obligations or priorities of these communities. They say, âOne size fits all. If you want to apply for funds, then apply for themâwe will make a decision here in Canberra through the bureaucratic processes.â They will not be made at the community level. They will not be made identifying what the community sees as its priorities. They will be made by the government, 3,000 kilometres away from where the decision should be made.</para>
<para>I think it is about time the government re-examined its priorities and started to understand its obligations to these Australian citizens. It is no longer good enough to just lay blame. Yes, it is true that parents need to take greater responsibility and, yes, it is true that in many communities there are problems with substance abuse. I visit these communities regularlyâI have done so since 1977. I have seen people die from petrol sniffing. I have seen people die from alcoholism. I have seen people who were massively abused. There is no doubt that it is a sorrowful picture, but I do not think the way to achieve a better outcome is to just blame. The way to achieve better outcomes is through a partnershipânot an unequal partnership where the government comes in and says, âWe are happy to make an agreement with you and we are happy to provide you with resources, provided you do what we want.â That is not the sort of partnership that should exist. It is a very unequal relationship.</para>
<para>As Patrick Dodson said earlier this week on ABC TV and radio, he sees these SRAs as assimilationist. They are. They do what I said previously. They take no account of the cultural imperatives of Indigenous Australians, because they are a bureaucratic response to a problem which has been identified at the community level and is seen as a national concern. The bottom line is that, in the context of this bill, there has been no effort by the government to provide the resources to adequately address the educational deficiencies confronting Indigenous Australians across this nation. There has been no effort made and no additional resources put in. We heard the glib comments made by the Prime Minister at the reconciliation conference earlier this week, we will no doubt get comments from the Minister for Education, Science and Training about what he is doing to improve outcomes for Indigenous Australians, but we know they are doing very little.</para>
<para>On the other hand, there is an election coming up in the Northern Territory on 18 June. I pointed out earlier that in 2001, when the Labor Party won after 27 years of conservative government in the Northern Territory, there was not one Indigenous community with a high schoolânot one. I am pleased to be able to announce that as a result of expenditure and policy changes by the current governmentâand I say this to the Minister for Workforce Participation, across the tableâthey now have secondary school facilities at Minyerri, Kalkarindji, Maningrida, Shepherdson College and Manyallaluk. There will be significant upgrades of Pupanya and Utopia, and a secondary program is being operated at Yuendumu and other places. These were not being done under the CLP government</para>

<para>âI must say I was absolutely appalled by the contribution made by the honourable member for Lingiari on the <inline ref="R2356">Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Amendment Bill 2005</inline>. The Labor Party were in office for very many years and the situation of Indigenous disadvantage did not improve. We saw where a lot of money was wasted in the area of Indigenous Affairs. Their solution simply always was to throw money at the problem. Unfortunately there was not the same level of accountability with respect to moneys spent on Indigenous Affairs as in other areas, therefore that made it very difficult, when we were elected in 1996, for us to gain the community support we needed to improve Aboriginal health outcomes. This government has a very proud record in the area of Indigenous Affairs. All of us want to see Indigenous disadvantage removed. All of us want to see Indigenous males live for the same length of time as other Australian males. The Labor Party stand condemned.</para>

<para class="block">... I am advised at this point in timeâand I seek to make the point clear that I am advised and I can only report to the best of my knowledgeâthat there are potentially two individuals who might have fitted that category. One no longer has an ASICâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">that is, an aviation security identification cardâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The other does. It relates to an offence committed in about 1980. The individual involved served his time and a number of years lapsed, resulting in that conviction having been spent. In those circumstances, under state and Commonwealth lawâas I think the Leader of the Opposition and, I hope, the shadow minister who asked the former question would knowâtheir previous misdemeanours must be overlooked. They cannot be used to discriminate against people in the workplace.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The minister is wrong on that count. Spent conviction schemes allow criminal records of offenders to be amended after certain periods of timeâthat is trueâand the idea is that spent conviction schemes allow former offenders to wipe the slate clean after a certain period of time depending on the offence. In Australia, the Commonwealth spent conviction scheme was introduced in 1990. It is in the Commonwealth Crimes Act at page 425. But under the Commonwealth and Queensland legislation, only convictions to which a sentence of imprisonment of 30 months or less has been imposed can become spent.</para>
<para>Spent conviction legislation also exists in all states and territories except South Australia and Victoria, where there are administrative guidelines about the disclosure of criminal convictions. In all jurisdictions except Western Australia, spent conviction legislation applies only to less serious offences, not to offences that relate to eight years imprisonment in relation to drug matters. In Western Australia spent conviction legislation applies to all offences except those with a penalty which includes a sentence of life imprisonment. In Western Australia, serious convictions become spent only upon application to and approval by the District Court where the making of an order is at the discretion of the judge. In terms of New South Wales, the ACT, the Northern Territory and Tasmania, only convictions for which a sentence of imprisonment of six months or less has been imposed can become spent.</para>
<para>So the minister is wrong when he asserts in question time today that it is automatic in relation to Commonwealth and state law that convictions become spent and must be overlooked, especially when the factâand he admits thisâis it was a conviction in 1980. I practised in criminal law before I came into parliament. I am aware of the law. In Western Australia, in the only jurisdiction that could allow this, it needs to be applied for by a District Court judge and it is discretionary; it is not automatic.</para>
<para>I think the minister is confused. Indeed there is a wonderful report by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, a discussion paper issued in December 2004, that talks about discrimination in employment on the basis of a criminal record. At the moment the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General is considering the development of a national uniform model. But this minister is wrong as to what he asserts in question time today and he should come back into the House to correct the record, either tonight or tomorrow, because he is confused. Indeed there are differences as to spent conviction across the board. The facts as they are known are that someone has served eight years for drug offences and is still working at Sydney airport, and this minister asserts that it is a spent conviction. He is wrong, and I assert that he is wrong. He does not know the law when he tells this House in his answer that in effect it becomes a spent conviction and it must be overlooked.</para>
<para>I am not against rehabilitation. I am not against people getting jobs after they come out of jail. That is not the point that I am making. This is a serious matter and the minister needs to come back and tell the House which jurisdiction and what the penalty was that was served. The Minister for Workforce Participation, Mr Dutton, who is at the table, could do that in his stead, but the House needs to have it properly recorded. That is why I have risen to speak. I have not risen tonight on a spurious point. I think the minister is confused. I do not believe that someone who got eight years for drug offences has a spent conviction. That is just not the case. Do not confuse it with the other point about rehabilitationâthat is not what I am saying. I am saying the minister has to come back to explain. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âOnce more I rise in this place to illustrate the double standards of the Child Support Agency. I quote from a letter I received from Perth, Western Australia, from a person who is a constituent of one of my parliamentary colleagues, who is aware of the letter and is taking the matter up as his local member. I have spoken to the wife of the person who sent me this information and she and her husband are in concurrence with me raising this particular issue so that we can put on record just how bad the Child Support Agency is. The letter, dated 17 May 2005, says:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">Dear Mr Schultz</para>
<para class="block">I am a 38 year old married man with Three children, prior to my current marriage I was a single parent for six years, with sole custody of my oldest son, James.</para>
<para class="block">I met my current wife in 1996 and had a two year relationship before being married in 1998, we now have two children together. Myself, my wife and my three children lived together in our family home from 1998 until now.</para>
<para class="block">James recently decided he wanted to leave home and live with his mother Christina. Christina has also re-married with two children with her current Husband.</para>
<para class="block">After discussions with Christina it was decided that James could stay with her and her current family. James moved from our house to theirs on the 10<inline font-variant="superscript">th</inline> of April 2005. During my initial discussions with Christina she expressed that she didnât feel it was fair to take 18% of my salary. I told her I was willing to support James as I have done for the last 15 years and asked if we could agree on an amount to help her with James. Christina telephoned me on the 11<inline font-variant="superscript">th</inline> of April asking me to contact Child Support Agency as she had made an application to them. I am now expected to pay 18% of my gross income which was $106,000 in the 2003-2004 tax year.</para>
<para class="block">This works out to be approximately $275 per week and after waiting for 1 month to have the payment set up I am now paying an additional $60 per week for amounts owing, bringing the total to approximately $335 out of my weekly salary for the next 14 weeks. As James is 17 this payment will continue for 1 year and total an amount of $14,300. I consider these amounts excessive for a number of reasons, the first being that I have supported James for the last 15 years, paying for all his education, private tuition for school, doctors bills, dental bills, clothing, food, karate lessons, football fees, a house for him to live in and supporting him as a parent should. Whilst in return Christina paid a total of $2,300 over a period of 15 years, which are figures I have received from the Child Support Agency. Secondly, the amount I am paying is a disadvantage to my current family that I also have to support and as my youngest child is only three and needs fulltime care from his mother, making her unable to work at this point in time.</para>
<para class="block">Thirdly, as a woman, Christina has re-married, has a husband support her, works part-time, and also claims an excessive amount of child support, whilst only having paid $3.00 per week over 15 years to her first son. I have contacted the Child Support Agency regarding this issue and have pleaded my case to them, they seem to be under the impression I am trying to shy away from my responsibility to James, when in fact I never have in the past. The Child Support Agency have been very condescending to me over the phone, and the system seems to be out of touch with my case and with other people in my situation.</para>
<para class="block">I am writing to you, asking for help with my case and hope you can see why I feel I am being unfairly treated. I have always taken care of my responsibilities and feel I am now being penalised. I hope you will consider approaching the Child Support Agency with my case and appeal for a fairer child support amount.</para>
<para class="block">I await your reply.</para>
<para class="block">Regards, Anthony Bell</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Mr Bell can be assured that I will approach the Child Support Agency. I will approach the minister and, once again, I will illustrate very forcibly to the minister the double standards of the Child Support Agency. This man supported his son for 15 years and received a measly $3 a week from his former partner, and he is now being asked to contribute $335 a week for the next 12 months to support his son. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âLike the member for Banks, I am compelled to rise tonight because I was appalled today at question time by the Minister for Foreign Affairs mincing at the dispatch box, vacillating between supreme arrogance and extreme unction. It was all about Vivian Alvarez Solon, an Australian citizen who lived here for 13 years and who was deported to the Philippines in July 2001. The shadow minister asked this question:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">Does the minister recall telling the Australian people on 16 May this year, in relation to the Vivian Alvarez Solon case, âI can only say to you that as far as my department is concerned we didnât know anything about her case until the end of last month,â meaning the end of April 2005? Is the minister aware of a letter from the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and tabled in Senate estimates today that says that the immigration department has now âlearned of an exchange between the Queensland police missing persons unit and DFAT in September 2003â and that the papers we have received from DFAT relating to this exchange show that Queensland policeâin providing DFAT with the context of their requestâindicated that Ms Alvarez was actually an Australian citizen? Minister, is it not the case that, at the height of the public debate in this country on the Vivian Alvarez matter, on 16 May you misled the Australian people about when your department first knew that Vivian Alvarez was an Australian citizen, and why have you not corrected the record?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Mr Speaker, you witnessed the justification. There was no apology for the briefing note being wrong. The minister could not even say that he had launched an inquiry to find out why his department had misled him in that briefing note that he had relied on. This is all that the minister said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The fact is that I provided at that time the information that had been provided to me in a written submission from my department.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Minister, it was wrong! It has been proven to be wrong. Your department knew 18 months ago that we had deported an Australian citizen but it did absolutely nothing about it. What did the minister say? âI provided all the relevant papers to the Palmer inquiry.â</para>
<para>We know that the Palmer inquiry will deal with only the one case. The minister cannot even table the papers in this House. Vivian is an Australian Filipina. I say in this House that I am very proud of the Filipinos that live in my electorate. There are a lot of them living in my electorate, as there are in the member for Greenwayâs. There are other members in Western Sydney who have lots of Filipinos living in their electorates, and they cannot understand how a citizen who has lived for 13 years in this country can be deported. The minister is so arrogant that he will not even apologise for the incompetence of his department or the fact that he misled the Australian people. He is so arrogant. He will not apologise. He has not said to the parliament, âLook, Iâm upset about this and I have launched an inquiry.â There is no inquiry, Mr Speaker.</para>
<para>No-one on the other side wants to stand up and talk about this case or about the Filipinos in their electorates who are upset, who may have come here a very long time ago as refugees from a corrupt Marcos regime and who now fear that the very thing that happened to Cornelia Rau or to Vivian Alvarez can happen to them. I say it is an outrage. No citizen should live in fear of being deported. They should not have to witness an arrogant minister who refuses to apologise, thinks it is a laughing matter and wants to make a mockery of this place. I think it is an absolute disgrace. I know that Vivian was not from the establishment. She did not belong to the Adelaide Club or the Melbourne Club. She was not born with a silver spoon in her mouth. She was a battling Filipina who married an Australian and came to this country. She was deported, yet there has not been one word of sympathy, not one word of apology, not one bit of humility and no determination to get to the bottom of it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âTonight I rise to congratulate and thank the organisers of the Multicultural Family Festival that was held in Quakers Hill in Greenway over the weekend. Several communities were represented on the day, some of which were the Filipino, Indian, Lebanese, Chinese and Italian communities. The festival draws together ethnic communities to celebrate their diversity and to embrace life in multicultural Australia. I was privileged to be present at the celebration on Saturday and witnessed first-hand the connecting that was occurring.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This was a celebration that drew together children and families. It was wonderful to see them laughing and enjoying their day together. The spirit of community was evident for all to see. It was an event that was free to families, and that was absolutely fantastic. Children were catered for with face painting, jumping castles, Chinese calligraphy and dancing. The atmosphere was fantastic, with a variety of stalls, international food and fine cuisine. The festival was an opportunity to acknowledge and recognise the richness of the past and the cultural heritage of our ethnic groups.</para>
<para>But it was also about living together in the broader Australian community in harmony. One incredible example was a display by Hindi schoolchildren who performed on the day. Their performance consisted of two parts: firstly, a wonderful performance of traditional Hindu song with the children in their traditional dress. Following this, they sang a song they had written about Australia. It was truly amazing, full of laughter and joy.</para>
<para>The Multicultural Family Festival receives support from a number of local community organisations that should be congratulated for this. Without the assistance of these groups the festival would not be the success I witnessed over the weekend. The Quakers Hill Family Centre have been working to reach out to the local area for over a decade now. Their connection to their community was obvious on the weekend and evidenced by the number of different cultural groups present. It is important to acknowledge the support given to this event by the Australian Chinese Community, the Australian Kurdish Association, Nirimba TAFE, Quakers Hill Uniting Church, the Australian Lebanese Welfare Group, the Philippine-Australian Community Services, and the Blacktown Migrant Resource Centre. I specially want to acknowledge the partnership between Wesley Mission and the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan whose vision really has brought the community together. Their work in the area is truly worthy of commendation and I am proud to honour their work in this chamber.</para>
<para>Community is at its best when we all come together. Festivals such as this that draw together not just different community groups but, in particular, families are significant. These are projects and festivals that really define a community. It was wonderful to see the next generation participating. Often at these events the older generation are significantly more represented, but this was a festival that was truly family oriented. As a government we have acknowledged the importance that diversity plays in the Australian community and we will continue to support the work of such community based groups that provide such a valuable service.</para>
<para>Greenway, as I have mentioned before in this House, definitely has a vibrant, dynamic and exciting community. Community mindedness is part of what defines who we are. I am proud to support the work of the ethnic support groups in Greenway and I commend them wholeheartedly on the weekendâs Multicultural Family Festival. I look forward to many more events like this where the Blacktown Migrant Resource Centre, Quakers Hill Family Services and other significant ethnic groups and their leaders come together not just to contribute to one another and celebrate their differences but to celebrate harmony as well as looking to the future by providing an environment where the next generation can learn to value the diversity that we celebrate in this country.</para>

<name role="display">Mr MURPHY</name>
</talker>
<para>âOn behalf of my constituents in the inner west of Sydney and in my electorate of Lowe I raise yet again the very serious issue of aircraft noise emanating from Sydney airport. As this House is aware, Sydney Airport Corporation Ltd was sold to the Southern Cross Consortium, chiefly held by Macquarie Bank and affiliates, on 28 June 2002. Since that date Sydney airport has continued to expand beyond its ecologically sustainable limit. Principally, this fact is best demonstrated in the continuous failure of this government to fairly implement the long-term operating plan. I have spoken exhaustively on the failure of the Howard government to fulfil its promises to solve Sydney airportâs aircraft noise problems. The Howard government has not solved the problemâit sold the problem.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I note that for the month ended 30 April 2005 aircraft movements to the north of Sydney airport were 28.21 per cent of total aircraft movements. The long-term operating plan target for total aircraft movements to the north of Sydney airport is 17 per cent. Movements to the north frequently reach 30 per cent and have been as high as 33 per cent, nearly double the long-term operating plan target.</para>
<para>Sydney airportâs aircraft noise problems continue unabated. I raise the issue in the context of a recommendation to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services by the Sydney Airport Community Forum, SACF, that requested him to draft terms of reference for the commission of a consultant to review the long-term operating planâs performance. Environmental consultants Airways International were retained to perform this work, and last March Airways International handed down its report.</para>
<para>I stand here tonight to record that the Sydney Airport Community Forum is very disappointed with this report for many reasons. The report does not make recommendations as to how the long-term operating plan may be achieved. Nor does the report shed any light on the reasons why the long-term operating planâs aircraft movement targets cannot be achieved. Rather, the consultants refer, dishonestly, to the long-term operating plan as a âcommunity expectationâ and not a statutory instrument carrying the full weight of ministerial direction.</para>
<para>The long-term operating plan is not a mere community expectation. The long-term operating plan and its movement targets are the result of the operation of a statutory power, being section 16 of the Air Services Act. The minister has issued a ministerial direction under that power when directing Airservices Australia to fulfil its terms of reference in the making of the long-term operating plan. The terms of reference are supplemented by further terms of reference of the Implementation Monitoring Committee in which reaching the long-term operating plan targets is a prescribed outcome. Interestingly, Airways International has no knowledge of the Implementation Monitoring Committee terms of reference and makes no reference to those terms of reference in its report. Point 1 of the Implementation Monitoring Committee terms of reference states:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">To assist the achievement of the integrity, intent and TARGETS of the Sydney Airport Long Term Operating Plan, the Committee shall ... monitor the distribution of noise, flights paths and runways movements which arise out of the implementation of the Long Term Operating Planâ.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This House has heard enough of the spin, the obfuscation and glib terms of the minister and from the sculptured reports that fulfil his mission. He who pays the piper calls the tune. The minister is paying for the report, and the report predictably reports what the minister wants to read.</para>
<para>Thankfully, the Sydney Airport Community Forum is not blind, deaf or dumb. No, Minister, Sydney airportâs aircraft noise problems have not been substantially solved. No, Minister, the long-term operating plan targets are not mere community expectations. They are the result of ministerial direction on not one but two occasions in which the minister has exercised his statutory powers. It is upon these two well-founded facts that I can say in this House with absolute certainty that the community and constituents of Sydney have every legitimate expectation that the long-term operating plan must be implemented to its specifications.</para>
<para>That means the long-term operating plan targets must be reached. This is so, despite the fact that the long-term operating plan targets, to be fully implemented, may reduce the number of aircraft and ultimately the profitability of Southern Cross Consortium. Southern Cross knew of the long-term operating plan before they purchased the airport and cannot now deny its effectiveness or implementation. The real variable to implementing the long-term operating plan is not weather conditions, but aircraft demand. The long-term operating plan can be achieved, even if it means fewer planes. To put it bluntly, the government must honour its promises and put the citizens of Sydney first and the shareholders of Southern Cross Consortium and Macquarie Bank last. Moreover, it is time for a second airport for Sydney.</para>

<para>âI rise this evening to make reference to how proud I am of an industry in Wagga Wagga called Kurrajong Waratah. As their patron, I was proud to launch a report titled <inline font-style="italic">Growing old with a disabilityâwho cares?</inline> For almost 50 years Kurrajong Waratah has provided services for people living with a disability. They provide employment, accommodation, day and early intervention services to more than 400 babies, children and adults with a disability and their families in the Riverina and Murray regions.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This ageing concerns project was funded by Kurrajong Waratah due to concerns that they had about the ageing of many elderly parents who are caring for children and family members with a disability. Without action this is an issue that will only continue to worsen and result in a crisis for many of these families. I congratulate Kurrajong Waratah on taking this initiative. It is an issue that we do not like to discuss because it is very difficult, emotional and painful to have to embrace and confront these issues. But this report will assist families to have this discussion on ways in which assistance can and should be offered into the future.</para>
<para>It is only in recent years that we have seen this problem. People, including those with disabilities, are now living longer. Kurrajong Waratah has recognised that without research, discussion and early intervention a crisis will occur. This report includes a number of recommendations to address the needs of ageing carers and what needs to be done to ensure their children or family members are cared for into the future.</para>
<para>There are a number of surprising and startling results outlined in the survey. I would like to bring to the Houseâs attention that the average age of family members surveyed who were providing care was slightly over 65 years. The youngest carer was 42 and the oldest was 89 years of age. Of those carers surveyed, 75 per cent were over 60, with 22.5 per cent being over 70 years of age. Forty-two per cent of people surveyed lived with a family member. In relation to the access to respite services by a primary carer, just five per cent of the families caring for a loved one accessed formal respite services. Twenty-nine of the families surveyed do not, or are unable to, access any formal respite services because they are not available, or not available in a form that assists themâthey are too expensive or they are not available when needed and for the length of time needed.</para>
<para>In relation to future planning, the following facts are very interesting and very telling. Just less than 50 per cent of families had no plans for the responsibility for caring when they are no longer able to do so. According to the report, a number of carers will pass away in the next 10 years which, without planning and action, will mean a crisis for not only these families but also government and government services. One of the greatest fears of these carers, 80 per cent of whom are parents, is what will happen to their children when they are no longer there. Imagine not knowing what will happen to your children or where they will go when they have relied on you their entire lives and you are no longer there.</para>
<para>The results of this report indicate that for many families there is a crisis in care which will worsen in the next 10 years if planning and action do not occur on all fronts to better meet the needs of people with a disability, their ageing parents and family carers. A number of these current carers will pass away in the next 10 years. At the same time their sons and daughters with a disability will continue to ageâsome more rapidly than the general population due to the nature and type of their disabilities. It is with interest that I bring this matter to the House.</para>

<para>âI rise to record my experience as Principal for a Dayâa program run in New South Wales, and perhaps in other states, whereby community, business and opinion leaders, and politicians are invited to spend a day, or a portion thereof, with the principal of a public school in order to gain first-hand insight into the current state of public educationâits challenges and its achievements.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Last year I visited the Matraville Soldiers Settlement School, a primary school in the electorate of Kingsford Smith with a school population drawn from many cultural backgrounds, many of the parents having recently arrived in Australia, including a number of Aboriginal children too. I was taken by the high level of care shown by staff, particularly to kids with physical or mental challenges. In past times, these kids would have been isolated in institutions. Nowadays they are embraced as full members of the school community. The school supported these kids, as well as other kids in the school, and worked closely with families to get the best out of the kids at this important stage of their education. I commend the principal and the staff for their untiring efforts at Matraville.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This year, I had the opportunity to visit Randwick Boys High and again was struck by the generous spirit and obvious dedication shown to students by teaching staff and by the very real achievements of the student body. Numbered amongst them were outstanding athletes, kids with fine academic records and those making real contributions in art, music, science and, more generally, to the life of the school community. Given the recent patterns of curriculum choices we have seen in Australia, where there has not been a great emphasis on learning in science and technology, I was particularly pleased to see the science labs full and humming with senior students.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Naturally, I enjoyed the performance of the composite orchestra, made up of a string section, the local band and students from the collegiate school next door, Randwick Girls High. Playing together, they made absolutely wonderful sounds. The measurable benefits of learning a musical instrument, the foundational role music plays in our culture and, of course, the way playing music with other people brings the school community together, cannot be underestimated.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Principals have a range of complex responsibilities as they lead and inspire their schools. At Randwick Boys High and Matraville Soldiers Settlement, I saw their good efforts first hand and I commend them to the House.</para>

<para>âWith just two words last FridayââYouâre inââthe NRL boss, David Gallop, advised Michael Searle that the Gold Coast NRL bid consortium had secured the 16th National Rugby League licence. Gold Coast City would be entering the 2007 NRL competition. The dream finally had come true. All the hard work, the tears, the disappointment last year and the commitment of a small band of dedicated individuals had delivered a rugby league team back to the Gold Coast.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The excitement was infectious. The news spread very quickly throughout the city and the celebration was on. I am told that Michael Searle and his mentor, Paul Broughton, shook hands and then hugged each other. There were no words. These two special men had ridden an emotional rollercoaster for nearly six years. They both had a dream to deliver a National Rugby League team back to the Gold Coast. They dared to dream and the dream had become a reality.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The hard work is not over. We have less than two years to put together a team that we can all be proud of. This will be a team that our entire Gold Coast community can get behind. It will be a competitive team. It will be driven by our local community, by the young players in the junior ranks who will now have a pathway to strive forâa pathway that will lead them into the national competition and even to aspire to representing their state or their country at international level.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I have had the opportunity of working with the Gold Coast bid team for nearly two years. Today, I want to pay tribute to the professionalism, commitment and credibility of two men who drove this bid and the dream: first, to the managing director, Michael Searle, an exceptional young man who has driven this bid with tenacity and belief and, second, to Paul Broughton, a man who is passionate about the game of rugby leagueâone of lifeâs gentlemen who never gave up the dream. At 74, Paul was the inspiration to us all to keep going until the dream was realised.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">These two men were supported by Ian Buchanan, who drove the media, worked tirelessly to ensure the message to the fans was the right message and put the positive spin on every step through the journey; by Geoff Smith, the legal brains, the man who ensured the legal paperwork was done, whose excitement last Friday was unbelievable; and by Rob Molhoek, now a Gold Coast City councillor, a man who is committed to the youth of Gold Coast City and believes the youth will benefit enormously with a career pathway in rugby league.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">These five men were the driving force behind the consortium. Jim Raptis, Steve Burns and I came on board around two years ago and lent our different areas of expertise to the bid team. We have all enjoyed our roles and feel very proud to be part of this winning combination of people. Let the planning begin for 2007.</para>

<para>âI regret that I am here once again to raise the matter of a further reduction in the services offered to Central Queenslanders by Qantas. As from today, 1 June, Qantas has cut its Jetstar services to and from Rockhampton by 50 per cent. It is now not possible to fly with Jetstar and spend the day in Rockhampton or, going the other way, a day in Brisbane. Jetstar customers from Central Queensland are forced to stay overnight in Brisbane, which of course negates the advantage of a cheap airfare. This 50 per cent reduction in Jetstar services will also have a very serious impact on the Central Queensland tourism industry.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Qantas made much of the introduction of its low-priced Jetstar service to Rockhampton. The House may recall that I said previously that it appeared to me that Qantas was forcing the people of Central Queensland to use Jetstar to give the new airline a revenue base while it established itself on the main trunk routes. Now, as Jetstar is established between the capital cities, we see Qantas withdrawing those Jetstar services from Central Queensland. I see that as proof positive of the Qantas policy of abandoning regional Australia.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is true that Qantas is making much of its intention to replace the Jetstar service with the propeller-driven Dash 8 aircraft. But let me give you an example of what this really means to the people of Central Queensland. One of my constituents was booked to fly from Rockhampton to Cairns on this small Qantas aircraft, which goes via Mackay and Townsville on its way to Cairns. When this constituent learned that in fact he would be in Mackay on the day of his departure, he rang Qantas and said that he would now like to board in Mackay. Of course this would give Qantas the opportunity to sell that seat to Mackay to someone else. However, my constituent was advised by Qantas that he could not do that unless he paid a $33 re-routing fee and purchased a new full fare ticket to Cairns at a cost of $457.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Another constituent, who was trying to attend the same conference in Cairns, simply gave up trying to go because of the difficulties in trying to find a flight that would get him there in a reasonable time. Yet another constituent of mine, who travels regularly for business to and from Rockhampton, has told me that he purchased a frequent flyer cabin bag to ensure that he did not have a problem walking onto planes with carry-on luggage. He was boarding a Dash 8 in Brisbane last Thursday when he was advised by Qantas that the Qantas cabin bag was in fact too big and he had to check it inâa great inconvenience. He was advised that the bag was okay on a jet but not on the smaller Qantas planes that service Rockhampton.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Mr Deputy Speaker, you really have to wonder whether Rockhampton was better serviced in the 1960s by TAA and the good old Fokker Friendships than it is today by Qantas. It would seem that the best friend that Virgin Blue Airlines has is Qantas management, with these kinds of decisions that really penalise regional Australia.</para>

<para>âI want to talk about water reuse on the Mornington Peninsula, in the Westernport area and in Australia more generally. Firstly, I would like to welcome yesterdayâs decision by the Victorian government to finally complete and launch the water retreatment program for Cranbourne and associated areas, which is known as the Eastern Irrigation Scheme. This scheme will deliver approximately five billion litres of water to golf courses, market gardens and parks and gardens in the eastern area of Melbourne. In my electorate of Flinders, farmers in Cranbourne South, Five Ways, Devon Meadows and Clyde will have access to high-grade treated water and they can use that to save costs, provide volume and take pressure off the environment. All of those things together make this a tremendously important projectâoverdue but important.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Secondly, this proposal, the Eastern Irrigation Scheme, deals with about three per cent of the waste water discharged from the Gunnamatta outfall, which is about three per cent of 150 billion litres a year. So effectively it prevents any further increases. It does not really deal with the underlying question. To solve that, we have to aim for much higher than the statesâ proposal of 20 per cent reuse. There is no question, as we look all around Australia today, that we have to work towards a total reuse policy for water. It is reasonable, it is achievable and it is the way of the future. At Gunnamatta the problem continues. Over 150 gigalitres, or 150 billion litres, of waste water every year are being discharged right on the shoreline. It is unacceptable, it is environmentally damaging, it is a health risk and it is a total waste of a valuable resource. I recommit myself to working towards a zero outfall for Gunnamatta. I am delighted to say that I have been working with the Prime Ministerâs office, with the Deputy Prime Minister and others on precisely that objective, and I believe that there may be something from the Commonwealth in the near future.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Thirdly, at the national level, we have to work towards 100 per cent water recycling nationwide. The position in Sydney of two billion litres of waste water at the raw sewage level and almost 400 billion litres of waste water at the primary level being discharged into the sea is an utter disgrace. Across Australia we need a national ocean outfall strategy which will achieve the ending of ocean outfalls by 2025 and the full recycling of water. I am delighted that yesterday was a beginning.

<para>âToday is the National Tertiary Education Unionâs national day of action protesting the assault on university funding and the impact of that on staff since the Howard government decided to rip out $5 billion worth of funding. The latest insult to our tertiary sector is the threat to withhold a further $838 million if staff are not moved onto individual contracts. I am very fortunate to count staff at the University of Newcastle amongst my dearest friends and amongst those whom I admire most for their contribution to our society. This week staff at Newcastle university have seen what a proposed job loss of 439 full-time equivalent jobs will look like. In this very difficult phase, I register my strong support for them and regret that they are suffering quite markedly. I have faith that their professionalism will cushion students, but there is a real risk of a crisis in confidence.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I again call on the government to assist the Hunter region to absorb this economic and human loss. It is estimated that the economic cost to our region will be greater than $100 million per year. A recent study showed that our university contributes nearly $650 million a year in gross output plus $215 million in salaries. So it will be felt very strongly by our region with the flow-on effect of another 150 jobs lost. The government shows very little sympathy, but certainly our region deserves and should demand some assistance. Our labour market is a lot thinner than those of cities like Sydney. That was recently quantified by Professor OâNeill, who said that our labour market vulnerability is such that, for the lower Hunter to have the same job-to-population ratio as Sydney, it would have to create 73,000 additional jobs immediately. We always feel economic shifts much more strongly.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In 2005 in the Hunter, the average total income per annum per wage and salary earner is only approximately $43,000ânot exactly prosperous or rolling in cash. I understand that the university would like to manage this change very quickly. I am sympathetic to its desire to get back in the black; I understand that. But the costs of getting this wrong are hugeâhuge for the region and huge for the people involved in the industry.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">At our university we do not just turn out units of production; we actually solve some of the problems of the world, some of the problems of Australian society. At the moment, groundbreaking research is being done in obesity, prostate cancer, premature births, family relationships, the rural GP shortages, nanotechnology, engineering, the Jameson Cellâsome landmark research values benefiting all. It is disgraceful that our region is left to handle this crisis by itself. It is disgraceful that universities are compromised by every decision this government has made.

<para>âAustralia has had an outstanding record in international swimming, going right back to the days of Freddie Lane winning a gold medal at the Paris Olympics in 1900, and from âBoyâ Charlton, Dawn Fraser and Murray Rose right through to our current champions: that great crop of women sprinters from Brisbane; Ian Thorpe; and Grant Hackett. But I rise on an issue of local importance to my electorateâthat is, the state of South Australia has no FINA-standard pool. South Australia is not able to host any national swimming championships. We are not able to host a world masters championships. We have not had a FINA pool for some time. Even a state like Tasmania has three to four FINA-standard pools.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The South West Indoor Aquatic Centre is a project that has been around for some time. It has been proposed by state governments of both political stripesâthe Olsen government and the Rann governmentâto be built at the Domain in Marion, in my electorate. In February 2004, it was proposed that this be done through a public-private partnership. The Minister for Recreation, Sport and Racing, Michael Wright, announced this in a media release.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Late in 2004, approaches were made to me by the Marion council to see if there was any possibility of federal assistance. I made the point to them that swimming pools are not normally an area of federal responsibility but that I would see what I could do. I helped the Marion council to make a submission as part of the 2005 budget. We got a tremendous hearing from the Minister for the Arts and Sport, Senator Rod Kemp, and the Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator Nick Minchin. Although there was no federal funding, I will be continuing to push for this project.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Having said that, I am disappointed that the state government is using this as an opportunity to further delay a project which has already been delayed for three or four years. There has been a sign at the site of this proposed pool since October 2001. It is now being said that what was always planned as a state-local government project will only go ahead contingent on federal funding. I will be doing what I can, but I feel akin to someone who has gone in to help a drowning person, only to be pulled in as well. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âOn the weekend before last, Major General Peter Cosgrove opened a very interesting exhibition, at which I was present, called <inline font-style="italic">Bittersweet Freedom: Memories of Liberation 1944-45</inline>, at the Jewish Holocaust Museum and Research Centre in Elsternwick in Victoria, in my electorate. I congratulated Major General Cosgrove on the fact that, in concluding his very important leadership of the Australian Defence Force, he had taken time to come down and open the exhibition.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The exhibition is open to the public, and I would urge members of the public to go and see it. The exhibition is produced by the museumâs curator, Jayne Josem. It basically consists of video interviews with people who were liberated by the American, British or Soviet forces. It also includes major works by Australian war artists of the time who were serving with the British forces and who, witnessing some of the camps that were liberated, felt that simple photographic evidence of what they were seeing was not necessarily an accurate way of portraying things. They felt it necessary to give vent to their art. One of the artists felt that no-one would believe what he was drawing and therefore took it upon himself to do a photographic copy of every painting that he had prepared for that exhibition.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I said to the large crowd at the exhibition opening that I congratulated Major General Cosgrove on being there representing the sort of tolerance and decency of the Australian armed forces that is typical of Australia. I congratulated him on providing for the people in the audienceâmany of whom have made successful lives in Australia during the 60 years since the end of the Second World Warâa continuum from Sir John Monash right through to himself. The exhibition by the Jewish Holocaust Museum and Research Centre is to be commended. It underlines again the tragedy and the importance of the great victory of the Second World War.</para>

<para>âThere are simply no words adequate to describe the service, sacrifice and suffering of our veterans, what they lived through and what some of them are still living through to defend our way of life. It is important that we pay due respect to their service, but in practical ways, so I was very pleased to announce a series of funding packages for veterans groups in the Hinkler electorate. In recent weeks, I announced a $3,480 Saluting Their Service grant to the Elliott Heads and District Ratepayers and Residents Association to help them enhance the Submarine Lookout Memorial. From a small headland and timber tower at Elliott Heads, civilian coast watchers looked out for Japanese submarines in World War II, a very practical way of assisting the war effort.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I have just had the pleasure of telling the Gayndah RSL sub-branch that they will be receiving a $17,348 veteran and community grant to install airconditioning in the RSL hall and help set up a drop-in centre for local veterans. This is a new and very important focus for Central Burnett veterans. The Bundaberg sub-branch of the Vietnam Veterans Association, of which I am patron, also received two veteran and community grants totalling $7,406 to fund outings and buy a photocopier so that they can produce their own newsletter. The Bundaberg and District Korean War Veterans group received a $2,500 grant to fund bus trips to reduce social isolation for veterans and their spouses. All these projects are worthy of government support.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I am fortunate that as the federal member I get to attend a wide range of commemorative functions from the Rats of Tobruk day to East Bundaberg state schoolâs marvellous pre Anzac Day commemoration in their school grounds. I always make a point of attending as many Anzac Day services as possible. This year I managed to make it to Bundabergâs dawn service, the Rosedale dawn service, the Boyne Island-Tannum Sands RSLâs morning service, the Gladstone citizensâ ceremony, and the Burnett Heads ceremony in the afternoon. My wife, Margaret, also lent strong support by representing me at services that I could not attend. She attended the Bargara dawn service this year and the Bundaberg citizensâ service.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">By funding memorials and commemorative events and community based activities for veterans, we are honouring the actions of those who served our country. Although our gestures can never fully compensate veterans for their experiences, it is important that we do what we can and show that we care.</para>

<para>âThe New South Wales Working Womenâs Centre provides an invaluable service to people in Sydney, including in my electorate of Parramatta. It provides legal advice to women in the workplace, particularly on their rights in the workplace. It has been providing this service for the last 11 years. Yet at this point, in the first week of June, DEWR has once again failed to assure its funding for the next financial year, which is 3Â½ weeks away.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The centre is once again in crisis, as it is at this time every year, due to the lack of advice on its funding position for the following year. Is it going to be receiving any funding? If so, how much? When will it be told? Should its staff look for other jobs? Should it plan to shut its doors, give notice on leases and plan the garage sale? Will its clients be left in an increasingly unfriendly work environment without its support? If the government finally does decide to fund the centre and finally tells it, will the government be even vaguely aware that a small group of people at this time of year every year risk their own financial security by hanging on and keeping the centre open without any idea of its future?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Even more importantly, given that the government is ripping away well-known and tested support structures for the most disadvantaged workers, the majority of which are women, will the government assist workers to deal with this changing environment by increasing the funding to the centre to a respectable level? Is the government even vaguely aware of, let alone concerned about, the position that our valuable community based infrastructure is placed in at this time every year when funding decisions are made this late? Is this lateness of decision a case of incompetence, a display of power and arrogance or just a general lack of care about an extremely important community organisation? Does the government even know if it will be giving any funding post-June, let alone the level of funding?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The centre has endured real reductions in funding levels over the last 11 years. Given that women are the most disadvantaged in the workplace, receiving lower salaries and being far more likely to be working in casual and unskilled positions, the advocacy role of the centre is essential and growing. Yet, while the demand for the service is growing, financial support is not. The initial allocation that established the centre in the 1993-94 budget was $297,062. It has dropped in real terms by 37 per cent, to around $240,000. Yet, since 2000 alone, the centre has received a 70 per cent increase in clients and expects that trend to continue with the new industrial relations reforms. Despite staff reductions in 1999, the service to clients is quite extraordinary. The centre operates a telephone advisory service that opens three days a week. Staffing is at a 3.1 full-time equivalents but with over 20 voluntary staff. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âAfter the 2 April helicopter crash on the island of Nias which claimed the lives of nine of our serving personnel, there was a tremendous outpouring of grief, none more so than in our local community of the Shoalhaven in my electorate of Gilmore. In one fell swoop, this tragedy took away four of our extended family. Four members of the crew were from No. 817 Squadron, whose home station is HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Albatross</inline> at Nowra Hill. It is difficult to describe the emotion that was being freely expressed at the time, as each and every one of us approached the news with different feelings. I can say that I have not seen such a reaction from a community in all my days. The four were Lieutenant Matthew Goodall, Lieutenant Paul Kimlin, Lieutenant Jonathan King and Leading Seaman Scott Bennetâall fine upstanding young Australians taken at the prime of their lives in their service to humanity. Of the four, Leading Seaman Bennet had a young familyâa wife and two childrenâwhose family home was in Tomerong, near the shores of Jervis Bay. It was the 31st year of his life. I attended his funeral, which was held at HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Albatross</inline>. The funeral was attended by several hundred people, many of whom did not know him, but such was the sense of family felt by the community that they grieved equally. It was a very moving occasion, and its impact will be felt for quite some time.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Shortly after we received the news that four of our own had gone down, we made available condolence books so that local residents could express their feelings. A similar book was made available at the chambers of the Shoalhaven City Council and at the Navy base, and the book will be given to the Navy at HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Albatross</inline>. Reading the entries is a bittersweet experienceâon one hand deep sadness, yet at the same time extreme pride that we shared a moment together. They are brief statements, awkwardly written in some cases, but genuine in their sympathy and gratitude. They are also a symbol of the bond that has been formed between residents and those in the garrison of HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Albatross</inline> who have been with us for over 60 years. Every day, in some little way, we have become accustomed to seeing these Defence personnel around us, whether it be in their uniforms as they go about their daily business or as we hear the drone of the Sea Kings and other aircraft flying in and out of the air base. They are quietly in our everyday lives. I am glad we have the Navy with us: no better tenant can you find. But the four from No. 817 Squadron who perished are not the first peacetime casualties for Nowra and, sadly, probably will not be the last.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Next to the general cemetery at Nowra is a neat and well-kept cemetery. It is the naval cemetery and has interred there a number of other naval personnel who died in the service of their country. It is a special place, with each tombstone having its own story to tell. In preparing for war, our servicemen and servicewomen undertake demanding tasks, sometimes with great personal risk and most times unseen. We should not need a tragedy like this to remind us of their contribution. We should be forever appreciative of their service and give them every support we can, and looking after the family of Leading Seaman Bennet in Gilmore is one such way.</para>

<para>âThe Bankstown Airport master plan is now in existence. It will govern the activity at Bankstown Airport for the next 20 years. The people of Bankstown who worked with me to achieve the key objectiveâthat is, to stop 737 jets from being able to use Bankstown Airportâhave won an enormous victory. But there is still more work to do. A noise management plan needs to be put into place. The fundamental problem in regard to noise management is that more freight aircraft will be operating out of Bankstown Airportâand there will probably be more at night. The extension of the runway by 200 metres means that planes can be more fully laden and will be flying lower and closer to people in Condell Park and associated suburbs. Logically, that means that the noise impact will therefore be greater. I call upon the management of Bankstown Airport Ltd to ensure that there is proper and full community consultation in regard to this and that the lives of people are not destroyed by inappropriate noise from Bankstown Airport.</para>

</talker>
<para>âI am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak in the debate on the 2005 budget. This is the Treasurerâs 10th budget. It is the eighth budget this government has delivered which has been in surplus. A most important part of this budget is the $21 billion in tax cuts which represents, for the second time, a very significant extension of the threshold for the top marginal rate and for the second highest marginal rate. When we introduced the new tax system in 1998 we were able to ensure that everyone on incomes below $50,000 was on a marginal rate of 30c in the dollar. At that time, 80 per cent of taxpayers were on incomes below $50,000. But we were never able to implement the tax cuts we had promised because the Senate would not allow us to do so.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Last year we were able to take advantage of the Leader of the Opposition at the time, Mark Latham, who had previously made a number of comments about the fact that the top marginal rate was cutting in at an income which was too low, and we were able to increase the threshold for the top marginal rate to $80,000. The budget measures will now increase the threshold for the top marginal rate to $125,000. When you find that the steelworkers in Port Kembla are paying 48Â½c tax in every extra dollar they earn in overtime, you realise that our top marginal rates are cutting in at incomes which are far too low. One million Australians are living and working overseas. Many of these people will be looking at where the top marginal rate cuts in and this will be an encouragement for many of our best and brightest to return to Australia to work under a tax regime which is not so punitive.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The welfare to work changes are another very important part of this budget. Our unemployment rate of 5.1 per cent is the lowest it has been since November 1976. As Australiaâs population ages over the next 20 or 30 years, we are not going to see the growth in the work force that we have traditionally seen. It is going to be more and more important to make sure, not only for our overall economy but also for individuals, that those who can find a pathway into work are able to do so, because it leads to a much more rewarding life.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The budget also contains a number of initiatives related to boosting skills. Because the economy has now been expanding for 13 years and because unemployment is now so low we are seeing a number of skills shortages emerging in the Australian economy. Because of the 13 years of economic growth we are also seeing shortages in unskilled labour. I am very pleased that we are increasing the skilled migration program by 20,000 places. This means that if you have skills which are recognised by Australia you can migrate to Australia from anywhere in the world.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The budget forecasts a growth over the next year of three per cent. This also reflects the fact that our export prices are at a record high. Australia now has the best terms of trade since 1974, particularly for iron ore and coal, and this has been very significant for what our exports are earning. As I said, unemployment, at 5.1 per cent, is the lowest since November 1976. It can go lower, but it will only go lower with changes to workplace relations and a more flexible labour market. The government is also looking at ways that it can increase the participation of people in their late 40s and 50s and encourage them back into the workplace.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Government debt has decreased from $96 billion 10 years ago, almost 19 per cent of GDP, to just $6 billion in this budget. There are very few countries that have wiped out their government debt. A couple of years ago we had a debate about whether we should maintain the debt market for Commonwealth government securities. A decision was made that it would be maintained. We will now be putting future surpluses away into our future fund, which means that the superannuation liabilities which have previously been unfunded will be covered.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There is a cash surplus in this budget of $8.9 billion, roughly one per cent of GDP. Compare this with the OECD average of budget deficits of three per cent of GDP. Australiaâs position by contrast is much, much stronger. There has been comment on yesterdayâs news about the current account deficit and Australiaâs foreign debt. There are a couple of points that need to be made on this. First of all, Australia has a floating exchange rate. If people believe that our current account deficit or our level of foreign debt is unsustainable, it will be reflected in the exchange rate. The exchange rate currently is very strong on the trade-weighted index and also against the United States dollar at about US76c.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The other point to make is that, because we have had government budget surpluses over the last eight years, the current account deficit largely reflects private savings and investment decisions. As the <inline font-style="italic">OECD</inline>
<inline font-style="italic">Economic Survey of Australiaâ2004,</inline> released in February 2005, states, because we have few distortions in the economy:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Â ... private sector savings and investment decisions are likely to be efficient, with capital flows reflecting informed decisions about relative investment opportunities.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Moodyâs has rated us âAaaâ and Standard and Poorâs has given us an AAA rating. The banking system is in good shape and the financial position of firms and individuals is in good shape. The governmentâs share of net external debt is very low. Government debt, as I said previously, is very lowâit is less than one per cent of GDP at $6 billion. It is just extraordinary and one of the lowest in the OECD. I again quote from this yearâs OECD economic survey:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">This places Australia in a comparatively better position than most other countries to respond to future economic shocks. To preserve this favourable position, the authorities should continue to ensure that the government does not add to aggregate external financing requirements.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Put simply, we should not be running up budget deficits; we should be, as we have been, running up budget surpluses.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The key theme of the 2004 federal election was, âWho do you trust to run Australiaâs $800 billion economy?â The mood of the Australian people at the moment is that they got that decision right. One of the things I find in the community is that people actually reflect on what might have been had Mark Latham become Prime Minister. After a few chuckles and so on people do reflect that it was a very close call but that they got the decision right. Our message was that it does take a lot of discipline and experience to run the Australian economy. We saw that the Labor Partyâs approach would be to give into narrow sectional interests ahead of jobs and the economy. Nowhere was that better demonstrated than in Tasmania, where you had the extraordinary scene of members of the Labor Party National Executive, CFMEU members, urging their members to vote for the Liberal Party. That was a snapshot which encapsulated the overall theme of the electionâthat is, every day you considerâ</para>

<para>âPerhaps I should clarify this. A member of the Labor Party National Executive shared the stage with the Prime Minister. I took that as implicit. I do not think he was not advocating a vote for Mark Latham. Certainly the timber workers were very happy to see the Prime Minister. I think if you look at the result in Braddon and in Bass you can see that that was strongly reflected. It does take a lot of discipline and experience to run our economy. Every day there are decisions to be made.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para pgwide="yes">Let us look at the key challenges we face. First of all, there is the ageing of our economy. Since 1978, we have had a fertility rate below replacement level. At the moment it is about 1.75 or thereabouts. We expect over the next 40 years that the proportion of people over 65 will double. This has important implications in terms of increases in what we will be paying in health costs for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and so on. Having said that, I believe Australia is in very good shape to meet this challenge because of our strong retirement income system with a means-tested pension and compulsory superannuation. What this means is that our estimates are that we should only be paying about an extra two per cent of GDP over the next 40 years for the age pension. Compare this to some other countries like Canada, for example, where it is expected that they will be spending about six per cent of GDP on the age pension. The OECD average is about three per cent extra of GDP.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I believe that we are well placed to meet the challenges and opportunities. But in only 15 years time, in the decade beginning the 2020s, we expect to see growth in the work force slow. Where we would normally expect 180,000 new workers to enter the work force every year, because that has been the pattern, in the whole decade of the 2020s the work force will grow by only 120,000, and by the time we get to the decade of the 2040s our work force growth will be only 0.1 per cent. So we will not see the increases in the work force that we have always had.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">But in countries with much lower fertility rates and where ageing is more advanced, such as in southern Europe, Spain, Italy, Greece, Japan, South Korea and so on, the populations will be ageing much faster. They will actually see periods of work force decline. It is not expected that we will see this in Australia. But it is important that we address the reasons why we have a very low work force participation rate amongst people aged from 45 to 64 years. We need to make sure that we take advantage of all the human capital in our society and that people are able to get the personal rewards available by working.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In terms of the approach that the government has taken, which is exemplified in this budget, what are the challenges we face? First of all, we need to increase work force participation rates, especially among the group aged from 45 to 64 years. The Prime Minister is to be commended for appointing a specific Minister for Workforce Participation, the member for Dickson, whom I am delighted to see in that position. We also need further reform of the economy, including tax reform and making sure that infrastructure is in place so that we do not have any bottlenecks in the economy and including workplace relations reform, because it is very important to have wages set at the enterprise level, not by a centralised tribunal.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Lastly, I want to touch on families. When the Howard government were elected in 1996, one of the things we did through family tax benefit part A and part B was to see that the relative position of low- and middle-income families was improved vis-a-vis the rest. For example, the family payment, which was only about $600 in 1996, is now about $1,800. We did that because we recognise the importance of families in our community, and the figures in the budget documents do show how the real incomes of dual-income families and single-income families have increased over the last 10 years.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">On the skills side, skill shortages are emerging, as I have said, and there is funding in this budget to improve vocational education and training through our new Australian technical colleges. But I am also very pleased to see that we have increased our skilled migration by 20,000.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Lastly, on local issues, one of the key local things I pushed for in this budget was federal contribution to the South-West Indoor Aquatic Centre. I believe the Marion council did put in a very good submission. It was supported by all of the peak aquatic sport and swimming groups. We had a very good reception from the Minister for the Arts and Sport, Senator Rod Kemp, and the Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator Nick Minchin. I am disappointed that we were not able to get funding this year, but it is worth remembering that, for example, Mount Panorama, which I believe received $10 million in the 2001 budget, only got that at their fourth attempt and only after a very concrete contribution from the NSW state government. Having said that, it is important to note that swimming pools and aquatic centres are not normally core business of federal government, except where there is a specific case. As I have said in a previous speech, we have no FINA standard pool in South Australia. We do need one. Our local swimmers, our junior swimmers, can never compete in national championships in their own state. We cannot host a national championship because we have no FINA standard pool.</para>

<para>âThis budget fails to adequately invest in training and infrastructure Australia desperately needs and, tragically, is therefore another wasted opportunity by the Howard government. The budget fails to adequately invest in the health care, child care and aged care so urgently needed in Sydneyâs inner west and instead spends $21.7 billion on an unfair tax cut, providing little incentive for lower income earners, and insults 80 per cent of honest taxpayers in my electorate of Lowe by offering them a miserable tax cut of $6 a week. The governmentâs tax cuts are unfair. Today I speak for the eight out of 10 taxpayers on average incomes in my electorate of Lowe who will see the lousy $6 a week. This is more evidence that once again the Howard government has sold short households and families in Sydneyâs inner west.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The tax cuts proposed by the government will cost more than $21 billion and are skewed heavily towards the highest income earners, with the maximum tax cut of $65 a week available only to those with a taxable income of $125,000 or moreâthat is, 280,000 taxpayers. The maximum tax cut available to those earning up to $63,000âthat is, 7.4 million taxpayers and 80 per cent of constituents in my electorateâis just $6 a week. Under the governmentâs proposed package 45 per cent of the value of the tax cuts go to the top 10 per cent of taxpayers, while the remaining 90 per cent of taxpayers share the other 55 per cent of cuts. While an average-income earner in Sydneyâs inner west will get a tax cut of $6 a week, a person earning $125,000 a year will gain an additional tax cut of $65 a week.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I know this sort of tax reform must reflect the progressive nature of our income tax system, but this imbalance is unnecessary and therefore a lost opportunity to begin to adequately address other critical issues such as Australiaâs skill shortage and urgent infrastructure needs. Worse, the governmentâs tax changes not only provide an unfair distributional outcome but also fail to adequately address the high effect of marginal tax rates for low-income earners moving from welfare to work. Many lower and middle-income earners face marginal tax rates of more than 60c in the dollar from income tax and the withdrawal of government benefits as they earn more private income.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The oppositionâs plan for fairer tax cuts would deliver a $12 a week tax cut to seven million Australians, providing fairer tax relief for 80 per cent of taxpayers in my electorate of Lowe, and could be delivered at the same cost. The plan announced by Mr Kim Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, delivers a $12 a week tax cut for those earning from $25,000 to $75,000, which is double what the government is providing. It will also preserve the governmentâs tax cut for people earning from $70,000 to $105,000.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Applying from 1 January 2006, the government should cut the tax of people moving from welfare to work by introducing a welfare-to-work tax bonus. It should replace the existing low-income tax offset and, when fully implemented, fully offset any tax on the first $10,000 taxable income for people earning up to $20,000 a year. To improve incentives for low-income earners, to help them in a meaningful way, the government should also extend the income range where the 17 per cent marginal tax rate applies by raising the threshold where the 30 per cent rate applies from $21,600 to $26,400. In addition, the government should also adopt Laborâs tax plan and deliver a tax cut of $12 a week for low- and middle-income earners.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">From 1 July 2006, the government should extend the income range where the 30 per cent marginal tax rate applies by raising the threshold where the 42c rate applies from $63,000 to $67,000. This would compensate middle and higher income earners for the effect of bracket creep and ensure that at least 80 per cent of taxpayers pay a marginal tax rate of 30c in the dollar or less. Finally, the income range where the 42 per cent marginal tax rate applies should be extended by lifting the threshold where the 47 per cent rate begins from $80,000 to $100,000. This would improve the competitiveness of Australiaâs tax system. Laborâs plan would ensure that a worker or single-income family on average weekly earnings will over the next four years gain $936 more than under the proposals contained in this bill. Further, a dual-income family on $85,000 will over the next four years gain $1,872 more under Laborâs plan.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As far as income tax relief is concerned, only Labor is willing to offer a fair outcome for Australian households by providing greater incentives for work and greater tax relief for the people who need it the most. While the government remains narrowly focused on supporting and rewarding Australiaâs highest income earnersâafter all, they are the Howard governmentâs natural constituencyâit fails to give urgently needed attention to other serious problems that most Australians would expect any worthy Australian government to address.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Firstly, it is shameful that the Howard government believes it can get away with skewing so-called tax reform in favour of Australiaâs highest income earners while flogging those Australians who are most disadvantaged. In this respect I will refer to an opinion piece written by Mr Frank Quinlan, the Executive Director of Catholic Welfare Australia, which was published in last weekâs <inline font-style="italic">Catholic Weekly</inline>. Mr Quinlan precedes his opinion piece titled âBudget âa lost opportunityâ to help the disadvantagedâ with the following:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">âPart of what makes Australia a good and decent society is our willingness to tilt the playing field in favour of low and middle income families with dependent children. This has been a defining philosophic commitment of mine for the past 20 years, not least in the area of taxation reform.â</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Mr Quinlan then began:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">These are the words of the Prime Minister, John Howard, during his Menzies Research Centre Address in Sydney last week.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Given the tax changes contained in the budget it is very difficult to believe the Prime Minister and his government are serious about anything else other than tilting the playing field away from the low- and middle-income families. As Mr Quinlan rightly continued:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Reflecting on the Budget, Catholic Welfare Australia is dismayed that rather than tilting the playing field in favour of low and middle-income earners, it seems many of them are being sent to the sidelines, off the playing field altogether.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">This is absolutely correct and it underlines why Labor opposes these unfair tax changes. Mr Quinlan continued:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">In a Budget that delivers an annual tax cut of more than $2,000 to those earning more than $100,000 a year ... low-income earners (those among the 20 per cent of Australian households that earn less than $12,000) receive a tax break of only $1.54 per week (not enough to buy a hamburger or a milkshake). Families on low incomes and middle incomes will have twice that figure consumed by the shift in the Medicare Safety Net in any case.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">There is no doubt that the Howard governmentâs tax changes in this bill fail to provide an incentive for people working on low incomes or the income tax relief to those who need it the most. While low- and middle-income earners are being sidelined by the Howard government, the story is reversed for those on the highest incomes.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As I said earlier, the opposition believes that all Australians deserve some tax relief. Our income tax system is progressive in nature so it is obvious that higher income earners will always share in tax changes designed to give tax relief. However, it is scandalous that the Howard government continues to allow some high-income earners to avoid paying tax altogether. I bring to the attention of the House an answer to my question on notice No. 3 in this parliament to the Treasurer. On 17 November 2004, I asked the Treasurer:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">What proportion of (a) barristers, and (b) solicitors failed to lodge an income tax return on time in each of the financial years ended 1992 through to 2002.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Following my 3Â½-year campaign to protect honest taxpayers, the Treasurerâs answer, provided by the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, confirmed that 36 per cent of barristers failed to lodge a return in 2003, with similar failures recorded every year from 1999.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Howard government flogs honest taxpayers and insults them with a $6 a week tax cut at the same time as it fails to crack down on the more than one-third of barristers who have broken the law and failed to lodge a tax return. It is bad enough that far too many of the legal profession have used their knowledge to avoid paying their fair share of tax or even lodging a tax return. Further, and incredibly, we now know that over one-third of barristers in Australia have not bothered to complete an income tax return and the Howard government has been allowing this to happen since at least 1999. It is an absolute disgrace that many of these people, who have taken oaths to protect the public interest, still believe that tax is optional for them and it is an absolute disgrace that the Howard government has allowed them to get away with that. This is an insult to the vast majority of honest taxpayers, who suffer an enormous and unfair burden under the Howard governmentâthe same taxpayers the government believes only deserve a $6 a week tax cut. I ask: what is the government doing to assist the New South Wales Bar Association and other professional bodies to expel those rogue members who refuse to do the right thing and who bring their profession into disrepute? What is the government doing to help them protect the name of honest professionalsâin this case the 64 per cent of barristers who did lodge a tax return on time?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I began by saying that, in failing to address the problems faced by all Australians, this budget is a wasted opportunity. Why does the government ignore the increasingly sad and unfair Australia it is helping to create? I want to refer to the sixth annual Manning Clark lecture, delivered on 20 March 2005 by respected social researcher Mr Hugh Mackay. My colleagues in the federal parliamentary Labor Partyâs social policy committee and I were privileged to welcome Mr Mackay to a meeting of the committee last week here in parliament. Mr Mackay is rightly raising the alarm about the fact that we have been living through:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">... the restructure of the Australian economy. This has resulted in a cultural shift in which we have gradually learnt to live with a widespread sense of job insecurity. We have witnessed a significant shift from full-time to part-time work, from permanent to casual employment and we have seen the problem of underemployment emerge as a more significant issue than the problem of absolute unemployment.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">We know this insecurity will only get worse under the Howard governmentâs unnecessary and unfair industrial relations agenda. Further, Mr Mackay points out:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The redistribution of work has resulted in a redistribution of wealth. We have widened the gap between the rich and the poor. The average annual household income of the top 20 per cent of Australian households is about $180,000. The average annual household income of the bottom 20 per cent of households is about $12,000. We are also living with our highest ever levels of personal and household debt. Such shifts throw out a challenge to our traditional ideal of egalitarianism and raise serious questions about whether we are prepared to allow Australia to become a three class society, stratified by the dollar.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Why is the Howard government ignoring this challenge? Because, in my view, it believes that it can get away with governing for the minority of Australians who believe a growing divide in Australia is acceptable and that it can scare enough other Australians into keeping it in office. I believe this will not last, but, equally, Australia cannot afford the governmentâs complacency. My constituents need a federal government that is willing to invest more in the services, training and infrastructure needed to ease the pressure on our communities and our household budgets.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The budget contains no plans for infrastructure spending to address the growing crisis of traffic congestion in Sydneyâs inner west and throughout Australiaâs major cities. This is a problem that must be addressed across all levels of government. Instead we suffer a serious lack of leadership from the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister. This is an abdication of responsibility that matches the governmentâs handling of other critical transport related issues such as aircraft noise and overdevelopment at Sydney airport, not to mention the security debacle in the cargo and baggage-handling areas at Sydney airport. I raised this issue on 11 May 2005 in my question No. 1320 to the Minister for Justice and Customs. In view of the reports in yesterdayâs and todayâs <inline font-style="italic">Australian,</inline> I will be very interested to see his reply. With all the money in its slush fund, I also ask: why is the government not ensuring that the long-term operating plan for Sydney airport is fairly implemented and why is it not honouring its promise to build a second airport for the people of Sydney?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The government remains idle as Australia suffers the terrible environmental consequences of and reduced productivity caused by its failure to respond to Australiaâs urgent transport infrastructure needs. Further, the governmentâs key election health platformâthe Medicare safety netâhas been cut by $499 million. This will increase current thresholds from $300 to $500 for concession card holders and family tax benefit A recipients and from $700 to $1,000 for all others. The current safety net level was a ârock solid, ironclad guaranteeâ before the last election, but now the Howard government wants households to pay more when they need a doctor. The budget will cut $1.3 billion from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme by increasing the safety net thresholds for prescriptions. The government is also punishing elderly Australians and cancer patients by removing calcium tablets from the PBS. This is both horribly short-sighted and counterproductive, in my view. It is an unfair attack on Australian households in an areaâthat is, health careâthat will cause maximum anxiety.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In addition, at a time of a national skills crisis the budget fails to make any significant new investments in the education and training sectors. The budget contains no general growth funding for additional TAFE places, despite about 40,000 Australians being turned away from TAFE last year. The budget contains no growth funding for additional HECS places, despite the fact that Australian businesses are crying out for highly skilled professionals like engineers and scientists. The Howard government has failed to adopt the oppositionâs proposal for a $2,000 trade completion bonus for traditional apprentices who complete their training. Having fewer apprentices in Sydneyâs inner westâincluding a drop of 23 per cent in my electorate of Loweâtraining in trades like bricklaying, plumbing and carpentry is an outrage when local businesses urgently need qualified tradespeople. This skills crisis hits all households and businesses through higher interest rates, increased costs and delays to building and renovations.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Howard government has also badly let down families in my electorate of Lowe by failing to invest in adequate child care. The budget contains no new funding for long day care and nothing to ease the shortage of care for the under-fives. Many parents with young children will be unable to work to help pay the family mortgage and stay relevant in the labour market because of the huge shortage in long day care places. The queue for child-care places in my electorate of Lowe continues to grow, and the government is failing to create new places. It is typical in the inner west for child-care facilities to have something in the order of 200 parents waiting to get their children into child care. The government should be addressing that, in my view. The long waiting lists for outside school hours care will continue because the funds allocated for new places will not be available until 2008-09. This means that parents who want to work past 3 pm are still being prevented from doing so due to the shortage of places.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The budget also neglects families looking after elderly parents and relatives because it ignores the ongoing skills shortage and the funding inequities in aged care. It fails to invest in training and retention measures for aged care nurses and personal carers. It does not address the systemic problem in the allocation of aged care places exacerbating the current waiting list problems. We know that there is a national shortage of 10,000 residential aged care beds and that there are over 17,000 phantom bedsâthat is, 17,000 beds that have been announced by the government but have never been opened. The budget also ignores the need for adequate funding for high-care residents and for capital development. By failing to adequately invest in, and in some areas cutting funding to, health, education and training, child care and aged care, the Howard government is contributing to the terrible anxiety of households in Sydneyâs inner west. I do not believe the Treasurer is serious when he expects this anxiety to be alleviated by a lousy $6 a week tax cut.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In the time I have left I want to confirm my support for the second reading amendment moved by the shadow Treasurer, the member for Lilley, that the House condemns the government for a budget which:</para>

<para>âIt is a pleasure to rise in this House and speak about this very sound and responsible budgetâthe 10th budget delivered by the Treasurer, Peter Costello. When I hear the contributions of the members opposite in this House, I sometimes wonder whether we are in the same parliament or whether we have a literacy problem, as they do not seem to be able to read the legislation that has been announced. The previous speaker, the member for Lowe, was decrying the shortage of long day care centres in his electorate. I remind the member for Lowe that there is not a cap on long day care centres. If there is a shortage, make sure you go out and fight for your electorate rather than simply coming into the House and complaining.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The measures and priorities in this budget are an investment in Australiaâs future. It is a budget about aspiration. The budget also comes at a time that is right to make important structural changes to help ease people away from the growing trap of welfare dependency. In 1996, when we came into office, the focus was on dragging the economy out of the debt mire of the Keating era. Since then the government has delivered eight surplus budgets, which have helped to restore confidence in the Australian economy and, in turn, opportunities for Australians.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I am proud to be part of a government that has introduced major initiatives throughout this term. On top of record investment into vital services such as health, education and aged care, this government has never lost sight of its genuine reformist zeal. There has been vital tax reform, important structural changes to the health system, and an emphasis on accountability and sustainability in the aged care sector. Furthermore, the workplace relations system has also had much needed reform. The new IR reforms, announced as recently as last Thursday by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, are a welcome step and should lead to more jobs, better wages and improved conditions for Australian workers. These workers have received far better outcomes from this government than the 13 years of the previous government, where real wages only went up by about 1.3 to 1.4 per cent, compared to 14 per cent under this government.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Nine years of painâfollowing Laborâs $96 billion debtâhave helped put the economy in great shape. This is the eighth budget that has delivered a surplus. As the Treasurer said on budget night, before we came into office the Labor government was in deficit by two per cent of GDP. Two per cent of GDP in todayâs terms is $19 billionâmoney which could have been better spent on vital services and programs in this country. We are paying off that debt. By June-July next year we will have reduced that net debt by $90 billion. We are paying off Laborâs debt and soon we will begin savingâsaving for the future, and, as the Treasurer says, saving for the ageing of the population and for the opportunities of future generations. This is a record that every member of the government can be very proud of. The Australian public have certainly recognised this time and again by re-endorsing us as their government of choice.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is also important that we use this strong position to set the scene for the future. At present, we are well aware that Australiaâs population is ageing. The time is right to make important changes to ensure that we remain on a sustainable footing. I am pleased that this budget is placing an important emphasis on moving people off welfare and into the work force. Our task now is to help people find a balanced approach where they can participate in the work force. It is important to help prevent people from feeling that they cannot afford to move back into work. It is important for them to once again start feeling good about themselves. They need to develop positive feelings about themselves and to develop self-esteem and a feeling that they can make a contribution to this nation.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This is not a budget that is about punishment. It is a budget that provides support and assistance to those who are seeking to return to the work force. To illustrate the importance of participating in the work force, I turn to a study recently commissioned by the Australian Institute of Family Studies. This study highlighted a very important point. In their report <inline font-style="italic">Growing up in Australia</inline>, the institute found that 70 per cent of parents feel that working makes them more competent parents. The study focused on the families of 1,000 infants under 12 months old and children under 4 and 5. The results are very significant because they go a long way towards dispelling the misguided assertion that parents who want to return to work will harm their childrenâs development. In most cases, of course, the parents we are referring to are mothers who are seeking to return to work. This assertion is misguided, because it does not harm the childrenâs development. In fact, as the study shows, it assists the competency of those parents to deliver a meaningful, loving environment for their children. The positive effects of a steady job and a life outside of the home cannot be overestimated.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I read with interest comments in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> by the director of the study, Ann Stanson of the University of Melbourne. In discussing the results of the survey, Ms Stanson stated:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">
<inline font-size="8pt">... a lot of parents feel that outside involvement helps them to be positive and responsive to their children when they are there.</inline>
</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">It is important in the context of this debate to highlight that a healthy working life can be good for a parent. This is particularly pertinent for very young mothers who have children prior to entering the work force. I am sure we all know of such cases. If a young mother moves onto a parenting payment as her first source of permanent income, it can be even more difficult for her to move into and establish herself in a workplace environment.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In many cases, young single mothers want to work. The workplace environment can provide purpose and an avenue for a young mother to make new friends and build self-confidence, self-esteem and feelings of self-worth. The last thing that a young mother in her early to mid-20s wants to face is a financial burden when she enters part-time work. This budget is all about assisting that transition and providing real incentive to make the transition into the work force.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As many members in the chamber will be aware, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation, which I chair, recently tabled a report in the House. That report on increasing participation in paid work inquired into how we can lift the participation rate in Australia. At present, Australiaâs work force participation rate is at 63.8 per cent. This is one of the lowest levels in the Western world and is a real long-term concern for our economy. One worrying observation that our committee heard is that Australia will have approximately 500,000 jobs with no-one to fill them by the year 2030.</para>

<para>âAs I was saying before the suspension, at 63.8 per cent Australiaâs participation rate is one of the lowest in the OECD. The reasons for the slow participation rate are varied. Some of the terms are fast becoming part of our contemporary vernacular. Terms such as âageing populationâ and âskills shortagesâ are often thrown about; they certainly feature prominently in the current national debate. A significant recommendation from the report I was referring to is recommendation 4, which I would like to share with the chamber:</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Committee recommends that the Australian Government review the tax free threshold, taper rates, effective marginal tax rates and income test stacking to maximise incentives to move from income support payments to increased participation in paid work.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I am pleased to see the fast adoption in the budget of part of this recommendation. Lifting the allowable income level to $37,500 before family tax benefit A decreases will help ease single parents back into the work force. This is good news for those looking to return to work. It provides an additional incentive through the tax system to make the transition. In combination with a decrease in the marginal tax rate from 17 to 15 per cent, those seeking to return to part-time work will have their benefits scaled down at a much reduced rate.</para>

<para>âAnother significant investment in this budget that will assist single parentsâwho are, in the main, females choosing to return to workâis the additional 84,300 outside school hours child-care places. These child-care places will be welcomed by those who are returning to work. Often, the criticism that is levelled at the government is about where these women are going to be able to place their kids and what facilities are going to be available for them.

<para>âAs I was saying prior to the divisions, one of the key priorities for future economic management is to ensure that the long-term administration of welfare payments is sustainable. I have already mentioned the need to encourage more single parents on parenting payments to get back into the work force. The other significant welfare payment that currently does not carry an obligation to seek work of any significance is the disability support pension, the DSP. I am pleased to see that there were some changes made in this yearâs budget to encourage those on DSP, from 1 July next year, to increase their participation in the work force.</para>

<para pgwide="yes">In January 2004 a representative of the Australian Council of Social Service explained this shift to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation, which I chair. I am pleased to see the former deputy chair of the parliamentary committee in the chamber today. According to ACOSS, the increase has been, in part, attributable to switching from other benefits. It is more appealing to be on DSP than the Newstart allowance. It is important that people with a disability are not simply typecast as being unable to work. Just as importantly, I have come across disabled people in my electorate and throughout Australia. Many of them have strongly implored me to be allowed to work if they are able to do so.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This budget is a $2 billion investment into services over the next four years, to help people find work. Members on the other side have made the accusation that it is about cost cutting and getting people off DPS. What they have failed to acknowledge is that there is no net gain from the changes to DSP and welfare to work for at least the next eight years. Of course, there are many different kinds of disabilities and not everybody is physically capable of working the prescribed 15 to 29 hours per week. But many people with often debilitating disabilities, such as neurological conditions, do want to make a contribution to the work force. One such group I have become familiar with are MS sufferers. I am fortunate to have the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Victoria based in my electorate at the Nerve Centre in Blackburn. The honourable member for Calwell and I had an opportunity to visit the MS Society in the course of the committeeâs inquiry.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The MS Society is a fantastic organisation that strongly lobbies in the best interests of people with this chronic and often disabling, disease. The MS Society has also highlighted the need for a change of culture towards employees with the condition. Employers can be reluctant to keep employees with MS on their books for the long term. Among many factors, the MS society has stated:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">Employers are often uncomfortable with discussing workplace accommodation and accede from fear of allegations of discrimination rather than a desire to provide appropriate assistance in the workplace.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">This is a real problem for those with MS. There is a feeling that it is not matter of âCan I find a job if I have MS?â but rather âCan I make keep my job if I have MS?â because of the degenerative nature of the disease.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I strongly value the MS Societyâs contribution to this issue, and I am endeavouring to work with them on establishing a pilot employment program under the Employment Innovation Fund. This project will provide an avenue for employees with MS to work through training and workplace integration and I look forward to its implementation in due course. In addition, the society and I plan to co-host a forum in my electorate later in this year, which will focus on workplace participation for people with disabilities. We hope to involve many of the local groups in the employment sector, particularly those employers who have a strong commitment, a strong desire, to lend a hand up to those with disabilities to enable them to enter into the workplace.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In the limited time I have available I would like to touch on a number of other subjects, particularly the budgetâs strong commitment to vocational education and training. We all know that the unemployment rate is currently 5.1 per cent, yet it is still important for us to invest strongly in increasing our skills base. The best time to encourage people into the work force is a time of low unemployment when jobs are available. We also need to acknowledge that there is a skills shortage in key industry sectors in this country. Through its budget allocation, this government is giving priority to vocational education and training.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is important to recognise that a love affair with a job begins at a young age. School age people in Deakin will benefit from some of the 4Â½ thousand new prevocational places announced in the budget. The $20 million for this initiative will support the $26 million that will go towards 7,000 new school based apprenticeships. We are pushing for a greater focus on vocational training. There are many more significant issues that I could go into, such as the $537 million to extend youth allowance and other assistance to young apprentices. I am sure there will be plenty of opportunities in coming weeks to debate these issues.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">One of the problems with school based apprenticeships is having the training recognised by the relevant industry sector. I have certainly encouraged the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education, Gary Hardgrave, to identify some of the impediments in the Victorian system. These impediments prevent the school based apprenticeships and traineeships from being recognised by prospective employers. There is a real concern that a number of industry awards make it incredibly difficult for such recognition to take place. While they recognise the formal curriculum side of an apprenticeâs training, often they will not recognise the workplace experience that accompanies it. It is not uncommon for an apprentice to be asked to start all over again when they have finished their school based apprenticeship.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The âLocal Answersâ funding included in this budget is important for my electorate of Deakin and has been most welcome. It has been directed at helping community groups do their fantastic work in our local area. It is targeted towards helping young people remain active. I have had several young people write to me and call my office about the need for recreational facilities, particularly in the City of Maroondah in Ringwood. For years young skaters and rollerbladers have had to travel to nearby Croydon to use outdoor skating facilities. The Maroondah City Council has long envisaged building a similar facility in Staley Gardens right in the middle of Ringwood. I recall in the election campaign making a commitment to ensure that we will get federal funding as part of a three-way contribution to establishing a skate park for the young people of Ringwood. A $50,000 commitment by the federal government is one which I know has been most welcomed and I was pleased to see that it was included in this yearâs budget. It is satisfying to know that this funding will make a large difference for local youth.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Just last sitting week I was fortunate enough to have one of my local schools, the Antonio Park Primary School from Mitcham, visit Parliament House. When I invited the students to ask questions, rather than asking the usual: âHow much money do you earn? How often do you fly to Canberra? Do you miss your family and friends? What kind of car do you drive?â the first question was, âAre you going to get us a skate park?â It showed that it really is an issue of great interest to those young people and I am very pleased to see that we are able to help deliver that election commitment.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Other groups within my electorate that have benefited from this budget include the Scouts. I am pleased to see that funding was also made available to help two Scouts groups in particular with some much needed refurbishments to their halls. These groups are the Seventh Ringwood group and the First Eight group in Blackburn, with $15,000 and $20,000 respectively. It is good news for them. I know that every member in this House values the work that the scouting organisation does in their communities, and in encouraging amongst young people a sense of the virtues of life skills, leadership and service.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The people of Deakin are an intelligent, diverse and articulate group of people. They keep me on my toes. They do not allow dominant issues to pass by without letting me know their diverse feelings. From time to time, some of these issues straddle the traditional demarcation belonging within the local, state and federal realm. One such issue which I have raised in this House on numerous occasions is the Scoresby Freeway. I am pleased to see that the federal government has kept its $560 million offer on the table for a toll-free road. I will not say anything more than that. It is on the table. I know that while Steve Bracks took much delight in the hyped-up sod turning of the project it is clear that the state governmentâs backflip on its no-tolls promise has not been forgotten by people of Deakin. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI would be really pleased if government members used this opportunity in the debate on the <inline ref="R2335">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2005-2006</inline> to do what speakers in the appropriations debate are supposed to do: come in here and talk about the budget, in particular about the Welfare to Work measures that are contained in this federal budget. We have 86 coalition MPs. One after the other they troop in, tell the good news story and troop back out again. What I am really interested in is how they can justify to their constituentsâin particular to the poorest constituentsâthe iniquitous tax cuts in this budget and the harsh Welfare to Work measures. I cannot understand why members opposite think that if someone is wealthy they need to be given more money as an incentive to work yet if someone is poor they need to have money taken from them as an incentive to work.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I want coalition MPs to come in here and explain to us why it is that they think shifting people on to newstart allowanceâwhich has a higher taper rate than the parenting payment or the disability support pension, so that people who will be on newstart will lose 60c in the dollar for every dollar that they earn instead of 40c, like they do now with the parenting payment and the disability support pensionâis going to encourage people to move from welfare to work. How does making it more expensive for people to pick up some part-time work, making it less attractive for them to do that, encourage people to move from welfare to work?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I want coalition MPs to come in here and explain to us how cutting access to the JET program, the Jobs, Education and Training program that provides child care for people who undertake training to move from welfare to workâa marvellous program that was first developed by a Labor governmentâencourages people to move from welfare to work. At the moment people are able to access JET child care for longer than a period of a year. They go on it for a year and then if their course is not finished they can go on it for another year. This budget says that if your course is longer than a year you have no access to JET child care training. How can it be that making it harder for people to undertake trainingâlike hairdressing apprenticeships, learning to be a social worker or studying to be a nurse or a teacherâwill help them move from welfare to work? It is a mystery to me, and I would love to hear coalition members of parliament explain it.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I believe that shifting people from the disability support pension and from the parenting payment on to newstart from 2006 is simply a cost-cutting measure. The member for Deakin said that it is actually not going to save money in the short term. The reason it is not saving money is not because of any of the Welfare to Work measures in it; it is because of the policing of those measures, because we are going to come down like a tonne of bricks on single mums who cannot find child care and thus cannot get part-time work. That is why it is expensive. We are going to pay the Job Network providers to breach people without explanation. The first time they do not turn up to a job interview, the Job Network provider will be able to get Centrelink to breach people, to rip them off benefits. That is where the expense comes in. It certainly does not come in from changing people to newstart allowance, which is going to be a major cost saver for this government.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The second class of welfare recipients who are going to go on the parenting dole or the disabled dole are the hardest hit by this budget. I will talk a little bit about the tax cuts later on, but the people who should really concern us in this budget are the people who are going to be put on this second-class parenting dole and second-class disability dole. Disability support pensioners are going to lose $77 per fortnight. This is an enormous amount of money to someone who is on a benefit. It is not much to the Treasurer and his mates who are getting their $65 a week tax cut on top of their pay rise, but it is an enormous amount of money to someone who is on a disability support pension. It is not just because the cost of living is unaffordable to people who are on welfare benefits; people who are on disability support pensions have a number of additional costs. They often have lots of medication to pay for; they often spend a greater proportion of their money getting around just doing the ordinary things that people do from day to day. Some people have incontinence aids to pay for and all sorts of things that we do not consider to be day-to-day expenses. These are the necessary types of expenses for people on a disability support pension, and they cannot afford a $77 a fortnight cut.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">People who are sole parents will lose $44 a fortnight when they are moved onto the parenting dole. If they are working or getting money from a private source, they are going to be enormously hard-hit by this budget. In fact, some single parents who work part time will have their benefits slashed by up to $236 a fortnight. Under current arrangements, a single parent with four children under the age of 16 and who has $800 in private income gets $250.26 in parenting payment. From 1 July that person will have their benefits cut by $236, and they will be left with a benefit of $13.80 a fortnight. How can we justify taking $236 from this sort of family? What the government seem to forget is, in their rush to punish these undeserving parents who are living the high life with their children, it is the children who suffer. It is always the children who suffer when money is taken from these sorts of vulnerable families. This family will be expected to suffer a 22Â½ per cent cut in their income.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is not just families in this scenario. Let us look at a single parent with one child between the age of six and 16. When they move onto the parenting dole, if they have $800 in private income a fortnightâif they are working a couple of days a week, maybe part time; they are doing exactly what it is that the government is asking single parents to doâthey are going to lose $206.94 a fortnight. They would suffer a 20.3 per cent cut in their fortnightly income. Under the current regime, they would receive $220.74 a fortnight; under the new regime, they will receive just $13.80 a fortnight. How can we justify punishing parents who are doing exactly what the government wishes them to doâworking part time, improving their chances of full-time work as their children grow olderâby taking from them $206.94 a fortnight? It just beggars belief.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As well as this, there is also the second class of welfare recipients who sign up after 1 July 2006. They are not just going to lose $77 a fortnight if they are disability support pensioners or $44 or more a fortnight if they are sole parents; they are going to miss out on the higher rate of indexation of pensions, so the gap will grow over time. The gap that we are talking about now will only grow because of the different way that pensions are indexed from the newstart allowance. They are going to miss out on the pensioner education supplement. All of the rhetoric about the welfare to work measures has been about skilling people and sending them out into the work force. How can it be right then that we would take from such people the pensioner education supplement? How can that be right?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">What about the telephone allowance? Surely someone who is looking for work needs a telephone to be connected to the rest of the world. Surely this is a basic requirement of someone who is searching for work. But people on the new newstart allowance, the parenting dole or the disability dole will not get it. So any help that they were led to expect in moving from welfare to work will be undermined by that as well.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The government has been trumpeting these welfare to work measures for months. People who watch these social issues were thinking: âGreat! They must have something really great in their back pocket because they sure have been making a fuss about these welfare to work measures. It must be something pretty exciting.â What a sad disappointment this budget has been. When it comes to moving people from welfare to work, it is all about punishment; it is all about stick and no reward, no carrot. It has been an enormous let-down. With $22 billion to spend on tax cuts, surely the government could have done a better job than giving 45 per cent of the tax cuts to the top 10 per cent of earners.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I do not understand how it is that we have family tax benefit part B, which is essentially a reward to a primary carer of children for staying out of the work force. It is structured so that, in a family where there is a major breadwinner and someone on a much smaller income or no income, they are rewarded for staying out of the work force or for working a minimum number of hours. Other people have called it social engineering and said that it is an attempt by the government to keep women out of the work force. Yet, if a woman is a sole parentâif her husband has died or left her or if she has left him because he was bashing her and the kidsâthen it is not a good thing for her to stay home with the kids. In those circumstances, when she is doing the job of raising her children on her own, suddenly she is a bludger. I cannot understand how we reward one set of parents for staying home and punish another set of parents for staying home, when the only difference between these two sets of parents is that in one instance they are in a couple and in the other they are on their own and doing it much tougher.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The other thing we need to talk about when it comes to moving people from welfare to work is: where are these part-time jobs going to come from? The government has been very enthusiastic about the 83,400 out of school hours care places. That is terrific, and Labor welcomes any increase in out of school hours care places because there is a shortage around the country. On budget day in the lockup Treasury officials confirmed that there are already 35,000 children waiting for out of school hours care places. That is almost half gone. There is no guarantee that any of these extra out of school hours care places will go to parents seeking to move from welfare to work. There is no tying of the extra places to parents who are seeking to move into the work force, and so it would be quite natural that a number of these places, perhaps the majority of them, would go to parents already in the work force. It is a real disappointment that this government has not done more in the area of out of school hours care and, more critically, in the area of long day care.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">One of the reasons that women get locked out of the work force and lose their skills is because it is impossible to find child care for children under the age of five and particularly for children under the age of two. When you do find it, it is so expensive that, unless you are a very high income earner, in many circumstances it is not worth your while going to work. So you take people who perhaps have a trade, a skill or a profession and you say to them: âFor the next five years, it is not going to be economical for you to be in the work force. But when your child turns six, just like that, we expect you to pick up where you left off.â That is not a reasonable thing to expect of people.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">If we had seen some more long day care places in this budget so that working women in particular could maintain their skills and maintain their attachment to the work force, which is so critical to people getting work, then perhaps I would be more convinced of the governmentâs sincerity. But the fact that there is nothing in this budget for long day care and that there is so very little when it comes to family day care really makes me question what it is that the government intends with its child-care announcement. I think basically it is window-dressing. It is supposed to make this budget look a little more compassionate than it is.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is worth remembering too that most single mothers are already working or looking for workâover 64 per cent of them. Most want to be in the work force. If we do something about child care and about training, I think there is a good chance that a lot of them will voluntarily move into the work force. At the moment all we seem to do is put hurdles in front of these people. All we seem to do is make it harder for them. As I said earlier, the harder we make it for the parents the harder it is on the kids. A lot of these kids are already skipping meals and missing out on school excursions, and the governmentâs solution is to move their parents onto a lower welfare benefit.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">If you look at this budget you also see that we are developing a two-tiered welfare system, which I think is appalling. I think that it is shocking that we are moving to a system where, if you are on a benefit on a certain day, you get one rate but, if you are in the same circumstances and have the same need for government support but you go onto the benefit after 1 July 2006, you will get a different amount. That is incomprehensible. I was interested to see that Ross Gittins also found it incomprehensible. In his column last week he said that this decision is:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">... a cold-blooded decision to switch the nation to a two-class welfare systemâa system where some people get benefits a lot higher than others.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">He points to people on the age benefit who will retain their higher benefits and their higher taper rate and he compares them with the people who are going to go onto the parenting dole and the disability dole. He says:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">The lower class will be the unemployed, sole parents whose youngest is six or older and people with disabilities who are judged capable more than 15 but less than 29 hours a week. They will get a benefit indexed the consumer price indexâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">in contrast to the pension, which is indexed to male total average weekly earnings.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Ross Gittins says the reason the government have been boasting about how their package is going to cost a bit is that they have been trying to portray that as an indication that they are in fact doing something constructive to move people from welfare to work. He points out that it costs a fair bit just to impose the work testâhassling people about how many jobs they have been applying forâon people who formerly would not have been subject to it. But the government has admitted that the package of changes will be saving the budget money after about eight years. We know why it will be saving people money: because people are going to be on a lower benefit with a higher taper rate, and they are going to miss out on programs like the JET program and the pensioner education supplement and the telephone allowance and all the other benefits they will miss out on.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Ross Gittins concludes by saying:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The real saving will come simply from screwing working-age welfare recipients a lot harder than the politically untouchable golden oldies.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I think Ross Gittins hit the nail on the head.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The other thing that is important to remember when it comes to what is keeping people out of the work force is child care, which I already mentioned. Child care has had what is called a broadband review. The minister has been looking at all the different types of child care and what we are going to do with all of them. The bad news is that some services are going to miss out. One that is going to miss out is in Daylesford Victoria. On 23 May 2005 David Wroe wrote in the <inline font-style="italic">Age:</inline>
</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">The irony of this monthâs federal budget was not lost on single mother Michelle Lowndes.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As the Government encourages single parents into work, it is tinkering with a child-care funding formula that might force the Daylesford Community Child Care Centre to close, in turn forcing Ms Lowndes to quit her part-time work and studies.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The manager of the centre, Julie McLean, is quoted as saying:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">What seems to be missing from the equation is that the low-income people in this area cannot afford to be paying higher fees.</para>
</quote>
<para pgwide="yes">The member for Ballarat, Catherine King, presented to the parliament a petition with 700 signatures about the closure of Daylesford Child Care Centre. Because of this governmentâs policies, centres like the one at Daylesford, which help working parents to balance their work and family responsibilities, will close. I do not think this is irony. It was described in the newspaper as irony, but it is hypocrisy. To say, on the one hand, âWe are going to help people get from welfare to work,â and, on the other hand, to take away from them every support that helps them move from welfare to workâtheir child care, their training opportunitiesâis not irony; it is hypocrisy.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The range of training and support measures provided in the budget is manifestly inadequate. Recipients of the disability support pension currently number 700,000 and recipients of the parenting payment 600,000. As well, there are about 65,000 mature age recipients of newstart. So there is a group of 1.3 million people that we are hoping to move from welfare to work. What have we done for these people? We have allocated 136,600 additional Job Network places. Someone is going to miss out. Only one in 10 people will get access to an additional Job Network place. There are 7,600 vocational training places for 700,000 disability support pension recipients. Training measures provided in the budget are manifestly inadequate. The problem is that a significant numberâabout 60 per centâof the target group have only a year 10 or equivalent qualification. Something serious needs to be done about their training and their child-care needs. This is not about moving them from welfare to work. It is about cutting their benefits.

<para>âI am very pleased to speak in the debate on the <inline ref="R2335">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2005-2006</inline> and associated bills. This is a great budget for Australia, and it is a great budget for the people of Ryan, whom I have the great privilege of representing in this parliament. The people of Ryan are very supportive of the government. That was reflected in my overwhelming re-election only several months ago, in October last year, which resulted in a substantial increase in my vote. I am delighted to say to the people of Ryan that it is great honour to be their local representative in the Australian parliament.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I call on the Labor opposition to pass the governmentâs budget so that Australia, including the people of Ryan, can benefit from the budget measures. This is important for the people of Ryan and it is important for the businesses of Ryan. It is absolutely undesirable that the government, which was re-elected in October last year, cannot have its measures passed immediately. So, stop the obstruction, stop the senseless politics and stop the blatant opportunism. It is important that a government with a very strong mandate can implement its policies. This will certainly be seen post 1 July, when the new Senate takes its form. The governmentâs measures can then be implemented fully and extensively. However one looks at this budget, whether it is income tax cuts, small business, welfare to work measures, health care funding, our international engagement or providing for the future of Australians through the future fund, this budget caters for all sectors of the economy and makes a very strong contribution to Australian society, in all its forms.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I want to take the opportunity to refer the parliament to the days of the Keating government and make a comparison between how the economy stood at that time and how the economy stands under the very strong leadership of Prime Minister Howard and his cabinet. In 1996, the Keating governmentâs budget deficit was $96 billionâtwo per cent of the nationâs GDP. Interest payments alone were some $9 billion. The inflation rate was over five per cent. A million people were out of work, and the unemployment rate was going through the roof. I am sure that many people in my electorate were affected by those figures. Mortgage interest rates were astoundingly high, at 18 to 20 per cent. Business confidence was at an all-time low, and small businesses were paying through the roofâwith interest rates of over 20 per cent. The taxation system and the industrial relations system were shambolic and outdated. This begs the question: who was the finance minister at that time? It was none other than the current Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, the member for Brand. The people in my electorate of Ryan have spoken decisively, having returned a Liberal member to this parliament and having played a strong part in returning the Howard government on three successive occasions for four election wins.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The coalition election victory in 1996, after a decade of Labor neglect, was very significant for this country. I am sure that when the Prime Minister took office he surveyed the scene and saw that the challenges facing him as the new Prime Minister of this country were very significant. There were always going to be massive challenges. Of course the government went to work straight away and took to the 1998 election a very historic taxation reform package. It asked the people of Australia for a mandate to implement those reforms, and those reforms have taken this country into the 21st century and set us up for decades of prosperity and growth if we can continue to govern wisely. Those reforms are going to set up this country so that my children and grandchildren, and the children and grandchildren of every member of this parliament, will prosper.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Not surprisingly, the ALP opposition stood in the way of these tax reforms of the 1998 electionâthe so-called GST election. I am sure the opposition thought they could surf to victory by being a small target. The Australian people showed very strongly that they were not going to be taken for a ride and saw straight through the blatant opportunism of the small target campaign that was adopted. We do not hear too much about it now, but their policy was one of roll-backâthat is, rolling back the GST reforms.</para>

<para>âI am happy to advise my National Party coalition colleague that that word was roll-back. I am not sure when that word was last mentioned in the House of Representatives or indeed in the SenateâI might check on that in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and advise my colleague. I am sure his electorate would be very keen to hear about this as well. I know that he is doing a fine job representing his constituents. The roll-back policy is dead and buried. It proved to be something on which the Australian people were not going to be taken for a ride. Thankfully for that, Australia today is a much better place. We are enjoying remarkable economic growth and remarkable prosperityâsomething which has allowed the government to deliver vital services to take this country forward.</para>

<para pgwide="yes">On budget night the Treasurer delivered his eighth successive budget surplus. The federal governmentâs cash budget surplus stands at $8.9 billion. This represents a surplus of one per cent of GDP. The unemployment level is at an almost 30-year low of 5.1 per cent. Isnât that remarkable? I would like to refer to the remarks of the previous speaker, the member for Sydney, about welfare to work. She seemed to focus a lot on that. The best thing you can do for people in this country is to give them a job. The best thing we can do is to give them a highly paid job, and this government focuses very much on skills and training. That is what is going to take people off welfare and into the employment market. Over the past nine years, real wages have risen in this country by 14 per cent, which compares most favourably to the 1.2 per cent rise over the 13 years of the ALP government. As the Prime Minister said recently, we are now in the 14th year of the longest unbroken economic expansion that Australia has had at any time since World War II. That is a very significant statement of fact.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I remind the parliament that the ALP left office in 1996 with a $96 billion budget deficit, or two per cent of GDP. Why is this important to the people of Ryan? It is very important because what that meant was that we were paying an incredible amount of interest. What did that do? It deprived the people of Ryan and the rest of the country of vital amounts of money for services to hospitals, the education sector and other important areas of the economy. Laborâs debt has been repaid to the tune of $90 billion. It has certainly been hard going, but we are making those repayments in the interests of our children, our grandchildren and the future of this country. Only by reducing the principal of that debt can we remove further interest payments. By doing that, $5.7 billion of interest payments have been freed up. We are talking about a very significant amount of money.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">People have asked me from time to time in the Ryan electorate, âWhy do you keep harping on about this budget deficit that the Labor government left you in 1996?â I say to them, and I again say today in the parliament, that I go on about it because it is very important to remind the Australian community that when Labor were in government they did not have the capacity to run the economy in the interests of the Australian community. How can you run a country with a massive debt and not expect that to catch up with the country some time down the track? For the people of Ryan, and their children and grandchildren, the governmentâs policies will make their lives and their economic prosperity much better into the future. We are certainly the envy of other nations.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I want to take the opportunity, while I am speaking on the debt that Labor had when they were in office, to remind the parliament, andâas the re-elected member for Ryanâto remind the people of Ryan, of the debt figures during the Hawke-Keating years. In 1991 there was a Commonwealth net debt of $31 billion. In 1992 it was $55 billion. In 1993 it was $70 billion. In 1994 it was $83 billion. In 1995 it was $95 billion. And of course in 1996 the Howard government confronted over $96 billion of government debt. I think it was very significant that the Howard government was elected to redress that economic crisis confronting the country.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In 1997, the first year after the Howard government was elected, the debt was $82 billion. It came down in 1998 to $70 billion. In 1999 it was $57 billion. In 2000 it was $42 billion. It continued to go down. In 2001 it was $38 billion. In 2002, $32 billion was owed. This government has made the tough calls, the tough decisions that only a government can make. Being in opposition it is very easy to have a go at the government, but the decisions do not lie with oppositions; they lie with governments. For the people of Ryan this is very significant indeed.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I want to remind the people of Ryan, and indeed the broader Brisbane and Queensland electorates, that Queensland as a state benefits from GST revenues to the tune of $35 billion. Hopefully the state government will get on with abolishing the whole basket of indirect taxes that Queenslanders have been slugged with. I want to call on the Queensland government, while they continue to receive this windfall of cash, to spend some of that money on the roads in my Ryan electorate. Spend some money on Moggill Road. So far it is all talk and no action. I know the people of Ryan are getting sick and tired of the Queensland government reaping in all this money from the GST, which as a Labor government they opposedâalthough they were the first in fact to sign the document. Now they are receiving all this money and I call on them to spend some money on local infrastructure. Moggill Road is a state road. The Labor government has been in power in Queensland since 1989, bar two years of the Borbidge government. Now it is 2005 and Moggill Road remains in the same condition as in 1989. This is something that I think will be very instructive to follow in the months ahead.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I turn my attention now to the tax cut measures introduced in the budget by the Treasurer. The governmentâs tax cuts are due to be delivered on 1 July, and I hope that they will be, because the people of Ryan certainly deserve their income tax cuts. There will be almost $22 billion worth of income tax cuts in the country. I think the small businesses and the families and the people of my electorate of Ryan are looking forward very much to them, because they deserve them. They deserve them because they have been working hard. They are the ones who loyally pay their taxes, who make a contribution to this community, to this country. With the economy growing very strongly and the country being run tremendously well, it is entirely appropriate that they receive their tax cuts as soon as possibleânot next year, not the year after and not in the next parliament, as the Labor opposition have called for. What was the Labor oppositionâs response to the governmentâs tax cuts? It was not to support them. The budget has been delivered in 2005 and how have they responded? They have proposed tax cuts in the next parliamentânot in the 42nd Parliament but in the 43rd Parliament. That is absolutely astonishing.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">What are these tax cuts going to do? They are going to boost disposable income. They are going to, as I say, reward the hardworking people of Australia. More than anything, they are going to assist low-income earners. I cannot believe that a party that is the so-called friend of the workers will not pass budgetary measures that support low-income earners. That is absolutely astonishing. What the new tax scales mean is that over 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers will face a top marginal income tax rate of 30 per cent or less.</para>

<para>âI will continue with my speech. Only three per cent of Australians will face a top marginal rate of 47c in the dollar. The top tax rate of 47 per cent will now come in at $95,000, and increase to $125,000 in July 2006. Let me make a comparison with some of the other countries in the world. The US is 43 per cent and it cuts in at $425,000. Japanâs top rate of 46 per cent applies at $A275,000. In the UK it is 41 per cent, at $87,000. The top tax rate in New Zealand is 39 per cent and cuts in at $55,000, and in Canada it is $120,000.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para pgwide="yes">This is a major step forward for the Australian taxpayer. However, it is by no means sufficient. I call for further income tax cuts for the people of Ryan and the Australian community. The tax measures that were passed are by no means tax cuts only for the rich, as the Labor Party so spuriously claims. The Labor Party does not even want to pass tax cut measures that will help lower income earners. I can certainly say to the Labor Party that the low-income earners of Ryan will not be sending it any bouquets, that is for sure.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">These tax cuts are very consistent with an economy that is growing. They are very consistent with the responsible financial stewardship of the nation. But what was the ALPâs response? In the House of Representatives, they voted against the cuts, of courseânot only for those on higher incomes but also for those on lower incomes. The Labor Party are supposedly a party that supports lower income earners and only the workers, but they do not want to give them those tax cuts. I think the sheer hypocrisy of the Labor opposition will come home to roost. I think it is very important for the Australian community to know that the myth that the ALP are the workersâ best friend is just that: a myth. The Australian people will see straight through it.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Fewer than one in five Australians are members of trade unions. In fact, I think only 17 per cent of the work force is in a unionâless than one-fifth of the work force. In the first decade of the 21st century we continue to hear the ALP go on about how it is the party of the worker, but I think those days are gone. They are finished; they are dead and buried. There are more coalition members representing constituents with lower incomes than there are in the ALP. Of course we do have many more members. I do not want to remind the opposition of that too often, but it is important to say that the coalition members are working very hard to earn the respect and the regard of their constituents. In the House of Representatives I think this will show very strongly yet again when the next election is held. The Australian peopleâand certainly I speak for the people of the Ryan electorateâare only interested in outcomes. They are not interested in outdated, 19th century ideological mindsets. They want outcomes, and our government are delivering them.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">When was the ALP going to offer its version of tax cuts? In 2008ânot even in the life of this parliament. That is absolutely remarkable. We are talking about a budget that was delivered in 2005, a budget that offers tax cuts to the broad spectrum of the Australian community. How does it work that the Labor oppositionâs budget reply in 2005 offers tax cuts not in the same year but in a separate parliamentary term? It would be an absolute laughing matter if it were not for the fact that we are talking about policy initiatives from the leader of a major political party, from a man who wants to be Prime Minister of this country, from a man who sets himself up as the alternative Prime Minister. It would be a laughing matter but for the fact that it is so serious an issue.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I want to turn my attention to small business, because small business in Ryan is very important to me, to the broader communities in the suburbs of Ryan, to the families of Ryan and of course to those who own and operate small businesses. As I have said, Laborâs tax response proposed to pass its tax cuts not this year but in 2008. Worse than that, Labor are also denying small businesses and small business owners in Ryan the opportunity of receiving the governmentâs tax cuts. There are some 1.3 million small businesses in Australia, and they are a key to Australiaâs strong economic growth. By assisting them to grow, we are going to provide more jobs to the Australian community. The Howard government has been very conscious of the importance of small business in this country, and certainly I am very conscious of that in the Ryan electorate.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">One of the important measures of this yearâs budget was to abolish the three per cent tariff on imported business inputs, a measure which I think adds in excess of $1.3 billion of savings for small business over the next five years. A broad range of business expenses will also be tax deductible and will foster small business growth and profitability. I also want to alert the Ryan electorate to improved access to the simplified tax system. It will provide tax relief to small businesses and is worth some $360 million. As I said, income tax cuts are very significant both at a personal level and also at a business level.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I want to conclude by saying that it is very important that the budget measures introduced by the Treasurer in the parliament get passed by this parliament. I want to call on the opposition to pass them very soon. This is a family-friendly budget, a worker-friendly budget, a business-friendly budget, an Australia-friendly budget and a Ryan-friendly budget. The Australian people and the people of Ryan continue to support the Howard government in office because they know that it takes a very strong government to make the strong decisions that will benefit the Australian community, that will benefit the businesses of this country and that will benefit individuals. They took the tough decisions in the 1996 election and in the 1998 election, with the GST reforms and the industrial relations reforms that are about to come through the parliament. I think the Australian people will see through the blatant opportunism that the Labor Party continue to talk about in this parliament. Instead of offering policies, instead of coming up with ideas, instead of coming up with initiatives that will actually improve the lifestyle of Australians, they are only on about blatant politics. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThe Howard government has failed our society, even by its own liberal values. One of the deepest insights of the classical liberal tradition is that each member of our society is valuable and has potential. I can only paint word pictures for you, but I challenge members of the government to go into the Centrelink offices, the welfare agencies, the homeless centres and the womenâs refuges and see for themselves the despair, the frustration and the suffering that some people are going through. Stop your busyness and feel the poverty that is happening right here in this country, a country that should be so good to live in. There is an underclass of poverty-stricken people. There is an underclass suffering from despair. It is growing and has been growing like a noxious weed under this government.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The people being ignored or being battered by this government include the unemployed, the underemployed, sole parents, those suffering a disability and people caring for others unable to care for themselves. This government goes from one vulnerable group to the next, stigmatising, denouncing and threatening them. It has been put to me that the governmentâs actions suggest that it sees these groups of people as valueless and without potential. That person then offered me another thoughtâthat the government deliberately sets up disadvantaged people as a class against which the government defines itself. It has become clear to me over recent years that the government has deliberately tried, and to some extent has succeeded, in setting Australians against Australians, and it is this trend that my constituent is talking about.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Today in Australia, on Howardâs watch, it is becoming okay to denigrate those on social security payments, it is becoming okay to denigrate those who come from overseas seeking our protection and help, and it is becoming okay to denigrate those who hold different religious beliefs or even none at all. It is becoming okay to stop caring about our neighbours, both local and global, and just narrow our focus to ourselves. A classic proof of this came the day after the Treasurerâs budget speech. The <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline>âs headline read âWorkers 1, shirkers 0:Â  The tax system finally rewards effort and makes the bludgers payâ. The article goes on to talk about workers winning and shirkers feeling the heat. The implication is that anyone on a social security payment is a shirker. This is provocative language and a clear example of whistleblowingâthat is, it appeals to those who are already predisposed to think ill of people on welfare and just want an excuse to do so. It encourages the notion that the world is a simple place and consists of people who work hard and those who prefer to lean on others.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In this black-and-white world there are no people who have accidents, or, if they do, they have the wherewithal to look after themselves, they recover completely and they return to work without any further problems. In this black-and-white world all marriages or relationships last happily forever or, if they do not, the partners have the grace to continue to live together quietly, providing good care for their kids and not abusing each other. In this black-and-white world no decent people have an alcohol problem or an addiction to illicit or legal drugs. Those that do are seen, firstly, as having wantonly brought their problems on themselves and, secondly, as not worthy of any assistance beyond the recommendation that they pull up their socks and get on with it. These attitudes do not recognise that many people, through no fault of their own, require assistance from time to time and that some people require assistance on a long-term basis. These attitudes do not recognise that, regardless of why some people are in need of help, there are often children involved and that we must, regardless of their parentsâ actions, have concern for these children and provide adequately for them.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This budget is a failure. It fails our society. It is not just and it is not fair. It does not treat the vulnerable as people with potential; rather, it attempts to separate them from others and treats them as a different species. It is my experience, listening to the distressed voices in my electorate, that disabled workers and single parents by and large want to participate in the work force. The trouble is that employers often do not want to employ them. The governmentâs own track record here is a classic example. The number of people with disabilities who are employed by this government is falling.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The government makes a lot of noise about the recent increase in the number of people on disability pensions. The government is trying to suggest that there are a lot of people out there on a pension fraudulently. We hear disparaging comments about all those with bad backs, as though everyone with a bad back is pretending. It is reasonableâin fact, it is desirableâto ask why the numbers of disability pensioners are growing. It is then the governmentâs job to react properly to the cause, not simply to suggest that those on this support are shirkers or to make life more difficult for them.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Those who are on a disability pension fraudulently should be identified and moved off. Those who are genuine should be treated with respect, provided with appropriate assistance to get a job that is consistent with their disability and provided with the assistance they need to live a decent life. Appropriate assistance includes recognising that some people cannot go to work every day, that sometimes they are well and capable and other times their illness means that they cannot work. Appropriate assistance means recognising that some people need assistance in the workplaceâphysical assistance or assistance that allows them to work at a different pace to others without fear of discrimination.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Research suggests that there are several reasons why the numbers of those on disability pensions have increased. One reason is that the population is ageing and that older people are more likely to have disabilities. For example, men who have worked in a physical job all their lives often eventually sustain physical long-term injuries. A number of other social security pensions have been stopped. For instance, the age for which the pension is available to women is increasing to eventually reach 65 years of age. It is likely that in the past women aged between 60 and 65, unable to work because of a disability, went on to the aged pension. Many of these women are no longer able to do that because of the change in the age rules and so move on to the disability pension. Another reason cited by the research is that we are getting better at looking after people who sustain big injuries from accidents. More people are surviving and they need support through the disability support pension. These people should not be the subject of slurs by the government or by the community. They deserve appropriate support and respect.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">A constituent of mine has told me of the frustrations she is going through trying to get into the work force. Maree has been out of the work force for some time. She was her husbandâs carer but they have now separated. Maree needs retraining and her confidence restored. She has had her name down for a place on the personal support program for many months and is despairing of ever getting onto this program. Maree spoke to me before this budget was brought down and said she was worried about having her single parent payments cut. She has one son. Her former husband is a pensioner, so there is not a lot of capacity for financial support from that source. Maree wants to get her drivers licence and to buy a car so that she can improve the range of jobs she can apply for. She cannot do this in the face of a threat of reducing income.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">If the mooted changes to the disability support pension and the parenting payments are made, those who are currently on these payments will be treated under one set of conditions while those who apply from 11 May for the DSP will be on another set of conditions and those who apply from 1 July 2006 will be on yet another set of conditions again. We are going to end up with groups of people who are operating under similar circumstances being treated very differently. This is going to be an administrative nightmare and, more to the point, it is very unfair to the recipients.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The tax cuts proposed in this budget have been described as a welcome and overdue acknowledgment of the tax break hardworking middle Australians deserve. I am not sure what middle Australia means in this context, but let us assume it means those on average incomes or in middle tax brackets. If the government was serious about rewarding hardworking middle-income Australians, it could have designed a far better tax system than the one proposed. The proposed changes are: a reduction of two points in the 17 per cent marginal tax rate, down to 15 per cent; an increase in the threshold level for the 42 per cent margin rateâfrom $58,000 to $63,000 this year, with another move to $70,000 next year; and an increase in the highest marginal rateâfrom $70,000 to $95,000 this year and then on to $125,000 next year. This is on top of the tax break introduced last year for those on $50,000 a year or more. It is also on top of the complete abolition of the superannuation surcharge tax for those on high incomes, from this year.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">What all this means is that those on $50,000 per year or more had a tax cut last year, they will get one this year and they will get another one next year. Those on incomes below $50,000 will get one tax cut. The tax cuts are roughly as follows: there will be $18 per week for those on $20,000 or less; there will be $6 a week for those under $50,000; and those on $100,000 per year can look forward to $40 a week this year, moving to about $63 per week next year. That again is before we start considering the changes to the superannuation surcharge.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Some people think it is okay for those earning more to get bigger tax breaks than those earning less. The argument usually runs along the following lines: those on higher incomes pay more tax in dollar terms in the first place, therefore of course they are going to get bigger tax cuts in dollar terms than those on smaller incomes. I have done an analysis of the proposed tax cuts to test this argument and I have come up with some interesting results. Firstly, as I noted earlier, those on higher incomes are getting a bigger tax cut in dollar terms than those on smaller incomes. Secondly, those on higher incomes are in many instances getting a bigger tax cut than those on smaller incomes in percentage terms as well. The tax cuts in percentage terms over the next two years, to 2006-07, are 13.1 per cent for those on an income of $20,000, six per cent for those on an income of $30,000, 3.8 per cent for those on an income of $40,000 and 2.8 per cent for those on an income of $50,000. So far, so goodâthe percentage tax cuts are moving in the direction you would expect and in the direction the government has said. However, from here on in the story changes. The tax cuts in percentage terms over the next two years, 2006-07, are 3.8 per cent for those on an income of $60,000, 9.4 per cent for those on an income of $70,000, 9.7 per cent for those on $80,000, 9.8 per cent for those on $90,000, 9.9 per cent for those on $100,000 per year and 10.1 per cent for those with incomes of $120,000 per year. We have to move on to those on an income of $150,000 a year before the tax cuts in percentage terms start to fall againâdown to eight per cent.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I did not take my analysis any further than these income levels. Even so, it is a bit rich to say that someone on $150,000 can have a tax cut of eight per cent or $86 per week, while those on a third of that income, $50,000, get a tax cut of $6 per week or 2.8 per cent. Again, do not forget that the person on $150,000 also gets a tax cut, as the superannuation surcharge is abolished.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The alternative plan put forward by Labor is much better. It proposes that from 1 January 2006 there should be a rise in the threshold where the 30c tax rate cuts inâfrom $21,600 to $26,400âand a welfare to work bonus that will provide an effective $10,000 tax-free threshold for people earning up to $20,000 per year. These would be followed by further tax cuts from 1 July 2006, which would raise the threshold where the 42c rate cuts in from $63,000 to $67,000 and would raise the threshold where the 47c rate cuts in from $80,000 to $100,000.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">These changes to the tax system will give a $12 per week tax cut for those earning from $25,000 to $70,000âdouble what the Liberal Party is proposing. They will give the same tax cuts as the government proposes to those earning from $70,000 up to $105,000. The changes will give a tax cut of $40 per week to those who earn $105,000, which is one-third less than the government is proposing and a much fairer outcome across the range.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is interesting to note that the Treasurer has not responded at all to this alternative proposal. He had the details of Laborâs tax policy for some hours before he was required to come back into the House and sum up the tax debate. He did not offer any comment or attempt to discuss the merits or otherwise of our policy.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The government promised, in the lead-up to the 2001 election, that it would keep private health insurance affordable. It is a pity that it did not define âaffordableâ. Clearly, this promise is in the same ironclad, never-to-be-broken category as the Medicare safety net promise. I say this because private health insurance has increased by 33 per cent since 2001. This is hardly an affordable rise.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This year, the government approved and announced an increase of 7.96 per cent in health insurance premiums. Many of my constituents, however, ended up with a rise of around 15 per cent. One gentleman who rang me was very upset. He joined private health insurance a few years ago. He was not sure he could afford it, but bowed to the pressure. The big push was on. But this latest rise is just too much for him and he is now going to get out. This means he will join many other Australians who are leaving private health insurance.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The seniors health insurance rebate was meant to make the private health insurance industry more sustainable, but it is not working. The latest figures show that, so far this year, while 54,000 people over the age of 55 joined private health insurance, 21,000 people under the age of 55 got out. This leaves a lopsided private health insurance industry paying out record amounts in benefits, which is hardly a sustainable trend. Private health insurance is not affordable for many Australians and the latest move to prop up the industry is not working. Clearly there is a lot more work that needs to be done in this area.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Child care, or at least the lack of child-care places, is a continuing theme with my constituents. This budget will do nothing to help them; in fact, it may make matters worse. This budget does not attempt to match child-care places with need in either long day care or before and after school hours care. The government is intent on forcing parents out to work but has made no provision for the extra child care that this will demand. There is a total of 87,000 new before and after school hours care places in this budget, and this is welcomed. We know from ABS dataâthe office of the Minister for Family and Community Services does not keep this dataâthat there is an existing shortfall of around 174,500 places in Australia.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We know, because the Treasurer has told us, that he wants 190,000 parents back in the work force. We do not know, however, how the extra child-care places needed to cope with 190,000 parents going back to work, plus the existing shortfall of 174,500 places, are going to be managed with the allocation of only 87,000 new places. Those figures are for before or after school hours care.Â  There is nothing positive in this budget for long day care.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There is a negative, however, which is very hard to understand. In the face of all the noise that the Treasurer is making about getting people back to work, he quietly cuts funding for child care to parents on low incomes whilst they undergo training or look for work.Â  The JET scheme is now only available to parents who can do their training within 12 months. If you are interested in doing any training that takes more than 12 months, this scheme, which is aimed at low-income parents, is suddenly not available.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Industry has, for some time now, been talking about a shortage of workers with the skills needed by industry.Â  The Reserve Bank, last March, talked about this shortage too, as well as problems with our infrastructure. These two factors were the reasons given by the Reserve Bank to justify its decision to raise interest rates by 25 basis points at that time. The Reserve Bank was concerned that skills shortages would put pressure on wage costs and, therefore, inflation. Despite the fact that skills shortages have been talked about for years, this government has done nothingâworse, it has actually reduced capacity to improve the situation.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Since 1998, over 270,000 Australians have been turned away from TAFE. We see that 40 per cent of our apprentices do not complete their apprenticeships. This is clearly unsustainable and needs to be addressed. Labor has announced a completion bonus to encourage apprentices to finish their training. This bonus would be in the form of $1,000 midway through the training, and another $1,000 once the training is complete. This money would be tax free. It is estimated that, should this policy be adopted, it would put another 8,000 trained apprentices into the market every year. We cannot afford to ignore the need for skilled workers. We must train up our own people, who are looking for training and ready to learn, rather than trying to rely on importing skilled migrants.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In summary, this budget introduces a new tax schedule which is clearly unfair. It threatens the wellbeing of many households by moving parents off parenting payments and onto a lower social security payment. It threatens the wellbeing of many disabled people by threatening their incomes. It does nothing to address the training needs and child-care shortages which exist now and are becoming more acute. This budget is clearly a disgrace.</para>

<para>âI am grateful to have the opportunity to speak on the appropriation bills. I am also proud to be a member of this government, delivering real outcomes for the people of Australia. One area that is of concern to me and that calls for greater attention by all governments is that of mental health. The provision of mental health services is one of the foundational issues of any well-governed nation. I am therefore glad to see in our 2005-06 budget that mental health remains one of this governmentâs health priorities. This budget reaffirms the Howard governmentâs election commitment on mental health, with both the continuation of the better outcomes in mental health initiative, at cost of $102.2 million over four years from 2005-06, and new funding of $151.2 million over five years, from 2004-05, for three priority areas. The priority areas are $69 million for youth mental health, $39.6 million for the national depression initiative and $42.6 million for the expansion of the better outcomes in mental health program.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The states have the constitutional responsibility for the provision of mental health services. Although I understand that the Commonwealth takes the lead role in developing the National Mental Health Strategy, it does not provide any day-to-day direct services itself, but it does provide about 65 per cent of the total funds dedicated to mental health in Australia. This high proportion of funding suggests to me that the states are not pulling their weight in the provision of services to the mentally ill. In fact, while the Australian government has increased its contribution to mental health services by 73 per cent per capita, the increase by the states has only been 19.8 per cent. Regrettably, the worst offenders have been the largest states: New South Wales and Victoria.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I understand that only about 10 per cent of the money that states have saved from the deinstitutionalisation over the last two decades, following the Richmond report, has been reinvested in services for the mentally ill. What a confidence trick this has been by the states and territories against Australian families: closing down residential care centres for the mentally ill, abandoning the sick to an unprepared community and then pocketing the money saved to curry political favour elsewhere. The whole rationale for closing down mental health institutionsâindeed the promiseâwas to build community care to the point where the acute mentally ill would be better treated. Regrettably, the states have done nothing short of sabotaging government infrastructure and services for the mentally ill.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">But there is good news in this 2005 federal budget for improving mental health services and I welcome it. In so doing, I would like to address the issue often drawn to my attention by close family members of people with acute mental illness who, in their distress and anxiety, cry out for the provision of accessible and quality residential care for their loved ones. These caring Australians usually have a son or a daughter, a brother or a sister, who simply cannot look after themselves and who are beyond the sustainable care their families are able to give them. I would also point out that, sadly, there are some childrenâsome under the age of 18âwho care for their barely functional mentally ill parents. These children are, in fact, the primary caregivers. In questioning the policy of deinstitutionalisation of care for the acute mentally ill, I may offend many mental health experts, but it is the people trapped at the coalface who I believe need to be heard. They never have had and still do not have any effective voice in the formation of mental health policy.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In speaking to the legislation, I want to address a foundational policy upon which the National Mental Health Strategy has been constructed. I want to question the policy and the wisdom of experts that have focused only upon deinstitutionalised care for the acute mentally ill. I know that back in the fifties and the sixties in the area of institutionalised care there where human rights and other abuses in such institutions. There was a passive attitude towards rehabilitation programs, there was not nearly enough supervision and many people were just admitted to the institutions and, shamelessly, quickly forgotten. They were out of sight and out of mind. The situation then was a disgrace and there was an unquestioned need for reform.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Over the next two decades state governments of both sides of politics, acting on the advice of health professionals, principally through the Richmond and then the Burdekin reports, decided to close down residential care centres promising a bright new world of future community care. These were well intentioned policies. Sadly, the residential care centres were gradually closed but resources for community care have not lived up to their promise. The closure of residential care centres often forced people to go back to the inadequacies of the community. As a result, many found their way onto the streets and became almost permanently homeless. Many families had their lives disrupted by the closures as they struggled to adequately care for their acutely mentally ill loved ones. This had a domino effect, with many members of the caring family collapsing themselves in the attempt to support the relative they loved. Today they remain unrecorded statistics of suffering and a badly thought-through policy. The discovery of psychotropic drugs was a big help when turning people out of residential care, but even this wonderful medication still has serious and real limitations for many.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Rarely does someone with a high profile who speaks out with authority, questioning the policy of deinstitutionalisation, come along. But this was the case when Professor Allan Fels, the former Chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, courageously spoke out about a member of his own family, his beloved daughter, who suffered from schizophrenia. I quote from the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Herald Sun</inline> of 31 August 2003. In an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Medical Journal of Australia</inline> Professor Fels said:</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">A few days later, on 11 August in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, Professor Fels was quoted as saying:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">We should be very wary of deinstitutionalisation in the light of the mental health experience, where there is inadequate resourcing of community care. For some people with a disability, a communal arrangement is better. There should be a choice rather than a single policy of deinstitutionalisation.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Will the experts please note that he said, âThere should be a choice rather than a single policy of deinstitutionalisation.â The editorial in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of Monday, 30 May 2005 commented on the New South Wales Auditor-Generalâs report on emergency services. It said that, if an acute mentally ill bed is needed, the wait is âlonger than for other medical patientsâ. It continues:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Some have to be transferred long distances to be admitted, hardly helping their recovery. Others are treated in emergency departments, with all the attendant disruption and misdirection of resources that that involves. Others stillâabout 9 per centânever even get that far. They just get sick of waiting and simply leave. What happens to them? It is no idle question. The Cornelia Rau case shows the dire consequences which can follow the communityâs neglect of the mentally ill.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">That says more about our mental health policy than it does about our immigration policy. I want to say at this point that it is not only hospital emergency departments and immigration officials that have to deal with people similar to Ms Rau who are suffering an illness. Often it is the police who have to put their lives on the line when the acute mentally ill have armed themselves or are otherwise threatening violence. Police officersâ lives and careers can be traumatically affected by the consequences of a decision that they must make in a split second. As well as police, prison officers are affected. For many disturbed people, our jails have replaced the closed mental residential care centres. This is in part the effect of reducing over a period of several decades the number of acute care beds to 10 per cent of their former establishment. The editorial goes on:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">More mentally ill patients are turning up to emergency departments now than ever before, they are sicker, and more of them have to be admitted to hospital. The 24,000 patients admitted to acute care beds in 2003-04 represented an increase of 11 per cent over the previous three years.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Unfortunately, the mental health professional establishment and the National Mental Health Strategy are bent on reducing what is left of institutional care. They are dismissive of it as the old service model of beds and buildings. I do not wish to be unfriendly towards the professionals, because I do acknowledge their expertise and their genuine commitment, but it has to be said that in my observation and in the opinion of many carers they are obsessed with a 1960s antipathy towards institutional care for the acute mentally ill. In a submission to the Senate this year the Mental Health Council of Australia said this about the achievements of the National Mental Health Strategy:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>the number of stand alone psychiatric beds has decreased by 60% since 1993.</para>
</item>
</list>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">So, according to the mental health professionals, the first âachievementâ of the Mental Health Strategy has been to reduce the number of stand-alone psychiatric beds in Australia. Instead of the 60 per cent decrease in stand-alone psychiatric beds being trumpeted as an achievement, there should have been a doubling of the number. The Mental Health Council went on to say:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Reduced reliance on stand alone psychiatric hospitals was the major policy driver for the first National Mental Health Strategy.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">They apparently believe that it has been successful because âdedicated, stand-alone mental institutions are regarded as a last-case resortâ. However, on behalf of the carers in my electorate and in the general community, let me tell the chamber that dedicated, stand-alone mental institutions are not the last resort for the acutely mentally ill; to date, they are the only humane solution for those who suffer an acute mental illness.

<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">... while the institutions themselves have closed, institutionalisation of people with a mental illness has in fact been transferred to prison and detention systems or replaced with isolation within the community, for example through homelessness.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">If you shut down the institutions, what else can you expect? However, the closure of more residential institutional care centres is being proposed by the received wisdom of the mental health professionals. In response to the non-existent services in some parts of rural Australia, they are proposing that existing funding for acute care beds be distributed in accordance with population densities and to address unmet needs in rural and growth areas. It should be noted that it is the existing funding for acute care beds that is proposed to be redistributed, not an increase in funding for acute care beds in rural and new areas. They want to reduce the number of beds in existing residential care centres. With all due respect, may I say that, in light of the demand, this is a crazy proposal.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">From what I can gather, the problem seems to be that mental health professionals, as I have said before, are obsessed with the possible abuse of human rights in mental health care facilities if residential care centres are restored. I believe that in todayâs world there is a defeatist attitude of the highest order. I believe that we can have quality mental health residential care centres that are humane and are without the human rights abuses that occurred in some cases in the past. I believe that the successful residential care centres that can be observed in the aged care sector provide an excellent model that could be followed in caring for the acutely mentally ill. It is not rocket science.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Despite the cut and thrust of politics, the standard of aged care has improved significantly in our country in recent years. Senior citizens who reside in aged care hostels are residents in their own right. Some are owners of their hostel units. They are not cooped up in a house with five others; they have room to move. They can remain in company if they wish or go off to some other parts of their modern facility or its maintained gardens if they wish to be alone. They have available for their use dedicated recreational facilities and programs. Because of the larger numbers, there is a better staff-to-resident ratio, with consequent better services and resourcing opportunities. They are residents; they are not inmates.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Although I have had some hard things to say about the views that have come through the Mental Health Council of Australia, to their credit they argue for about $1 billion per year over the next 10 years to be put into primary and secondary community care, together with the matching of any increases from the states. They highlight the problem and they are about boosting community care in order to reduce the pressure on facilities for the acutely mentally ill.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I do not know whether the $1 billion-plus per year level of expenditure is sustainable into the future, but my plea is: do not do it by further reducing and badmouthing residential care facilities for the acutely mentally ill. Learn from the mistakes of the past. Acknowledge the inhumanity that was and still is being inflicted on the vulnerable and powerless because of de-institutionalisation. Do not shoot, by closing more doors, the acutely mentally ill messenger, who desperately needs more appropriate care. Do not thrust the acutely mentally ill onto their unresourced families and say, in effect, âThis is your problem. Hereâs a form to apply for a couple of dollars.â</para>
<para pgwide="yes">My concern is that the problem of mental illness has now grown and will grow further, to the point where it is beyond the financial resources that are needed and will be needed on a sustained basis. We have to address the mental health problem before the primary stage. The deluge of mental illness has got to this stage because we have been in denial about the things that can contribute to mental illness. As a community we have done what is easy and convenient. The mentally ill have always been with us but their number has soared in recent decades.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We have to have a close look at prevention. Family breakdown is known to facilitate great distress and contribute to depression amongst the young. It may release one or both parents to get on with a new life, but for some children it has a lingering and traumatic effect. Many blame themselves for the family breakdown and suffer emotionally for the rest of their lives. In some cases, family breakdown leaves a trail of many traumas, including child sexual abuse, youth homelessness and suicide. Research has shown that this is a major cause of mental illness.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">An increasing number of people are suffering dysfunctional and sometimes fatal psychotic disorders as a result of smoking cannabis and using other banned substances. Harm minimisation drug strategies over the eighties and nineties tended, if not to glorify, then to present an image of toleration of illicit drugs, and the legalisation of cannabis for personal use in some states has been a mental health disaster. We now know that substance abuse is a significant cause of youth mental illness.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is only now, with the greater availability of abortion, that its emotional consequences are beginning to surface. The evidence is now beginning to mount about post-abortion trauma that contributes to severe depression in some women. Of course, there are many other important causes of mental illness and depression, but these are just some that have come to mind.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> dated 11 April 2004, Professor Allan Fels said, when speaking of his daughter:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">Unlike many, Isabella has a family that both cares and is in the privileged position of being able to afford to buy better care. Those without such family or financial support are abandoned by a system that doesnât respond or doesnât care.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">He went on to conclude:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">Although we have had national mental health reform for more than a decade, the experience of the mentally ill and their families is of little genuine progress. As a community, our future health and welfare may well depend on our capacity to respond to the challenges of mental health and wellbeing. Our present approach of leaving families to cope, largely unseen and largely through their own devices, reflects poorly on our nation.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Robbing Peterâin this case, residential care centresâto underpay Paulâin this case, community based careâis not the answer. Blaming institutional care for the mental health delivery problem is just plain wrong. We need to finetune the Richmond and Burdekin strategies in the light of several decades of experience of only doing half of what they recommended and recognise the importance of adequate and good residential care models for the acutely mentally ill while at the same time building better community care. We could effectively adopt the current aged care hostel model for residential care and make it available to the acutely mentally ill. Finally, we could look at broader policies in the community that will help us avoid the consequences of mental illness. I commend this bill to the House.</para>

<para>âExcept in here. We are discussing <inline ref="R2337">Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2005-2006</inline>Â  and other appropriation bills. During the Treasurerâs budget speech, he announced new tax thresholds to take effect from 1 July 2005. I am not going to go over what those thresholds are. But what I think is worth talking about is the view that we have adopted in the Labor Party, which is that we believe that the tax cut proposals from the government are unfair. We are not arguing that there should not be tax cutsâlet me make that very clear.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">What we are saying is that, for the majority of the Australian work force, the tax cuts are minuscule. If a person earns less than $55,000 a year, the maximum tax cut they will receive under the governmentâs proposals will be $6 a week. If they happen to be on $15,000 a year, it is only $3.50. Many people in that tax bracket probably will not pay tax, but the bottom line is that what we have here is a structure that distorts the needs of the Australian community.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In my own electorate of Lingiari, 80 per cent of wage and salary earners earn less than $1,000 a week. This means that 80 per cent of those people will receive a maximum tax cut of six bucks a weekâenough money to buy a sandwich and a milkshake. As one of my colleagues said yesterday, it is hardly enough to get you a pie and a beer if you are down at the footy at the MCG. I know that, in the case of Traeger Park, you would not do any better. Traeger Park is the main oval in Alice Springs, where there is a very good football competition. At the other end of the salary scale, wage earners who earn $1,500 a week or more will benefit by at least $27 a week. If they happen to be members of parliament, who earn in excess of $100,000 a year, they will receive a huge tax cut around $45 or $50 a week. I do not believe that is either fair or reasonable.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In the Lingiari electorate, approximately four per cent of wage and salary earners will earn $1,500 a week or more. We note that other electorates are more fortunate. While only four per cent of workers in my electorate will benefit by the tax cut of $27 a week or more, 10 per cent of people in the Prime Ministerâs own electorate will get that benefit.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In my budget reply last year, I spoke about the electorate of North Sydney. I mentioned that 90 per cent of Lingiari individual tax payers missed out on tax cuts. In North Sydney the figure was 65 per cent. That was the case last year. This year, I notice that, in the North Sydney seat of the minister responsible for human services, 20 per cent of wage and salary earners earn more than $1,500 a week and will benefit substantially from the tax cuts.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This is not saying that we do not have a progressive tax system. It is saying that those who most need the maximum tax break are low-income earners on less than $55,000 a year. It seems to me that it is only fair and reasonable that we, as a community, examine what our priorities ought to be. Should our priority be to give an extra 40 or 50 bucks to members of parliament or should it be to give a better deal to those people and families who earn less than $55,000 a year? I know what I think should happen. I would be happy, in my own case, to have this situation reversed. That is why the Labor Party has introduced an alternative proposal to double the size of the tax cuts for those earning under $55,000 a year and taper the tax cuts at the upper level so they are not as gross for those people who earn maximum incomes.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It seems to me that, despite the rhetoric that comes from the government from time to time, that is an entirely appropriate course of action. It will say to the Australian community that, while we know the government is going to give us this tax cut of six bucks a week, and while we know this will happen after 1 July, no matter what the opposition does in the parliament, we appreciate the intent of the Labor Party to ensure that we get a better benefit than that which is being proposed by the government.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">You know the electorate of Lingiari, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley. You have been through it; certainly you have been to the north-west of Western Australia any number of times. You would recognise the disproportionate costs that people in these areas bear in terms of living. They pay for their remoteness; they pay for it very materially in the higher cost of food and the higher cost of fuel. These sorts of things are what we regard as everyday needs. Six bucks in that environment does not go very far. In most instances, while it will provide welcome additional income to most families, it will not be sufficient to shift the burden that has been placed upon them by a series of government decisions over the last little whileâfor example, increasing the cost of private health insurance and increasing house mortgages. Quickly this $6 will be eaten up.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">That is why we in the Labor Party say we should double that. The government should adopt our proposition of doing these tax cuts differently, giving a greater deal, a better deal, to those people on low incomes, with us at the top end of the income bracket saying, âWell, thatâs not unreasonable; thatâs a good thing to do.â We understand that families are struggling and we could hardly say we suffer from the same pressure on our family budgetsâeven though, in my case, we have a huge number of kids. There are families with an equivalent number of children who earn $55,000 a year or less. I think it is a bloody disgrace, frankly, that we should be countenancing pocketing our 40 or 50 bucks and giving these poor Australians $6 a week.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I have spoken in the past in this place about the cost of living in remote communities, butâleaving aside our differences over the tax issueâthis budget shows me that this government has no comprehension whatsoever of the needs of regional Australia, particularly remote Australia. It has no understandingâthat would be the polite way of putting itâat all of the costs and needs of those communities.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I have spoken in this place before about the plight of roads in the bush. Once again, the budget has let us down. The government talks about the need for infrastructure expenditure, but, once again, it has not addressed the infrastructure needs of Northern Australia. There are between 8,000 and 9,000 kilometres of unincorporated roads in the Northern Territory alone. These are largely used by the beef industry, the mining industry, the tourism industry and small communities. It is a severe cost to business and to those community members to travel on those roads.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">With great respect to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I notice we have in the chamber two members of the National Party, you and one of your colleagues. You understand, I am certain, the cost of transporting beef in road trains over large distances on bad dirt roads. Who bears that cost? Ultimately, the consumer, but directly bearing the cost in the first instance are the road transport industry and the beef producers. I would have thought that, in the context of making our industries more efficient, it would not be beyond the wit and wisdom of this government to recognise that, if you want to increase productivity and efficiency in the bushâthe real bush; not up and down here on the east coastâyou should address those infrastructure shortfalls. But do we get that from the government? No way. Instead we get a very distorted allocation of resources through the Roads to Recovery program. Where does that money go? Of course, in the pockets of National Party seatsâand principally that of the member for Gwydir, I might say.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In my communities we know the costs that are involved in not addressing this issue. A range of issues confront people who live in the bush, like roads and communication. The government is still going to sell Telstra. You chaps in the National Party understandâyou particularly, my friend, Member for Hinklerâthe telecommunication needs of people in the bush. In my communities people are underserviced and underresourced. That is not because Telstra Country Wide are not doing their job. In fact, I have nothing but the highest of praise for the Telstra Country Wide people who work in the Northern Territory. But they are subject to budget decisions made by a board. The majority of the decision-making power rests with the government, as the majority shareholder. The board has made decisions which will ensure that there will be no catch-up.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Despite the protestations of the government, blind Freddy knows what future-proofing means: âWeâll give you a set of standards which we think will work at the time, even though we know youâre behind the eight ball already. Youâll never get to catch up and youâll never get an equivalent standard of service to people who live in the major metropolitan regions.â That is what will happen. So we get a major communications disadvantage for people who live in the bush. That is not something which I think is acceptable, and I know it is not acceptable to the people of Lingiari. We deserve and we want something better from this government.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The people of Lingiari are the poorest of Australians. However, there are pockets of wealth in Lingiari. There is a large mining operation in Groote Eylandt, and there is wealth at Nhulunbuy and Ranger. There is a lot of wealth being developed, and a lot of taxes are being paid to the government, like company tax. There are a lot of export earnings coming into the Australian community. But we are not getting investment back in those communities or in that region by this government. It is about time we actually got a fair shake.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The bulk of the population who live in this community, 44 per cent or thereabouts of the voters in my communities, are Indigenous. They are at the very bottom end of the income scale. They live mostly in abject poverty. I will address this at another time. They are not regarded as being important enough to get the finances that are required to address their poverty needs. We heard the Prime Minister down at the reconciliation conference talking about how he wants to address Aboriginal disadvantage, Indigenous disadvantage, in this country, to meet Indigenous Australians halfway. He could start by addressing the major indicators of poverty. He could start by addressing the $800 million shortfall in Aboriginal housing in the Northern Territory alone, where communities have 17 and 20 people living per house. He goes on about the need for education. As I have said in this place on many occasions, you have to address the health of the whole person and the whole community. That means looking at all those indicators: health, housing, education, primary health care and environmental health.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">All of these things cost money. We are seeing no benchmarking by this government of what it is proposing to introduce to these communities to ensure they get out of this poverty. We get a lot of platitudes and a lot of mutual responsibility, but no acceptance by the government of its responsibility to provide these Indigenous Australians with the rights that every other Australian would regard as fundamental to their living. These are rights which they should have, human rights, rights which are accorded to them by conventions which we are signatory toâa right to education, a right to housing, a right to employment opportunitiesâfundamental human rights which this government has failed to properly address. Instead, it talks about penalising people. It is about time we got rid of the penalties and started accepting our responsibilities as a nation to address their most vital needs.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In the few moments I have left, I want to remind the House that, of course, there is an election about to happen in the Northern Territory, on 18 June. The election will involve the Country Liberal Party, a conservative party which has two members sitting in this place, one with the National Party and one with the Liberal Party, I understand. They cannot make up their minds who they are. But we know they are not a Territory party.</para>

<para pgwide="yes">I have to say: that was a great moment in time, one of those moments of history. I was asked to be one of the experts sitting on the ABC panel on the night of the election. We saw those results coming in. I was with Kerry OâBrien, Antony Green and Barry Coulterâwho, I am sure some of you will know, was formerly the Deputy Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. Barry was sitting alongside me, Kerry OâBrien was sitting over here and Antony Green was sitting over there. Within 20 minutes, I had the biggest smile. Within 20 minutes of the numbers coming in, I was able to say, âI think weâre going to win this. Weâve got these six seats; it will be a Labor victory.â You should have seen their faces. Do you know why there was a Labor victory? Because the CLP had done a bad job. The CLP then left the Northern Territory with a budget black hole of $127 million, which it did not disclose to the Northern Territory community prior to the election.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is a very different kettle of fish now because the current Northern Territory government is providing a capacity for the government to adhere to a fiscal strategy, to sit in budget 2005, which will ensure that its budget is balanced by 2008-09. The Northern Territory government will make its commitments available to Treasury to be assessed to ensure they will meet that objective. It is inviting the CLP to do the same thing, to have a bit of transparency before polling day to show what the true costs of their promises will be to the Northern Territory community in terms of their budget. We know from past performance what the likely outcome of that will be: there will be no cooperation. They hate transparency and they want to try and hide from the Northern Territory community.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I am sure that the Labor Party will be returned and that the CLP will not be returned. I would hazard a guess that that is going to create all sorts of havoc. I do not know what happens in your party room. Say Daveâs sitting with the Libs this week. Does he have a think about whether to go to the National Party party room or the Liberal Party party room? What do they do? They do not represent the interests of the Northern Territory if they are doing that. If they masquerade as the CLP, they should be sitting as the CLP in Canberra and not sitting with either of you guys. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âToday I am speaking to <inline ref="R2335">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2005-2006</inline> and the cognate appropriation bills. In doing so, I would like to compliment the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Brendan Nelson, on some of the advancements and general improvements to be found in this budget. As the member for Kalgoorlie, I remind members that the electorate of Kalgoorlie takes up 91 per cent of the Western Australian landmass and by definition, therefore, it has a most sparsely distributed population. There are some 250 communities, approximately, spread across that 2.3 million square kilometres. When I speak in this place, I speak for genuine regional Australia. Any improvement in the education budget that reflects opportunity for regional and remote Australia is of interest to me, because it is of interest to my constituents.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">In the 2005-06 budget, the Australian government provides an estimated $28.4 million under the Country Areas Program which will benefit Australian schools and students in rural and remote communities. This is good news. It represents an estimated increase of $6.6 million, or 24 per cent over the previous year, to government and non-government education authorities. Of this $28.4 million, an estimated $23.9 million will be provided to state government schools and an estimated $4.5 million will be provided to Catholic and independent schools. The Australian government recognises that students attending primary and secondary schools in geographically isolated areas often have a more limited access to educational opportunities than do metropolitan students. Isnât that nice? The Australian government funds for CAP are provided to state and Northern Territory government and non-government schools. The funds are used to support projects which enhance the curriculum through excursions, visits, and attendance at cultural and sporting events; to assist with the transition to further education, training or work; and to provide access to professional development for teachers.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In addition to those changes, from 2005 the Australian government has significantly increased assistance under the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme, the AIC. That scheme helps the families of primary and secondary students and tertiary students who are under 16 years old who are unable to attend an appropriate government school on a daily basis primarily because of geographic isolation.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The basic boarding allowance and the distance education allowance both received a significant boost from 1 January 2005. The basic boarding allowance increased from $4,446 to $6,000 per year from 1 January 2005 and will help around 7,500 students who have no choice other than to board away from home at a school, hostel or private home. This results in an estimated increase in funding of over $39.6 million over the four years to 2008-09.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The distance education allowance increased to $3,000 per year for students who study at home through distance education. The increaseâsome $1,759 for a primary school student and $1,140 for a secondary student in 2005âreflects the increased cost of new computer technology and communications infrastructure required by students. This results in an estimated increase in funding of $21.3 million over the four years to 2008-09.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The second-home allowance and the additional boarding allowance increased by the CPI from the beginning of 2005. Also, from 1 July 2005, the Australian government will extend eligibility for youth allowance, Austudy and Abstudy payments to eligible full-time new apprentices, who will be able to apply for the same payments currently available to full-time students. This will assist them in the early years of their new apprenticeship, when their wages are generally at their lowest.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">But my main concern today is not the wonderful increases to government funding for rural and remote education, increases which are seriously and greatly appreciated; it is to highlight the fact that inequities still apply. I have a great concern in particular with the inequities that exist in the allocation of and entitlement to youth allowance. What I will endeavour to do today is to point out the contrast between a rural based family having a child who is of tertiary education age and about to leave secondary college, and a city family in exactly the same situation. My proposition is that the rural family, by the nature of their employment, happen to earn more than the allowable ceiling. To start with, the allowable ceiling is $28,850 per annum for the earnings of a family, if they are going to be entitled to the full entitlement of youth allowance for their son or daughter attending a tertiary institution away from their home.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Youth Allowance program is primarily designed to support young people, but it ought to include country families whose means may be above the current threshold but whose income is not sufficient to enable them to rent or buy a metropolitan unit for their children to attend university. By making youth allowance available to this demographic, not only will the additional costs traditionally shouldered by country students be alleviated but a greater equity in access to educational opportunities will also be achieved. I commonly hear from families of country students who have no choice but to meet practically all of the costs of independent living for their child, while city families merely hand over a few bus or train fares.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">If the high level of parental support is not available, accessing youth allowance for a regional student will entail at least a year of full-time work so that he or she can be classed as independent. Compare this to city students, who have the option of going straight to university, comfortable in the knowledge that they can live with their parents for as long as required or desiredâor, possibly, permitted. In terms of access to youth allowance, the parameters of independence represent an anomaly. Students from the city can be classified as independent when in fact it is regardless of whether they live at home or not; whereas, a student from the country has to leave home to study. If they have not taken a gap year to earn eligibility for independence, they do not qualify for youth allowance. This means that a city student can be eligible for youth allowance whilst living at home, whereas a country student has no such luxury.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Compounding this inequity is the fact that these payments can be spent on socialisingâand are very often spent on socialisingâand mere discretionary expenditure. By comparison, country students living in the city have to make ends meet and almost always have a part-time job to cover extra living expenses that youth allowance does not cover.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The amount for independence must be earned in 18 months. Therefore, the student does not receive payments until halfway through the first year of study. They must rely on their parentsâ income or part-time work to cover their living costs in the first five months, a difficult task when studying full time, with some of the biggest expenses, such as books and general setting-up fees, presenting themselves during the first semester. A student can easily be left having no means by which to pay for them.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Further, as most university courses cannot be deferred for more than a year, if a student needs youth allowance while studying, and is not eligible due to his or her familyâs means, they cannot participate in programs like Rotary Exchange, or even take that gap year off to travel, because there is a need to spend a year and a half earning the money to shore up their ability to pursue tertiary education.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I note that there is assistance available to children under 16 under the Isolated Children scheme, as I have just mentioned. It seems reasonable to me, because of the inequities I have pointed up, that this provision be extended to older tertiary students if they are from country areas where they are not able to live at home whilst accessing tertiary education. This was certainly the case for my own children in Karratha, where we lived for 20 years. Like hundreds of families in my electorate, I experienced first-hand this inequity. It is part and parcel of country students pursuing a tertiary education. It is with these hundreds of families in mind that I rise today to underline this anomaly to the House.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We are doing a great deal and achieving a great deal in this area, but still the inequities exist. In the 2000-01 budget we changed the situation so that from 1 January 2001 the government would disregard 75 per cent of the value of a familyâs interest in assets such as a farm or business. We changed that from the allowable 50 per cent, increasing the eligibility or the number of those that would be eligible for youth allowance. Those changes, although they are greatly appreciated, simply do not go far enough. I say again that the federal Youth Allowance system aims to support young people financially if they are unable to completely support themselves. But, with the anomalies that exist, eligibility for the allowance is very difficult to attain.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Parents must have a very low income for their children to be automatically eligible for the allowance. As I have said, young people must work for 18 months and earn $15,950 in that period to be declared independent. The strict limitations on that allowance make it very difficult for students from regional areas who must leave home to study. Obviously they require some form of financial assistance if their family has an income which is above the minimum threshold for eligibility but is unable to support their child. Young people are then forced to take at least that year off from study to become eligible. The current system states that, unless the annual family income is below the threshold for automatic youth allowance, students intending to study higher education must either rely on their parents for assistance during their course or work for that 18 months and earn the required amount.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">When you analyse the very restrictive, very narrow terms that make that allowance absolutely available, it becomes obvious that a large number of issues highlight the anomaly and increase the frustration of the families and students that find themselves in this situation. If the regional studentsâ parents cannot support them, or if they already receive a youth allowance, country students must take at least a year off and earn the money for the independence. Alternatively, city students have the option of going straight to university. The comfort that they gain from living with their parents simply highlights, once again, the anomaly that exists. Country students are not able to have their university places held for more than 12 months. This is yet another hurdle in the road for a country student to achieve that diploma or that graduation certificate from a tertiary institution.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The youth allowance payment is not enough to cover college fees. College is an option taken by country students in order to meet new people and have the comfort of acclimatising with more ease to a city situation. That city environment is often most alien to country students. Unless they have the opportunity of the camaraderie that is offered by a university campus college, the achievement of that tertiary education is made more difficult than it ought to be. Because the youth allowance payment, if they are entitled to it, is not enough to cover college fees, the students need to work 10 to 15 hours a week in order to cover the fees. But the system does not allow students to earn more than $118 per week. As a result, the student does not have anywhere near enough funds to live a reasonable existence. If a country student is awarded a scholarship for course fees, they must attend university or TAFE the year after high school graduation. Scholarships cannot be deferred. These students are not supported for living costs and therefore must either rely on their parents for support or reject the scholarship and spend that year working to entitle them, eventually, to a youth allowance.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is an unfair burden, as I have said, for parents to have to support the living costs of their offspring at university or TAFE. It is often much more than the family can afford. It is not reasonable to suggest that a family income of $28,850, which is in excess of that allowedâthe base limit that starts to disqualify payment of that youth allowance is as low as $28,850âinfers that these families are from some great wealth belt and can set up a son or daughter in a metropolitan or other area where they may attend a tertiary institution that exists. It costs a great deal of money. They will have to meet a weekly rental fee and will have to do something about the cost of food. Many people see that, in the long-term cost effectiveness, they have to go into a mortgage situation and purchase some sort of real estate in the metropolitan area to accommodate their student child. There is ample evidence to suggest that country families do not need this additional hazard to remain loyal residents of regional Australia.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In my 2.3 million square kilometres, I have but one centreâBroome, in the Kimberleyâthat has an increasing population. All the rest are declining. They are declining because of the tendency to empty out rural centres and migrate to city centres; if not city then certainly coastal. This is causing a problem. I am often heard to say that if we allow it to continue to happen we will have the eventuality that when Australians from the leafy suburbs decide to have their once a year, or once a lifetime, sojourn to the outback they will find no-one left to pour the beer or the petrol. It will change, for all time, their impression of the wonderful outback of Australia that has been so much our heritage.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I have, for six years now, contemplated solutions to the demise of populations in the bush. In this place, I have spoken frequently on the topic. I have illustrated today just one hurdle that exists for families residing in rural areasâthat is, the inequity that exists for a family that does not qualify for youth allowance in a rural area, in comparison with one that exists in the city and has all that public infrastructure in place to assist them.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The main solution, as I see it, is a dramatic increase in the taxation zone rebate system that was introduced back in 1945 and has undergone, for the last 10 years, no reasonable review or increase. I call again on my governmentâmy Treasurerâto seriously consider the increase in taxation zone rebates and do something now to change the situation of hurdles in the bush.</para>

<para>âI rise to speak on the appropriation bills in response to the governmentâs budget for 2005-06. It is now three weeks since the Treasurer brought down his 10th, and the Prime Ministerâs 16th, budget. This budget does not serve Australia well. It does not serve Western Australians well and it does not serve my constituents in Swan well. This is a lazy budget. It depends on the rivers of gold from vast, unanticipated streams of company tax revenue emanating from the resources boom to fund a tax giveaway which is all about rewarding those on high incomes in the Liberal Partyâs natural constituency.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">In my response last week to the governmentâs legislation on the tax cuts, I outlined many reasons why these tax cuts are so inequitable and provide so little to help those families in Swan and the rest of Australia who continue to struggle to make ends meet. I do not propose to canvass those arguments again. It is sufficient to remind members of the House of the innate injustice of those tax cuts and of the fact that Laborâs tax policy is fair and provides a far better deal to those families in Swan on average incomes. The fundamental question is: why doesnât this budget serve Australia well? The fundamental answer is because it fails to use this revenue bonanza to put in place policies which will ensure Australiaâs future prosperity. We are enjoying the benefits of our abundant natural resources, particularly those from my home state of Western Australia, and a commodity price boom the like of which this country has not seen since the Korean wool boom in the early 1950s.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">According to the Treasury, Australiaâs terms of tradeâthe relative value of our exports over our importsâare forecast to rise by 12.25 per cent in the 2005-06 year alone to reach their highest level since the wool boom of the early 1950s. Perhaps members of the House who are senior enough might remember those glory days. Certainly it has become part of the historical record that we received â¤1 for each pound of wool. I am sure the squatter from Corangamite will remember those days well. Just as the good luck which Australia enjoyed then fuelled prosperity for some time so the current good luck we are enjoying could secure higher rates of economic growth and higher living standards into the future for our children and grandchildren.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">But, noâput simply, the government failed to put in place the necessary policies to dramatically increase infrastructure spending. This is not to say that tax cuts should not be part of this budgetâall Australians deserve a tax cut as part of this fiscal dividendâbut those tax cuts should be fair and focused more on improving incentives for low- to middle-income earners. There is no doubt that government coffers are oozing with revenue, which could have been used to fund tax cuts and to lay the groundwork for increased infrastructure spending, paving the way for a higher rate of economic growth than we would otherwise enjoy.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As the Leader of the Opposition announced in his budget reply, Labor plans to use the interest earned by the future fund to pay for national infrastructure projects. Unfortunately, the Liberal Party is obsessed with the public serviceâs unfunded superannuation liabilities and has earmarked the future fund for those. According to the Productivity Commission and the governmentâs own <inline font-style="italic">Intergenerational report</inline>, the superannuation liability of the Commonwealth Public Service is actually in decline as a share of GDP and will continue to decline over the next 40 years. The Liberals have created the superannuation liability argument as a straw man to stymie the attempts by the National Party to turn the future fund into a slush fund for traditional pork-barrelling. I can well understand the Liberalsâ efforts to keep the funds away from the profligate and irresponsible National Party, which regrettably has ministerial control of infrastructure spending.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The examples of rorts and unaccountability in programs administered by the National Party are so legion as to be totally embarrassing. I can hardly bring myself to repeat the alarming examples which have come to light in this parliament just since the last election. I know that the members from the Liberal Party back bench squirm almost as much as we do when the current Deputy Prime Minister is forced in the House to account for his dodgy ministerial practices. When the current Minister for Veteransâ Affairs is called on to explain her administrative misdemeanours it really seems kinder to just turn the microphone off at the dispatch box. For those reasons, I have a kernel of sympathy for the more responsible Liberals trying to keep those funds away from their coalition colleagues. But that does not negate the fact that a much greater focus on infrastructure was sorely needed in this budget, and that is where the government unambiguously failed to deliver for the future of this country.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">While the Nationals like to shore up their own electorates with rort-ridden programs and funding allocations which would not pass any objective assessment of worth, many of these projects do not provide the real impetus to infrastructure across Australia that is sorely needed. It is vital for all Australians that our infrastructure, transport, communications, energy, water and so on are as efficient and effective as possible to ensure our international competitiveness. The framework used by the National Party in allocating such projects is not based on economics or sensible public policy; in fact âframeworkâ is too strong a word. The National Party approach is traditionally not rigorous as it has at its origins some of the flagrantly misspent expenditure of the Bjelke-Petersen government in Queensland. Under Joh, if you were a white shoe brigade friend of or a donor to the National Partyâoften with the appellation of âSirâ being put before such names as Bruce, Justin or Bazzaâthen you could have the hereto unsealed road to your property surfaced at taxpayersâ expense.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">That is the type of approach the National Party apply to spending programs they administer. They allocate funds to projects involving their mates, bully local communities to make sure that only National Party members are associated with these projectsâjust ask the member for New Englandâand often do the paperwork assessing the projectâs eligibility for funding after the project has been approved, not before.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">How many reports have been published over the last 10 years of this government which have highlighted the infrastructure gaps and the bottlenecks which our businesses and exporters have had to deal with to sell their product? Today the government released a long-awaited report by an eminent prime ministerial task force on ways to remove infrastructure bottlenecks that harm Australiaâs economy. This report has confirmed what the Labor Party has been saying: that the current transport infrastructure programs are a joke. The worst joke, of course, is the AusLink program. As eminent economic commentator Alan Wood of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> commented the day after the budget:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Under AusLink, a lot of money is likely to be wasted without the check of any rigorous cost benefit analysis. It started in the election campaign and will continue, as will the now notorious Roads to Recovery program.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">As a Western Australian, I have long called for a better deal for Western Australia in terms of transport road funding. Unfortunately, my calls have fallen on deaf ears with this government. It is of little surprise that we in the west call the AusLink program âEastLinkâ, given its focus on the eastern states.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I have been calling for federal assistance under the national highway program for the upgrading of a section of the Great Eastern Highway in my electorate of Swan. The stretch that requires urgent widening and upgrading is between Redcliffe and Rivervale. As those who know Perth well will understand, the stretch of road not only is a major link between the Perth CBD and Perth Airport but also is the major arterial road linking Perth to the eastern states and therefore clearly forms part of the national highway.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As I informed the House earlier this year, it is not overstating matters to say that this section of the highway is the lifeblood of Perthâs transport industry. Yet, again, this sensible, cost-effective project, which ultimately would benefit not just those in my electorate but all Western Australian businesses and indeed national businesses and tourism, has been ignored. As the local member for the area, if the government were to approve this project I would be the first to recognise and acknowledge the wisdom of its doing so. But, yet again, Western Australians have been cruelly disappointed by a government which seems to believe the national border ends at the Nullarbor. Unfortunately it does not, but I am sure it thinks it does.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">To add insult to injury, much of the revenue bonanza which this government has received comes from Western Australia in the form of company tax receipts from the mining boom. Is it too much to ask that some of this windfall gain be passed on to the state of origin for the benefit of its citizens and businesses in terms of better infrastructure? I am becoming very concerned about the lack of any advocate for Western Australia in the federal cabinet. While I know that Senators Ian Campbell and Ellison are ministers, I have to say that, if they are arguing as they should be that Western Australia is generating the bulk of the wealth on which Australian prosperity is riding and that therefore Western Australia deserves a better deal, they are being demonstrably unsuccessful in doing so.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Another vital aspect of infrastructure is telecommunications. Unfortunately I have previously had occasion to raise in the parliament the issue of the appalling standards of Telstra services in my electorate. In February and again in March I raised the issue of inadequate services and the broken promises of Telstra in regard to the access of several of my constituents to broadband services. On 17 March this year I wrote to the CEO of Telstra, Dr Ziggy Switkowski, and called on him to come to my electorate to see for himself the inadequacies of Telstra services. I explicitly asked for him not to palm me off onto one of his staff but to come and see these problems for himself. Lo and behold, on 24 March I received a letter not from Dr Switkowski but from Bill Scales, one of Dr Switkowskiâs underlings, informing me that Dr Switkowski had no plans to visit Perth and therefore would not be able to meet with my constituents or me to discuss these problems.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I was disappointed that the CEO of a still majority public owned company would treat the genuine concerns of the current majority owners of Telstraâfor example, my constituentsâwith such disdain and disregard. Imagine my surprise, therefore, when I noticed a few days ago in the social pages of the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> newspaper a picture of Dr Switkowski, dressed to the nines, tripping the light fantastic at a business school soiree at the University of Western Australia. It turned out that not only was Dr Switkowski in Perth, when I had been informed that he had no plans to visit the west, but, to add insult to injury, his presence at this function with the top end of town was advertised in November last year. I believe that my constituents deserve better than this blatant disregard from the CEO of a company still owned in a majority sense by the people of Australia.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I wrote to Dr Switkowski again on 12 May and explained my disappointment with him regarding the misleading information I had been given by Telstra about his travel plans. Last week on 26 May I was honoured to receive a reply from Dr Switkowski himself, telling me:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">A useful step might be for me to call you and discuss further your viewsâI will set this up for the days ahead when convenient to you.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I must admit that I am a bit bemused and a little amused that so much planning and setting up is involved in the head of Telstra contacting a federal MPâparticularly by phone. In the time that it would have taken for Dr Switkowski to sign the letter, he could have just dialled my number.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Let me give the House yet another example of Telstraâs failure to meet and satisfy customer demands in Swan. In early April this year, Lynda, a constituent of mine who lives in Bentley, was contacted by Telstra, offering her Telstraâs latest promotion: a new fixed phone service with 50 free phone calls a month and 50 free SMS messages a month. Under her previous policy, Lynda was receiving a fixed number of free phone calls but, notwithstanding this, Lynda told the Telstra representative that she would convert to Telstra if she could also get broadband internet connection. Having received assurances from the Telstra representative that this would be the case, Lynda decided to subscribe to Telstra for a fixed home phone service and provision of internet services. She signed the necessary paperwork.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">After not hearing from Telstra for some time, Lynda contacted the company herself, querying the delay. She was told that her phone service had been transferred to Telstra around 22 April, but they could not give her any information on the broadband connection. So, on 11 May, Lynda again phoned Telstra and was told that she would not be able to get broadband connection until mid-July, as there were no ports available to the local exchangeâand, because she did not have two or more Telstra services, she could not get the 50 free calls a month and the 50 free SMS messages that were originally offered as part of the deal. In other words, my constituent is currently financially disadvantaged, compared to her original arrangements with another carrier, because of misinformation given to her by Telstra.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Despite Telstraâs promises, Lynda will not get broadband internet access until mid-July. That is the date, I suppose, when Telstra will finally have signed up enough people in Lyndaâs street to warrant the cost of adding another port to the exchange. She has now been belatedly promised that all discounts and free calls will be backdated to April. I wait with great interest to see whether this promise eventuates. I believe the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman had to get involved to make that happen.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This is but one of many similar issues raised with me by constituents. It is clear to me that many of Telstraâs broken promises to those in my electorate are due to the companyâs reluctance to invest in new networks and technologies because of its corporate desire to minimise expenditure and boost the sale price. I urge all of my colleagues in this House to take a serious view of Telstraâs behaviour and to document their constituentsâ complaints so that, like me, they can use the opportunities of this House to try and impose some scrutiny on Telstra.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Mark my words: although it is difficult to imagine, if Telstra is fully sold it will become even less responsive to customersâ needs. And once againâthey are at it againâthe National Party will have caved in and sold out its own constituents and all Australians. Given its ineptitude, it is not surprising that since 1996 the number of National Party members of this House has been reduced from 17 to 12. Little wonder that we have seen the Independent members for New England, Kennedy and Calare returned handsomely.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As I have mentioned in this House on other occasions, the current leadership of the National Party is bereft of political skill, basic competence and administrative ethics. Members of this House have only this week and last witnessed the unedifying spectacle of the Deputy Prime Minister trying to argue in this place that national transport security has not been undermined by the fact that Mr Mick Palmer and his staff from the Office of the Inspector of Transport Security have been transferred to other dutiesânamely, to investigate the appalling case of Cornelia Rau and many others who have been wrongfully detained or deported.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Deputy Prime Minister is wriggling like a rat in a trap on this issue. Almost daily he demonstrates to the House and to the Australian public his unparalleled incompetence both administratively and politically. Yesterday in the debate on a matter of public importance it was not surprising that only 11 of his coalition colleagues were willing to sit in the House and witness his confusion. You can bet they were press-ganged into attendance by the National Party whip. In fact I think I only saw one or possibly two Liberal members there. I think one of them might have even had to speak, so he was stuck.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Another alarming failure of the Deputy Prime Minister concerns drought policy. It is almost beyond comprehension that the second most senior minister in the government actually sat around in the cabinet room in recent weeks and agreed to a budget falsely premised on an optimistic outlook for rural Australia. The Deputy Prime Minister, who, while he looks like a stockbroker from Double Bay, claims he has such an affinity with the bushâon our side of the House we call him the Liberal in gumbootsâfailed in the most fundamental way to inform his Liberal colleagues that the drought was getting worse. He has also agreed to a budget devoid of any additional measures for the drought. Within three weeks the government was forced to confront reality and change budget policy. The truth of the matter is that the Deputy Prime Minister got well and truly rolled by the Liberals on the nature and scope of the drought measures.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This is the same Deputy Prime Minister with the glass jaw who will soon roll over on the sale of Telstra. As someone who was once a farmer and who has lived in regional Australia, I know how important access to efficient, reliable and state-of-the-art telecommunications services is to regional Australia. As the federal member for an inner city electorate in Perth, I know that these issues are vitally important to urban residents as well. Country residents will ask themselves: why vote for the National Party when the National Party has sold Telstra and in so doing has reduced further the service quality in telecommunications? The simple truth of the matter is that the most profitable telecommunications services are located in Sydney and Melbourne and along the eastern coast and if you live elsewhere you are a marginal customer to Telstra, meaning they do not really give a toss about you.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As I draw to a close, I would like to leave the House with one clear message: this budget is a missed opportunity that fails all Australians. In years to come, we will look back at 2005 and know that, if only we had invested wisely in infrastructure now, we would be equipped to sustain higher economic growth. The Hawke-Keating government commenced the process of reforming the Australian economy through tariff cuts, tax reform and more flexible labour markets. They modernised the Australian economy and strengthened it to better compete in global markets. Those substantial and genuine reforms have stood the economy in good stead. The coalition has implemented some further policy reforms which have received the support of the opposition. This budget is not an example of the government grasping the nettle and implementing much-needed reform. We should have used our good circumstances to secure long-lasting investment in our infrastructure, which would enable us to sustain higher economic growth rates for the future. Unfortunately the coalition has squibbed this opportunity, to the detriment of all Australians, and in particular to the detriment of Western Australians, who have contributed so much to the national good fortune. I call on members to reject this budget and to put pressure on the government to address our infrastructure deficiencies as a matter of urgency.</para>

<para>âThe member for Swan joins all those opposite in saying how he would spend the surplus. If they had been in government for the last 10 years, there would not be one. They would be scrabbling around having interviews with Middle Eastern money men, looking for some way of meeting expenditure. They would be grossly overspent. They are the ones that hollowed out the logs. They sold Qantas, they sold the Commonwealth Bank, they sold CSL and they want to come in here bleating about the sale of Telstra. If the member for Swan had represented his constituent in that Telstra matter, he would have gone straight to the telecommunications ombudsman and had it fixed immediately and had her returned to her situation prior to taking up Telstraâs offer or got Telstra to deliver.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">All of this reform of the regulatory environment of telecommunications has come about since Telstra has been partially privatised. When they owned Telstra and were running it, there was no telecommunications ombudsman to complain to. It was an appalling service. Everyone agreed about that. It was absolutely shocking, and there was nothing you could do about it. Now we have a responsive telecommunications giant. There are still some issues but, partially sold, it is a heck of a lot better than it was. Just imagine what it could be like if it were fully sold.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The member for Swan then continued to slur my good colleagues in the Nationals about their Roads for Recoveryâthe programs that they support that deliver infrastructure into the bush. Maybe that is the reason the coalition actually took seats in Western AustraliaâHasluck and Stirling were returned to the government. If the ALPâs representation of the rural constituency is so great, where are the extra seats for the ALP in this parliament? Our Nationals colleagues, compared to the ALP, are expert rural representatives. They do a great job representing the bush and its interests against the state governments that universally ignore their issues and do not deliver the infrastructure they need. The response to AusLinkâa very responsible national program about connecting our capitals and dealing holistically with the transport of goods and people around this countryâbasically ended up being Labor councils and Labor states squeaking out for federal funding for what are basically local government roads and state infrastructure.Â  For goodness sake: not only do we have to fix all the major issues like industrial relations reform, waterfront reform and tax reform; now the state governments are calling on us to fix their hospitals, their roads, their police forces and their schools. The list is endless. Surely, if we were doing such a bad job at the federal level, the ALP would have picked up a few more seats in Western Australia, rather than having Stirling and Hasluck returned to the coalition.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Quite clear from the member for Swanâs speech is the fact that the opposition is about axing the Roads to Recovery program. It is about squandering any surplus in incredible ways. Where are the moneys they got from the sale of the CSL laboratories, Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank? This is the same party that rolled over DFRDB contributions of members and government into consolidated revenue. Now, when the members of our military forces come to call on their pensionsâand eventually this pension fund will have as much money exiting it as entering itâthey will find that there is no DFRDB fund to finance that liability. Those opposite want to say, âThat is all right. The current taxpayer can do that. We do not need a future fund. Let us blow this future fund on a whole bunch of things that the state and local governments should be doing but, because of their economic responsibilities, are not doing.â</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The member for Swan was talking about the Nationalsâ support for our Deputy Prime Minister. The backbench of the ALP, behind the Leader of the Opposition at question time, is the most enervated, bored, restless, unmotivated group of individuals in any parliament anywhere in Australia. They are totally used to opposition. They totally lack ideas. They have nothing but a mantra of âSixty-five dollars is too much for politicians but $40 is okay.â If they really object to this tax cut for higher income earners, then they should negate the lot. They should have the courage of their convictions and say so.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The taxpayer is not buying Laborâs fiddling with the fringes. They understand that this government has consistently delivered tax cuts to the vast majority of Australians over the last 10 years. They understand that we stand for tax cuts. The message that they are getting from the ALP through its opposition to these bills is that the ALP stands for high taxes and huge expenditure. They do not see the benefit of that. Just look at the New South Wales state governmentâs budget, introduced a week after the introduction of this budget into the House. Clearly people can see that Labor governments take money from the taxpayer and we return it.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This 2005-06 set of budget bills builds on nine years of strong economic performance. We have had strong growth, low interest rates for home owners, record low unemployment and more incentives for people to benefit from our economy and contribute to our society. This budget now focuses on returning people to the work force. It addresses trade shortages. It seeks to improve parenting in separating couples, with a focus more on their children and a parenting plan rather than on the issues that that couple may have with each other. It delivers targeted funding to two of the most mysterious and devastating diseases in our population: dementia and cancer.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It also delivers on my election promise of $7 million for a library at UWS at Kingswood, for which I have received a thank you letter from my vice-chancellor, Janice Reid, which I appreciate. I hope this library will improve the experience of learning for students at the Western Sydney campus. It is particularly important that we have the types of resources that Sydney and New South Wales universities do. I am known to be a strong critic of UWS, but that is because I want it to be one of the sandstone eight. My vision for University of Western Sydney is a premier university, a university that will be top of the pick no matter what for every student in Western Sydney. It should not be a university of which students think, âIf I donât get the TER to get into New South Wales, Macquarie or Sydney, I will go to Western Sydney.â It is not acceptable. It is the only university in Western Sydney, for two million people in Sydney. It needs to start lifting its game and delivering to the section of people that it represents. It is far easier for students to stay at home in Western Sydney and go to university than try and attend one of the other universities where they have to make living arrangements away from home.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The other election promise that I have delivered on in this budget is $10 million for the Panthers stadium. While that stadium will predominantly still be for league, the new surface will mean that other sports, such as soccer, union and hockey, and non-sporting events, such as showjumping for horses, gymnastics and festivals, can all be held in that stadium with increased sitting capacity. The western grandstand will be upgraded to include an extra 2,500 undercover seats, and the corporate facilities will be upgraded to include an additional 300 seats, which will bring additional opportunities for sponsorship to the various sports. I understand Panthers have recently chosen the architect and that work will begin at the end of the league season this year in September. The work should be completed by June next year. I understand the NRL has agreed to a delayed series of games for the Panthers next year so that Panthers will get its fair share of home games in the new stadium when that facility is ready at the end of next season. I fully supported the Panthers submission by lobbying the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Arts and Sport to provide those funds. It is a project that the club has been working on for many years. Full credit to them for achieving that goal.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the great contribution of Roger Cowan, the CEO of Panthers for the last 30 years, who is retiring. He has a life of extraordinary achievement with Panthers. He has brought a number of facilitiesâsporting, cultural and otherwiseâand forms of entertainment to Penrith at a time when the private sector failed to deliver to the citizens of Penrith. Roger did nothing that was not allowed within the clubs act. If the New South Wales government want to destroy the club industry, do not take it out on Roger and Panthers. Regulate appropriately if you do not feel that it is appropriate for the club industry to extend itself with Panthers. I would like to remind everyone that Roger at all times saved clubs that were going into receivership and closing. At no time did Panthers take over a club that was already financial and that was not asking for assistance from Panthers. We have rescued a number of clubs that would otherwise have closed.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">If the state government has issues with that, there are other ways of dealing with it rather than opening up pokies into the hotels sector and populating gaming throughout an industry in the private sector. For all of the tragedy and social ills that gaming causes, it has no returns to society. The club movement was, I think, an excellent and admirable worldwide example of how to control and contain gaming and to deliver some great outcomes for the community. I think that the state government could have worked better with the clubs industry for other outcomes rather than set about dismantling the clubs industry by arduous taxation, targeted inquiries and increasing competition in the private sector with the hotels. Roger has seen the club industry through some very hard and challenging times. I wish him the best in retirement. I know he and his wife will retire in our local area and will be active in a number of things in our local community. I wish them all the best and acknowledge the great job they have done.</para>

<para pgwide="yes">This budget also saw the setting aside of $8 million over four years for the National Community Crime Prevention Program in Western Sydney. The centrepiece of this initiative is a national community grants program, providing funds for grassroots projects, designed to enhance community safety and crime prevention by preventing or reducing crime and antisocial behaviour, improving community safety and security and reducing citizensâ fear of crime. I believe the closing date for the first round of grants in the Western Sydney program was 29 April. I hope that many community groups I approached did put their applications in and will be soon benefiting from those grants.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The other election promise I made was the offer of $1.1 million for a vermin proof fence on the ADI site. I am very concerned that the New South Wales government has failed to take up this offer. I received a letter from the New South Wales Minister for Environment, Bob Debus, proposing a macrofauna fence to restrict the movement of dogs and foxes. A macrofauna fence does not gel with all the environmental issues we looked at in that parkland and all the environmental issues that the residentsâ action group fought hard to deal with. There is no point having parkland in the middle of what is essentially an urban area without a vermin proof fence. There are houses all around that ADI site. The reason it is in such pristine condition is that it has been fenced, and once further housing encroaches on that site it really will need a vermin proof fence that will prevent cats, particularly feral cats, and other introduced species from harming the flora and fauna, particularly the bird life. If we can get the Cumberland Plain forests back to their pristine condition, the bird life that goes with that community should come back too. That will only be possible if their nesting areas are preserved from cats and whatnot. In that way a vermin proof fence that goes two feet underground and has wires and barbed wire at the top, to stop that entry, is critical for preserving that site, for all the reasons that we fought so hard to preserve it.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It does not appear that the fence is in any way included in the plan of management. The last meeting of this plan of management is tomorrow night and so far nothing has come out of it to indicate that the state government is taking the R and E values of the site seriously. They are really not protecting the Cumberland Plain woodland and the flora and fauna on that site. Again we are relying on the state government to pick up where the federal government has left off, and again we are sorely disappointed.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The state government has also failed the people of Lindsay by so far refusing to provide an after-hours clinic at the Nepean Hospital. This is something that I lobbied to have in this yearâs budget, but it is not accounted for in this yearâs budget because the state government has so far failed to say where this clinic could go.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In their budget, the Carr government budgeted $900 million in extra funding for hospitals but half of that would have had to have been spent anyway to cover wage increases for existing staff under new awards. So for $900 million we are not getting any more staff; we are just getting an increase in the pay of existing staff. With the extra 4,000 patients admitted to emergency wards across the state this yearâand that figure is quite consistent with expectations: you can imagine that emergency wards would see more and more people each year; that is a natural normal increaseâthe remaining money will barely cover increasing admissions and administration costs, let alone improving existing services at the Nepean Hospital.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">When the Carr government introduced the pokies tax, they ran around quicklyânot at the time they introduced it but two weeks laterâand said, âWe will spend all this pokies tax on our hospitals.â I do not see that, I do not see anything in the state budget that remotely says there is an increase equivalent to the pokies tax revenue going to our hospitals for improved services and new services and more staff and more beds. There is nothing in this budget except normal increases, which any responsible state government would have had to fund. There is no real increase at all.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In August the federal government offered the New South Wales government the opportunity to establish an after-hours GP clinic located near the emergency ward of the Nepean Hospital to take some of the heat out of the emergency centre, which gets quite busy. We have seen a number of cases recently where Western Sydney hospitals have been on code red and patients have travelled many miles to be treated. Again, no effort has been made to take up this offer.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This budget has also established some health priorities, namely dealing with dementia and cancer. All too often we get the terrible news that someone we know has been diagnosed with cancer. It has deeply affected this side of the parliament at this time, with the death of Gary Nairnâs wife, Kerrie. Her funeral is on Friday, and I know that a number of people from this House will be attending. I believe Kerrie was diagnosed with cancer no more than five months ago. It is the number one killer of Australians. Everyone knows someone who has been affected by cancer.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I am proud that this government is delivering $189 million to strengthening cancer care over five years to try to lessen the impact of this devastating disease. The funding includes $4.1 million to develop and implement training courses for cancer nurses, $1 million to improve the support for women newly diagnosed with breast cancer and $4 million to improve the early detection of breast cancer. There is $17.6 million into cancer research, $21 million for cancer clinical trials, $5.5 million to establish a national research centre for asbestos related disease and $23 million to enhance palliative care programs. These are just some of the ways the money will be spent.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There is also $5.5 million to raise national awareness of skin cancer and $25 million over four years to discourage young people from taking up smoking. I am very disturbed by the fact that 25 per cent of 18- to 25-year-old females in my electorate in Western Sydney smokeâwell above the national average. This campaign will be targeting those young women and the reasons they take up smoking. Through a national awareness program, this campaign will be trying to deter them from taking up smoking. In Lindsay there are about 7,000 in this age group, meaning that about 1,750 young women in Lindsay are endangering their health.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I am always disappointed to see young women smoking. I grew up in an environment where we knew that smoking kills. There were big efforts by our parents to discourage smoking. It is quite disappointing to see it on the increase in young people. As a habit smoking really does not have much going for it. It is detrimental to your health, it is expensive and there is already sufficient pollution in Western Sydney without having smoking contributing to it. It is the largest preventable cause of premature death and disease in Australia. I hope that these initiatives will have some impact on the young women in my electorate to give up smoking or to never take it up.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I commend these bills to the House. They are yet another example of good economic management and strong reinforcement from a reforming government. They are a tribute to our Treasurer and to our leader. The ALP should be ashamed of the statements that I know the members opposite will be jumping up to make about how they will spend the budget or a surplus that they seriously would not have had. They certainly did not have one in 1996. There is no state budget anywhere in Australia demonstrating a surplus. This is the only government that has consistently demonstrated a surplus. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âIn this debate on the appropriation bills I want to focus on the attempt by the Howard government to laud itself as the friend of working families. It is true that since 1996 the Howard government has used a range of tactics to capture the votes of low- and middle-income families. It has revived this pitch recently in the Prime Ministerâs address to the Menzies Research Centre and the constant mantra at question time. The Prime Minister knows that to keep government he needs the votes of low- and middle-income Australians. He knows that, were this group to return to Labor, he would be out of office.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">At the same time the Prime Minister remains beholden to a set group of interests in the community, largely dominated by big interests but also those of independent wealth. Everything he does and says should be seen through the prism of these two interests: capturing the votes of middle- and low-income families and servicing his interest groups. It has been a fine balancing act, but when you bother to actually study the detail of what he has done and his policy approaches, you see that that is exactly what it is: an act. Far from being the friend of working families, this Prime Minister is more like the wolf in sheepâs clothing. In this debate I want to examine some of the key policy challenges facing families at the moment and the reality behind the myth generated by the Howard government that they support working families.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The self-proclaimed workersâ friend in this yearâs budget failed to deliver any real package to address skill shortagesâto train more Australians and to provide opportunities for the kids of low- and middle-income families to acquire a trade. He failed to actually assist people from the lowest income families from welfare to work and has presided over a growing inequality between high-income and low-income families. He failed to seriously tackle the propositions put by Labor for real tax reform, preferring to give the highest income earners a tax cut while not seriously tackling those in the middle. He has overseen a further erosion of the social wage through both his backflip on the Medicare safety net and now the introduction of his extreme industrial relations agenda.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I turn firstly to the issue of skill shortages. The most recent figures clearly show that the Howard government has presided over a massive skills crisis. Far from improving, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations skilled vacancy index shows the shortage of skilled workers is getting worse. As with infrastructure bottlenecks, the shortage of skilled labour is restricting the economyâs productivity and its capacity to grow. In regional Australia we face a shortage in both the traditional and the professional trades. However it is in the area of traditional trades that the crisis is most acute. The Howard governmentâs new apprenticeship program is not offering a pathway to traditional trades to the unemployed. The only path many Australian companies can now take is to look overseas for skilled labour. Australia is already ranked third in the OECD for reliance on skilled migrants to address skill shortages.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The effect of this policy failure is that we now have around 200,000 teenagers not in education or full-time work. Government members may well point to the increase in the number of new apprentices in the retail or hospitality industry. Despite the governmentâs rhetoric, many of us on this side of the House value the skills and experience gained in these industry sectors. In fact many of us on this side of the House have worked pretty extensively in those sectors. However, these industries are characterised by part-time casual work and predominately employ kids after school. It is an important thing to do, but they are not trade apprenticeships. We know that 40 per cent of apprentices who commence an apprenticeship in a traditional trade drop out. The government has done nothing to actually provide incentives for apprentices to complete their trades. This means that of the 580 apprentices who commence a traditional trade in Ballarat each year 230 are dropping out. The government has dropped the ball on this issue. This is just another example of its complacency.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">OECD studies consistently indicate that failure to make an early transition to permanent work or full-time study is associated with long-term risks of marginalisation, helping to trap people in a cycle of unemployment, part-time work and government schemesâwhich many of my constituents are, sadly, all too familiar with. This is also one of the reasons why Labor proposed providing more vocational options as part of school based apprenticeships. Nine long years of Howard government failure has created a skills crisis that is hurting Australian businesses and families. The Howard government has dropped the ball on training, and this yearâs federal budget clearly showed it has no idea how to pick it up again. Instead the Howard governmentâs response to the skills crisis was a quick fix, short-sighted approach. The only new skills initiative in this yearâs budget is an increase in skilled migration, with an extra 200,000 skilled migrants instead of focusing on training Australian kids first. This government has created not only a nation of unskilled workers but a nation living on the margins, struggling to make ends meet.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">A study carried out by the St Vincent de Paul Society has exposed the reality of John Howardâs Australiaâor perhaps to be more precise I should say âAustraliasâ. We have become a more unequal society under this government, a chasm that will widen after the government implements its new tax cuts. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer continuously boast about the fact that their government has presided over the strongest growth in private incomes and that they have created the miracle economy. The Howard government has been trying to brand itself as a great friend of the average Australian worker. This is about as believable as saying that Tony Abbott is the best friend of Medicare or even that Brutus was the best friend that Caesar ever had. The claim that the Howard government is a friend of the Australian worker is a myth. The Howard government showed in this yearâs federal budget that it was no friend of the ordinary working family and especially of those low-income families struggling to move from welfare to work.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Over the last few weeks, the Howard government has laid claim to creating a more equal Australia. However, nothing could be further from the truth. The Howard government has cited NATSEM figures showing a 163 per cent increase in private incomes for the bottom 10 per cent of households over the eight years to 2002-03 compared to 38 per cent for the top 10 per cent. Suddenly, after years of denigrating NATSEM, the Prime Minister is out there discovering the âgoodâ Ann Harding. However, the St Vincent de Paul report <inline font-style="italic">The reality of income inequality in Australia</inline> highlights the fact that the actual increase for the bottom group was $26 a week, from $16 to $42, compared to $762 a week, from $1,989 to $2,751, for the top group. I can imagine speaking to a teacher, cleaner or child-care worker in my electorate and telling him or her that if they receive an income rise from $10 to $50â500 per centâit is better than a CEO income rise from $1 million to $1.5 million. It really does not add up.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">After nine years of unbroken economic growth, far from making the lives of average Australian families more comfortable, the Prime Minister has plunged 30 per cent of households into poverty, and middle-income families are relying more and more on debt to keep their heads above water. In the electorate of Ballarat, over 14,000 people, including over 4,000 children, are living in poverty according to Commonwealth census figures that show huge wealth disparities across Australia. The research also showed that rural Australia has much higher rates of poverty than cities, with almost 12 per cent of rural people living in poverty compared with 7.6 per cent in inner suburbs.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is widely acknowledged that work is the best way to get people out of the cycle of poverty and to re-engage them with the mainstream community. We know that many of the people on Centrelink payments such as the disability support pension and single parenting payments require additional training to move into the work force. A government serious about helping struggling families would not be spending three times more on compliance in this budget than they are on training measures. A real friend would give such people a hand up, but the Howard government has gone for the handball, shifting them from one welfare payment to another that is punitive and provides a lower level of financial assistance.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is also a package that provides more cuts than carrots. While the $1.5 billion invested in child care, wage subsidies and employment assistance for people with disabilities is welcome, that is almost totally offset by the $1.4 billion of cuts to payments and employment assistance. We cannot actually get the figures on this because, despite the fact that the government has put its measures in the budget and it has calculated those measures in the budget, it is refusing to provide that information to one of the Senate estimates committees that has been holding hearings this week. I ask the government what it has got to hide.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Five hundred million dollars has been cut from Job Network employment assistance, which means that the level of help, training and work experience available to people who need to skill up to get back to work will be inadequate. The Australian Council of Social Service already considers the current level of assistance for training and other assistance for most job seekers as inadequate. Cuts to employment services will affect the most disadvantaged Australians, who have low levels of skills and education and who have little more than $200 a week to live on.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is not only the lack of adequate skills training but also the lack of incentives to move from welfare to work that is such a shame in this budget. Raising the lowest marginal tax rate from 17 to 15 per cent will not be enough to move people off welfare and out of poverty into work. In fact, the Howard governmentâs Welfare to Work scheme actually decreases incentives for welfare recipients to engage in paid work. This is despite yet another OECD report highlighting the fact that stronger incentives are needed to move people from welfare to work.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This shines a light on the true motives of the Howard governmentâs move to force single parents from the single-parenting payment to enhanced newstart or the new dole, which will begin to be withdrawn earlier and at a higher rate than existing payments. Parents who move from the lower newstart payment will face higher effective marginal tax rates than they otherwise would have on the pension income test. That means that, under the new scheme, welfare recipients keep less private income earned than they would have under the existing system, robbing them of the incentive to work and the opportunity to become more independent of welfare payments. Again, as with tax reform, the opportunity for welfare reform has been squandered in this budget, as has the opportunity to assist low-income families into meaningful work.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Nothing shines a light more clearly on the true colours of the Howard government than the tax cuts contained in the budget. The tax cuts were for the top end of town, not for the nurses, policemen, teachers and tradespeople of Australia. The budget exposes the masquerade that the Howard government is the friend of ordinary Australian families. It openly celebrates the growing divide in household incomes in our communities. After becoming Australiaâs highest-taxing government, the Howard government has decided to provide $22 billion in tax relief, but it is unfairly skewed towards the top end of town and it is still the little people who are going to be carrying the burden.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This is a budget for the Liberal Party heartland, not a budget for the ordinary men and women of Australia. The Treasurer has been unable, in either his commentary in the media or the consideration in detail on those bills, to give any reason for not supporting Laborâs fairer tax package. He has never substantially addressed the amendments moved by Labor, preferring to hide behind a procedural debate rather than account for why he has skewed the tax cuts in this way. The reality is that, while the government knows that it needs to keep middle-income earners happy, two years before the election it is not that worried about wearing some flak over providing a small amount of tax relief to middle-income families while also providing substantially larger tax cuts to Liberal Party interest groups.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">At the same time as providing tax cuts skewed to families on higher incomes, the âworkerâs friendâ has been busy eroding the social wage. What Howard has given in cash advances to low- and middle-income families he has taken back in increased medical costs. We have seen the Medicare safety net backflipâthe safety net that was supposed to fix up the mess that the Prime Minister had made of Medicare. He has gone back on that as well. Private health insurance premiums have been increasing. There is also the GST, which was the pride of the last two elections. There are also issues with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and petrol prices are increasing. Not satisfied with this, the Prime Minister wants to further erode working conditions for Australian families through an extreme industrial relations agenda.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">History is a great teacher. The Prime Ministerâs record of opposing every minimum wage case since coming to office tells us how much the Prime Ministerâs friendship means to low-income families. In 1997 the government sought a wage increase that was $2 a week less than that awarded by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. In 1998, it was $6 less; in 1999, $4 less; in 2000, $7 less; in 2001, $3 less; in 2002, $8 less; in 2003, $5 less; and in 2004 it was $9 lessâtotalling $44 a week, or $2,300 a year, less if the governmentâs view had prevailed. Are these the actions of a friend? I do not think so.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Under the governmentâs new reforms, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, the independent umpire, will be stripped of its powers in setting the minimum wage and award wages. The Howard government has reduced the role of the AIRC to that of merely a spectator of industrial relations. Can you imagine the umpire Dickie Bird being told that he had to sit in the stands and let the Australian and English cricket teams sort things out? That is basically what the Prime Minister has done in terms of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Prime Minister stood up in parliament yesterday and defended the independent umpire of the politiciansâ wages, the Remuneration Tribunal. The federal government wants to abolish the independent umpire for low-wage workers, and it is currently arguing against a $26.60 a week minimum wage rise in front of that umpire, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Why does the Howard government hate the independent umpire for minimum wage workers, the Industrial Relations Commission, but seem to think that an independent umpire is perfectly okay for politicians? These are double standards. Patrick Gourley summed this up well in yesterdayâs <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline>:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Letâs be clear: the Government has knackered the Industrial Relations Commission because it has, since 1996, given those on a minimum wage $44 a week more than the Government wanted. The entire rationale for the FPC, about which the Government will not be frank, is to dampen the rates of increase in minimum wages so that pay for 1.5 million people dependent upon awards will increase at a slower rate than those on higher wages.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">It is not just the Australian Industrial Relations Commission that the Howard government is setting about dismantling with the awards system reforms. The number of allowable matters is being reduced from 20 to 16. Gone will be shift penalties, annual leave, long service leave, bereavement leave and jury leave, just to mention a few. While the impact of the Howard governmentâs reforms are unlikely to be felt by the Australian worker in the short term, there is no doubt that over time the Australian Fair Pay Commission will leave workers worse off, a fact confirmed by the Prime Ministerâs refusal to say otherwiseâhis absolute inability to give a guarantee that no Australian worker will be worse off under these changes.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I want to talk briefly about a case example from my electorate and about some of the things that can happen. In my electorate, Telstra Country Wide has a large call centre which is fantastic. It provides great employment for people in my district. However, Telstra has contracted out the employment for that call centre to a labour hire company. All of the workers under that labour hire company are not employed by Telstra and they are not subject to the EBA conditions to which other Telstra workers are subject.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Quite recently Telstra Country Wide wanted to change the shifts at the call centre. Without any consultation with the work force, which is what the EBA for Telstra workers required, Telstra decided to extend and change a shift, which would have required people who are now working a fairly reasonable amount of time during the day to work fairly late into the night. A large number of women in this industry work part time while their children are at school. They are supplementing the family income. The changes that were going to be forced on them by the labour hire company at Telstraâs behest meant that the workplace was no longer going to be family friendly. If this government thinks that implementing those sorts of changesâforcing people onto individual contracts, not allowing them to be part of enterprise-bargaining agreements and particularly agreements that cover companies such as Telstra, and allowing companies to suddenly change workersâ shifts without any consultation or without allowing them to put a case as to why it would be very difficult for that type of work force to comply with those changesâis being family friendly and being the friend of Australian families then the government is kidding itself.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The industrial relations reform agenda that the Howard government is bringing to this place is not friendly to families. If the government thinks it is, it needs to go out to Australian work forces and talk to people about their living conditions and their expectations of balancing work and family. If the government does that, it will see that its reform agenda is not family friendly.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The self-proclaimed workersâ friend has targeted low- and middle-income families as systematically and doggedly as he went after the Liberal Party leadership. It was a long-term agenda. He sees them as a group that has to be capturedâfamilies that have to be wooed and votes that have to be bought. He sees them as a commodity that is of use to him to be bought for the highest price. When we examine the Howard governmentâs record closely, we see that its claims and commitments to the Australian worker are little more than clever, deceptive marketing and spinâand it is spin that has worked: the broken promises, the Medicare safety net, interest rate rises, the never-ever GST, the unfair tax package, tax cuts for low- and middle-income families and larger tax cuts for high-income families, the erosion of the social wage and now the extreme industrial relations agenda.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This government is not a true friend to Australian families. Its friendship stems from political opportunism and self-preservation. As Australian families start to wonder why, despite the trappings of material wealth with which they have surrounded themselves, they find they have a creeping despair about their level of debt, the future of their children, whether their jobs are secure and whether they will have the resources ever to retire, perhaps it is time for them also to wonder whether the self-proclaimed workersâ friend, this wolf in sheepâs clothing, has all the time just been pulling the wool over their eyes.</para>

<para>âIt was actually $96 billion when the government came to power, but by the time I got here they had reduced that by $50 billion. When you consider the difference that made to the perspective of a small businessman, like me, who has owed money for most of his working lifeâand still doesâand who is paying interest, you appreciate what it means to have a government that was an active participant in the borrowing market.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para pgwide="yes">Think about what that $96 billion debt did to the rates around Australiaâand, I guess, beyond that, the world. When you have got a $96 billion debt, it has to be funded by interest repayments. The Treasurer has informed us that in another 12 months we will be down to a debt of around $6 billion. You have to be a borrower in the market to realise what an incredible difference that makes, not just as a borrower but as a person who continually deals with a market where interest and inflation are incredible factors. That affects people who borrow for business and people in the housing marketâanybody who owes money. That involves virtually all of us at some stage in our lives, especially when we are youngerâunless you are in an incredibly lucky position, in which case you thank your parents very much. Most of us are not in that position; most of us are borrowers. Those of us in businessânot just farming but small business all around Australiaâhave incredible reason to be wary of high interest rates.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This is the fourth or fifth budget that I have been involved in, and I am pretty proud to be part of a government that in another 12 months will reduce the debt it inherited from $96 billion to $6 billion. That is one hell of an achievement which every one of usâwhether we are borrowers like small business people or simply people who work and have a mortgageâhas to be incredibly thankful for. That can happen only because the government makes hard decisions and makes tough decisions and because it by and large makes decisions not for the moment but for the future of the country, decisions with long-term aspects to them.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is only because of that situationâbecause we do have an economy that is strong because those decisions have been madeâthat we are now able to make the decision to add another $250 million to the governmentâs $1 billion cost for the current drought. You cannot do those sorts of things when you owe $96 billion, as our predecessors very kindly left us to deal with. You simply cannot do it.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Neither can you make one of the greatest foreign policy investments that we have made. Following the tsunami disaster, we will make available over the next five years $1 billion, in probably one of the biggest foreign policy decisions this country has made. We are part of South-East Asia. We are a nation that is part of a very distinct area of the world. That investment is something that upstaged countries with far bigger economies than ours, such as the US, which contributes one-third of the worldâs gross domestic product. For us to do that shows not only how much a part of this region we are but how much we accept our responsibilities within the region in which we live. I think that is one of the best policy decisions that have been made in my lifetime. But we are only able to do it because of the state of the economy and the way in which it is being run.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">To have a $9 billion surplus says that we are running particularly well. When you measure it against the rest of the OECD, it is incredible. Most of them are running budget deficits and are certainly not in the situation that we are in. It means that the nation as a whole can start saving for the future. The only reason we are able to look after our ageing population, the only reason we are able to make forecasts about where that is going, is that we have put ourselves into that situation.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I would like to talk for a while about what has happened in my patch, the Parkes electorate in western New South Wales. I know the member for Lindsay next to me is probably thinking about Western Sydney. I too have a strong leaning towards that area, as I have driven through it for many yearsâover the Blue Mountains, down through Penrith et cetera. It is always a good place for St George to win the football. I would like to talk about the parts of the budget which are particularly relevant to my electorate of Parkes. AusLink is going to put nearly $100 million into the Newell Highway. Almost $20 million of that is going north of Parkes up to around Alectown, and $11Â½ million of that is going to be spent in the coming financial year. I am talking about an area between Parkes and Dubbo which, on a good dayâif you can put it that wayâcarries more trucks than the Pacific Highway. It is quite obviously an area that must receive that spending. The highway gets incredible haulage usage and we are doing our best to increase its capacity so that people can still use it as safely as possible.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The introduction of the rural medical infrastructure fund, a $15 million program through Regional Partnerships, means that medical centres in regional Australia that can show need can get up to $200,000 to help with outfitting. In my electorate, places like Tottenham and Tullamore could benefit from that. One would hope that if places like Cobar and Narromine, which are putting up medical centres, are unable to do it in their present circumstances the rural medical infrastructure fund would be relevant to them.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The whole of the Orana region of the west is incredibly pleased to see that provision has been made in the budget for the operation of a Medicare-licensed MRI machine for Dubbo. This means enormous things to our region. People from as far away as Bourke will not have to travel as far as Orange or Sydney to have access to an MRI machine. People all the way from Moree through to Ivanhoe and Condobolin will have access to an MRI machine in an area that is much cheaper for them to travel to. Dubbo is a natural centre for them. The Aboriginal population of western New South Wales in a lot of situations do not like travelling any further east than Dubbo. They see Dubbo as a natural hub. It does not seem to matter whether they come from Moree, Wilcannia, Walgett, Condobolin or wherever; they naturally gravitate to Dubbo. Our government has recognised this and has accepted the argument that Dubbo does need an MRI machine, from a geographical point of view and because it is a natural hub for western New South Wales.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The water-saving issues, while not specifically targeted just to our electorate, have huge ramifications. Think about the towns out there that in some cases are only a few months from having to deal with water situations they have not had to deal with before. The water infrastructure fund, with $2 billion in various sections and departments, must go a long wayâone hopes with state, local and business money going with itâtowards dealing with some of those issues. While this country can never protect itself entirely against drought, I do believe that with judicious use of that money and cooperation with state, business and local people, we will turn that $2 billion into far more money and to some extent proof ourselves against situations such as the one we are in at the moment. There is obviously the urban side of better water use, and there is money there to experiment with more efficient usage. It is a big thing for my electorate and it is a big thing for Australia.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">For those of us in agriculture, the tax cuts may not be of enormous advantage today. One does hope it will rain again and we will return to profitability.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Labor have the opportunity over the next couple of sitting weeks to pass the legislation in the Senate and make that which is inevitable come true on time on 1 July, as the Treasurer has drawn to our attention. There are many people in my electorate who will take advantage of the threshold changes in that legislation. There is almost $20 billion in savings involved for taxpayers there.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is not, as some people have pointed out incorrectly, just a $6 tax cut to low-income earners. Most people earning up to $45,000 with two children are not, as we have heard, really paying a net tax at all. In addition, what a lot of people forget is that it is not really in the interests of people who are currently on $50,000âand that is a lot of peopleâto earn any more at the moment. When these thresholds are raised, it certainly will be. Most of them will go to a 30c in the dollar tax level, and suddenly their whole attitude will change. They will have a reason to do overtime. They will have a reason to get ahead more and, obviously, they will take advantage of that, as indeed one would hope they would.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I mentioned the ability of a good, well-run economy, in the firm control of a government, to help. Having the most drought-affected electorate in Australiaâit gives me no joy to say that, but I have every reason to point out that fact, as I have done before in this placeâI am very grateful, as indeed all of us with rural electorates should be, that the government have listened. They have only been able to do that because of their good economic management: the extra $250 million that has come out has been made possible by the budget situation the Treasurer drew to our attention three weeks ago.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As well, in an area such as mine, there are towns, particularly ones like Cobar, Dubbo, Parkes and Forbes, where there are incredible skills shortages. Given that scenario, the Australian technology collegesâone of which, I am happy to say, is going into Dubboâwill allow people from all those regions to be able to make use of the enhanced youth allowance, living away from home allowance, apprentices allowance and other allowances that are all part of this budget.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is a great problem to have, if you think back to the time 10 or 15 years ago when there was no shortage of skills in country areas like mine. That was not so much because there were people there. It is simply that now a demand for them exists that did not exist before. A budget like ours underlines the fact that we have made possible the decentralisation of industries in areas like the ones I have spoken about. It is a great problem to have this need for skilled people, a need that did not exist 10 or 15 years ago.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Like a lot of others I am very critical of the way in which academia got hold of the education curriculum in New South Walesâand around Australia, but I know more about what is happening in New South Walesâand seemed to encourage people to think that if they did not go to university they were dumb. That has been recognised by this governmentâby Brendan Nelson. What we are doing about the problem of skills shortages is recognising the problem and allowing industry to say, âThis is what we need,â rather than have TAFE colleges or someone say, âThis is what is here. Get used to it.â</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Now that we are listening to industry, I believe the 300 places we can have as a maximum in Dubbo can be accessed. We can get people from places like Cobar, Forbes, Parkes, Condobolin and wherever it might beâout at Nyngan, perhapsâand they can come to Dubbo and make use of the allowances that have been enhanced, particularly the living away from home allowance. People from Broken Hill could go there, or they could go to Adelaide. But we need to train our own, and that is what our measures are designed to do, in conjunction with business. They are targeted and specific. In our region, it is obviously the heavy industrial and the heavy mechanical skills that are needed. Instead of having to go to New Zealand or elsewhere overseas to get them, one would hope that in another three or four years we will be able to get them locally. Also, to my surpriseânot having any argument with the restaurants we already have in Dubboâin that town in particular I am told that chefs are in short supply. So perhaps the catering industry may have some influence in where we go with our technology college in Dubbo.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Another thing that came through in the budget that was of particular relevance to the seat of Parkes and also to all of regional Australia was Bank@Post servicingâ266 post offices around Australia will receive Bank@Post. This gives people an opportunity to carry out financial transactions in areas where there is a lack of banking services that people can use. Over the next 18 months Bank@Post services will be introduced in 266 post offices, including those in Tullamore and Tottenham in the electorate of Parkes.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Roads to Recovery funding is once again being put out, with another $1.2 billion over the next four years; and the black spot road safety program is also being extended, with another $340 million in 2005-06 in partnership with councils. There are also projects of strategic regional importance to make our roads safer, which is certainly relevant to those who live in those areas.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Funding for two new Sustainable Regions was announced in the budget, one of which involves all of the western division of New South Wales plus the Shire of Nyngan, in conjunction with south-west Queensland. There is $21 million to be spent over the next two years. I do appreciate those people like David Boyd, Steve Radford, John Williams, Howard Laughton and Jeff Wise, who have taken on responsibility in our region for sitting on the board, helping the government and the region to work out ways we can increase employment in western New South Wales.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In closing, there is nothing so important to a country like ours, with its growth rate and its population, who are so export orientated and small business orientated, for the government, whatever it does, to be as much as possible a debt free government that does not push interest rates up, that keeps inflation down and that makes it possible for those of us involved in small business to go ahead and borrow with confidence and expand with confidence. When you couple that with an industrial relations policy that allows you to employ people with confidence, I think the country can do nothing but go ahead further. I would add that I am very proud to be part of a government that is ensuring that that happens.</para>

<para>âThere is no doubt that the political landscape and the discussion and development of public policy at the moment are regrettably littered with instances that display short-term vision when we should be displaying long-term vision; which display good politics rather than good public policy; and which display lack of balance on a whole host of levels. One example of that sort of outcome is this yearâs budget. Given the economic circumstances that Australia presently finds itself in within the global marketplace, this yearâs budget could have held so much promise. But it is an opportunity that has been squandered, for much of the reasons that I outlined from the commencement of my speech.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Regrettably, this governmentâs actions over the course of its journey have been characterised by looking at what is just around the corner rather than thinking things through in the longer term. It has been characterised by the use of devices such as wedge politics and every form of political device that you can think of, rather than actually sitting down and talking about mechanisms that could ensure we are developing good public policy. When it comes to the lack of balance, it can be either not getting the balance right between expenditure and revenue on a financial spreadsheet, which is the budget; or it can be getting the balance wrong between the way in which people with different power and circumstances can operate together within the Australian community.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The previous speaker, the honourable member for Parkes, talked about the prospects for small business. It strikes me as strange if we look at industrial relations that what we are seeing from the Howard government is progression towards a scenario that puts people into conflict. The whole basis, especially for small business, in the change of the relationships between the power of the employer and the power of the employee dictates that that is what is going to happen. We have a set of principles for industrial relations which so emasculate the protections that employees have had that it makes it very difficult for them to enter into relationships of trust, which are very important in small business, between the employer and the employee.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">A strange notion that has been rattled on about by this government over several years is that the panacea for continuing job growth is to ensure that unfair dismissal laws are struck from the law book. In fact, when you push this point and ask for any evidence that this is so, you find that there has been one study and nobody even now can suggest where the footnote comes from. One of the greatest urban myths ever is a magical figure that is from time to time plucked out of the air in the context of these types of discussions that says, âThis is what will happen.â</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I am interested when there are debates about small business. If we look through a number of the studies and reports that have been mentioned, there are two that are very important to the Australian parliament. The first is the Reid report and the second is the report of the Baird committee. I happened to be an opposition member of both those inquiries. On the first occasion some people thought that I was a strange appointment but I was put on the committee for various reasons.Â  I found that inquiry one of the most interesting inquiries that I have been involved in. It assisted me in my understanding and education of the problems that surround small businesses throughout Australia.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">If you look through the submissions and the body of evidence, you will see that unfair dismissals and unfair dismissals laws are a very low order problem when presented by small business. Small business will always be concerned about issues that surround fair balanceâtheir ability to negotiate themselves, whether it be small business against big business, retail small business people against landlords in large shopping plazas, small business people that find themselves in difficult situations because of the imbalance of power by those that hold the licences for franchises; franchisees against the franchisor.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Australian parliament has progressively tried to address these types of issues through amendments to the Trade Practices Act. That culminated early in this parliament following the election. We had the ludicrous situation whereby in amendments to the Trade Practices Act the Howard government recognised that one of the advantages that small business could have was if they were allowed to go forward under the Trade Practices Act and use collective action. Ah ha! The light switch is on and there is an indication of an understanding from the government that, in situations where there is an imbalance of power, if we are to assist those in a weaker position and if they are encouraged and allowed to take collective action that is something positive for them in advancing their cause.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">When the legislation was reintroduced, there was one difference between the piece of legislation presented in this parliament and that which was presented in the last parliament before the election. What was that? In the particular amendment that talked about collective action there was one group of organisations that was unable to be involved in actions taken under the proposed amendments to the Trade Practices Actâand they were organisations registered under industrial relations law: trade unions and organised labour. Why did the government have to pursue its ideological hatred for organised labour in that manner? There were examples going on at the time the parliament was discussing this amendment to the Trade Practices Act which showed that, through the cooperation of organised labour with employer groups or industry groups, action could go forward. But, in that first blush of this parliament, we saw the government give an indication of its ideological bent against organised labour in the emergence of that piece of legislation.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We now have the principles set down for the proposed changes to industrial relations. All I can say is that they are simply based on winding the clock right backânot to last century, not to the 19th century but right back to the time of the Industrial Revolution. That might be overly dramatic, but that is a way in which you can look at the principles. You have to ask: is that really the intention? It is simply wrong to suggest that, even over the length of time that the Prime Minister has been a member of this parliament, organised labour has not changedâas all other areas of society have changedâand that the way we do industrial relations has not changed. It would be a different matter if in fact nothing had happened and it was all based on conservative action and the protection of the past. But that is a nonsense. There have been changes in the way in which production in workshops et cetera is carried out. There have been changes in managerial practices and administration. There have been changes in the relationships between employers and employees. In an overwhelming majority of cases these have been positive changes for all.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Last night in a contribution I reminded the House that in the Hawke-Keating years, especially in the early years under Prime Minister Hawke, the great revolution that occurred in the restructuring of the Australian economyâsomething that from time to time the Howard-Costello government wants to completely ignoreâwas only achieved because there was consensual agreement of a tripartite fashion between employers, employees and the government to move things forward. There was the give and take and the balance that I have talked about. To throw that away simply because people have a blinkered view of the way in which the world works is wrong. If there are excesses by any section of the community, we should deal with them. But, please, do not brandâas I believe the government isâthe majority on the basis of the actions of a minority. It does not make sense for me to come in here with a few horrid examples of the behaviour of employers and suggest that that is the way all employers act. If I illustrate the actions of some employers over which employees obviously need protection, I do it on the basis that it should be sensible legislation that enables appropriate protection in those cases. The principles set out in the industrial relations vision that the Howard government has just too dramatically change that balance.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">To suggest otherwise is to not really look at the way in which this has been put to the Australian community. There is a need to have that underpinningâan underpinning that has been very important for the way in which Australia has moved forward and for the way in which Australia has been able to be a cohesive society. Let us not just say, âItâll make us more competitive,â and assume that in some way the industrial relations flick of the switch backwards is going to make us more competitive. Our competitiveness, as we know through the changes over the last 20 or 30 years, is more complex than that. Let us do it in a balanced way. Let us recognise that we will not continue to go forward if we do not have the necessary investment in physical infrastructureâbelatedly acknowledged by the release of the report into the infrastructure requirements for Australiaâs export efforts today by the governmentâand if we do not invest in the skills of our people through appropriate training and understand the way that fits into our economy. If we do not do that, we will get swamped by our competitors. Again, it is about balance.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Look at the way this government is developing its trading relationships. It has decided that the way that it will do this is by negotiating free trade agreements with individual countries. It is a much different approach to the multilateral approach of Labor in government and the approach which the opposition continues to support. We see a greater advantage in concentrating our efforts on a multilateral basis, looking at blocks of countries and looking at ways in which we can cooperate at a regional level. If we think it is going to be simple negotiating a China-Australia free trade agreement with China, I think we are kidding ourselves. There is a lot of nonsense going on now in the assessment of what has happened since the start of the year when the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement came into force. There is a body of evidence that suggests that, at this stage, overwhelmingly the advantage has been to American interests over Australian interests. One would hope that that is not to continue, but that was the warning that many people gave in the debate about that free trade agreement. Once again, it is trying to get the processes right. When we are talking about pieces of public policy believed to be for the long term, we need to get the balance right to go forward.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Look at the differences between the opposition and the government about tax cuts. Simply, what the opposition is putting forward is that the tax cuts be distributed more equitably. If you look at the comparison in a graphical manner, the tax cuts that are given under Labor have a much flatter gradient. We have tried to ensure that larger cuts at the bottom end of income levels are offset by making smaller tax cuts to the higher level. There is one element that the government has been strangely silent on when we have debates about tax levels at the federal level. The debate always concentrates now on income tax. It is as if that great phenomena, the goods and services tax, never happened. What we really should be doing when comparing tax levels at different income levels is layering the effect of a flat taxâthe GSTâbecause, regrettably, on the basis of the very sparse study that has been made of this phenomena, the impact of the GST is greater for those on lower wages than those on higher incomes.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Supposedly the GST was the âgreat revolutionâ, the âgreat reform of our tax systemâ. Let us not forget that. We have this hokey-pokey about it being a state tax: âThat doesnât have to be in our books, because that goes straight to the states.â Let us compare apples with apples. At the start of the Howard government, it was pure income tax. Since then, the GST has been introduced. So, if we are going to make the right comparisons, we should be looking at the combined impact of both those taxes. As I said, I hope that at some stage we will be able to look at a number of the questions that confront this parliament in terms of its long-term impact, in terms of what is good public policy as opposed to good politics and in terms of a more balanced approach.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I will give one further example, because it was something that struck me. When we looked at the budget this year and were told how much money was available to be distributed, the squandered opportunities were clearâopportunities like reinstating the Commonwealth dental health program. I will continue to challenge this government to have a direct involvement in the provision of public dental health. It is allowable under the Constitution. In the late forties, I think it was, there was a constitutional amendment that allowed it, and the Constitution specifically mentions it.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">That is not the only reason I will state; the other reason is a point I will continue to return to. I have before me a national dental update from May 2005 from the Australian Dental Association which indicates that indirect expenditure by the Commonwealth government, through the 30 per cent rebate for private health insurance, accounted for 6.81 per cent of total dental expenditure in the year 2002-03. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI am delighted to rise in the cognate debate on the <inline ref="R2335">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2005-2006</inline>, because I am a proud member of a government that has done more for the Australian people in the last nine years than the previous Labor government did in 13 years. How do I know that? I know that because wages under this government, in real terms, have grown by 14.7 per cent, but under Labor in 13 years they grew by only 2.1 per cent. So who has done more for the Australian taxpayers? The Howard government, because it is delivering in so many respects.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">You only have to look at these milestones: the lowest unemployment level in nearly 30 years; record low interest rates on home loans; low inflation; and high investment. This country is booming, but countries do not boom by themselvesâjust look at New Zealand. Today New Zealand announced that it is concerned about its growth and the downgrades in the forecasts. Yet Australia is booming, because it is being managed well by a strong and capable government led by Prime Minister John Howard and a good team in the Treasurer and the executive. I will also add that members of the government make a solid contribution. I often look across the chamber and wonder to myself how long the Labor Party, as the commentators say, can continue to thrive on dead wood. However, I should not really go into that.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This budget was a post-election budget, but what did it do? It gave tax cuts at both ends of the spectrum: it gave tax cuts to compensate for bracket creep in the higher brackets, and it gave tax cuts at the lower end of the spectrum. When I was first elected as the member for Canning, I said I would make it my business to make sure that the so-called working poor got to keep more of their money. Here is a genuine, gilt-edged case of those who are working being able to keep more of their money.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This is important to those who work at both ends of the spectrum but, because of the relativity of their wages, it is particularly important to those at the lower end. If they get to keep more of the money that they earn, the working poor, as they are called, are better off and as a result their families are better off. That is why, combined with low unemployment so that more people have a job and with low interest rates and low taxation, Australia has never been better off since the glory days of the sixties.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I could go into so many aspects of this great budget which my electorate of Canning has received warmly. I know the Australian people have received it warmly. The only people who have not received it warmly are those opposite, and that is because the budget is too good. They cannot match it. They complain and they talk about $12 tax cuts, yet Mr Beazley knows that when he was in the previous government, led by his great mentor Mr Keating, they promised things such as tax cuts in law which were never delivered. So the Australian people just do not trust them.</para>

<para>âThey just do not trust the Labor Party on economic issues. It was very clear in my electorate as I went around doorknocking before the last election that people were very concerned about what would happen should Labor ever regain the Treasury bench in this country because they know that Labor do not keep their word. Not only do we keep our word but we actually build on it as a government. Clearly, we are a government to be trusted, and that is why the people endorsed us in droves. Dare I say it about myself and others of us whom we may wish to mention, our margins went from very low margins to much greater margins because the people believed that we were in a government that would do more for them.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para pgwide="yes">One of the aspects of the budget which was heartening to see was the fact that AusLink was again in the forward estimates. The funding will now flow to the states, although only if they sign the bilateral agreement on the construction code and the road funding code. This code, as we know, has currently been taken up by Victoria. South Australia is in the loop, and I am told that Mr Beattie and Mr Carr are heading that way. In Western Australia I think we are nearly there, because they only have until the end of the month to do it. Dr Gallop has been a bit hairy chested since he won the election in February and he thinks that he can take until the last moment, but I have inside information that they are about to sign. It is cute, really, isnât it, because they are about to sign the code which, again, takes contracts on these roads in the AusLink program out of the hands of the union thugs and places them back in the hands of productive small businesses, contractors who want to get on and employ people and local people who want work. So, at the end of the day, Western Australia will sign before the end of the month.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In a very surprising development, I have been able to glean something from the Western Australian state government budget papers about one of the main projects that I have been pushing for ever since I have been the member for Canning, the Mandurah bypass. This is the extension of the Kwinana Freeway and the building of the Mandurah bypass, essential infrastructureâand there is much talk about infrastructureâfor the south-west and for the Peel region.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In the lead-up to the last election the state government were continually asking the federal government to cofund this. âWe want 50 per cent,â they kept saying. They originally asked for $150 million, and that was committed through AusLink. The then minister for roads, Senator Ian Campbell, was happy to announce that in the Peel region in Mandurah. With much fanfare, my opposition opponents on a number of occasions turned up with the then transport shadow spokesman, Mr Martin Fergusonânot Mr Laurie Fergusonâ</para>

<para>âI refer to the member for Batman, not the member for Reid. My opponents announced that they would match that funding if they were elected. Then the state government got a bit cute and said, âLook, it is $170 million now, and we want an extra $20 million.â So the Prime Minister announced in Perth, with many present, that we would contribute the extra $20 million to build the Mandurah bypass. But he did put a condition on that extra $20 million, which was that construction would begin in 2006.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para pgwide="yes">He did that because, like me and the rest of the people in the region, he is suspicious about the state government not getting on with the job. We are suspicious because Alannah MacTiernan, the transport minister in Western Australia, is building a railway from Mandurah to Perth. We applaud her for doing that because it was an initiative of the coalition under the previous Court government. However, she changed the route and has done a number of other things that have now seen the cost of the project blow out from $900 million to $1.5 billion. What does that tell you about her ability to fund something like the Mandurah bypass? It makes it difficult, obviously, because the moneys that should be going into road infrastructure are being sucked into this rail infrastructure. I would like to put on the record that the $1.5 billion being used to build this 100 kilometres of railway is more than the cost of building the Alice Springs to Darwin railwayâI think that was $1.25 billion and this is $1.5 billion. You could call it the gold-plated Mandurah railway line. You can see that its cost is absolutely blowing out and as a result they are having trouble funding it.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">So the condition is that they start in 2006. However, I have been made aware that before signing the bilateral agreement the state government have put a few conditions on it. They want to commit to â50 per cent fundingâ as the wording when they sign the bilateral agreement. Naturally they want to do that. Why? Because if it blows out and blows out and they do not build it until something like 2012, it will cost much more. If that is the case, it will cost much more well into the future, and if the federal government agrees to pay 50 per cent it will be paying much more than it expects to. My understanding is that the project has already been assessed by main roads and, while it is over $340 million already, it is going to cost an extra $100 millionâso it will be $440 million. Of course they want to set funding at 50 per cent rather than having a set figure.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">But in the state budget the state government so far have only allocated $4 millionâ$3.3 million spent to 30 June 2004. The state government have allocated $82 million towards this project over the period from 2004-05 to 2008-09. Just understand this: if they have only allocated $82 million for that period which finishes in their forward estimates in 2009, they are only half funding it to 2009, given the fact that they have to start by 2006 to get the extra $20 million of federal government moneys. So they are not serious. If they were serious they would be allocating the whole lot. They have a sign on the end of the freeway saying construction will begin in 2007ânot 2006 by the wayâand yet they are only half funding it. Do they want to build half the freeway or the bypass or are they just putting it there so that they do not have to really start work until 2008-09, which is the time that Alannah MacTiernan has been talking about?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">What is even worse is that the second tranche of funding of $82 million, which takes the total to $167 million, does not mature until the period 2009-10 to 2010-11. So that is the real time that these people want to build this road: in 2010 or 2011. I am going to expose them through their own budget papers in the local media and the Western Australian media. I am going to show that the state government are not serious about building the Mandurah bypass, because their own figures show that they are not funding it completely until 2011.</para>

<para>âNo, because I have a lot to say. One of the other elements of the lack of state government funding on this is that the state government say that they have not had a decent response from the federal government. I have said this in this place a number of times, and I will do it againâjust very briefly, because I want to move on to something else. Minister Alannah MacTiernan says that we have been tardy in responding to her requests for funding for this essential piece of infrastructureâthe Mandurah bypass. Yet I have a letter sent from John Anderson, our Deputy Prime Minister, to Alannah MacTiernan, dated 13 February 2002, where he says in essence that the Peel deviation should be determined and there should be decent planning and infrastructure. His letter says:</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Further planning and design activities you propose for the Peel Deviation should provide necessary evidence for the Commonwealth in determining whether this project should be declared a RONI or not. In particular, detailed planning of these sorts of proposals allow the Commonwealth to prioritise projects with the largest benefit to the nation and provide an appropriate level of certainty in cost estimates for the Commonwealth to be confident of requiring funding levels.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">When he wrote that we were still on RONIs, so of course he could not respond under the Roads of National Importance program, because she did not reply until 29 June 2003, some 16 months later. So who is tardy in responding? A letter to me from John Anderson 16 months later says:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I note your desire for funding for the Peel Deviation West Australian freeway. The West Australian freeway is not a Road of National Importance now because obviously that program has finished and it is a state responsibility. To date, the Western Australian government has not responded to my previous requests for a detailed project proposal and has not allocated any funds for this project.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I rest my case. They have not even done the preliminary work. They took 16 months to respond. Is it any wonder that the project changed from Roads of National Importance to AusLink?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The state government have had record income through taxes and royalties. Their budget a few weeks ago showed how well-off they are. Yet the people of Western Australia cannot get this decent piece of infrastructure. As we know, if you can take their word for it, their half share is $170 million, yet their estimated bonus GST payment this year was over $200 million. They can get on and build it, and that is what I urge them to do.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Taxation is always an important issue to do with budgets, collecting moneys et cetera, but I am always very concerned when the tax office oversteps the mark, and it has overstepped the mark again. People in this House will know that I have been concerned about the way the tax office has treated people involved in schemes that it gave private and public rulings for. We went through the mass-marketed schemes exercise, and there are still people bleeding from that. They lost their houses, their families broke up and some even committed suicide. We have just recently gone through the latest exerciseâwhere the tax office has retrospectively applied rulings to employee benefits arrangements. It is the same storyâpeopleâs lives have been destroyed, because they have been retrospectively visited with EBAs. Currently, the taxation office is looking at being retrospective over a 20-year period. It is looking at service trusts established in 1983. There are companies that established service trusts in 1983 that are now under scrutiny from the tax office.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Last week, Mr Mark Konza, the Deputy Commissioner, Small Business, at the ATO, and Mr Michael DâAscenzo, the Second Commissioner of Taxation and Chief Tax Counsel, visited us. When we asked these two gentlemen how they could start visiting operations such as service trusts that have been established for more than 20 years, they said, âLook, some of them are out of hand.â If that is true, we do not want anyone to be rorting, but at the end of the day there is no ruling. They admitted themselves that the Tax Commissioner has only mentioned this in a speech and an article. There have been no rulings and no appropriate guidelines put out. They even admit that it is a grey area and there are no parameters or benchmarks that people can base their assessments on. There was a ruling some time ago called the Phillips ruling which somewhat addressed this. Most people operating in this area believe that they have a 50 per cent deduction and that there is a six per cent to eight per cent mark-up per annum on these service trusts. We know that they are usually used by tax accountants and professionals such as lawyers, doctors et cetera, where they run their office at arms-length.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is absolutely indecent behaviour by the tax office to visit people in a retrospective manner. So when we asked these two gentlemen last week: âWhen are you going to start your retrospectivity? When does the clock start ticking?ââunder the new guidelines for self-assessment you are not meant to go back more than four yearsâthey could not say whether it was from Mr Carmodyâs speech or whether it was from his article, which was apparently only a one-paragraph article, or whether it was meant for some time in the future. How do these people know how to put their affairs in order? It should be prospective, not retrospective. To that end, recommendation 6 of the tax office, in the ROSA report, states:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Where the tax office changes a public interpretation or long standing practice to the detriment of taxpayers, that change should become effective prospectively and, where necessary, from a future date that allows affected taxpayers reasonable time to become aware of, and act upon, that new interpretation.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The ROSA case is currently taken as future direction. Yet one of the reasons why we have had trouble trying to convince the succession of ministers of this disgraceful behaviour by the tax office is that in some respects they seem to be prisoners of the tax office. I will not name him, but one of the current ministerâs staffers was a tax partner in KPMG; his position was national tax director of KPMG. In 1997 KPMG issued tax advice for two mass market arrangements, namely, Freedom Express and Interest Recount, and he was their head man. So why would he then be giving contrary advice to the minister if he has had that position?</para>

<para>âOn retrospectivity the Assistant Treasurer is mute. In fact, it is very hard to get him to address it. Originally he showed good signs in comparison with the previous minister, but currently he has again decided to be manacled by the tax office. The situation is very dangerous when you are taking advice from somebody who seems to be compromised. At the end of the day, I think the tax office is getting above its station in life when it decides to get involved in these sorts of rulings that affect so many peopleâs lives. In the case of this service trust there are 70,000 taxpayers involved. Seventy-thousand Australians thought they were doing the right thing, some of them for 20 years. Now they are going to be visited by the tax office, who do not even know what the parameters are. So we should be bringing these issues back into the House to be dealt with quite properly as legislation. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âPerhaps the most telling contrast about the realities of this budget was presented in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of 11 May when Matt Wade wrote an article with the headline âTheyâll be feasting at the top end of townâ. Alongside the article was a photograph of a hysterically laughing Peter Costello, obviously pleased with the inequitable taxâ</para>

<para>âThe photograph was of a highly amused Treasurer, hysterically laughing at the realities of the inequities in this budget, a Treasurer who, in his past life, had been a very important activist in reducing the ability of workers to negotiate collectively against employers. The same newspaper contained an article in which the contrasting view was presented, entitiled âPainting the town red is out for full-time mumâ. That was about a woman with six children who had been unable to obtain child support payments from her husband and who was living on $460 a week. The article was looking at the situation she would be in when her youngest child turned six years of age. That is the contrasting situation in the budget. We are all awareâit does not need regurgitating by each and every member hereâthat Labor has put up an alternative to the governmentâs proposal that the Prime Minister and members of this parliament should receive tax cuts of $65 a week. Under Laborâs alternative, large numbers of Australians would receive $12 a week rather than $6 a week. For some people that kind of figureâwhich seems paltry to members in this House, who are getting the $65 reductionâis indeed very important.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para pgwide="yes">We are all aware that under the governmentâs proposed package 45 per cent of the value of tax cuts go to the top 10 per cent of taxpayers while the remaining 90 per cent of taxpayers share the other 55 per cent of tax cuts. It is a question of tax cuts, a more equitable proposal by Labor so that the vast majority of Australians get a better deal and we do not have this elitist proposal by the government. I hate to offend those on the other side by quoting the ACTU, but they said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">As a result of the last two Budgets high income earners stand to gain more than $130 a week in tax and superannuation relief while more than 75% of working peopleâeveryone earning less than $58,000 a yearâgets between zero and $6 a week.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">They also talked about the way in which these families have been hit by higher interest rates under the current governmentâthere has been a major effort by them to increase interest rates since the electionâhigher petrol prices, and increased medical and education costs. And of course we know of the particular changes on pharmaceuticals and Medicare that have occurred since the election.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">ACOSS, the Australian Council of Social Service, made the point that 80,000 sole parents with children aged six to 16 who apply for parenting pensions will be put on Newstart payments and lose $20 a week over the next three years and that 70,000 people with disabilities will be deemed ineligible for DSP and lose $40 a week in payments. These people are already struggling on payments of just $200 to $240 a week, and they will receive even lower payments under the proposals of the peopleâs friend, John Howard. We should remember that 88 per cent of sole parent families are headed by women and 92 per cent of parenting payment single recipients are women.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">That is the reality out there. It is not the conventional picture of the stereotypical analysis by people in backyards across Australia that it is all 15-year-old or 18-year-old teenagers who are having children. The reality is that single parents in Australia, predominantly women, are essentially in their 30s and 40s. That is borne out by the federal governmentâs own statistics. That is the reality out there: people on very low incomes trying to survive and look after their children. And now we are going to have a situation where they are essentially forced to go out to work as soon as their children turn six. We know there are going to be very unfortunate social consequences of this policy, because many of those people are concentrated in suburbs of very dense housing, transient population areas and housing department areas where virtually everyone has the same problem and social support is minimal. We are going to have very real social problems arising from this governmentâs policy.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is very interesting to note this thrust against children and parents. One of the crises this country faces is the fertility rate. We lament the decline in the number of children in this country. We look at the overseas experience of countries like Japan and Germany which is much worse than ours. We complain about the ageing of our population. This policy is guaranteed to go further down that road. Rather than having a society which essentially encourages women to move in and out of the work forceâto not lose their employment but be able to return to their status in organisationsâand which supports them in bringing up children, these changes will worsen the situation.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In 2002, 49 per cent of children under 12 years of age, or 1Â½ million children, spent some time in child care. There is a chronic child-care shortage. The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates that 175,000 miss out on child care needed by their parents. And what we are going to have is the offer of 84,000 out of school hours places, 2,500 day-care places and 100 at-home places, which is going to continue the chronic shortage. We are going to have a situation where there is no funding for long day care places. This means that parents with young children under five years of age will be unable to return to the workplace in a practical sense. We will have a situation where nearly 160,000 sole parents are forced to work and need child care. They will be competing for a minimal number of child-care places in this country. I think the obvious outcome for this is extremely negative. The Treasurer criticised the claim that some welfare recipients were âshirkersâ. He also questioned the growth in the number of Australians on disability pensions, declaring:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Have we really had an outbreak of disability?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">In contrast, his brother Tim Costello of World Vision Australia said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I think that notion thereâs a whole big group out there who are taking taxpayers for a ride is actually profoundly untrue.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I think when you are trying and you are really giving it a go, that people assume when thereâs low unemployment that you must be a shirker, is disempowering.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Those are contrasting views on these changes. The government argues some statistics, such as unemployment rates and interest rates et cetera. But all is not merry in the kingdom. I refer to an article by Tom Bramble in issue No. 54 of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Journal of Political Economy</inline> which made a few other points about the reality in this country. He looked at part-time and casual employment. Whereas in 1984, 16 per cent of the Australian work force was casualised, today we see 27.9 per cent in casual employment and a further 28.5 per cent in part-time employment. Thirty-five per cent of new jobs are casualised. While everyone in this country is allegedly so happy, the Australian survey of social attitudes indicated with regard to working hours that two-thirds of people, who because of the power of employers have very little choice in life these days, said that they were working too many hours. In 1992, executive pay in this country was 22 times greater than average weekly earnings. A decade later, in 2002, it was 74 times greater.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In the housing market, we have a situation where, in 1996, 43 per cent of people in Australia owned their own house and 28 per cent were paying it off. Now the amount of people owning their own house has declined to 38 per cent of the population. Amongst people aged 25 to 39 years there has been a decline of 10 per cent in home ownership. In the period 1999 to 2004, total earnings in this country of $77 million have been countered by a consumption increase of $110 million. I turn to the household debt to income ratio. In 1996, it was 35 per cent; in 1990, 50 per cent; and, in 2004, 150 per cent. And I do not need to accentuate the foreign debt or the decline of Australiaâs trading situation in elaborately manufactured goods.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">An article by Kenneth Davidson in <inline font-style="italic">Dissent</inline> magazine in the summer of 2004-05 made a few points about the great contrast with regard to the export of elaborately transformed manufactures from this country. There was an expansion in their growth rate over the decade to 1996 of 18 per cent. What has the figure been since 1997? Against that 18 per cent rise, there has been a rise of 1.7 per cent. The trade deficit has markedly blown out. We have seen a situation where:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Behind the smokescreen supplied by the $8 billion budget black hole, Costello slashed $2 billion of R&amp;D, business and export development programs plus funding cuts to universities and training programs.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Talking about training, we have come to a very sad situation in this country. Todayâs figures from the NCVER on Australian apprentice and trainee statistics note that sad situation. In the 12 months ended December 2004, there were 133,000 withdrawals and cancellations compared with 139,000 completions of apprenticeships. The number of cancellations in the three months ended last December was the highest on record. Those statistics also indicate that the number of apprenticeship commencements fell from 277,000 to 263,000 over the 12 months to December 2004. So what we have in this country is a very serious problem with regard to training in the conventional trades.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I recently had the pleasure of attending Granville TAFE College in my electorate, the second oldest in the country and the second largest in Sydney. With the support of the CFMEU, the support of the state government and the interest of local employers and community groups, people were trying against all obstaclesâagainst inactivity and lack of interest by this governmentâto sponsor young people and get them involved in conventional apprenticeship areas. But it is going to be to little avail because of the stark lack of interest by this government in training. I have to admit: the government do have a solution. Since they have been in government, they have brought in over 400,000 people under the skilled migration category. They have brought 400,000 people into this country to fill the skill absences which they have created. That seems to be the limit of their thinking on this matter.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">What do we see with the migration intake? When Labor went out of government the current Prime Minister was out there with subliminal messages to the electorate that Labor was a high-migration party, that Labor was dictated by ethnic vote buying, that this is what dictated immigration in this country. A decade later, the man who subscribed to views of a low-migration future for this country will have an intake next year of 137,000. If you look at the figures, you will see that the total of 137,000 is markedly higher than in most of the Labor Keating-Hawke years.</para>

<para>âI think that is correct. What has been the reality inside that intake? Next we have seen a decline in the refugee humanitarian intake in this country. When the Prime Minister came to power, this countryâs concern, involvement and interest in the world was such that 16 per cent of the intake was refugee humanitarians. In the coming year it will, sadly, decline to nine per cent. At the same time family migration has been starkly slashed back. In the current intake, out of that 137,000 next year, 97,000 will be part of the skills intake. If you are an employer, are you going to bother? Are you going to be interested in training anyone when you could just ring up the federal government minister a few days after you have been to the party fundraising function and say: âItâs dreadful in Australia. We canât get employees. Itâs really dreadful out there. Itâs so hard. When you advertise in the papers thereâs no interest. No-oneâs skilled enough. Please, please help us.â The government is so uninterested in our skills future that it thinks it can just turn on the tap. No employer is going to do any training under this government, because it is so inclined to see the short-term solution of migration.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para pgwide="yes">If we had any hope that it was going to improve under the Howard government, the last budget was very interesting. The initiatives are very minimal. I will develop this more in the exploration of the budget in detail. Most of the expenditure in this budget in the immigration portfolio is for various aspects of the skills intake, which is understandable. But this government has come up with a new and brilliant solution to how we are going to solve skills shortages in this country. It has come up with a new initiative. We are going to import not only labour but also people to do apprenticeships. This is the giant idea that has come out of this government. It will solve our problems by bringing in people to do apprenticeships here. We cannot encourage Australians to do it. We cannot give incentives to employers to make sure they do it. We cannot give benefits to people to finish apprentices. So now we are going to Timisoara in Romania and Timbuktu in north-west Africa to look around for people to come and fill these skills shortages in this country. What future does that indicate for young people in this country? That the government is so uninterested that it sees the future as bringing apprenticeships into the country.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">They have talked about other initiatives such as these new colleges, which will not produce anyone with a trades degree until 2010. This government say: âThings are so desperate that we have to bring in an extra 20,000 people in the skilled intake next year. Itâs so desperate this momentânot next week, not in two yearsâthat that we have got to increase the intake at this level now.â They are bringing in a scheme that is going to bring in more apprenticeships in 2010. If you want any reason why this is happening in this country, look to the sad state of payments to apprentices. It is bad enough that the media promote competition with regard to the lifestyles of other people. It is bad enough that some areas of this employment have been decried and turned down for years by public debate. It is worsened by the amount of money that is paid to these people.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is a concern to people that this is the governmentâs response. There has been very little research done. We know that one of the initiatives of the government when it first came in was to close down the independent research body which looked at settlement in this country. We have got no real evidence of the connection between the trades, occupations and supposed proficiencies of the people we import and where they actually end up in the labour force. We in Australia are asked to have faith in this budget, to have faith that the skills shortage of this country are going to be solved by a proposal which will bring out tradesmen in another five years time. We are asked to say that this government is going to solve the problem by bringing in people as skilled migrants, with great uncertainty as to whether they will actually work in that occupation. We face the reality that migration processing in these areas takes a year or so on average. So the chronic, immediate crisis which has to be solved tomorrow afternoon is certainly not going to be solved by this initiative.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">With regard to immigration, I will also briefly talk about the refugee and humanitarian intake. Last year there was great fanfare about an increase in the money spent on the settlement of immigrants under the refugee and humanitarian intake. In reality, if you look at the figures, you see that per capita there was no increase. The only reason that there was a rise was that there was an increase in the intake from 12,000 to 13,000. This coming year we will see a focus on Africa in regard to our refugee and humanitarian intake, a government initiative that I support totally and absolutely. However, these people will cost the Australian taxpayers more money per capita because many of them have had very disrupted education, if any education. They have lived in dire circumstances in rural areas, and they have very major family dislocations. If you treat them with the same level of assistance per capita as before, it will not go very far.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In conclusion, there is an initiative by the opposition which encompasses a far more equitable tax option for the Australian people. It is a thrust towards doing something about the collapse of infrastructure in this country. There are measures that encourage people back into the work force. There is no stick; there is no persecution. There are no punitive measures to force them back but, rather, there are measures that give them incentives to empower themselves to become part of the work force. I commend Laborâs amendment.</para>

<para>âI rise in support of the <inline ref="R2335">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2005-2006</inline> and related bills, and I congratulate the Treasurer on presenting his 10th budget and his eighth budget surplus, which for the 2005-06 year provides an underlying cash surplus of some $8.9 billion. Developing budget surpluses and paying back debt have helped to lower interest rates and to lower inflation. Economic reforms have made our tax system and our economy more competitive and have created some 1.6 million new jobs since 1996, bringing unemployment down to its lowest level in 28 years. This outcome has been achieved because of this governmentâs outstanding economic management and policy decisions that affect the lives of all Australians.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The budget builds on previous budgets which sought to give particular support and assistance to families and small business in order to create greater productivity. It builds on the governmentâs record of being able to pay off Laborâs massive $96 billion debt, a debt that was costing the budget some $9 billion in interest payments.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Australians deserve the lowest possible tax, consistent with responsible budget management. This budget rewards hard work by delivering some $21.7 billion in personal income tax relief over four years, on top of the $14.7 billion delivered in last yearâs budget. These tax cuts will increase the reward from work force participation for all Australian taxpayers, assist low-income earners, boost disposable income and improve the competitiveness of our personal income tax system in comparison with those of other developed nations.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">From 1 July this year, the 17 per cent marginal tax rate will be cut to 15 per cent. The 42 per cent tax threshold will increase from $58,000 to $63,000 on 1 July 2005, and to $70,000 on 1 July 2006. The 47 per cent threshold will increase from $70,000 to $95,000, and on 1 July 2006 it will increase again to $125,000. These changes will ensure that more than 80 per cent of taxpayers will face a top marginal rate of 30 per cent or less over the next four years, and from 1 July 2006 the top marginal rate will apply to only three per cent of all taxpayers.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Superannuation savings will also be given a significant boost with the abolition of the surcharge on superannuation contributions and relevant termination payments made or received from 1 July 2005. This measure will save taxpayers $2Â½ billion over the next four years and, together with the co-contribution scheme announced in the 2004-05 budget, demonstrates this governmentâs commitment to encouraging voluntary savings and boosting retirement incomes.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There are also additional benefits for seniors. Those who are eligible for the senior Australian tax offset will now pay no tax on their annual income up to $21,968âup from $20,500âfor singles and on a joint income of $36,494, up from $33,612, for couples with equal income. The Medicare threshold for senior Australians will also be increased to ensure that they do not pay the Medicare levy until they begin to incur an income tax liability.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">With unemployment at its lowest level in 28 years, when more Australians than ever before are participating in the work force, it is now time to spread that participation further. We want to encourage more people to join the work force. The introduction of the largest ever Welfare to Work program designed to assist moving people who are capable out of welfare and into work is a commendable initiative and will further strengthen our economy in the longer term. Although costly in the short term, this $3.6 billion package provides more incentives for people to work. These are the long and hard decisions that the government is prepared to make for the future of all Australians.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">If more people are able to move from welfare to work, this will help them with higher incomes and better participation in mainstream economic life. It will also reduce the obligation on other taxpayers, whose taxes pay for welfare support. There are many people of working age who receive income support without any obligation to look for work. I believe that those who are working deserve to know that others who are capable of work are at least looking for work in return for income support. I am sure they agree that the best form of income is from a job. We need to encourage as many people of working age as we can to join the work force.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">At a time when unemployment levels are at their lowest and in fact businesses are crying out for more workers, it is essential that we invest in higher skill levels so that employers can obtain the skilled labour they need. This is important for the business sector, as upskilling our work force will increase the abilityâ</para>

<para>âAs our economy changes, the nature of work changes, but a strong vocational and technical education system will better equip workers to upskill and adapt. This budget delivers up to 4,500 prevocational training places for people interested in a career in a traditional trade and provides some $5.8 million towards an additional 7,000 school based new apprenticeships, so more students can begin their apprenticeships while continuing their school studies. A further $12.6 million has been allocated for an extra 5,000 New Apprenticeships Access Program places that will assist job seekers who experience barriers to skilled employment to obtain and maintain a new apprenticeship.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para pgwide="yes">As also promised during the election, this budget provides $351 million over the next five years to establish 24 Australian technical colleges for 7,200 year 11 and 12 students. This will allow young Australians an opportunity to learn the best trade skills. It will enhance the prestige of technical education. I believe we should recognise and value trade training as highly as we recognise other forms of postsecondary education.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This government has demonstrated that it is serious about catering to the needs of the 70 per cent of students who do not go on to university. We currently have 394,000 new apprentices in training in this country. The vocational and technical education system has grown by 35 per cent since 1995âfrom 1.3 million students to more than 1.7 million in 2003. This represents more than one-ninth of the Australian working age population.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">At a time when we have such low unemployment and an exceptionally strong economy, we will need to meet immediate labour shortages by increasing our skilled migration intake by 20,000 places to 97,500 places in 2005-06. Business will be supporting and identifying their needs for skilled migration and identifying those who can provide it. This initiative will assist businesses in the mining and construction industry, metal trades and fabrication, earthmoving companies and abattoirs in my electorate in the south-west of Western Australia to immediately attract more workers with experience and skills to meet the growing demand for production.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In recognition of such areas of skills shortages, this government has demonstrated its support to strengthen efforts to address the current skills needs in some of our key traditional trades and will provide $106 million over four years for trade-learning scholarships in trades experiencing skills needs. This will provide a $1,000 tax-free scholarship from 1 July 2005 through the Commonwealth trade-learning scholarships and will ease the financial burden faced by new apprentices in their first years of training. This, coupled with the allocation of $120 million for new apprentices starting in specific trades experiencing skills needs to obtain tool kits to give them a financial head start in their new career, further demonstrates this governmentâs commitment to ensure a clever, skilled work force and our future prosperity. It is estimated that around 34,000 new apprentices will benefit from this tool kit provision, valued at some $800 per kit. Along with our $5 billion investment through vocational education and training agreements, these initiatives represent a comprehensive approach to meeting Australiaâs skills now and in the future.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This 10th budget has allocated record funding of an estimated $8.5 billion to Australian schools and students for the 2005-06 year, an increase of a staggering $589 million or 7.4 per cent over last year. This increase continues the trend of the past nine Howard budgets and highlights the national leadership shown by this government. This budget also commits over $635 million for school capital works, representing an increase of 29 per cent over the previous year, largely due to the roll-out of the Howard governmentâs $1 billion initiativeâInvesting in Our Schools program. A total of $163 million will be provided from the program in 2005-06 to fund state schoolsâ capital works that school communities have identified. Capital funding for Catholic schools and independent schools in 2005-06 will consist of an estimated $113 million provided through the capital grants program, plus an additional $80 million injected from the Investing in our Schools program. This is a great boost for many of our local public, Catholic and independent schools and addresses the needs that our state governments have tragically failed to address. The Howard government is strongly committed to ensuring that every child is given the chance to find and achieve their potential through choice and opportunity in education. I commend this governmentâs 2005-06 budget initiatives for schools that continue to strengthen the Australian governmentâs leadership role in schooling across Australia.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Last year the government introduced a $19 billion More Help for Families package. In continuing its strong commitment to families, this government will again increase family benefits. It is estimated that around 400,000 families will get an average boost of $24 a fortnight to their family tax benefit part A payments from 1 July 2006 as part of this budget. This boost is the result of an increase in the lower income threshold level to allow low-income families to increase their earnings without affecting family assistance payments. The threshold will be increased by $4,139 to $37,500 from 1 July 2006. It will not only put more money into the pockets of low-income families but also play a significant role in the governmentâs welfare to work policies and is a key part of a total budget package aimed at removing the barriers which are keeping welfare recipients out of the paid work force.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In recognition of the extraordinary effort and contribution carers make by providing constant and daily care for their relatives, friends and those who have disabilities or are frail aged, this government will once again provide a one-off carerâs bonus payment. A bonus of $1,000 will be provided to 90,000 current eligible recipients on the carerâs payment and a bonus of $600 will be paid to 300,000 people receiving the carerâs allowance. We value the work they do and they deserve this recognition. It will cost some $317 million in this year as a bonus is tax free and will not be treated as income when calculating the carerâs social security entitlements. This yearâs budget measures continue the Howard governmentâs strong commitment to carers and builds on last yearâs budget initiatives when carers were given more flexibility and support in their care arrangements.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Included in the budget is a commitment to Western Australiaâs transport infrastructure of over $223 million. This confirms that the Australian government has kept its election promise to contribute an extra $20 million to the Peel deviation, more commonly known as the Mandurah bypass. But the Western Australian state government must come to the party and start major construction works in 2006. I note that it has confirmed that the timetable is achievable. This government will contribute $170 million to the Peel deviation over five years, including $3 million in 2005-06 to continue preconstruction and planning. The extra $20 million has been allocated for 2007-08. When complete the 48 kilometre Peel deviation and the 23 kilometre extension of the Kwinana Freeway will provide a fast freeway link from Fremantle through to the south-west regional cities of Bunbury, Busselton, Margaret River and of course further south to Manjimup, Pemberton, Northcliffe and points south. It will provide better access for producers in the south-west to markets in the city and to export destinations. It will also provide faster access to boost tourism and allay the concerns of residents travelling to and from Perth.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Our Roads to Recovery funding program has been renewed for another four years as part of this yearâs budget with Western Australian councils receiving $45 million in the 2005-06 period and $76 million in untied local road grants. The Roads to Recovery initiative is important and has been a very successful program. The reason for its success is that it provides funding direct to councilsâmoney that they did not have before and money that is spent on worthwhile road repairs which otherwise they would not have the financial ability to do for quite some time. The budget confirms that $1.35 million will be spent on extending the Roads to Recovery program for Western Australia until 2008-09. It is a vital funding injection that the councils need. South-west shires in my electorate of Forrest will benefit from some $13.8 million in funding to address problems with local roads over the next four years. Allocations are as follows: Augusta-Margaret River will receive $1,444,000; Bridgetown-Greenbushes, $1,095,000; City of Bunbury, $1,458,000; Busselton, $2,041,000; Shire of Capel, $818,000; Collie, $865,000, Dardanup, $724,000, Donnybrook-Balingup Shire, $1,000,071; Shire of Harvey, $1,516,000; Shire of Manjimup, $2,121,000; and Nannup, $709,000.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">To ensure that we minimise dangers on our roads, a further $5 million of federal government black spot funding for the program in 2005-06 will be provided to support Western Australian shire councils and to fix approximately 54 black spot crash locations. This is a key part of the national strategy to reduce Australiaâs fatality rate by 40 per cent in 2010. In conclusion, I can reiterate this outlook from the governmentâs forecasts: solid economic growth, low unemployment and low inflation within the Reserve Bank range. A strong economic performance is no accident. It requires sound economic management and a commitment to ongoing reform. It results in business and consumers that are confident about Australiaâs future. It requires prudent policies that lock in our achievements for future generations. All indications are that there is confidence in the business community and an expectation that our economy will provide sustainable profits and employment opportunities for Australians, with an unemployment rate expected to remain around its 28-year low. I commend the appropriations bill to the House.</para>

<para>âThis budget shows the real, stark differences between the Labor Party and the Liberal Party. You occasionally hear it said that there are no differences anymore between Australiaâs major political parties, but this budget shows that there are real, stark differences. I listened to the debate in the House on the budget and the appropriation bills with some interest. The government have tried some of their favourite tactics. The government members have not defended the skewed nature of the tax cuts, instead they have tried to paint a misleading picture of the oppositionâs role. They say the Labor Party is engaging in class warfare or the politics of envy. The hypocrisy of this government never ceases to amaze me. If it were a crime, they would all be in jail. They introduce tax cuts which massively favour one segment of society over another and when the Labor Party dares to point this out government members cry âclass warfareâ.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The other tactic is to portray the Labor Party as being opposed to tax cuts or being opposed to tax cuts for high-income earners. Both of these allegations are untrue. In fact, Laborâs plan delivers tax cuts of up to $40 a week for people on upper middle incomes. If you earn $80,000 or $90,000, the tax cut under Laborâs proposal and the governmentâs are exactly the same. In fact, the tax cuts are the same under both packages up to an income of $105,000 per annum. Indeed, people who earn $125,000 per annum and above will receive a substantial tax cut under Labor, but not one which is 10 times as big as that received by people on average weekly earnings. Under the governmentâs plan an individual on $125,000 a year will receive a tax cut of $65 a week whereas someone on average weekly earnings will receive just $6. Under Laborâs proposal an individual on $125,000 would receive a tax cut of $40 a week whilst someone on average weekly earnings would receive $12 a week. In fact just one in 35 people across the country will receive substantive tax cuts under what the government proposes.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I have a particular interestâas you would understand, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkinsâin Western Sydney. In my own electorate of Prospect, 70 per cent of taxpayers would be better off under Laborâs proposed tax cuts than under the governmentâs plan. I have no hesitation in, and make no apology for, coming into this House and arguing that the governmentâs tax cuts are not in the interest of the economy or in the interest of my constituents. There is a very interesting picture in other Western Sydney electorates as well. Two electorates neighbouring mine have an even starker portrayal of how badly tailored the governmentâs tax cuts are. In the electorate of Lindsay, 75 per cent of taxpayers would be better off under Laborâs plan.</para>

<para>âIn the electorate of Greenway, 74 per cent of taxpayers are better off under Laborâs plan than under the coalitionâs. As I said, I followed this debate quite closely. I followed the debate in the House and I thought, âItâll be interesting to see these two members in particular come down and defend the skewed nature of these tax cuts.â Alas, I was disappointedâneither of them came to the House to defend their position. I must say in fairness that the member for Lindsay did speak on the budget in an adjournment debate. But she did not come to the House to defend the government in the debate on the tax bills and she certainly did not defend the skewed nature of the tax cuts in the adjournment debate. The member for Greenway did not come into the House at all to speak on the budget.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para pgwide="yes">I thought I had better double-check in case I missed something as a busy member of parliament going to meetings et cetera. Maybe I missed the members coming into the House to defend these tax cuts. So I double-checked. I found that in fact they did come down and make a speech about taxâonly it was not income tax and, in fact, it was not a federal tax; it was the New South Wales land tax. So the honourable member for Greenway and the honourable member for Lindsay came into the chamber and spoke about a tax they could do nothing about. They condemned a tax they could do nothing aboutâa tax which has absolutely no policy basis in this chamber. They made an impassioned plea for tax relief for their constituentsâthe only thing they did not do was talk about a tax cut that they could actually do something about. They did not come down and say to their government colleagues: âSorry, weâre not with you on this one. Weâre voting with the Labor Party. Weâre looking after our constituents.â We have seen a bit of that from the government in the last few days. We have seen a bit of courage from some honourable membersâthe honourable members for Kooyong, Pearce and Cook spring to mind; it is late, but nevertheless it is a bit of courageâbut we have seen none on these tax cuts.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I do not have a problem with the governmentâs political tactics. We all have to engage in a little politics from time to time. At the government tactics meeting, they said, âWe know what weâll do. The New South Wales government is about to change land tax. They have got a budget coming down next week. They are about to soften it, so why donât we put a motion on the books calling on them to do it and then we can claim a bit of credit.â I do not have a problem with that. That is a cute little political tactic. But why didnât they come into the chamber and talk about a tax cut that they could actually do something about? Why didnât they come down and say, âSeventy-four per cent of taxpayers are better off under Labor in Greenway and 75 per cent are better off under Labor in Lindsay, and we are going to vote for those tax cutsâ? Alternatively, why didnât they come down and explain why they would not? The reason they did not is because they cannot defend the indefensible. They could not come down and recognise that over 70 per cent of their residents, their taxpayers, were better off under the Labor Party. They were not going to listen to them. They both hold marginal seats and they could not bring themselves to come down and defend the indefensible.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I was drawn to an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Blacktown City Sun</inline>, which I read regularly and which covers a very small area of my constituencyâalthough it covers the area where a lot of the constituents of the honourable member for Greenway live. I was drawn to the headline âA smirk and a snubâ. I wondered who that could have been about, knowing that the Treasurer had recently been in town. The opening paragraph of the story reads as follows:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">On his first visit to Blacktown, Treasurer Peter Costello dashed the hopes of a rise in the proposed $6 tax cut for people earning $60,000. Mr Costello told the Sun last Wednesday that people would benefit in higher payments in family and disability benefits, child care and welfare to work schemes.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">So he dashed the hopes of a tax cut and then he said, again, that people would be better off, with higher payments in family and disability benefits, with child care and with welfare to work schemes. It sounds great, but it is wrong. People who are moved from a disability support pension and the sole parenting allowance onto this so-called enhanced Newstart allowance are actually $80 a fortnight worse off. There is no increase in payments. They are $80 a fortnight worse offâand the taper rates are worse.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The honourable member for Forrest talked about how wonderful the welfare to work reforms were. I attempted to ask him a question, which he declined to take, which is his right. I was going to ask him how he felt about the increase in the effective marginal tax rates for people moving from welfare to work in this budgetâthe fact that the taper rate, the withdrawal rate for the parenting allowance, is 40 per cent but on the Newstart allowance it is 60 per cent. They have increased the effective marginal tax rates and reduced the incentive for people to move from welfare into work, but not only did the honourable member for Forrest decline to take a question, it appears that his Treasurer does not understand that people are actually worse off.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The other interesting point is that the $6 a week tax cut that people in Western Sydney will receive will be more than eaten up by the next interest rate increase, which is coming as sure as night follows day. These tax cuts will have done more than a little to create the next interest rate increase. It always pays to go back and check the words of the Prime Minister. On 23 September 2004, not that long ago, the Prime Minister had this to sayâagain I quote:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">... and you can promise a few extra dollars here and there but those few extra dollars a week, extra that some people may think they will get from Labor, will be more than swallowed up by an interest rate riseâan interest rate rise of one per cent would add about $125 a month to the average mortgage bill of a family in Australia. So there is no issue that symbolises the importance of economic management more critically than that of interest rates.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Here we have the Prime Minister saying that a tax cut which creates increased interest rates is not worth it because the interest rate increase will more than swallow the tax cut. Do not take my word for it; take the word of the Prime Minister of Australia: low interest rates are more important than tax cuts. For once I find myself in agreement with this Prime Minister. It would not be so bad if the people who were going to be hit hardest by the interest rate increase actually got a decent tax cut. If the people who were struggling with mortgages in Fairfield, Blacktown and Penrith actually got a decent tax cut and then interest rates were increased, at least it would not be so bad. But what we see instead is what I call the Prime Ministerâs pincers: higher interest rates and lower tax cuts. People who are struggling with mortgages will be hit by higher interest rates and lower tax cuts.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">What is more, the governmentâs cuts will lead to higher interest rates. They will increase consumption. Because these tax cuts are so badly skewed and badly targeted, they will increase consumption in a most pernicious manner, and we will see the people hardest hit by the interest rate increase getting the lowest tax cut. That is what we will see happening with income tax, but the members on the opposite side, the vast majority of whose electors would be better off under the Labor plan than under the Liberal plan, refuse to come into the House and justify their position and refuse to vote for Laborâs amendments. They refuse to show any courage.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">But the problem is not just income tax. We have heard a lot about infrastructure in recent weeks and months. We have heard the government and many other people talk about the massive lack of investment in infrastructure that we have seen in this country in recent times. However, this budget, frankly, does nothing for infrastructure. The government have created a future fund, which could have been used for infrastructure. The capital or the interest could have been used to spend on infrastructure, either of which would have been an improvement. What we see instead is the capital locked upâI think the Treasurer calls it a locked boxâand the interest and the revenue returned to be spent on paying superannuation. We need to pay superannuation, but this is all a matter of balance. This is a matter of assessing what is more important in the national interest. The crisis facing our infrastructure, I would submit to the House, is much more important than the relatively small levels of unfunded superannuation that we see in this economy.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">But it does not finish there. What we also see is the government refusing to act on the tax disincentives for investment in infrastructure. This problem has been around for years. The Fraser government, when the current Prime Minister was Treasurer, brought in a section of the tax act which is now known as section 51AD. It was a perfectly legitimate amendment to make at the timeâin 1983. It was designed as an anti tax avoidance measure, to stop people pretending to invest in income-generating projects which were really not income-generating projects. That was a worthwhile thing to do. Since then the world has moved on. Now we see a great increase in public-private partnerships across the country. They are entered into mainly by state governments but also, partly, by the federal governmentâand also by a few of the larger local councils around the country.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Section 51AD of the tax act has been interpreted by the tax officeâI think correctlyâas saying that a private company investing in an infrastructure project is in many cases not able to claim the expenses that they put into that project for tax purposes. So you have a situation like the one involving the Eastern Distributor freeway, for example, in New South Wales. The freeway was built by the Carr Labor government several years ago, in a private-public partnership with Leighton. It is a very good road and everybody recognises that. However, the tax office ruled that for taxation purposes Leighton could not claim all the expensesâfrom concrete to reinforcement and everything elseâthat had gone into building that very expensive freeway, although Leighton would be taxed on the income from the tolls. That was a pretty extraordinary ruling. Eventually the tax office changed its mind and said, âYes, weâll let you claim the expenses.â The basis of its original ruling was that in fact the New South Wales government was in control of the asset, because the New South Wales government determined the phasing and the sequence of the traffic lightsâa pretty amazing ruling. The tax office eventually overturned that ruling, but not until some six months later.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Here we have a situation where we are desperate for infrastructure, and we are desperate for private sector investment in infrastructure. The government cannot affordâand no government could afford, no matter what sideâto put in all the money that is required for infrastructure investment in this country. No government could afford to do that. We are seeing more and more governments moving to private sector partnerships, and yet this government refuses to act on the biggest single tax disincentive to private sector investment in this country.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Australian Council for Infrastructure Development says it is the biggest single problem for infrastructure investment in this country. The government, to their shame, acknowledge that there is a problem. They acknowledge that something should be done, and they do nothing about it. They acknowledged four years ago that this section of the tax act needed to be amended. They acknowledged four years ago that this needed to be dealt with. They put out a discussion paper. Three years ago they gave us their preferred option, and since then it has sat in the big round filing cabinet underneath the Treasurerâs deskâit is called the garbage bin. It has gone absolutely nowhere. They have abrogated their duty to amend section 51AD of the tax act. They recognise that it is a problem and they refuse to do anything about it. I suspect it will take a Labor government to come into office and do something about it.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In the same way, despite all the rhetoric we hear from the government about how they are the friends of business and they are the people who can make things happen and they are the can-do government, it is the Labor governments across the statesâparticularly in New South Wales and Victoria, but also in Queenslandâwho have entered into partnerships with private industry to see infrastructure actually being built. We have seen the New South Wales government enter into private sector partnerships to build the Eastern Distributor, the M5, the Sydney Harbour tunnel, the Cross City tunnel and the Lane Cove tunnel. That is just in New South Wales and that is just in the last few years. Major roads are being built in partnership with the private sector and with no assistance from the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth is making the situation worse by refusing to amend section 51AD of the tax act. So in two areasâin income tax and in a much more specialised and esoteric area, section 51AD of the tax actâwe see this government being completely out of touch with what is needed. What is needed on income tax is real and proper tax relief for the hardworking Australians in the middle- and low-income brackets.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We all like a tax cut. Everybody likes a tax cut. People at the upper end of the income scale like a tax cut, and they deserve a tax cut. Under Labor they would get one. What they do not deserve, frankly, is a tax cut 10 times bigger than that received by people on average weekly earnings. This government should hang its head in shame for bringing in a tax cut which gives a massively skewed benefit to those at the upper end of the socioeconomic scale.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Under Laborâs plan people at the upper end of the income scale would get generous, worthwhile, necessary and deserved tax cuts, but they would not get obscene tax cuts, which is what this government proposes. This governmentÂ  proposes tax cuts of $65 for people at the upper end of the income scaleâ10 times the $6 tax cuts they propose to give people on average weekly earnings. That is a matter of some shame. Again, I call on the member for Greenway and the member for Lindsay to explain themselves and to justify their position. I call on all government members who represent seats with lower income constituentsâand there are quite a few such membersâto explain why they refuse to vote for Laborâs amendments under which tax cuts for people on lower incomes are greater than they are in the governmentâs scheme. I again call on the government to finally do something about section 51AD of the tax act, so that we can get some private sector investment in infrastructure in this country.</para>

<para>The proportion of imported honey tested for nitrofurans in the period April 2004 to April 2005, was 79 out of 350 consignments. Only one consignment was found to have a level of nitrofurans that exceeded the level of detection and failed.</para>

Imported honey is subject to inspection and testing on arrival at a rate of 10% of all consignments to verify compliance with the FSC. Honey is tested for a range of residues in accordance with the requirements of the FSC, including nitrofurans and its metabolites, chloramphenicol, pesticides listed in the FSC, sulphonamides, streptomycin and tetracycline. A very high level of compliance is evident.</para>
