Minister, isn’t it a fact that on 21 June 2004 the government correctly approved and issued travel identity documents for a Mr and Mrs Kola? Minister, isn’t it also a fact that, after failing to deport Mr and Mrs Kola to Serbia using these documents, the minister’s department knowingly requested the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to issue new identity documents bearing names for Mr and Mrs Kola that the department knew were false identities? Minister, isn’t the deliberate production of false identities in order to gain admission to a country what people smugglers do—not an action of the Australian government?</para>

<para>—I thank the honourable member for Mackellar for her question. I can report to the House that the International Monetary Fund has released its annual assessment of the Australian economy, known as the ‘Article IV assessment’. This is what the IMF does for all 184 members. I am sure that both sides of the House will be glad to know that the IMF has reported that the sustained strength of Australia’s economic performance can be attributed to an exemplary setting of economic policy and institutions. The IMF notes that since the early 1990s, when Australia bottomed in living standards as a consequence of the Labor recession, per capita incomes have increased to almost 10 per cent above the OECD average. So, even though the OECD standard of living was increasing, Australia’s was increasing faster and, far from being in that bottom half of the world league ladder of economic performance, since the early 1990s Australia has climbed the ladder and all Australians have improved their per capita incomes compared to developed economies overseas. The IMF notes that employment and productivity gains have been strong. The IMF records that there has been a six per cent decrease in the unemployment rate since the early 1990s. Unemployment is now at a 30-year low and six per cent better than it was under the then Minister for Employment, Education and Training, who was presiding over an 11 per cent unemployment rate in the early 1990s.</para>

<para>—Modesty forbids me from naming who the minister for employment was when unemployment hit 11 per cent. The IMF notes that there has been strong productivity growth. It indicates that there is ‘increased flexibility at the micro-economic level’, and notes ‘prudent and flexible management of monetary and fiscal policy within transparent medium-term policy frameworks’.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>All in all, the IMF report today is a glowing assessment of the Australian economy. If one were to compare it with the IMF assessment of the UK, United States, European or Japanese economies, you would see that no longer does Australia trail in economic performance—now, Australia is among the lead nations of the OECD. We did not get there by accident or fluke. We got there by hard work. A proper monetary policy, a balanced budget, reducing net debt, reform of industrial relations, abolishing wholesale sales tax, cutting capital gains tax and reducing income taxes—these were the things that made the Australian economy stronger, and if we continue with economic reform it will continue stronger into the near future.</para>

Does the minister agree that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs should play a critical role in Australia’s national security? Minister, is it not imperative, if the immigration department is to play this role, that it provide accurate, not deliberately false, documents to other key agencies critical to ensuring Australia’s national security? Minister, is the department of immigration now so incompetent that it commits identity fraud in order to do its job? How can Australia’s national security be protected with that level of incompetence on the front line?</para>

<para>—I thank the honourable member for his question. All I can say is that for the honourable member to be suggesting that this government would have anything at all to do with illegal representation from one department to another shows just how desperate the opposition has become. It shows how absolutely irrelevant the opposition know they have become to the greater Australian public. It shows how irrelevant they were in 2001, when they could not find it in themselves to have a decent immigration policy. It shows how they have never, ever been able to stand firmly on one side of the line when it comes to protecting Australia’s security. I think the member for Watson needs to take a very hard look at himself as to whether he has any respect for his own side.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Pearce for her question. I recognise her ongoing interest in our international relationships, particularly with regard to the effort that many of her Western Australian counterparts have put into the relationship with China, particularly in the minerals and resources sector.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>China is the fastest growing major economy in the world today. The Chinese economy is growing, on average, at about nine per cent per year. It has achieved that on an average basis over the last 25 years, which is quite a phenomenal achievement. This growth has lifted more than 300 million people out of poverty. A prosperous, outward-looking and engaged China is a vital component of both international and regional economic prosperity when you look at what is taking place within the East Asian region now in growth, linkages among those economies and the impact on that by the growth of China.</para>
<para>Australia have been well placed to benefit from China’s rapid industrial expansion because of our strengths. I have flagged some of the all-important exports that go out of Western Australia that have helped to fuel, if you like, the industrialisation of China. Australia’s exports to China grew by 30 per cent in 2004-05, to stand at about $13 billion. During the last decade, our exports to China have increased fourfold, such has been the growth of our relationship with China.</para>
<para>I know that many members of the House are interested in the export of manufactured goods. It is interesting to note that, in the last little while, our exports of elaborately transformed manufactures to China have grown four times faster than to the rest of the world. So we are expanding our manufactured exports to China faster than we are to most other markets in the world. Services exports have grown nearly three times as fast to China than to the rest of the world. It is interesting to look at some of the key statistics as far as China’s growth is concerned. In 1996, China had seven million mobile phones in use; in 2003, they had 269 million mobile phones in use. In 2003, there were 36 million computers in China, and that rate is doubling every 28 months, such is the expansion and development of the Chinese economy.</para>
<para>The relationship that Australia, over many decades, has established and nourished with China is delivering and will in the future deliver significant prosperity to our country. Australia’s FTA negotiations with China allow us to make the most of this unique opportunity as far as our exporters and our broader relationship with China are concerned. Our overall economic relationship within the East Asian region is growing rapidly and being drawn along by the growth of China.</para>

<para>—My question is to the Treasurer. I refer him again to the fact that, on 12 August this year, the Singapore price for petrol was $95 per barrel but more recently it rose to $120 per barrel while the crude oil price a month ago and today has hovered more consistently at around $89 per barrel. Does the Treasurer now accept that Australians are the victims of petrol price gouging? Why is he not prepared to direct the ACCC to investigate refiner margins, as he can do, of course, under the Trade Practices Act? Is it because the Treasurer does not understand the issue or does he simply not care?</para>

<para>—As I said earlier today, consumers in Australia are obviously suffering under exorbitant petrol prices. That is not good for them, it is not good for Australian businesses, it is not good for the economy, it is not good for the consumer price index and it is not good for other retailers because, as people spend more on petrol, they tend to spend less in other areas of the economy.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>If the petrol price were just a matter for an ACCC investigation, nobody would be happier than this government to have the matter solved. But I point out to the honourable member for Hunter that the petrol price does seem to be high in the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Japan. So, if the cause of high petrol prices was domestic conditions, one would wonder why they are high in the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Japan. The reality is that the price of petrol is high because world oil prices are high and refining capacity, particularly in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, has been reduced.

<para>—I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question. As I previously outlined to the House, the International Monetary Fund has just done an annual report on the Australian economy, as it does in relation to all 184 members of the IMF, the premier world financial body. It has endorsed Australia’s fiscal policy, its monetary policy, its structural reform programs and its competition policy, but it makes the point—and the government would also make this point—that you can never rest when it comes to economic reform. The moment you rest in relation to economic reform is the moment you begin to slip behind.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The IMF talks about things we have to do in Australia. It welcomes our recent reforms of pharmaceutical benefits. It welcomes the establishment of the Future Fund. But, most importantly, it says that Australia can get a productivity benefit from reforming its industrial relations system. After looking at the government’s proposal on industrial relations and work to welfare reform, the IMF concluded:</para>

<para class="block">The mission urged the implementation of this package of reforms to widen employment opportunities and raise productivity by enhancing flexibility and work arrangements.</para>

<para class="block">You do not have to take it from the government, you do not have to take it from the Prime Minister, you do not have to take it from the Treasurer and you do not have to take it from the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations because the IMF has recommended to Australia that we engage in industrial relations reform—met with great hilarity by the Labor Party.</para>

<para>—I am not aware of this report. But can I make a point with regard to services and services to regional Australia, because that is what the question goes to. In the whole process of this debate about Telstra and the level of services to regional Australia, we have put in place legislation that underpins the universal service obligation. We have put in place legislation that underpins the customer service guarantee. We have announced what we are going to do as far as the network reliability framework is concerned and what we are going to require Telstra to do as part of that licensing requirement. We are going to make part of the licensing requirement their local presence plan in regional Australia.</para>

<para>We have made abundantly clear in this whole debate what we intend to do as far as the delivery of services to regional Australia is concerned, and that is what this government have done since we came into office in 1996, which is something that the Labor Party—you should note this—never ever did when they were in government for 13 years. Apart from turning off the analog mobile phone system, they never mentioned any interest in investment in telecommunications infrastructure in regional Australia. In the last nine years, we have invested over $1 billion in regional telecommunications across Australia.</para>

<para>—I thank the honourable member for Wakefield for his question, and I know of his real and continuing interest in these matters. Of course the government’s response to the terrorist threat has been substantial. It is a three-pronged approach involving better laws to deal with terrorists and prevent attacks, equipping our law enforcement and intelligence agencies with the tools they need to fight terrorism, and international cooperation, because we know that the war on terrorism is not a battle which can be fought on any one front.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I note that the Leader of the Opposition has recently expressed some interest in these matters and at the weekend gave an insight into the type of innovative thinking that we have come to expect from him and his colleagues on these matters. According to the Leader of the Opposition, we do not need new laws to deter terrorists; we need more spies. I am pleased to inform the House that under this government ASIO currently has around 960 staff, compared with 580 four years ago. This figure is expected to increase to 1,100 by the end of this financial year. I might say that no request from ASIO in the budget process has been rejected by this government.</para>
<para>This significant commitment accounts for only one part of the $5.6 billion investment in national security since September 11 four years ago. For the benefit of honourable members opposite, I am pleased to advise that there have been more than 100 practical security initiatives. They include establishing counter-terrorism first response capability at all international and major domestic airports, increasing the rate of container examination by Customs and establishing Customs officers to board more vessels at first port of arrival in Australia, expanding our National Counterterrorism Committee exercise program, establishing the AFP mobile strike teams and joint counter-terrorism teams, initiating a national identity security framework, increasing the funding for AUSTRAC to provide vital intelligence to counter money laundering and terrorist financing, establishing and maintaining the national security hotline, engaging with the private sector to improve protection of critical infrastructure and supplying chemical, biological and radiological counterterrorism equipment to the states and territories.</para>
<para>These initiatives are a record of achievement and a measure of this government’s commitment to protecting Australians from terrorism. They do not diminish the importance of equipping our agencies with the legislative tools they need to successfully thwart terrorist activities, and I look forward to the Leader of the Opposition supporting the serious, practical measures announced by the Prime Minister and me last week. In the meantime, the government will get on with the job of protecting our community from the terrorist threat.</para>

<name role="display">Mr ANDREWS</name>
</talker>
<para>—I thank the member for Hasluck for his question. Indeed there are examples of archaic and discriminatory provisions in awards in the state systems in Australia. Let me take a couple of examples. The bag, sack and textile award in Western Australia contains the provision that no more than one in three male workers in a workplace can be juniors, but no more than one in two female workers can be juniors. And take the laundry workers award, also in Western Australia: there may be two female juniors for each adult employee but only one male junior for each adult employee. These are just a couple of examples of the mind-numbing minutiae contained in state awards that seek to regulate every minute of every day of workers in Australia. The only party in Australia which is defending this mind-numbing archaic detail is the Australian Labor Party.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Australian Labor Party has as a policy to call for the implementation of a comprehensive system of awards in Australia. It is no wonder, as the Treasurer pointed out, that in its report the IMF has called upon and supported further reform of workplace relations in Australia. In its report, the IMF said, in part:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Further reforms of industrial relations are needed to expand labor demand and facilitate productivity gains.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It went on to point out that large employers face up to six industrial relations systems at federal and state levels—something which this side of politics is trying to overcome by the implementation of one national system for industrial relations. This is something which, again, is opposed by the Australian Labor Party and the union movement.</para>
<para>Indeed, the IMF concluded:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The mission urged the implementation of this package of reforms to widen employment opportunities and raise productivity by enhancing flexibility in work arrangements.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So it is quite clear that when an objective assessment is made of workplace relations in Australia and the challenges facing the Australian economy over the next five, 10 or 15 years, by the IMF, there is this conclusion that we need to undertake further incremental, careful, balanced reforms of the workplace relations system—something which this government proposes to do. Why does the ALP stand opposed to these changes? Why has the ALP opposed every attempt to change and improve workplace relations under this government going back to the 1996 reforms? As the Treasurer pointed out in his quote from a former Leader of the Opposition, it is because you have union leaders sitting around a table in a Chinese restaurant each night deciding what the policy for the ALP and the rest of this country should be.</para>

<para>—My question is to the Acting Prime Minister and follows on from the earlier questions by the Leader of the Opposition. Is it the case that the 104-page document contains potentially market-sensitive information? Does the Acting Prime Minister support Labor’s approach to the Stock Exchange for the document to be released generally rather than provided selectively? Will the Acting Prime Minister ensure the public release of the information before the vote to fully privatise Telstra takes place in the Senate?</para>

<para>—I do thank the member for Solomon for his question and I also thank him for the concern he has to try to combat this dreadful scourge which afflicts many remote Indigenous communities. Petrol sniffing in remote communities has claimed some 100 lives since the early 1980s, but thanks to the policies of the Howard government unsniffable petrol is now available in some 43 remote communities around the country. In the budget, the government allocated an additional $9 million to extend unsniffable petrol to another 23 communities, and yesterday the government committed a further $6 million to extend unsniffable petrol to at least seven communities and six roadhouses in a 128,000 square kilometre swathe of the central desert, centred on Ayers Rock. This is an area twice the size of the state of Tasmania.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Also yesterday, the Commonwealth, South Australian, Western Australian and Northern Territory governments agreed on a comprehensive anti-petrol-sniffing strategy, including consistent legislation clearly banning petrol sniffing, effective policing to ensure that the law is actually enforced and responsible communities that are capable of giving their young people a decent future. Again, I commend the example of Yuendumu, which has almost eliminated petrol sniffing through practising zero tolerance and quite literally marching petrol sniffers out to the Mount Theo outstation for rehabilitation and treatment. As Noel Pearson said on the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> program a couple of weeks ago, when it comes to substance abuse, we need to ‘rebuild intolerance’. That is what he said. Yet again, Noel Pearson is providing great leadership, not just to the Indigenous people of Australia but to the wider Australian community.</para>

<para>—I know that the honourable member for Page, like many members on this side of the House, is very anxious to see considerable upgrading of Australia’s road system and wants to see, in particular, the AusLink commitment for $12.7 billion put into action as quickly as possible. This is an important national program that will help deliver critically important land transport upgrades around the country, including significant expenditure on the Pacific Highway—which I know is of great interest to the member for Page and all other members on the New South Wales North Coast.</para>

<para>—to enable important road and rail construction projects to commence. It is important to note the significance of New South Wales and other states blocking the financial opportunities that are available under AusLink. For instance, under AusLink, New South Wales will receive $2,488 million, including $1,946 million for construction. That is 77 per cent more in construction funding than the state has received over the previous five years. It is a 77 per cent increase, and New South Wales has not yet signed the agreement. What about Western Australia, which I referred to a couple of days ago? There is $620 million under AusLink for Western Australia, including $460 million for construction. That is an 89 per cent increase over what they have received in the past. This is an 89 per cent increase, and Western Australia are dillydallying! They cannot get around to signing the agreement. I would remind the states that, if they have not signed up by 1 October 2005, all of the unsigned agreements will include the new construction code guidelines.</para>

<para>I was asked whether there are any alternative policies or commentary on these issues. On ABC Sydney Drive just the other day, the New South Wales Minister for Roads said, ‘If I get the money, I will spend it.’ There is a clear message to the Minister for Roads in New South Wales: he can have the money; all he has to do is sign the AusLink agreement. But it seems as though Labor are not all that committed to road funding.</para>
<para>I noticed that Labor’s shadow spokesman for transport and regional services waded into the issue yesterday with a statement in which he repeated Labor’s election commitment to strip money out of the Roads to Recovery program—a program absolutely essential for the construction of urban streets and rural roads around the country—and to spend that money on other projects such as public transport, bus and ferry stations, walkways, railway crossings and real-time passenger information. That is their priority—the money goes off roads and onto all these other kinds of infrastructure expenditure. I fail to see how you can deal with the increasing freight task in Australia by building more cycle lanes, walkways or ferry stations. That is not the answer. It is time that Labor got on board with this very significant AusLink project and used their initiative so that all Labor state governments would sign up, get on with the work and build the roads so that we can stop some of the fatalities that are tearing so many communities apart at the present time.</para>

<para>—My question is to the Treasurer in his capacity representing the Minister for Finance and Administration. Does the Treasurer agree with his colleague the member for Cook that the Telstra privatisation bill is ‘an economic bill about privatising a very large government owned organisation and has no impact on families’? Will the Treasurer be seeking the Prime Minister’s commitment to deliver on his promise to deliver these family impact statements? Treasurer, is the provision of decent telecommunications services crucial to family life in the country and in the suburbs?</para>

<para>—Can I say that access to communications services is important for families. Of course it is important for families. That is one of the reasons why we want to promote competition in the sector to get lower prices. It is one of the reasons why we have the HiBIS to extend broadband access. It is one of the reasons why we have a $2 billion regional Communications Fund. We do believe it is important for families.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I take up this point that something that is important to families can only be delivered by a nationalised company. I think that is the premise behind the question. If Telstra is in private ownership, somehow that affects in an adverse way the delivery of services to families. Can I make this point: there are many things that are delivered in this economy by the private sector that are important to families. Let me give you an example: food. In this country, food is entirely produced by private producers, distributed by private transporters and sold by private retailers, and it is very important to families. But that is not a reason to nationalise the food industry.</para>

<para>—Let me conclude by saying that we believe that a competitive sector, delivering lower prices, with an infrastructure fund to roll out broadband, is in the interests of Australian families. Can I say that the regional telecommunications fund is going to be of great assistance to regional families to future proof new services. In fact, it ought to be renamed ‘The Labor Party future-proofing fund’, because what it will do is ensure that those people get great services long before the Labor Party ever gets back into office and proceeds, as we have always known that it would, with its own plans to privatise Telstra.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Hume for his question. I certainly acknowledge his commitment to supporting the needs of older people living in the electorate of Hume. Due to the strong economic management of this government, we have been able to invest record levels of funding in aged care, including in rural and regional Australia. We are aware of the particular challenges that older people face in accessing aged care in rural and regional Australia, and members will be pleased to know that over one-third of all operational aged care places—residential and community care—are located in rural and regional areas.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This year, in the 2005 annual aged care allocation round, we have allocated over 40 per cent of available places for rural and regional areas. There is in place a viability supplement, recognising the increasing costs that the delivery of care in rural and regional Australia might bring. As of 1 January this year we have increased that viability supplement by a further $14½ million over the next four years, on top of the $13 million a year that currently comprises that viability supplement.</para>
<para>The government also provide capital grants for homes in rural and regional Australia for communities who have difficulty accessing capital. Again, this year some $40 million will be available for homes in rural and regional Australia for capital requirements. Recently, we completed a grants application process to enhance respite services and information services across Australia. As a result of this grants process, some $374 million will be available for enhanced and increased respite services and improved information services. Of the 414 projects that received grants, over 50 per cent were located in rural and regional Australia—some 244 projects, up on the 193 rural and regional projects before the commencement of the grants application process. On average, there has been an increase of 20 per cent per project across Australia. We now have in place 54 combined Carelink and Commonwealth respite service centres across Australia. These provide information on aged care services and respite services. Thirty-nine of those 54 co-located services are in rural and regional Australia and, as a result of our grants process, two new services will be available in remote communities in the Northern Territory.</para>
<para>The government has also allocated a further $9.3 million in the last budget for further respite services, through the 93 multipurpose services that exist in Australia to service remote and rural communities. The government is committed to supporting older Australians living in rural and regional areas. Meanwhile, the Labor Party has no interest in the needs of people in rural and regional Australia, no interest in aged care and still no aged care policy.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Greenway for her question. As I have informed the House, the federal government, under its co-contribution, has now given $309 million to low- and middle-income earners in Australia who, in the first year of the super co-contribution, received a dollar for every dollar they put in. But what does that mean to those low- and middle-income earners over time, because what we are about here is changing people’s attitudes to their own retirement? A worker who is 25 years of age and who in the first year took up the option of putting $1,000 away and receiving $1,000 through the Howard government’s co-contribution—getting an immediate boost of $2,000 into their superannuation account—over a 40-year working life, with the seven per cent interest rate, will have $28,000, in round figures, by making the decision even just once. In the electorate of the member for Greenway, as she will be pleased to know, in the first year of operation, over 3,100 of those low- and middle-income earners in the Parramatta region and around that area actually took the chance of getting a dollar for a dollar from the Howard government.</para>

<para>She also asks: are there any threats? The threat comes in the form of the Labor Party’s policy at the last election. So that the member for Lilley cannot pretend that he has been somehow verballed, let me read and quote from page 4 of their policy:</para>

<para class="block">Many people in this House will remember the former leader, Mark Latham, in a photo opportunity at the Golden Circle factory in Brisbane with the member for Lilley. Photo opportunities are cheap, but many of those workers would have no doubt taken up the super co-contribution. In fact, nearly one in every 10 voters in the Lilley electorate actually took up the Howard government’s co-contribution; some 7,500 members of the member’s electorate took up the Howard government’s co-contribution. I wonder whether the member for Lilley mentioned that to the workers at the Golden Circle factory. The member for Lilley had a policy—</para>

<para>—Treasurer, he had a policy! The policy was: do not let these workers at the Golden Circle factory get $1,000 as a dollar for a dollar. The Labor Party said, ‘If you’re on a $25,000 income, we’re going to cut your contribution tax by two per cent over four years.’ What does that mean for a Golden Circle worker? It means for a Golden Circle worker $45 over four years—that is it. Mind you, if you are the boss of Golden Circle and you are earning $100,000, you will get $180 from Labor. This co-contribution is about rewarding effort. It is about rewarding people for putting money into their retirement. It is about building better retirement incomes for Australians—and it is opposed by the Labor Party.</para>

<para>The member for Paterson has 3,500 electors who took up the co-contribution. The member for Tangney has 4,400. But what is the member for Ballarat going to be saying at the next election? Is she going to be holding up the Labor Party document to the 4,400 workers out there who took up the co-contribution, saying, ‘You can’t have it’? Remember the member for Rankin? He has a lot to say these days. Well, 6,500 of his voters actually took up the Howard government’s co-contribution. And now it is even better: put a dollar in, get $1.50—make a difference to your own retirement and get the support incentives of the Howard government.</para>

<para>—My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. I refer again to today’s report by the respected NATSEM institute. In particular, I refer the minister to the report’s findings that the Howard government will take back as much as 75c of every dollar that people with a disability earn. Why does the minister find it acceptable for people with a disability to work for an effective return of $2.27 an hour? Why do the Howard government’s proposed welfare changes make it less worth while to move from welfare to work than it is now? Why doesn’t the government at least listen to its own backbench when the member for Pearce says:</para>

<para>—Can I repeat for the benefit of the member for Jagajaga that under these new arrangements a person who is on Newstart and working the minimum of 15 hours a week would effectively have in their pocket at the end of the week some $382.25. That compares to a person on the disability support pension without work who has $290.05 a week. If the member for Jagajaga could simply subtract one from the other, she would find out that there is a difference—an advantage—of some $90 between those two figures.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As for the suggestion that somehow this person is effectively earning only $2.27 an hour, the reality is that a person who works 15 hours and receives Newstart allowance in addition to what they are earning effectively puts in their pocket, at the end of the week, somewhere in the order of $24 or $25 an hour. The principle which underlies this is very simple. We in the government believe that if a person is capable of working 15 hours or more a week they should do so. I believe that the overwhelming majority of Australians also believe that. We have a generous safety net in place for people who are incapable of working 15 hours a week. That safety net remains. People will still be on the disability support pension if they cannot work for 15 hours a week, but there is some expectation that somebody who is capable of working 15, 20 or 25 hours a week will contribute to their own wellbeing.</para>

<para>—Yesterday I was asked a question about the standard of dress acceptable in the House. As was the case with many of my predecessors, I do not intend to be inflexible or prescriptive on this matter. In 1999 the former Speaker, the Hon. Neil Andrew, pointed to the significance and role of this unique institution and the expectation on the part of electors that we, as members, maintain high standards in carrying out our responsibilities and in our conduct in this place. The accepted practice is that members have chosen to dress in a formal manner in keeping with business and professional standards. This includes trousers, jacket, collar and tie for men and a similar standard of formality for women.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I would also like to make the point that these standards apply equally to officers and staff occupying the advisers boxes, members of the press gallery and guests in the distinguished visitors gallery. As already mentioned, I do not propose to apply these standards rigidly. However, while I accept that members hurrying to attend a division or quorum will sometimes arrive without a jacket or tie, it is not in keeping with the dignity of the House for members to arrive in casual or sports wear. I look forward to the cooperation of all members in fulfilling their obligation to maintain the dignity of the House through their standard of dress and their conduct during proceedings.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I note for the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record that the Treasurer has slipped out of the chamber, which prompts me to make the point that he thinks this debate is beneath him. He thinks he has more important things to be doing, despite the fact that Australian families are facing crippling fuel costs and are hurting. The electorate find the Treasurer’s smugness disconcerting, his arrogance offensive and his ignorance on petrol prices scary. He demonstrated that ignorance in this House yesterday when, in response to my question, he did not even go to the question of refinery pricing and the huge gap opening up between world oil prices and refinery prices. I note that he corrected that today on some advice overnight, but his answer yesterday demonstrated clearly his failure to understand and properly grasp this issue and the impact it is having on Australian families. The Treasurer has failed two tests today. The first test was to give a serious, sensible and constructive answer to the question I posed to him during question time. The second test was to stay in here for this most important debate on the impact that petrol prices are having on Australian families. Of course, he failed both tests.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I am disappointed that the Treasurer has left us. I am disappointed not for us but for him, because we have some very good advice for the Treasurer this afternoon. The Treasurer says that he feels that he already leads the country in a sense—he already leads the country in an economic sense. This is an economic issue. This was a good opportunity for the Treasurer to show some leadership. We are prepared to give him some advice on leadership. We are happy to tell him that he should jettison the Prime Minister’s contention that the government can do nothing about petrol prices. He should forget about that. Instead, he should acknowledge the pain being imposed on Australian families. He should acknowledge that families are now facing fuel bills of up to $200 a week and, in addition, that they are facing higher prices on the goods they buy due to the transport and additional costs imposed on all sorts of goods and services as a result of rising fuel prices.</para>
<para>I note that just today, coming out of the IMF report that the Treasurer was quoting during question time, the IMF has predicted that Australia’s inflation rate is now likely to go to three per cent as a result of these high oil prices. That has ramifications and implications for interest rates and for mortgage interest rates in this country. I also note that today JP Morgan has estimated that for the average household the 20 per cent rise in petrol prices over the past six weeks is roughly equivalent to a quarter of one per cent increase in interest rates. So the government, already putting pressure on Australian families by not introducing fair and equitable tax cuts and putting extra pressure on them through a range of higher costs including private health insurance, is now not prepared to move on this very important issue.</para>
<para>I said I had some advice for the Treasurer. In fact, I have a five-point plan for the Treasurer today. He says he can do nothing, but I have a five-point plan which he could embrace immediately and put into effect in most circumstances in a very short time. The first point, and one of the most important, is that he should apologise for his broken promise that the GST would not cause petrol prices to rise. We all remember that period around 1999-2000 when the Treasurer said, ‘Don’t worry, the GST will not cause petrol prices to rise because we are going to reduce the excise by 7c.’ He established what was called a strike rate. He said that, if you take 7c off 70c—the arithmetic is pretty easy—and put 10 per cent back on, you end up back at the same price. But, if you take a price of $1.30—I am giving him a bit of latitude here—which is below the current price, and take off 7c and put 10 per cent back on, you end up with $1.35. So the promise that the GST would not cause petrol prices to rise has been well and truly broken and the Treasurer should come in here today and apologise.</para>
<para>The second thing he can do, as we have been calling upon him to do for weeks, is to ask the ACCC to conduct an inquiry into fuel prices and, in particular, refinery margins. The <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> screamed the headline ‘The big petrol rip-off’. That was sufficient for the Chairman of the ACCC to say that there was something funny going on with refinery margins. But it was not sufficient for the Treasurer, who obviously does not understand this graph that shows a huge gap opening up between oil prices and petrol prices. This shows that this is not just about oil prices; this is about oil companies gouging profits inappropriately. The government have their hands in the trousers of the Australian community. The combined effect of that is devastating on Australian families.</para>
<para>The Treasurer said yesterday that the ACCC could hold an inquiry any time it liked. Of course it can but, for whatever reason, the Chairman of the ACCC has not seen fit to do so. I call upon the Treasurer to direct him to do so. As I indicated during question time, the Treasurer has the absolute right to do that. Both the Treasurer and the Prime Minister like to hang their hats on the fact that we have had 100 or so inquiries into petrol already—in fact, I exaggerated, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be surprised to hear. The Prime Minister claimed that there have been 44 major inquires into petrol, but the government was very clever in choosing the base year. You may have noted that the Prime Minister likes to go back to 1983, some 22 years ago. Here is the more important point. How many inquiries do you think we have had since 1996, in the almost 10 years that the Howard government has been in office? The Prime Minister claims that there have been 44 inquiries since 1983, but how many do you think there have been in the last nine years? There has been one major inquiry in 10 years. I will concede that there were two other minor inquiries by the ACCC—one on declaration and one on inconsistency between domestic and international prices—but they were very narrowly confined inquiries. The major inquiry I am talking about, the Trebeck inquiry, was into fuel taxation only. It did not in any sense canvass the issues we are dealing with here today of abuse of market power and price gouging. That is the second thing the Treasurer can do today: insist that the ACCC undertake an inquiry into what is happening in refining margins in particular and petrol and fuel prices generally.</para>
<para>Third, the Treasurer can do something about section 46 of the Trade Practices Act. It is well known that section 46 of the Trade Practices Act has been rendered inefficient and ineffective because of a number of Federal Court and High Court cases. For example, in the Safeway case the concept of take advantage was brought into question. In the Rural Press case the concept of abusing market power in another market was brought into question. In the Boral case the very concept of market power was brought into question. The ACCC has effectively given up taking cases under section 46 of the Trade Practices Act because it knows it has now been rendered ineffective. We had a Senate inquiry into this issue and a report was tabled in March 2004 making some sensible recommendations for reform of the Trade Practices Act, but we have heard nothing from this government.</para>
<para>The fourth thing the Treasurer can do today is to have another look at the regulatory structure which controls the petroleum industry. This is a structure that is now 25 years old. In 1980 Malcolm Fraser decided it was time to put a brake on the power of the major oil companies. To do so he introduced two acts: the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act and the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act. But back then there were nine major oil companies and some 20,000 service stations around this country. Today there are just four major oil companies and some 7,000 service stations. More to the point, this is a regulatory structure that has been effectively circumvented by the major oil companies by a range of invented instruments, the least of them not being the concept of the multisite franchise. But, even worse, this is a regulatory regime that does not cover the new entrants to the market, Coles and Woolworths, and as a result does not cover 50 per cent by volume of the market. What sort of a regulatory regime does not cover 50 per cent of the market or two of the biggest players? The government has had nine years to sort this out. It has been talking about an oil code. The opposition is happy to talk about the repeal of the franchise and sites acts if it can come up with a decent oil code and get some agreement between the major players in the market, but the government is simply not capable of doing it. If it were capable of doing it, in combination with improvements to section 46, petrol prices for motorists would fall.</para>
<para>We are talking about a fuel industry in which we rely too heavily on imports. We are now approaching 60 per cent oil import dependency and we are now importing 25 per cent of our refined product—in other words, petrol. We are increasingly being exposed to the whims of OPEC and difficulties in the Middle East and elsewhere, and the government has no plan whatsoever.</para>
<para>That takes me to my fifth point: the government has no plan to diversify our fuel mix in this country. We are becoming increasingly dependent on imports, yet at the same time we have enormous opportunities here in Australia to advance the biofuels market, including ethanol, which has three positive effects: it is good environmentally, it creates jobs in regional Australia and—potentially more important—it maintains the competitiveness of the independent sector because there is no tax on ethanol. So, if the independents can put some ethanol in their mix because it is cheaper, they can compete with the power of those major oil companies.</para>
<para>More particularly, we have 150 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in this country that today, using current technology, could be used and transformed into liquid diesel fuels—fuel that will go straight into existing diesel engines without any modification whatsoever. While ever the price of oil is greater than $US20 per barrel, this is commercially viable. But do we see any plan from this government? No, we do not. The government is happy to sit back and let the oil companies have their hand. It is happy for Australia to become the LNG hub of the world while Qatar in the Middle East becomes the value added gas to liquids hub of the world. This is to Australia’s great disadvantage. We are taking the gas out of the ground, we are selling it off at bargain basement prices and, when the time comes that we will require it, the major oil companies will say: ‘Sorry, all the easier and cheaper to win stuff is already gone; we have exported that. You are going to have to pay through the nose for the harder to get stuff.’ That is what will happen in this country, and it is an absolute disgrace that this government has no plan to transform that gas into diesel liquid fuels, just as it has no real plan for ethanol. It is a friend to ethanol producers but not a friend to ethanol, and it needs a plan. So that is the fifth area of advice I have for the Treasurer.</para>
<para>I made the point that the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> has directly accused the oil majors of profit gouging. The Chairman of the ACCC has said, ‘Something funny is going on but the government refuses to act.’ During question time today the Treasurer in his smugness said, ‘What is the opposition going on about? Don’t you know petrol prices are high all around the world?’ Of course we do, and we know the causes of that, and that is why it is more important that the government act. But Gordon Brown is acting—and guess what? He has got a five-point plan. I quote from the London <inline font-style="italic">Times</inline> today:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Gordon Brown will table an emergency international plan today to bring down oil prices. He will tell the TUC conference in Brighton today that he has a five-point plan.</para>

<para>—As every motorist and as every pensioner knows, the price of fuel at the pump today is of grave concern to every Australian—not just the cost when you put the fuel in your motor vehicle but the cost that flows through to everything we purchase. Being such a large country and such a decentralised country, we are so dependent upon transport. In the production cycle, fuel is a major contributor to cost. What is happening around the world today, not just in Australia, is of grave concern to many economies and many governments because it will impact upon the production cycle and the cost of living which, ultimately, flows through to potentially inflation and associated economic activity.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>There is no quick fix for the problem of major oil prices. What we have seen here today is typical cheapjack political opportunism from the member for Hunter—that is all it is. If the Labor Party were sincere in their belief, if they really believed that they could wave a magic wand and somehow remove the pain from the Australian economy—not just from the motorist but from the entire economy—then they would have done so. Who condemns the Labor Party for their actions? It is not the Prime Minister, it is not the Treasurer—it is one of their own. Craig Emerson, ALP federal member for Rankin in Queensland, wrote in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper on 20 July, only a couple of months ago:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Australia’s record petrol prices have one cause and one cause only—high world oil prices.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He asks this rhetorical question:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">But isn’t the Government reaping a revenue windfall from soaring oil prices that it could hand back to motorists?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is the common belief. In years gone by, before the coalition government stopped fuel excise being indexed every six months, the federal government continued to take a windfall from excise. But the Howard government froze excise and reduced the price of fuel by over 6c for Australian motorists. So no, the federal government does not pick up one red cent extra when the price of a barrel of crude goes up because our excise is a flat rate. It does not matter if fuel is being sold for 90c a litre or $1.30 a litre: the fact is that the excise collected by the federal government remains the same. The GST goes up, obviously, but where does the GST go? Every last cent of it goes to the state governments. So, when the member for Rankin, Craig Emerson, writing this article asks this rhetorical question about a windfall, he says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It used to, but not any more.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Has this man any credibility beyond sitting on the back bench? I went back and had a look at his CV to see whether he had any credibility. He is a doctor of economics. He was an economic analyst with the United Nations from 1978 to 1980, an economic adviser, a former shadow minister for resources—a man of some credibility in this field. He makes a lie of the political cheapjack opportunism of the member for Hunter, who comes in here ranting and raving, trying to put up an argument to make the Labor Party credible on an issue that is painful to the world—not just to Australians. The member for Rankin goes on in the same article:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">There’s no revenue windfall from petrol excise when world oil prices go up.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">As he says, the states get a bit of a windfall from GST—about $32 million. But he puts an interesting spin on this, and he is absolutely correct. The member for Hunter said that the rising price of petrol could flow into inflation. We are very much aware of that. What happens when it flows into inflation? The CPI goes up. What is indexed to the CPI? Pensions—disability pensions and age pensions—are indexed to the CPI. Therefore, the cost to government goes up. So there is no windfall to the Howard government—quite the contrary.</para>
<para>The member for Hunter went on to talk about competition. Can I read to members what the ACCC said in a press release dated 12 September, yesterday? There is no point mincing words. The member for Hunter likes to play fast and loose with words. These are the facts:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has confirmed that it is closely monitoring developments in petrol prices, both in Australia and overseas. Recently there have been significant increases, both in the level of petrol prices in Australia and also in the difference between petrol prices and crude oil prices. This phenomenon has occurred not only in Australia but also internationally. It is primarily a result of a shortage in the supply of refined product in the US Gulf following Hurricane Katrina—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">which may have missed the attention of the honourable member for Hunter—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">and the Chinese government’s recent decision to take steps to halt the exports of petrol because of an acute shortage of fuel in several of China’s provinces.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The ACCC—the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission—does not have any evidence that increases in current domestic petrol prices are related to any anti-competitive conduct. If evidence of such conduct is discovered, the ACCC will immediately investigate.</para>
<para>We talk about competition. A thing called shopper dockets may have escaped the member for Hunter. There is pressure on retailers to drive down the price of petrol. The discounts of 4c and 8c a litre—some mortgage originators, I believe, are even offering discounts of 50c a litre—show the enormous downward pressure, as much as can be achieved, at the petrol pump. That is not anti-competitive; that is competition working at its best, and it is giving some relief to Australian motorists.</para>
<para>Let us compare Australia’s circumstances to international circumstances. The following prices are in US dollars: Australia has petrol at about 71.7c a litre; Austria, $1.15; Belgium, $1.41; the Czech Republic, just over $1; Denmark, $1.39; Germany, $1.38; and Greece, over $1. Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and even New Zealand are more expensive than Australia for petrol. Yes, this issue is hurting Australian motorists and, yes, the Labor Party is looking for something to hang its hat on, but trying to make an issue in here of rising petrol prices, which is a phenomenon striking the world because of natural disasters and because of the Chinese economy and its government’s decisions, is nothing more than cheapjack opportunism. And that is what the member for Hunter is renowned for in this place.</para>
<para>Let us go to what Labor did in government. In 1993, when the Labor Party occupied the treasury bench, they brought down a deficit of $17 billion and inflicted upon the Australian public a further increase in the fuel excise. That was over and above the normal six-monthly indexation introduced by a Labor government and stopped by a coalition government. They said this:</para>

<para>—That is an additional 5c a litre impost of excise on every Australian motorist, right through the production chain, right through the transport chain, because the Labor Party could not manage the economy. Because the economy was going backwards jobs were almost nonexistent, we were at nearly 10 per cent unemployment and interest rates were through the roof, and their answer was to slug the motorist. It was the coalition government that removed excise, that froze excise. If we had not done that, today excise would have been 52c a litre and there would have been more pain to Australian motorists, but that is not the case.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>There are many things that the coalition government has done to assist in driving down the prices of fuel. For instance, there is terminal gate pricing—the government has developed a draft oil code which details a set of national terminal gate pricing principles; collective bargaining—currently the TPA provides for businesses to seek collective bargaining so that the major companies cannot just have it on their own; strengthening section 46 and banning predatory pricing—providing cease and desist powers to the ACCC. These are the very sorts of things that the Labor Party come in here harking about. The ACCC do not need a direction from the Treasurer. They have the power to act, and in fact they have in the past acted. They have had parts of the petroleum industry in the courts for having colluded. So they do act as much as they possibly can. Let us go to the inquiries. There were 45 inquiries, so the Labor Party talk about—</para>

<para>—You are going to quibble over one—44 inquiries? No, in fact it was 45 inquiries so there you go; you have lost track. There have been 45 inquiries. At the same time that the Labor Party was deliberately of its own action collecting more taxes from the Australian public through increases to excises, 5c between 1993 and 1994, and on top of that the indexation every six months, they had inquiries in their own hands. They had an inquiry into petroleum product prices in December 1989. So four years earlier they were out there telling the public, just before an election, no doubt, ‘We’re worried about petrol prices and we’re going to have another inquiry’—No. 37, 38 or 39. That is typical of what Labor governments do. In the same way we have seen the state Labor governments putting up stamp duty on insurances recently. State Labor governments, federal Labor governments—it does not matter where they come from, the colour is always the same: they stand for higher taxes, and the law they have implemented shows that unequivocally.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>They had another inquiry: the ‘national inquiry into petroleum product prices’ in November 1990. So there was one in 1989, but that was not good enough so 12 months later they had another one. Yet three years later the Labor Party, through their own actions, put a direct impost onto Australians and then wanted to continue to index it. Yet today they are in here again, saying that something should be done about petrol pricing.</para>
<para>The coalition say that the best thing we can do is to provide incentives to people to have jobs, to provide lower taxes for them, to freeze their excises and to drive those things down that have an impost on them so that the whole of the economy can benefit. On top of that the coalition also introduced major improvements to the diesel fuel rebate, because this is not just about petrol; this is about the whole cost of petroleum products—on road, off road. So it meant that the cost of delivering products and that the price throughout the production cycle of business were driven down.</para>
<para>But we have not finished there, because we have already announced to the Australian public that there will be over $1.5 billion worth of additional relief, as we go forward, in the form of diesel fuel, so that we can have parity between the different products and so that the cost of business will be reduced. When you reduce the cost to business, it means that the end user, the consumer, benefits, not just at the petrol pump but at the grocery checkout counter, and everywhere else in that cycle.</para>
<para>So, once again, we have come into this place for a matter of public importance. We had the member for Rankin, a person who is credible on this issue, who blows the Labor Party, his own party that he sits on the backbench for—I do not know how he managed to stand today when he was asked in good faith to stand to support this, when he himself has said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">So no, there are no magic solutions to high petrol prices. It might seem clever to pretend there are, but the Australian people are smarter than that.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">They are smarter than that. It is clear, though, that the brains in the tactics committee of the Labor Party are not smarter than that. Trying to use this issue to give themselves some momentum, when they are quite clearly as flat as a tack, going nowhere, leaderless and with no reasonable policy initiatives, they rely on cheapjack political opportunism. Listen to the member for Rankin: he is right. There are no easy issues and answers to this, but you can depend upon one thing: the coalition will continue to deliver to the Australian public in the best possible way. We will do all we can to deliver the strong economy and jobs that Australians deserve. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—The member for Longman has just aptly demonstrated the point of this MPI. The government come in here and say, ‘We can do absolutely nothing.’ Hiding behind a hurricane, ‘We’re not responsible at all for petrol pricing; it’s the crude oil. We’re sitting here and there is absolutely nothing we can do,’ they claim. In fact there are things that they can do. The price of fuel is hitting the nation hard. We are seeing prices at a $1.33 in Sydney, with predictions by motorist organisations that it will hit $1.45. The price of fuel is $1.40 in my own district and that of the member for Bendigo just last week.</para>

<para>—Fuel prices are what families around Australia are talking about. It is consuming their household budgets at an absolutely alarming rate. Unfortunately, for families that is all the Howard government has done in relation to the spiralling cost of petrol—talk. This is despite the alarming rise in fuel prices in the past few weeks alone. Each time the price rises families are facing tough choices, having to cut back on other expenses and on their daily activities.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>In the midst of all this, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have been virtually absent from the debate. They have been keeping their heads down, claiming that it is not their responsibility and that the price triggers are well beyond their control. That is not true. Yesterday during question time the Treasurer took this further by laughing off families’ concerns and dismissing a legitimate question about why there is such an enormous variance between the price of crude oil and the price of unleaded petrol and why that variance is getting bigger. The Treasurer cannot have it both ways. If it is all about the price of crude oil, as he argues, then the price of petrol should be much lower than it is today. The Treasurer’s response merely epitomises this government’s do-nothing approach. This government’s form is to act on something only when it becomes a political problem for them, not when it becomes a problem for Australian families.</para>
<para>Action on petrol pricing is long overdue, which demonstrates how out of touch this government is with ordinary Australian families. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics household expenditure survey, every 1c per litre increase in the price of petrol costs the average family 34c per week and the average couple with two dependent children 46c per week. The impact on families, especially those living in regional Australia, is absolutely enormous. Consider that 35.4 per cent of all families are struggling just to make ends meet, according to the ING Direct survey. How are these families managing to cope with petrol prices of $1.40 a litre? The reality is that many of them are not. For an average family with one car, the price increases have added at least $11 to the weekly household budget. That is based on the distance an average person drives in a week, which is around 293 kilometres. The figure is even higher when you consider that many families are running more than one car and that 293 kilometres per week is only the average.</para>
<para>This is bad enough, but if you live in regional Australia it gets even worse. In my own district around 465 people drive from Ballarat to Melbourne every day for work. In the last seven weeks alone, these people have had to fork out an extra $40,000 in fuel. When you add people from Ballarat who travel to Geelong each day—students going to Deakin University and commuters going to work—the figure over the past seven weeks alone is $51,000. The government is so focused on the big end of town that it has taken its eye off the ball as to what is happening to regional economies.</para>
<para>The price of petrol is already having an effect on regional economies like my own. The increased cost of freight is causing difficulty for our manufacturers, who are already under pressure. Regional tourism is suffering due to a decrease in the number of day trippers from Melbourne. Companies are thinking twice about locating in regional areas, because their freight costs are too high. The cost of groceries is going up. You only have to look at the media attention to realise what a massive issue this is for Australian families. At the moment it would be fair to say it is their No. 1 concern. So where is the government on this issue? Where is the self-anointed best friend of ordinary Australian families? What do those families get? They get a do-nothing response from an out-of-touch government.</para>
<para>While the Prime Minister is in New York and the petrol price skyrockets, the government sits on its hands. Where is the leadership? There has been nothing from the PM and nothing from the Treasurer as the responsible minister. They do not have a plan; they do not have a clue. The Treasurer claims that he is already in some way leading this country. How about you stop talking about what a great leader you are and actually get off your backside and do something? His statements to date on this issue show a distinct lack of leadership. How is it leadership to wring your hands like Uriah Heep and say there is nothing you can do about the price of petrol when you know there is? How is it leadership to ignore the plight of ordinary working families as their household budgets become higher each week? The government is out of touch with ordinary working families.</para>
<para>The truth of the matter is that there are things that the Treasurer could do. The Treasurer could apologise for the GST on fuel. He made a promise that the cost of petrol would not go up with the imposition of the GST—a promise that he has not been able to keep. It has gone up. Sorry is only a little word, but it takes a big man to say it. How about the Treasurer shows us what a big man he is. After saying sorry, the Treasurer could apply the competition blowtorch to the industry by strengthening the Trade Practices Act to prevent abuse of market power.</para>
<para>Furthermore, the Treasurer could have the ACCC investigate petrol prices and report every six months on price movements, particularly in regional Australia. The Treasurer could modernise the 25-year-old regulatory regime for the petrol sector to promote competition and protect independent service station operators and franchisees. The Treasurer could work to reduce our reliance on imported fuel by growing a gas based fuel industry. The Treasurer could provide a real future for the biofuels industry by providing a government fleet market for ethanol blends to set an example and help to grow the industry. There is plenty that the Treasurer could do.</para>
<para>However, yesterday, when we called for an ACCC inquiry to detail what can be done to bring petrol prices under control, the government said, ‘Another inquiry is the last thing we need. We don’t want to do anything about this.’ As we just heard again from the member for Longman, the government has stated that we have already had 44 inquiries into petrol pricing. Like most things this government says, that is only half the truth. Since 1996 there have only been three such inquiries and only one of them has been a major inquiry into fuel pricing. The Howard government cannot even be bothered to look at the possibility that something can be done.</para>
<para>Cracking down on the abuse of market power and making the market truly competitive is central to Labor’s approach. This can only be done by giving the ACCC more teeth. The government claims that everything is okay and that the ACCC already has the power. I want to mention a case that the minister referred to, where the ACCC did take petroleum companies to court under section 45 of the Trade Practices Act. The case was based on petroleum companies in my electorate. What emerged in that case—and most people do not know about this—is that for two years Ballarat people knew there was a problem. For two years Ballarat residents and former politicians were calling for the ACCC to do something about it. They were calling the government and asking that something be done.</para>
<para>We knew there was a problem in Ballarat. And what it took was an independent petrol retailer, a whistleblower, to come out and provide some evidence. If the ACCC had been regularly monitoring petrol prices, it would have had evidence to bring this case much earlier and Ballarat residents would not have had to pay the petrol prices we did. It is all right to say the ACCC has the power; this case demonstrated that it did not.</para>
<para>This can only be done if we give the ACCC more teeth, and that is exactly the point that Labor has made in this MPI. We need to encourage more refining capacity by ensuring that the major players do not abuse their market power with anticompetitive behaviour such as predatory pricing. In essence, what Labor is calling for, and what the Howard government is refusing to even consider, is modernising the 25-year-old regulatory regime for the petrol sector to promote competition and protect independent service station operators and franchisees.</para>

<para>—Labor’s reforms are practical. At the very least the Australian motoring public deserve to know that they have a government who is batting for them rather than sitting on its hands. They deserve to know that there is someone in there ensuring that the ACCC keeps the pressure on to prevent the price gouging that goes on and to at least put a counterweight in the system against the bad habits the oil companies have developed around weekends. However, John Howard and Peter Costello maintain nothing can be done. The only excuse the Howard government has for not acting on this issue is either complacency or arrogance. Australian motorists deserve better than this government. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I am pleased to speak on this MPI today in relation to petrol pricing. I concur with all speakers at this stage by saying that the price of fuel in Australia is extremely high, at record levels, and it is hurting people, it is hurting families and it is hurting the economy. Having said that, I must point out that, as the member for Longman and the Assistant Treasurer has pointed out, the member for Hunter, having raised this issue, is demonstrating why he is known as an opportunistic and cynical member of parliament. Unlike him and unlike the Labor Party, most Australians know that the current price of fuel is not something that is within the control of the Australian government. As the member for Rankin has pointed out, it is totally out of the hands of any government in the world to regulate and to suppress prices, because it is a world phenomenon driven by a number of factors.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Petrol prices are said to be too high in Australia. I point out that Australia is actually one of the lower taxing fuel countries in the world. In fact, on OECD figures, Australia is seen as the fourth lowest fuel taxing country in the world. I repeat that: it is the fourth lowest. The lowest is the United States, the second lowest is Mexico, the third lowest is Canada, then comes Australia and then comes New Zealand. But amongst those countries, in 29th place—at a very high level—is the Netherlands, which taxes fuel at 69.2 per cent, just to put it into context. So as much as fuel prices are high, as much as the opposition wishes to lay this glove on the Australian government, it is not a fact. It is not supported by any economic data or any credible economic commentator. The fact is the Labor Party in this place is scratching around for an issue and, unfortunately, they can find no traction anywhere else. As a result, they cynically find an issue which is hurting the mums and dads of Australia and the businesses of Australia, because they know if you say something long enough and loud enough, people will believe it.</para>
<para>Their argument is not supported by the facts. The fact is Australia has a free market for crude oil and refined petroleum products. This includes the freedom to import and export crude oil and refined products. Consequently, Australian prices for crude oil and refined products are set on world markets. I reconfirm: prices are set on world markets. For example, if petrol or diesel prices in Australia were lower than those prevailing overseas, Australian refineries would export these products. The result would be to drive Australian prices higher, until they equalled international prices. This disallows transport and handling costs. Conversely, if prices in Australia were higher than overseas prices, imported products would drive the prices down in Australia. In other words: ex-refinery prices tend towards equalisation in Australia and the rest of the world.</para>
<para>I do not know if it has actually gelled with people, but the fact is that Australia does produce some crude oil. However, if we were to sell that in a free market—which was deregulated by the Labor Party back in about 1988, I believe—we would then be sucking in higher priced fuel to Australia. If we were selling it into a low-cost market in Australia—in other words, artificially deflating or suppressing the price—then, in an internationally competitive environment, in would come other countries, because they could, selling fuel into Australia. This competition would then drive up the price in Australia. It also has the reverse effect. If there were lower prices overseas and Australia could sell its fuel into those markets, where we could get a better deal, we would. So there is an equalisation component.</para>
<para>There is an excerpt from an ACCC report which describes how petrol prices are determined in Australia. Although the report is dated, the essential facts still remain correct. It states that ‘the main causes of changes in fuel prices in Australia are international prices and the exchange rate between the Australian and US dollars, excise and taxes, and the level of discounting or margin support provided by oil companies’. To that end, today in Sydney the price of fuel is $1.31. I want to compare this price with the Shell Sydney 28-day average price, which is $1.25. In my electorate of Canning, which cuts across 4,500 square kilometres, the price of fuel today in various fuel stations—which I was able to gauge before I came here—was as follows. At a place called Karragullen, coincidentally the price is $1.31.5—about the same as in Sydney—in Mandurah it is $1.30.9; in Kelmscott, near my office, it is $1.31.9; in Halls Head it is $1.30.9; and in Canning Vale it is $1.28.6. Basically, there is a 3.3c variation.</para>
<para>What needs to be pointed out is the fact that the Labor Party’s argument about the government take on taxes is untrue and disingenuous. It is not borne out by the facts when we look at today’s price in Sydney and break it down into the components of who pays what and what it costs, and look at it against the Shell 28-day average price. For example, on today’s price of $1.31 the product cost is 58 per cent, or 76c. On the average price it is 55 per cent, or 69c. When we come to the excise, we know that remains the same—it is 38.1c, and that remains a constant. If the price of fuel goes up, it decreases the percentage slightly. However, the fixed price of GST on both days is nine per cent. On today’s price in Sydney that works out to be 12c. On the 28-day average price it is 11.4c.</para>
<para>It has been pointed out that the government gets a fixed amount of 38c—it is a volumetric measure. The states get the GST windfall. Every cent of this GST, increased by a rise in the price, goes to the states. I have not heard Mr Gallop in Western Australia talking about reducing the price at all. The Labor Party here have a six-point plan and they tell us that Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the UK, has a five-point plan—they have got all these different point plans—but at the end of the day none of them actually work in any way. They are just rhetoric. There are no practical measures in them and they just do not work at all.</para>
<para>Let me point out to the honourable member opposite that the people who get dudded in this whole exercise, besides the consumer, are the operators of fuel stations. As the price goes up their margin goes down. For example, on today’s inflated price of Shell petrol per litre in Sydney, they only get four per cent. Yet on the 28-day average price—where the price was $1.25 compared to $1.31, as I said—they get six per cent. So who is getting dudded around here? The consumer and the operators.</para>
<para>It has been pointed out by Graeme Samuel of the ACCC that one of the factors that are driving up the price of fuel is the production cost. He has quoted the fact that the production cost per litre has gone up by 7c, to 17c. So there appears to be some method of profiteering by the fuel companies in this exercise, which Samuel seems to believe is because we hub out of Singapore on these issues. We do not control the Singapore government or the Singapore free market; we are just a victim of them. As a result we need to understand what drives these things. When we have a shortage of fuel we know that sometimes there is an upside to it. We need to be looking at things like biofuels and ethanol. I support both the member for Kalgoorlie and the member for O’Connor. In the US at the moment, hydrogen cars are on the go. I recommend that we move towards a hydrogen economy as well. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—by leave—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the committee’s 16th report. The proposed work is intended to replace ageing and dysfunctional facilities on Willis Island to enable the Bureau of Meteorology to continue its important monitoring and research work. The estimated cost of the proposed works is $7 million. Most of the current facilities on the island were constructed in either 1950 or 1968 and are nearing the end of, or have already exceeded, their useful economic life.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Specifically, the bureau has identified a need for redeveloping the facilities, based on substantial damage to the structure of existing facilities, with some areas no longer able to be made safe for operational use; health and safety hazards for station staff, visitors and maintenance personnel as a result of the presence of asbestos and ageing service infrastructure; the considerable cost of maintaining the existing facility in such a harsh and remote location; and the need to enhance the station’s desirability as a staff posting. In order to address these deficiencies, the bureau proposes to demolish and remove existing redundant buildings and to construct new accommodation, office and storage facilities and to upgrade utilities and services. The resulting facility will support a four-person deployment and allow for a six-monthly resupply and staff changeover period, during which the facilities will be required to accommodate a further 15 persons for about three days.</para>
<para>At the public hearing into the proposed work, the committee expressed concern that the bureau had contravened the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969 by undertaking documentation and design work prior to parliamentary approval of the project. While the committee accepts the bureau’s contention that some funds had to be spent to determine the viability of the project, it did not believe that the bureau was justified in proceeding to tender before referring the work to the committee. The bureau explained that this had been the result of a misunderstanding as to when the work should be referred. The chair observed that the act is very clear on this point and emphasised the problems caused by agencies failing to refer relevant works to the committee in a timely manner. In this instance, as a consequence of the delayed referral, the bureau will be unable to complete its proposed six-month construction schedule prior to the summer cyclone season, as originally hoped.</para>
<para>The committee explored the requirement for the ongoing retention of the Willis Island meteorological station and the alternative solutions were considered. The committee was assured that the bureau had considered both the automation of the station and a wet season only staffing option but had concluded that only the year-round, fully staffed observations and monitoring program would satisfy all reporting and research requirements. Moreover, the bureau anticipates that this level of function will be necessary for at least the next 20 to 30 years.</para>
<para>Having learnt that some of the buildings earmarked for demolition contain asbestos, the committee wished to ensure that the removal of any hazardous materials would be done safely. The bureau assured the committee that asbestos would be removed from the island in accordance with relevant legislation and expressed confidence that the tenders, including shipping costs, would cover the asbestos related costs in a worst-case scenario.</para>
<para>In response to questions regarding the environmental impact of the proposed work, the bureau stated that the Department of Environment and Heritage had determined that the work did not constitute a controlled action under the terms of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The bureau explained that the successful construction contractor would be required to prepare and implement an environmental management plan for the works.</para>
<para>Noting that the bureau had originally anticipated that the construction project would be completed before the summer cyclone season, the committee wished to know how a delay in the construction schedule would impact upon both the project costs and the bureau’s operations. The bureau explained that the magnitude of any delay would depend upon the severity of the coming wet season but anticipated that some excess costs could be absorbed by budgetary contingency provisions. The bureau assured the committee that the Willis Island radar system, which is pivotal in providing forewarning of cyclones approaching the North Queensland coast, will be operational before the cyclone season.</para>
<para>The committee undertook a close examination of the project costs and, given the remoteness of the work site, was especially interested in the costs associated with shipping and logistics. The committee also noted that the cost estimate included a number of as yet undetermined items. The committee recommended that the bureau supply it with cost details of these items when such information becomes available. Having given detailed consideration to the proposal, the committee recommends that the construction of facilities for the Bureau of Meteorology on Willis Island proceed at the estimated cost of $7 million. I would like to thank those who assisted the Public Works Committee with the public hearing and my committee colleagues. I commend the report to the House.</para>

<para>—by leave—I concur with the comments made by the member for Pearce with respect to the project on Willis Island. There is no doubt that there were some early concerns about the way in which the Bureau of Meteorology referred the matter—and these have been properly attended to in the comments made by the member for Pearce. It is important to note that this is a $7 million project and therefore attracts the provisions of the Public Works Act 1969. However, I think I represent the view of many members of the committee when I say that there has to be a review of the threshold amount of matters referred to the Public Works Committee.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>There is no doubt that we have a very heavy schedule. In fact, if you compare the work undertaken by this committee with that of many others, you will find that the number of public hearings and inquiries is great. This imposes certain strains upon the time and resources of members and, indeed, the secretariat. I raise that because the committee has asked the government to consider amending the Public Works Act to raise the threshold in order for us to look at works of significant expense—and that issue is under some consideration by government.</para>
<para>The government should also look at lease arrangements—these are not exactly bricks and mortar projects—worth tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars, which are not being properly examined by parliament. The government would do well to consider whether the threshold should be raised so as not to attract smaller projects. At the same time, so as to ensure that the Public Works Committee examines a greater proportion of Commonwealth expenditure, the government should look at allowing the committee to properly review lease arrangements, which have increased over the last 20 or so years, in terms of the way in which the Commonwealth decides to enter into lease arrangements with other parties to provide the services it requires. I support the comments made by the member for Pearce, but I wish to add to them by asking the government to properly consider the particular matters I have raised today.</para>

<para>—Although the <inline ref="R2313">Copyright Amendment (Film Directors’ Rights) Bill 2005</inline> is a small bill, it carries a great deal of symbolic importance. With the passage of this bill, Australian law will provide economic intellectual property rights to film directors for the first time. This will recognise that directors are essential creative contributors to the film industry and that, as with other creators, their creativity should be rewarded through copyright law.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Given the cultural and economic contribution that film directors make to Australia, Labor is pleased to support this bill. The bill includes directors of non-commissioned films in the definition of ‘maker’ of films for the purposes of section 98 of the Copyright Act. However, it then limits the effect of this change to the statutory scheme for the payment of royalties for the retransmission of free-to-air broadcasts. That is the scheme outlined in part VC of the Copyright Act. As a result, although it carries important symbolic value, it is a very limited change in practical terms.</para>
<para>In terms of the history of this issue, the practical modesty of the reform makes it remarkable that the government took such a long time to make good this commitment. The question of whether film directors should be included in the retransmission scheme first arose in 1999, when parliament was considering the digital agenda reforms which introduced the scheme. The House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, of which I was deputy chair, unanimously recommended that film directors should receive remuneration under the scheme. When the digital agenda bill was being debated in this House, Labor moved an amendment to give effect to that unanimous recommendation, but the government opposed it. We had planned to move the amendment again in the Senate, but the government announced at the last minute that it would conduct a special consultation process to consider the issue. In the interests of getting the rest of the digital agenda through, we accepted this compromise, expecting the government to make good its commitment. The then Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston, told the Senate:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... as a matter of priority in September the government will be calling for submissions on the issue of film directors’ copyright. It is hoped that any amendments arising from the review will be ready to be introduced by the end of this year.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Unfortunately, that was in August 2000—over five years ago. The government have taken an astounding five years to produce this very limited but, nonetheless, important symbolic change. Given that they could have been guaranteed bipartisan support at any stage in those five years to get this change through, this delay seems to us a sign of nothing but pure incompetence.</para>
<para>Mind you, while it has taken the government five years to finally get around to this reform, the Liberal Party have been more than happy to promise it in both of the elections that we have had in that time. We have heard of the core and non-core promises, but this is an example of a third category of promises—the ‘when we can be bothered, if we remember to’ promise. The irony is that, after five years of allegedly consulting, the government did not seem to consult anybody much. The Screen Producers Association of Australia told the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee that they believed there had been a ‘serious failure on the government’s part to communicate and consult widely with the industry’ before introducing this bill. The Australian Writers Guild made a similar observation, saying that there has been a ‘complete lack of comprehensive industry consultation on the issue of director’s copyright’.</para>
<para>The first time any of the stakeholders got a chance to have real input was when Labor pushed for a Senate committee inquiry on the issue. So the consultation phase, promised to start in September 2000, never happened and the bill, promised before the end of 2000, did not see the light of day until 2005. This has been a case of quite extraordinary mismanagement.</para>
<para>Nonetheless, let us look at the proposed reform. While it has taken five long—and we say wasted—years, I am pleased that we are finally here debating this bill. As I have said, Labor will support the bill, as we believe that film directors should have their creative roles in the Australian film industry recognised through economic rights. By including directors of non-commissioned works in the retransmission scheme, the bill will give these directors an additional chip at the bargaining table. Copyright is assignable by contract, so a change like the one proposed really goes to the default position—the position where bargaining begins. In altering this default position, the bill recognises that directors do have a creative input into films. As with other creators, that input should be recognised through copyright law and through a system that makes sure that there are sufficient incentives to be creative.</para>
<para>There are many reasons that we should be concerned to provide the incentive structure to encourage and support creative directors. Along with others in the film industry, Australian directors over the last century have made a significant contribution to the development of our distinctive Australian culture. Through their work, they reflect our society, history and culture. They have also kept us entertained with Australian stories and, of course, Australia’s unique sense of humour.</para>
<para>Aside from these intangible benefits, the Australian film industry is an increasingly important export industry. As communications technology transmits higher quality video at faster speeds, Australian film increasingly competes in a global market. Indeed, one of the strongest rationales for including directors in the retransmission scheme is that it will help our directors receive reciprocal royalties from retransmissions of their work in other countries, which gives directors economic rights, principally in the large European market. This is a stream of export revenue which can be tapped to support our directors.</para>
<para>Although the internationalisation of the film industry is increasing in pace, the trend has been with us for some time and has already helped several Australian directors achieve international recognition. In what is far from a complete list, I think of people such as Gillian Armstrong, Peter Weir, George Miller and Baz Luhrmann or, more recently, John Polson and Cate Shortland.</para>
<para>I suspect that this bill will not do much to help those directors who have already landed on their feet. Their proven talent is no doubt their best bargaining chip. But it will help the next crop. It will also help the many less famous directors who make the documentaries, animations, miniseries, movies and other film products that are entertaining and educating us every day.</para>
<para>I know that it has been a concern among others in the film industry that the extension of economic rights to directors diminishes the recognition of other rights’ holders, like producers and writers. I do not believe that this is the case. Film, unlike some other creative pursuits, is inherently a collaborative art. It involves joint creative effort and the law should reflect that.</para>
<para>Labor acknowledges the concern raised by the Australian Writers Guild that screenwriters should also be considered owners of copyright in films for the purposes of the retransmission scheme. We support the recommendation of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee that the government consult with relevant stakeholders on this change. We hope that it will not take another five years to get that done.</para>
<para>The question has to be asked: could economic rights have gone further? The Australian Screen Directors Association, as I have said, would have liked this bill to go further. They would have liked some provision to include directors in future statutory royalty schemes. Labor believes that this is impractical at this stage, as we cannot make rules today that will govern schemes in the future—schemes that do not yet exist. I can give a commitment on behalf of Labor, however, that we will certainly consider the inclusion of film directors in any statutory scheme that is proposed in the future. One of the great benefits of the current bill is that it should mean that film directors are brought to the table whenever a new scheme is being considered.</para>
<para>The Australian Screen Directors Association also wanted to see film directors included in the educational copying and communication licensing scheme in part VA. They argue that it is inconsistent to recognise the creative contribution of directors in part VC but not in part VA. They also argue that it is discriminatory, as other creative contributors such as composers and writers are included in part VA of the scheme.</para>
<para>On their face, we find these arguments compelling. The film directors have raised a legitimate issue and it deserves to be explored, in consultation with other stakeholders. As far as Labor is concerned, this bill should not be considered as having closed the book on directors’ rights. Copyright law is a difficult area of policy, because we have to carefully balance the sometimes competing interests of directors, other creative collaborators like writers and producers, and of course consumers. Labor is committed to working with the film industry to pursue any improvements to copyright law that ensure that the incentives are right, the costs are fairly balanced, the export opportunities are maximised and that the public’s interest is properly taken into account.</para>
<para>Film directors are crucial contributors to Australia’s cultural and intellectual life. There is no doubt that their contribution to film is a creative one. For this reason, we believe that they are entitled to share the incentives that our system of copyright provides to creators. Although we would have preferred to see this change occur five years ago, we are pleased that the bill is before the House today, and we are pleased to provide Labor’s support.</para>

<para>—The significance of the <inline ref="R2313">Copyright Amendment (Film Directors’ Rights) Bill 2005</inline> is perhaps essentially a statement of principle, as a recognition in a small but nonetheless tangible way of the creative input of directors: those people who, in the midst of the scores of others involved in the making of a motion picture, have to provide the artistic leadership and the creative command that pull it all together to make the cinematic art. Section 22(4)(b) of the Copyright Act provides:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">… the maker of the cinematograph film is the person by whom the arrangements necessary for the making of the film were undertaken.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That language is derived from the United Kingdom legislation which was the consequence of the recommendations of the Gregory committee in 1952. The committee observed that what this language had in mind was ‘the entrepreneur’—if the word is not too old-fashioned—‘under whose care the labours of many contributors are brought to a successful issue’. The entrepreneur, as artist, is an interesting concept, which is not extended to other forms of creative ownership. The patron who organises all the necessities of life for a painter, or a writer, does not by reason of those logistical efforts become the owner of the copyright in the works created. For films, the owner has always been taken, therefore, to be the producer, who typically pulls the whole enterprise together but, who, most importantly, marries the financial resources necessary for the film, together with the artistic leadership in the form of the director. Of course, a lot of directors are producers, too. The artistic temperament does not preclude great logistical and organisational skill, but the functions are nonetheless separate ones.</para>
<para>Section 86 describes the copyright in a movie as consisting, as one would expect, of essentially the right to copy that film or to cause it to be communicated to the public. In 2000 the parliament amended the Copyright Act to introduce part VC, which is designed to enable pay television operators to rebroadcast simultaneously free-to-air channels. This was an obvious and necessary reform which meant that subscribers to pay television services would be able to watch both the free and the pay channels through the one service. A statutory scheme was established whereby the retransmitting pay television operators would pay a fee—to be settled by the Copyright Tribunal—to the collecting society in the case of films, for screen rights. The effect of the bill therefore is to amend section 98 to provide that, where the film is not a commissioned film, the maker of the film—hitherto meaning the producer only—shall include a reference to each director of the film. The amendments, however, provide that, if a person becomes an owner of the copyright by reason of this director provision, it applies only ‘so far as the copyright consists of the right to include the film in a retransmission of a free-to-air broadcast’.</para>
<para>The term ‘retransmission’ is defined to mean a retransmission to which part VC applies, which is of course the part which applies to the retransmission of free-to-air channels on pay TV services. In some respects therefore, the declaration that the director is a co-owner of copyright in a film is, as the member for Gellibrand observed a moment ago, a symbolic one. Unlike the producer who has all of the section 86 rights of a copyright owner, the director declared to be an owner by this bill has no rights other than to receive a share of the retransmission fees if his film is, firstly, broadcast on a free-to-air channel and, secondly, retransmitted pursuant to part VC of the principal act by a pay TV operator.</para>
<para>The director has the right to transfer his or her interest under this legislation, and one would expect that in most cases the director’s rights would be the subject of a contract and that his or her participation in the copyright of the film—if any—would be determined by that contract. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which considered this bill, was told by Mr Geoffrey Brown of the Screen Producers Association of Australia that only one or two per cent of Australian films were not commissioned ‘since directors waive most of their rights under the terms of their contractual arrangements with producers’. This commercial reality underlines again the essentially symbolic nature of the legislation. Reading the evidence given to the Senate committee, including that from the Attorney-General’s Department, one is struck by the consistent conclusion that the bill will have, in the Senate committee’s words, ‘a negligible impact for the current copyright arrangements for producers, because a director will never work without being in an employee relationship with a producer’.</para>
<para>The principal controversy attending the bill appears to have been the government’s decision not to confer on directors a similar share in the existing educational copying statutory licensing scheme in part VA of the principal act. Notwithstanding that the copyright ownership rights conferred on directors under the legislation are modest indeed, the screen producers expressed themselves as opposed to the bill. Mr Brown, to whom I have just referred, told the Senate committee that the bill introduces uncertainty to the investment climate in the industry. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Producers have to guarantee to their investors that the copyright in a cinematographic work is clear and unencumbered, that there is a clear chain of title, to create the confidence for investors to invest in the film. Once you start splintering that into copyright to individual creators ... you start to lose that confidence.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Given the limited rights granted under this bill, Mr Brown’s criticism reads as unduly apocalyptic. A better argument, from his viewpoint, may be the contention that this would be the thin edge of the wedge and that further rights, especially statutory rights, could be granted. The bill, the producers would argue in that case, creates a precedent from which other legislative changes may follow. Dr Matthew Rimmer of the Australian National University, in his very scholarly submission to the Senate committee, observes—correctly in my opinion—that the answer to the thin edge of the wedge or floodgates argument put by Mr Brown is:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... that there should be clearer rules as to joint authorship in respect of a copyright work—not that we should deny the possibility of joint authorship altogether.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I note, in the context of Dr Rimmer, that the member for Gellibrand, in her criticism of the government, seemed to make two critiques of the government’s preparation of this legislation or carriage of this legislation which were contradictory. On the one hand she said that the government had taken far too long to introduce it: after all, part VC had been introduced in 2000 so why had it taken five years to bring this bill into the House? On the other hand she said that the government had failed to consult and that one may then ask what had been happening over all those years. The reality is that the government was consulting. It is true that the producers and the Australian Writers Guild complained to the Senate committee about a lack of consultation—and the member for Gellibrand pointed that out. But she would have given the House a fairer appreciation of what had transpired before the Senate committee had she referred to the submissions from other parties before the committee, in particular that of Dr Rimmer whose contribution, as I said earlier, was a very scholarly one and an extremely valuable one. I will read what he said on this point in his submission. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... the debate over film directors’ copyright has been an exhaustive process, with much special pleading by all sides. The various stakeholders have all had ample opportunities in the past six years in which to address this issue. There certainly has been a comprehensive consultation about film directors’ copyright.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Dr Rimmer was not an interested stakeholder: he was not a producer, he was not a director, he was not a writer. With respect to the member for Gellibrand, I think it would have been fair of her to draw that objective appreciation to the attention of the House before she presented her highly critical assessment of the government’s carriage or preparation of this legislation.</para>
<para>The Writers Guild, predictably, opposed the bill unless similar rights could be given to writers. The Senate committee’s sole recommendation—other than that the Senate should pass the bill—was that writers be included as co-owners of copyright for the purpose of sharing part VC retransmission revenues. The writers’ case for inclusion in this bill appears to me a very strong one. After all, it was only in 2000 that the Copyright Amendment (Moral Rights) Billwas passed by this parliament. It granted to the authors of literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works and cinematographic films certain moral rights—essentially, the right to have their authorship acknowledged, or attributed in a reasonably prominent way, and the right to ensure that the work’s artistic integrity is maintained. For the purpose of the moral rights legislation, the author of a film is defined as the maker of the film, which is in turn defined as the principal director, principal producer and principal screenwriter of that film.</para>
<para>There was also some criticism of the bill because it allows directors to sign away their part VC rights—as undoubtedly almost all of them will do in accordance with their contracts with the producers. The notion of a nontransferable property right does not sit comfortably with our legal system and, certainly from our side of politics, it is difficult to see any reason why a person should not be able to deal freely with their own property. Given the global nature of the cinema industry, it is well for the House to consider whether this bill adds to international harmony or complexity.</para>
<para>The countries of the European Union have traditionally taken a different view of the ownership of the copyright in a film. Rather than the entrepreneur, the organiser, the producer, who pulls it all together being the owner of the copyright—which is the view taken by the common law countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, Canada and New Zealand—the Europeans have given directors moral and economic ownership rights. This view of the director as auteur is distinctly different from our own, but it is gaining ground because of the influence of the European Union. In 1996 the United Kingdom’s laws, in order to comply with European laws, were changed to provide that the director and the producer are deemed to be joint authors and copyright owners of a film. An employed director’s rights vest in the producer, and a nonemployee director can, of course, contract to transfer his rights to the producer—and most do. The UK maintains a statutory scheme—not unlike our own scheme for rental rights—and the directors have a nontransferable right to remuneration from that scheme.</para>
<para>One submission to the Senate committee, by Kimberlee Wetherall, claimed that the bill creates a uniquely—and thus discordantly—Australian position, because, while we will recognise producers as owners of the copyright, as do the United Kingdom and the United States, we will add directors only for certain purposes. Further, she said, unlike the United States we will give directors moral rights—of course, we have given directors moral rights—but, again, unlike the United States, not confer a concept of co-authorship where the film is regarded as a joint work. The US position, as in so many other areas of law, is essentially unique, even idiosyncratic.</para>
<para>It is difficult to see how Australia can reconcile its law perfectly with that of any other country unless we were to copy that of another country. Of course, it used to be the case that our copyright laws were essentially a facsimile of the United Kingdom’s. The rest of the world has moved in so many different ways—and the differences are, in so many ways, very subtle—that it is hard to see how Australia can harmonise its laws with a copyright world that is becoming increasingly, often subtly, less harmonious.</para>
<para>On balance, I believe that the bill improves our position in a global context. It is better to give directors some recognition than to give them none. As the explanatory memorandum notes, the Australian Screen Directors Association has contended that it has had difficulty negotiating for recognition for Australian directors under authorship schemes in Europe due to the lack of reciprocal payments in Australia. A fair criticism of the bill would be that it is a gesture only—that directors will simply contract away their rights to the producers. That may be so—in which case the concerns of the producers ring rather hollow.</para>
<para>The critics of the bill may find, therefore, that this legislation will be an arrangement which, from their point of view, fails in theory but works perfectly well in practice. Time will tell. When the House returns to the subject matter of this bill, it would do well, in my view, to give very serious consideration to including, as the Senate committee recommended, writers as co-owners for the purposes of participating in the statutory scheme under part VC of the principal act. I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para>—If the member for Wentworth was disappointed by the member for Gellibrand’s comments on the <inline ref="R2313">Copyright Amendment (Film Directors’ Rights) Bill 2005</inline> then he will not be terribly happy with my comments either. My expectations of the government when it comes to this essential industry, our audiovisual industry, are very high. I expect the government to take a leadership role, above the sectional interests of the industry itself, and lead this industry into the vibrant future it deserves. The bill brings about some very minor changes. It is true that they may be symbolic, but they are associated with one of Australia’s most important industries and one of the fastest-growing markets in the world and they relate to one tiny aspect, very small amounts of money and very few directors under very narrow circumstances.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Let us look at exactly what the bill does. Directors in Australia currently have no economic rights in a film; they have moral rights, but no economic rights. This bill gives directors copyright in the case of retransmission through free-to-air, but in very few cases—for example, it only applies to uncommissioned films and it is estimated that only one to two per cent of all films are uncommissioned. The vast majority are commissioned and will not be affected by this bill. It is about negligible amounts of money, for a very small number of people, in a scheme that has not yet been established, yet there has been considerable debate about it within the industry. It is extremely important to directors because it might be a precedent, it is extremely important to producers because it might be a precedent and it is extremely important to writers because they are not included in what might be a precedent. But each of those three groups has a different view. The directors hope it is a precedent, the producers hope it is not and the writers hope it might be. None of them is really concerned about the bill itself, because the financial impact will be quite negligible, but all are concerned about the possible precedents being established here.</para>
<para>All parties in the industry have had something to say. As I said before, as you would expect, the Australian audiovisual industry is well represented by these associations. They are all effective and all argue in the interests of their own constituents, as they should. The argument here, once again, is about how the pie should be cut up. We are arguing about the slices of pie and who gets what slice—or, more accurately, in this case we are arguing about the crumbs that fall off the slice of pie as it is passed from one person to another. This is essentially a bill about the crumbs—very minor stuff—and has been under discussion now for five years.</para>
<para>When the <inline ref="R910">Copyright Amendment (Digital Agenda) Bill 2000</inline> was passed, a scheme was introduced whereby subscription television providers could retransmit free-to-air broadcasts without infringing copyright on condition that royalties were paid to the copyright owners. That is quite a standard thing in other creative sectors. At the time, though, the Australian Screen Directors Association lobbied that film directors should be included as copyright owners in films for the purposes of the retransmission scheme. This was part of a broader ongoing campaign to have directors sharing in the copyrights of films. Currently the producers of films are the only default copyright owners. The government did not respond at the time, but they did promise to review the issue and present another bill later in 2000. The <inline ref="R2313">Copyright Amendment (Film Directors’ Rights) Bill 2005</inline> is the result—five years later—and it is still unclear whether this is a precedent or whether it is a sop for directors who were promised something in 2000.</para>
<para>We are talking here about crumbs. We are arguing about slices of the pie when really we should be talking about the size of the pie. Whereas most of the industry associations within the film industry have to argue about the allocation of the pie slices, the government has the capacity to step above that and provide leadership in the industry and talk about how to make the pie bigger or even how to build a bigger bakery. The industry around the world is enormous and the potential for growth in the Australian industry is absolutely huge. In 1999 global trade in services accounted for 20 per cent of cross-border trade and 60 per cent of global output. In 1994 output from the information communications sector was valued at $US1.5 trillion, with media forming 21 per cent of that.</para>
<para>The industry has been growing at twice the US growth rate since 1977. It is a massive industry growing at a rapid rate. By all means let us talk about how producers, directors and writers divide up the pie, but let us talk, more importantly, about how we build a bigger, more vibrant industry. Let us talk about the barriers that stop our industry from growing quickly. Let us talk about the confusion between rules and regulations in different territories, complexities of coproduction, companies trying to operate in several tax regimes through several government funding models and under several copyright regimes, with private investors with their own needs and uncertainty in our own market in the interpretation of tax laws.</para>
<para>Underlying the difficulties that our film industry face is the international context in which films are made and distributed territory by territory, with many partners, other governments and private investors, each with complex rules, regulations and customs of their own. Our industry is drowning in complexity and production is falling. The deficit in the balance of trade for Australia in royalties arising from imports and exports of cinema films has continued to grow in the last 15 years. The value of exports of audiovisual products rose from $105 million in 1987-88 to $152 million in 2002-03. That is a 50 per cent increase over some 15 years. The deficit grew from negative $245 million to negative $528 million—that is an increase of 100 per cent in the same 15 years.</para>
<para>Meanwhile, Australia continued to go backwards. Imports of film, television and digital products whose IP ownership is offshore continues to outstrip exports. The longer this continues the more impoverished our industry will become. Australia’s production of its own films is well and truly in decline. In 2004 Australia produced 16 films—down from 28 in 1994. It is interesting to look at the range of countries that outproduced us quite significantly. The obvious countries are there: India, USA, Japan and China. India produced 946 films and China produced 212. Spain beat us with 133 films, Bangladesh with 90, South Korea with 82, Brazil with 81, Argentina with 78, Mexico with 54, the Philippines with 53, Turkey with 27, Pakistan with 25, Egypt with 25, Netherlands with 24, Taiwan with 24, Malaysia with 22, Greece with 22, Hungary with 21, Romania with 21, Poland with 17 and Indonesia with 17. Australia produced 16 films.</para>
<para>We are well down on the world production list. Australia is one of the great talents when it comes to film production. We have a highly creative population and we do excellent work. The domestic film share of the total national box office has been in decline in Australia. It was eight per cent in the year 2000 and only one per cent in 2004—significantly lower than many of our competitor countries. The average number of cinema admissions per capita in Australia is about average at 4.5. That is slightly up on the statistics for 1993, but the growth has been static, at best, since 1999.</para>
<para>Federal government appropriations have fallen. They were at their lowest in 1998-99, with the greatest variation in appropriations over the 11-year period attributed to the formation of the commercial television production fund, with the largest single increase—22 per cent—coming in 1995-96, the year in which the agency was established. The largest decrease—12 per cent—occurred in the year the fund was terminated, in 1998-99. Appropriations for the Australian Film Commission fell steadily from $68 million in 1991-92 to $49 million in 1996-97. They remained almost static at $48 million to $50 million between 1997 and 2002 and finally rose again in 2002-03 to $58 million—still $10 million short of the peak in 1991-92.</para>
<para>In the face of that, in the face of the potential and the reality for the Australian industry, let us talk about the audiovisual industry and how proposed changes to media ownership, for example, will impact on the development of our industry. We hear the government talk about changes to media ownership, but we rarely hear them talk about the effect that will have, positive or negative, on the development of our audiovisual production industry. Let us talk about changing technologies. Again, we hear the government talk about digital television—and there are many reviews into that at the moment—and shifts in consumer preferences through broadband and downloading through handheld devices, but how will these impact on the development of our industry? When those changes come to fruition will we have a stronger production industry? Will we be a stronger exporter or will we be an even greater net importer? Let us talk about market failure. Let us talk about the fact that in any creative industry there is a need for a very strong scene where mistakes are made, where people come together and break apart, where people try new ideas—many of which fail—and the extreme unlikelihood that any commercial company will invest in such a high-risk innovative product.</para>
<para>Let us talk about the ABC and how the role that the ABC had as a leading innovator and trainer of our audiovisual industry has now been lost, with the ABC producing very little drama and not playing a significant role even as we approach a change in form from analog to digital. Let us talk about all the issues that affect the rest of the country—skills, export, R&amp;D and innovation. The film industry is in exactly the same boat, only in much rougher seas than most, and is still ignored. I rarely hear the government talk about the community, common stories and the role of the cultural sector in providing common views and stories for our population. Let us talk about vertical integration and convergence. Let us see the effect of transnational media corporations—big corporations that have swallowed production companies including large Hollywood studios—and the potential for anti-competitive behaviour when broadcasters and distribution media of all kinds become owners of production houses or when producers of content buy up the means of distribution.</para>
<para>Let us see the government address the effects of bilateral trade agreements, rather than multinational agreements, with exemptions negotiated on a case-by-case basis. This creates incredible uncertainty and is a nightmare for producers negotiating coproductions across international borders. Let us see the government acknowledge the difficulties experienced in gaining access to high-bandwidth telecommunications—the capacity needed to transfer and exchange the knowledge products of the industry—and the evidence that costs are much higher in Australia than they are in the rest of the world and that that is holding back our industry. Let us talk about the potential of that industry. Let us hear the government talk about the growing world market and the extraordinary talent that we have, how they will work to make sure that there are flow-on effects for our industry and that Australia’s creative product in the world benefits its image and its tourism industry. Let us hear the government talk about the intellectual property market globally and how our creative sector can become a major player in that world market. Let us hear something from this government.</para>
<para>In the past few weeks we have seen the government being driven by ideology on the sale of Telstra. We have seen them fixated on the path of privatisation to the extent that they do not know any more where that path is leading. We have seen a similar fixation on deregulating the labour market—so fixed on that belief, so focused on the path that they have not looked up to see where that path is going. When it comes to the audiovisual industry we do not see a path or a plan at all, let alone a horizon or a view of what the world might look like beyond that horizon. True, in recent years there have been some reports. There was a paper from the Prime Minister’s Science, Engineering and Innovation Council which had some excellent suggestions and quite a good analysis of the problems within the industry. We have had <inline font-style="italic">From reel to unreal: future opportunities for Australia’s film, animation, special effects and electronic games industries</inline> from the Standing Committee on Communications, Information Technology and the Arts; we have had the Gonski Review of Commonwealth Assistance to the Film Industry several years ago; and we have had some action with the promise to extend the Film Licensed Investment Company scheme immediately prior to the last election with some measures in the 2004 budget.</para>
<para>Nevertheless, it is my view that the government is not strongly supportive of this industry; that its work over the last few years has left this industry struggling with massive technological changes, massive changes in the financial structure of the industry and an extremely complex and convoluted international regulatory framework in which to operate. I urge the government to show leadership here, to engage the industry in the development of a real plan that will ensure a real future for this extremely important and highly skilled industry and to maximise the return to this country from the work of our creative talent. There are enormous potential benefits to Australia, both economic and cultural. We have had a five-year wait for this bill that deals with crumbs, but we really cannot wait another five years for this government to develop a real plan for this sector.</para>

<para>—It is a pleasure to speak on the <inline ref="R2313">Copyright Amendment (Film Directors’ Rights) Bill 2005</inline> because it recognises, for the first time, the right of directors to a share of the copyright in their films. The copyright protection of the directors’ creativity of entrepreneurial input will secure their economic and intellectual property. This bill will give directors a right to a share of royalties with producers when their films are shown on pay TV channels. Given the emergence of pay TV channels in our modern times, this has to be a very positive step.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The bill delivers a commitment made by our government in the Strengthening Australian Arts policy for the 2004 election. It is the product of consultation with the main stakeholders. The bill builds on the government’s amendments to the Copyright Act 1968 in 2000, which gave directors moral rights in their films. The bill creates the opportunity for directors to claim royalties for use of their films under remuneration schemes in the European Union countries. European directors will now have reciprocal entitlements to remuneration in Australia.</para>
<para>In discussing this bill, it is worth reflecting more broadly on the film sector. The government recognises the importance of a viable local film and television industry for the many reasons just outlined by the member for Parramatta. The sector not only improves and makes a great contribution to our economy but is a very significant part of our cultural life. As a whole, the Australian film and television industry contributes some $2.1 billion annually to GDP and employs more than 25,000 people. I am aware, from a recent visit to China—I will talk about this in more detail shortly—that the Chinese industry use our postproduction facilities and have been doing so for some time. They are also very interested in our locations—the unique Australian landscape and the cities. The government is doing a lot to support the industry and to make sure that it continues to grow.</para>
<para>The film industry provides the creative opportunity to tell our stories in our way. The industry also fosters a very wide range of talents and skills—from directors to screenwriters, producers, actors, sound engineers, set designers and makers and camera operators. These are just a few of the different skills required of all those involved in producing a film. As I said, the government recognises the importance of the industry and provides a range of support to the sector to ensure its long-term sustainability. Without government intervention there would be few local voices on our screens.</para>
<para>In the 2004 election campaign, the government announced a film policy: ‘A World Class Australian Film Industry’. This package of measures was confirmed in the 2005-06 budget and is worth $88 million over four years. As a result, total direct funding for film in 2005-06 is at a high of almost $160 million. The package is a carefully balanced strategic intervention and takes a whole-of-industry approach. It will strengthen our film and television sector through a combination of increases in direct support to our film agencies and by making the film sector more attractive to private investors. It is important that we get the copyright laws right so that we protect the intellectual property of directors.</para>
<para>A focus of our film package is private investment. The Australian film industry needs a greater level of private sector support. Private investment is an important complement to direct funding by government. In Australia, film and television financing is usually a combination of investment from the marketplace, government funding and private investors.</para>
<para>The parliament recently enacted the Film Licensed Investment Company Act 2005, which extends the Film Licensed Investment Company scheme in accord with our election commitment. The extended FLIC scheme seeks to encourage the private sector investor back to film and television. On Friday, 12 August, Senator Rod Kemp, the Minister for the Arts and Sport—a very active minister who works very hard to promote the whole of the arts and sports portfolio; I know he has had a particular interest in film and done much to support that sector—called for applications from Australian companies for the new FLIC licence.</para>
<para>Under the FLIC scheme, in 2005 a company will be granted a licence to raise $10 million in concessional capital in both 2005-06 and 2006-07. This will inject up to $20 million in additional funds into the local sector, while investors in the FLIC scheme will benefit from a 100 per cent up-front tax deduction on shares purchased. The government will also soon be calling for submissions to a review of divisions 10B and 10BA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and has announced that it will amend the act with regard to the interaction of the foreign loss quarantining rules. Both of these measures were sought by the sector and were part of the consultation process.</para>
<para>The Australian government is working in other ways to stimulate our local film sector. To encourage and facilitate cooperative film-making, Australia and China have been negotiating a bilateral film co-production treaty. The member for Parramatta is right when she says that there has been immense growth of the film industry globally. I was in China with the minister at the time that the discussions on the bilateral film co-production treaty were going on. I am trying to recall the figures, but we met with the minister responsible for the film industry in China. She told us that China would be making in the order of 257 movies this year and would be opening around 160 or 170 digital cinemas across China. Their film industry is very vibrant, but we have to remember that China has a population of 1.3 billion people against Australia’s 20-odd million. So there is a slight difference.</para>
<para>I listened with interest to the member for Parramatta’s comments about the numbers of films being made. Success cannot always be simply linked to quantity. One of the great features of the Australian film industry is that we produce very high-quality film and television programs. That is recognised around the world. Many of our directors, actors, musicians—people writing music for screen—and many other people involved in the industry have been recognised and awarded. It is the quality of our films that is critical, and we need to maintain that high quality and high reputation within the sector. It is that high quality of work and that high reputation that bring in the other work that helps to sustain the whole industry—the post-production work, for example.</para>
<para>Australia and China have a history of working together. It is my privilege to have been, now for the second term of parliament, elected by my colleagues as the chair of the Australia-China Parliamentary Friendship Group. As such, I have had the great privilege of travelling to China fairly frequently. As I said, in July this year I had the benefit of being there with the Minister for the Arts and Sport, Senator Rod Kemp. He was very active in seeking a bilateral film cooperation treaty. We are hopeful that we will be able to agree on a text later this year.</para>
<para>As I said, our countries have a history of working together on internationally renowned film projects such as <inline font-style="italic">Hero</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">House of Flying Daggers</inline>. In both of these films we did some post-production work here in Australia, if my memory serves me correctly. The agreement between Australia and China represents a great opportunity for the Australian film industry to collaborate with Chinese film-makers and to access the film market of the world’s most populous nation.</para>
<para>There are tremendous opportunities for us, including promoting our own unique culture, telling our own stories in our own way and promoting the unique Australian landscape. The member for Parramatta mentioned the tourism aspect of film-making. A lot of people do not realise it, but when movies like <inline font-style="italic">Matrix</inline>, for example, are made in Sydney they are not made by an Australian company but they use Sydney as a set. That promotes Australia internationally. The unique Australian landscape is also of interest to the Chinese. They think it is pretty fascinating. There are lots of opportunities for us to highlight and promote the benefits of Australian talent, the Australian landscape and the Australian post-production services to overseas film-makers.</para>
<para>As I said, last month I was in China when Senator Kemp was there and when this treaty was discussed with Chinese officials. Both Australia and China are very enthusiastic about this treaty. I can assure the member for Parramatta that our minister—and he is a very good minister; he is very committed to the arts, very involved and very knowledgeable—was constantly talking about the brilliance of our Australian film industry and the brilliance of the talent that we have. He was taking every opportunity to promote the Australian film industry.</para>
<para>Australia and China are cooperating in other ways. On 10 September, the Australian Film Commission, together with the Australian embassy and the consulate-generals in China, will launch another series of Australian film festivals. There was a very successful Australian film festival last year. I want to take the opportunity to mention Sean Kelly, who is the cultural ambassador in China, working in the embassy in Beijing. A lot of the credit has to go to him and his department for the promotion and development of these very successful film festivals—of course, along with the Australian Film Commission and the Australian Ambassador to China, Dr Thomas.</para>
<para>During his visit, Senator Kemp was able to announce that the martial arts superstar Jackie Chan will be the international patron of the 2005 Australian film festival series. We know that Jackie Chan has had a long and very close association with Australia. I am sure that he will be an excellent patron and will again provide a great opportunity for us to promote the Australian film industry in the best possible way. Australia will present 10 leading Australian films from the past five years in festivals in Beijing in September—this month; in fact, it has happened—in Shanghai in November and in Guangzhou in December. Last year, audiences totalling nearly 10,000 people enjoyed another 10 top Australian films—as I said, in the first-ever Australian film festival held in China.</para>
<para>It has been a great promotion. Chinese people love good Aussie films. I had an opportunity to meet one of the Chinese leaders here a few months ago—I think last year. He was telling me about his grandchild, who enjoys Australian TV series. After his visit, I sent him a note to say how pleased I was to meet him and a copy of <inline font-style="italic">Bananas in Pyjamas</inline> for his four-year-old grandson. During a later visit to China, I had occasion to meet him. He said that his grandson thoroughly enjoys <inline font-style="italic">Bananas in Pyjamas</inline>, even though it is in English, and that it makes him laugh a lot.</para>
<para>As I said, Australian films are popular. The Chinese love Aussie films. Our minister is doing a fantastic job—as are our Australian film sector and the embassy—in promoting Australian films. The Jackie Chan announcement has created considerable interest in the 2005 Australian film festival, which indicates yet again the complete commitment of the Australian government to the Australian film and television industry.</para>

<para>—I rise principally to support the <inline ref="R2313">Copyright Amendment (Film Directors’ Rights) Bill 2005</inline>. It is a very small and a very belated step but it is a step in the right direction. As the shadow minister, the member for Gellibrand, said in her remarks, it is a measure more noted for its symbolism than for its substance; nevertheless, it is welcome as a step in the right direction. That is the principal matter to which I wish to address myself, but I would like to begin by responding to some of the remarks made by the member for Pearce. I agreed with a lot of what she said about the potential with our cooperation with China and those various things. I wished to say that before I went to the points with which I disagree, because I do not want to suggest that I disagreed with everything she said—that is far from the case.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>My concern, which is reflected to some extent in the cautious and belated nature of this legislation, is that, across the range of film and television initiatives of this government over the last decade, and reflected in the attitudes of the minister and the member for Pearce, is a comfortable complacency about the slow and steady decline of the Australian film industry. Because we have such stunning talent leading the way around the world and winning Oscars—not just the actors, whom we notice, but the directors, the cinematographers, the animators—we all enjoy basking in the reflected glory of their success and saying, ‘Look how clever we are.’ This is a return that we have had on the investments of past years in the training and development of talent and in the generation of a great film industry.</para>
<para>But what we have now is a crisis in the quantity of films being produced—I will come to television in a moment. We ought not comfort ourselves by saying that, because that is so low, it is compensated for by the quality. These are not things about which one can have an objective measure, but I do not think the balance of reviews or audience opinion would suggest that the quality of Australian films in 2005 is higher than it was in 2000 or 1995, when we were producing more films that were attracting more at the Australian box office. We are getting a record low level of Australian films attracting people at the box office. Notwithstanding the fact that we still have talented young directors, writers, actors and cinematographers, we are just not cutting through and there is a complacency in this government about it—and, after nearly 10 long years, they ought to be doing something better.</para>
<para>There is an extra element that is even more directly the government’s responsibility, which I will refer to in response to the remarks by the member for Pearce—the crisis in television drama production in the ABC. We are approaching the point where there will effectively be no television drama production on the ABC. In previous years that has been the benchmark, the area where the new and the cutting edge has been found—and that is no longer the case. I am extremely concerned about that in the immediate.</para>
<para>Some data provided in association with this legislation tells us that there is a lower proportion of Australian content on the ABC than on the commercial television networks. This is a situation that just cannot be allowed to continue. The government has to look at an overall package of measures that assists a strong and vibrant television and film production industry. Of course, the government cannot guarantee success anymore in this area than in any other—perhaps less than in most others. That depends on the creativity and the quality of the people working in the industry; a great film is not going to be produced by the government. The talent has not gone down but the output has. And it has not been compensated for by increased quality. We need to focus more on incentives, support and opportunities to create a great, cutting edge film and television industry.</para>
<para>That brings me back to the incentive element of this legislation. This bill includes directors on non-commissioned films in the definition of the ‘maker’ of films for the purposes of section 98 of the Copyright Act. However, it then limits the effect of this change to the statutory scheme for the payments of royalties for the retransmission of free-to-air broadcasts. As a result, although it carries some symbolic value, it is a very limited change in practical terms.</para>
<para>The first thing to say is how small a measure that is. That is not to say it is a bad measure. It is a good measure, because it is a first step on a long journey and all long journeys start with a single step—but, boy, is it a pretty small and timid step. It is the smallest and the most timid step one could have taken. Of all the options that were considered, some of which are referred to in the explanatory memorandum and associated materials with the legislation, this is the most timid. It is a significant disappointment to the film industry and to film directors, who believed when they read the commitments that the government had made at the election that the government was going to do something significantly more substantial. It said it was going to recognise directors’ copyright. This is not a breach of that promise; it is just the most minimalist response to it. There is nothing less the government could have done without walking away all together, and yet it has taken it five years to do it.</para>
<para>More than five years ago the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee recommended that film directors should receive remuneration, arising from the review of the digital agenda. The government undertook to do something about it in 2000. If one were a literalist about this, that is actually last century, but let us not get into that catch—let us say five years ago, in August 2000. So the government has laboured long and hard and produced a minnow. Nevertheless, it is a small part of a major job that needs to be done to recognise the rights and the economic interests of artists in the work they create—in this instance, in the role that directors play in the creation of films.</para>
<para>Not in every circumstance but in many circumstances, it is impossible to argue that there is not a creative input by directors. I sympathise with some of the concerns that writers and producers have about the implications of the extension of copyright recognition to directors because, in some circumstances, while this is not a zero sum gain, there is an element of potential risk to the remuneration rights—not the other rights, in my opinion—of producers and writers. Understandably, you would be apprehensive if you were in or represented either of those categories of creative contributors to the film industry. Nevertheless, can one seriously argue that Peter Weir and Steven Spielberg are not making a creative contribution to the films that their names are on? It is just a nonsense. So let us start dealing with its consequences and ramifications. This symbolic step is welcome. But it is more than symbolic, because it opens up the possibility that we can move on to Australian directors participating in some of the reciprocal royalty options with, for example, countries in the European Union.</para>
<para>I support the legislation. As the shadow minister made clear, there is significant room to do more in the area of directors’ royalties, but at least this will help our directors receive reciprocal royalties from retransmission of their work in other countries that do give directors economic rights—principally in Europe. The shadow minister has made clear, and appropriately so, that there is room to do more with directors’ rights. More can and should be done and this is a small start.</para>
<para>There are just so many outstanding issues in copyright. The previous Attorney-General paid little attention to this area and, to our amazement, it appears that the current one is paying even less interest. It is not at the political cutting edge. The government cannot run a scare campaign about it as it can with issues of terrorism, with which it can come in here and propose things that it hopes will provide it with some sort of political wedge opportunity. It is about recognition and reward for creative people and the protection of their rights. In the 21st century the countries that will succeed will be those that protect and enhance the contribution of their creators.</para>
<para>We have not yet seen some of the issues that the Copyright Council has been calling on the government to act on. Starting at the procedural end, there is the abolition of the Copyright Law Review Committee and the absence of alternative effective advice to the Attorney-General. There is also the completion of the fair use inquiry by the government, because the question of what constitutes fair use is important. There are issues arising from the Australia-US free trade agreement, particularly what will happen with the two-year implementation deadline with special circumstances for technical protection measures. There is the question of the jurisdiction of the Copyright Tribunal; when will the government come forward with that? There have been recommendations on this matter since April 2000.</para>
<para>We have had a draft bill on Indigenous communal moral rights—I do not think it was a very good draft bill, but at least it was a start—and we have seen no action. We have been looking at the fees paid for broadcasting sound recordings; the digital agenda review; sections 65 and 68 of the Copyright Act relating to art in public places, which arose out of the Myer inquiry into visual arts and craft; Crown copyright, on which the CLRC, before it was abolished, made recommendations; the performers rights’ provisions review, which the Copyright Council has called for, particularly to assess whether the current provisions comply with the formal requirements of the World Intellectual Property Organisation’s Performances and Phonograms Treaty; consents and waivers under the moral rights provisions introduced in 2000, which need to be reviewed; and the review of the government’s own use provisions in the Copyright Act. All these things are outstanding. We need some action. The government is just failing to act.</para>
<para>I have listed there a dozen issues, but I want to come to the 13th; it is one that I have not listed but have raised in this House before. It is an outstanding matter in the area of copyright policy where the government has had a strong recommendation for years. It continues to say that it is looking into it and even makes some sympathetic noises about it, but nothing happens. That is the question of resale rights for artists.</para>
<para>When we deal with copyright legislation in this parliament, it is good that we welcome the small positives in it, but we need to focus our attention on what is not in it. That is what is wrong with this legislation. In addition to welcoming this small initiative and indicating bipartisan support for further measures to recognise the copyright of directors, I say that it is time for the government to act on the issue of resale royalties for artists. There was a government discussion paper; submissions were sought; Rupert Myer in his inquiry said that this action needs to be taken.</para>
<para>I know there will always be people against every change. There are people who are beneficiaries of the existing system; there are people who are very successful artists who do not see any need and who are concerned about the potential implications for their sale into the market. But the broad principle is clear. The principles of copyright in this case essentially are that the artist should have a right to participate in the increased value of the work that they have created—and that is not happening. It is not happening for visual artists and it is overdue. It is far from the case that, in raising this, I am suggesting that the people who buy the works of new and emerging artists at very low prices and then benefit from selling them at high prices when those artists gain recognition are doing something wrong; that is far from the case.</para>
<para>New and emerging artists value people who pay $100, $500 or $800 for their original works. But when those works are subsequently sold for $1 million—and this is not a hypothetical case; this has happened in Australia this year—most of that benefit should flow to the person who had the flair, the recognition and the eye to see a piece of art that was going to increase in value in future years and to give some early recognition to that new and emerging artist. But, if we were to adopt the emerging international standard that has just been adopted in Ireland, where four per cent of the increase in value should flow to the artist, then we would see either the artists or their families benefiting from the value of the work they have created.</para>
<para>In the 21st century the successful societies will be those that reward and encourage creativity—in research and development on the industry side and through the sort of creative talent that flows in the IT industry but also across into films, visual arts, literature and all those areas. If we do not get our copyright house in order quickly, we will be left behind. The measure we are debating today is a welcome measure but, sadly, after five years of effort it is a small and timid measure where we need to be striking out boldly to create a new and enhanced regime to strengthen our copyright and intellectual property laws. I support the legislation—it is a step in the right direction—but it is sadly belated and sadly inadequate.</para>

<para>—Madam Deputy Speaker Bishop, it is good to see you in the chair yet again. With respect to the <inline ref="R2313">Copyright Amendment (Film Directors’ Rights) Bill 2005</inline>, I listened very carefully to the contribution made by the honourable member for Fraser and no-one could deny his passion for the subject on which he spoke. However, I believe that he was a little less than generous to the government, because this bill does bring about some very important changes and, while the member for Fraser said that he welcomed the bill, he damned it to a certain extent by faint praise.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>There has been much written about the perceived downfall of the Australian film industry in recent years, with recently released government reports highlighting the decrease in film production in this country as well as reductions in the collective budgets of these productions. The Copyright Amendment (Film Directors’ Rights) Bill 2005 may just help to turn the tide on this phenomenon in some way by giving film directors a legal ownership in the copyright of films which they have directed.</para>
<para>The bill proposes changes that will give directors a slice of the financial pie that they have helped to bake, or create. The right is limited to sharing in the royalties generated for the copyright owners when the film is transmitted on pay TV or free-to-air TV. This provides a new revenue stream to Australian film directors, quite a substantial number of whom are doing it tough in a difficult industry. This may not be exactly what the directors desire but it is at last a legal recognition of their intellectual and creative input into film production.</para>
<para>The promise of sharing copyright ownership can immediately give a director a long-term relationship with a film production. A long-term relationship can help to deepen the feelings of creative ownership that a director has with one of his or her films. There can be no denying that a film director has the best interests of the finished film at heart, but a knowledge that his or her creative labours are helping to bolster the income of the producer can turn even the best of conditions somewhat sour. The director who is paid a set fee may feel somewhat of a gun for hire, rather than a creative conduit.</para>
<para>It is the director who often carries the burden of success. The director is praised when the film is a critical or commercial success but is the first to be criticised when the film is a flop. A finished film’s success depends significantly on the director’s intellectual labour. Those are two words you do not often hear in the same phrase. I refer, of course, to ‘intellectual’ and ‘Labor’. So these directors seem to have a legitimate claim on the finished product.</para>

<para>—I thank the honourable member opposite for his recognition of the fact that one does not often see the words ‘intellectual’ and ‘Labor’ side by side. Returning to the bill, it is often the producers and investors who reap the financial rewards of a successful film. In a submission to the Senate inquiry on this bill, Chryssy Tintner, CEO of the copyright collecting agency Viscopy, made the following statement:</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<quote>
<para class="block">The argument as to whether the Director, Screenwriter or Producer is the true author of an audio-visual work has been a point of discussion between the relevant unions around the world since 1923.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This debate is set to continue for some time to come. Ms Tintner went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It is clear that all three are essential to the creation of a film work. The Screenwriter is the creator of the script, the Director interprets this work in a visual way, and the Producer creates the financial and resource environment in which the work can occur.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In the submission Viscopy supported the idea that copyright ownership and subsequent payment of royalties should relate only to the retransmission of the work on TV screens. This at least is some form of recognition.</para>
<para>A film director colleague of one of my staff members has spoken of the daily presence of disappointment when a film project is not turning out the way that he hopes. The comments by Peter Nathan, of Peter Nathan Films, highlight the yearning of the director to ensure a project will be as good as it gets. Factors such as low budgets, time constraints, weather, equipment failures and various other influences all affect the final product. While the producer must sort out the logistical issues, it is the director who may be required to take creative short cuts while desperately clinging to his or her original vision of the project. It seems quite amazing that it has taken this long for the vital influence of a director in the final look of a film production to be recognised in a proposed law. As I have mentioned, it is the director who carries the bulk of the burden of success. Yet, despite having this creative burden on his or her shoulders, as the case may be, film directors at present remain significantly at the mercy of their producer.</para>
<para>When we visit the cinema and sit down to enjoy a movie, I suppose with a tub of popcorn—if you like popcorn, Madam Deputy Speaker; I certainly do not—we are effectively the last stop in a long, complex process that has seen a film progress from a small idea, through a complex development process, lengthy production, post production and, finally, screening. Directors have a legitimate claim to the creative flair of the production. It is their skills that help to make the movie what it is and so they should be afforded the opportunity to reap some sort of financial reward. An extra incentive for financial reward may help to spark a new wave of enthusiasm by directors, which can only be good for the Australian film industry.</para>
<para>Despite the mutterings of the honourable member for Fraser, this is a very important piece of legislation. It is a major step forward for film directors. It may assist the recultivation or repropagation of the Australian film industry to some extent. I am very pleased to be able to commend the Copyright Amendment (Film Directors’ Rights) Bill 2005 to the chamber and I hope that it receives a speedy passage.</para>

<para>—The Australian film industry has a proud history and it is very important that the parliament look at protecting the rights of film directors. We want to make sure that their artistic investment in the work of the film is recognised and that the copyright protections, which ought to be there, are in fact there. In many ways, the Australian film industry thrived during the time of the previous government, with the introduction of a number of measures including the establishment of the Film Finance Corporation. Film production and broadcasting in Australia now generates an overall income of $1,596 million and the industry employs 16,427 people in 2,174 businesses. I am very proud to be able to make a few comments in support of our film industry and acknowledge that, while the steps made in the <inline ref="R2313">Copyright Amendment (Film Directors’ Rights) Bill 2005</inline> are only small, nonetheless, they are incremental steps in the right direction.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Watson for showing his thorough and acute appreciation of some of the issues surrounding the legislation that we are looking at today. I want to make some general remarks about the state of the film industry before I address the question of the <inline ref="R2313">Copyright Amendment (Film Directors’ Rights) Bill 2005</inline> and take the opportunity to refer to some of the comments that have already been made by members in the House, including the members for Pearce and Fraser and others.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>At one of the most recent conferences of the Screen Producers Association of Australia a topic for consideration was: ‘Is the Australian film industry stuffed?’ That was the question that delegates to the conference had to ask themselves and the reason for asking was the alarming statistical record of decline in the success of Australian films which we have witnessed during the term of the Howard government. As shadow parliamentary secretary for reconciliation and the arts, I need to say that I share, along with all members of this House, great enthusiasm and hopes for the success of the Australian film industry. But I also have to make the observation that, since the high point of the 1980s—particularly the year 1986 when Australian films generated about 9.5 per cent of box office—we have fallen to the lowest share of box office, at 1.6 per cent, and it is declining under this government.</para>
<para>Members standing up in the House proclaiming the success and the level of support that has been shown by the government are simply flying in the face of the statistical realities. It is widely acknowledged in the industry that we have a serious problem in relation to the success of Australian films. To point this out is not to say that we do not have confidence in the talent and the abilities of our film-makers and our creative industries—we do. It is not to say that we do not recognise that some support has been provided by the government to buttress the film industry’s efforts—it has—but it simply has not been adequate enough, and I will return to that a little bit later.</para>
<para>I have been championing a series of films that have come off the slate and have been released or are due for release soon. In particular, I want to place on record in the House my commendation of the efforts of director Rowan Woods and the film <inline font-style="italic">Little Fish</inline>. I had the opportunity to co-launch the film in the western suburbs of Sydney at the Westfield Plaza film complex in Liverpool only a couple of weeks ago. It was an appropriate location for us to speak to a film which actually dealt with people in the western suburbs and dealt with them in a sensitive and compelling way.</para>
<para>The simple fact is that we are not making enough films; we are not making enough Australian films. As a consequence, expectations of success for those films that we are making are that much higher. We make a dozen or so films; we need to be making scores of films. Whilst the full responsibility for ensuring that we do make more films does not lie entirely with the government—I acknowledge that—it does lie with a government policy which seeks to do two things. Firstly, it seeks to provide substantial resources and support for the film industry and, secondly, it seeks to provide appropriate and effective frameworks for leveraging private investment so that Australian investment and Australian income can go into our film-making industry.</para>
<para>This piece of minor legislation confers a copyright on directors in very limited circumstances, as members have noted. It is welcome, but it has been too long in coming. In fact, it is way overdue. Five years ago Peter Weir and Scott Hicks—both notable film directors—were among a number of people who visited then government ministers Alston, Williams and McGauran to argue the case for recognition of the role played by directors in the creation of motion picture films. Even earlier, a similarly eminent group of directors, including Gillian Armstrong, Bruce Beresford, Jane Campion and Fred Schepisi, had written to the Prime Minister in 1999—that is, in the last century—protesting that directors had been excluded from the Copyright Act. They were supported by Labor and by a number of organisations with interests in this area, including the Arts Law Centre and the Australian Copyright Council.</para>
<para>The background to this issue lies in the fact that the Copyright Act identifies two categories of artistic creation. The first category is works of an artistic, musical or literary nature and provides that, where a work is created, copyright in the work is owned by the author. The second category relates to subject matter other than works—for example, films—for which copyright did not adhere. Up to now the Copyright Act did not recognise directors as makers or copyright owners. The directors’ argument was a simple one—namely, that a film is in fact a work and as such copyright should adhere to directors, who clearly are creators of the work.</para>
<para>This legislation goes a small distance towards addressing this issue in that it grants film directors a share in copyright for the purposes of the subscription TV retransmission scheme, but I do not think it goes far enough. Still, as indicated by the shadow Attorney-General and other speakers, Labor supports the bill—with some reservations, which I will return to later. I note also the recommendation of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee of August 2005 that the bill in the form that it has come into the House should be passed.</para>
<para>Copyright is a sometimes complex and often contested area of the law in relation to creative works, but it has become an important legal principle that there should be a right which vests in the creator or originator of a work and which provides both recognition and legal foundation for the creator—in legal terms, the author—across the range of artistic, musical and literary output. This legal foundation is essential for the author of works to protect their interests in a work in any negotiation with someone wishing to exploit the work, and then, in the event that the work is publicly exploited, to have this protection available through the various commercial and legal relationships that follow.</para>
<para>In the case of musical composition, it is a fact of history that the earliest arrangements between a composer, who was often also the performer of the work, and a record label or record company intent on exploiting the composers were lopsided to the extent that in many cases the composer and performer of the work rarely saw any return from the sale of the work, even in cases when the work was particularly successful. There are scores of examples, particularly in the early period of the development of the recording industry, of very successful recording artists dying penniless. They had few rights to begin with, few opportunities to assert them where they existed and oftentimes unwittingly traded them away as a result of their overwhelming lack of bargaining capacity when faced with the more experienced and better resourced record labels.</para>
<para>Jelly Roll Morton, the historically recognised creator of jazz, died in 1941 destitute, cheated by ASCAP and his publishers. Bo Diddley in his 50th year of touring still has not seen any money in relation to the Chess Masters issues, although he concedes that he has to believe that MCA is doing all that it can to resolve this matter. Bo’s faith in MCA is to be admired. Fortunately, the excesses of this period have been pared back somewhat over time, although the lack of bargaining parity remains a feature of the initial interaction between the sole performer—or author—and the music label or publisher, especially when that label or publisher is part of a much larger corporation.</para>
<para>As a consequence of this inevitable environment, which has not been confined to the music industry, we have witnessed the recognition of fields of copyrights extending over time—in part, as a consequence of the practices I have referred to here and due as well to the increasing commercial trade of creative works and the need to adequately identify and protect the inherent rights that attach to authorship. I do not think that it is stretching an analogy too far to say that the extension of the notion of copyright and its subsequent implementation through legislation has a parallel with the larger progress of increased political rights and freedoms and the attempts to guarantee those rights, which has been a compelling national and international development over the past 100 years or more.</para>
<para>In this instance, a number of interested organisations submitted to the government their support for the introduction of film directors’ copyright. The Australian Copyright Council, for example, supported the assertion by directors which proposed simply enough that, where a film has a principal director, the principal director is deemed to be the author; where there is a principal director, copyright in the film would be co-owned by directors or directors’ employees or the assignee of directors’ future copyright interests; the other co-owner would be the maker or the person who commissioned the maker to make the film or their assignee. Where there was no principal director, copyright was first owned solely by the maker or commissioning person.</para>
<para>The government’s election policy Strengthening Australian Arts promised that the coalition government would amend the Copyright Act to give, for the first time, film directors these rights. But it has taken far too long from the time this issue was first raised to now for the government’s promise to be partially realised. The explanatory memorandum to the bill notes that ‘film directors make a significant creative contribution to the film making process’. It is this contribution which can be summarised as the primary creative role in the ultimate making of an audiovisual work, which has in Labor’s view long needed due recognition and which ought to be accurately reflected within the legal framework that the film industry operates within.</para>
<para>To put it simply, the director is the linchpin of the entire creative process. The director is the most prominent and pre-eminent party in a process that can take up to a decade to complete. The director requires an all-abiding commitment to shepherd, energise, shape and sign off the work in question. This is not to say that screenwriters, producers, editors and other skilled personnel working on the film do not make significant contributions; they do. It is just that a film should be and usually is the fruit of many labours but the realisation of one or sometimes two filmic minds and imaginations and that creative intelligence and storytelling skill, as well as the responsibility for bringing the project home, belong to the director.</para>
<para>The reality is that the director is literally akin to the author. In numerous cases, where the director initiates the idea and writes the script, the director is actually the author as well. It is simply not possible to envisage <inline font-style="italic">Citizen Kane</inline> without Orson Welles, <inline font-style="italic">The Godfather</inline> without Francis Ford Coppola, <inline font-style="italic">My Brilliant Career</inline> without Gillian Armstrong or <inline font-style="italic">Little Fish</inline>—one of the finest Australian films I have had the privilege of seeing recently, which I have referred to above—without the encompassing role played by the director. The role of the director is central, authorial and fundamental to the film’s genesis, execution and success. It is as simple as that.</para>
<para>It was implied that the government would grant more than one right to film directors in its contemplation of the role they play in the creative process, especially given the greater recognition and protection they have in other territories, particularly Europe. There is a strong argument that asserts that all creators should receive the same complement of economic and moral rights across the range of subject matter. In fact, this bill only grants a very limited right—namely, to provide for directors’ copyright in relation to retransmissions of free-to-air broadcasts across the pay TV platform, and only in relation to non-commissioned films. It is a very minor right. It will have very little effect on the working arrangements and enhancements of rights of directors, as few films will fall within the category identified and in many cases—and this is allowed under legislation—the right can and often will be contracted away.</para>
<para>The fact that this legislation, so limited in scope, comes after a long campaign by directors and also many years after the initial announcement by the government that it would enter into joint ministerial consultation about directors’ copyright begs the question: what took the government so long to do so little? And where is its commitment to promptly reviewing and clarifying the broader issues of copyright as it pertains, for example, to harmonisation with international law and treaties, to consideration for screenwriters to be accorded some form of copyright or, in another area of importance, to visual artists in respect of royalties where their work is resold for significantly higher prices?</para>
<para>It is telling that directors previously had no rights, other than moral rights, as makers or copyright owners which were reflected in copyright law. But the Labor Party, from the first instance when this issue was drawn to our attention, have been active and consistently supportive of the claims that directors have made. We recognised that they were legitimate and urged action. I note in the House the significant contribution of the member for Denison, the then shadow arts minister, whose early advocacy in this matter was substantial, and also the efforts undertaken on behalf of directors in the Senate by Senator Stott-Despoja of the Democrats.</para>
<para>The claim by directors that as a matter of fairness they were entitled to some form of copyright protection simply should have been acted upon earlier. It is some small consolation that the limited nature of the rights means that the government’s laxity in this instance has not meant significant income forgone. Most importantly, European jurisdictions, which ultimately will be covered under European Union regulations and laws, do recognise directors as film-makers for copyright purposes, so it is way overdue that similar arrangements be put in place in Australia.</para>
<para>The arguments that were put in opposition to this legislation, including issues of certainty surrounding contracting and investing in a project and the ‘thin end of the wedge’ argument, which featured in these deliberations, were—with respect to those who made them—not sufficiently substantial. They do not and did not neuter the legislation.</para>
<para>There is one exception. This goes to the reservation I have in relation to the intended copyright not extending to the educational use licence in part VA. No compelling evidence was brought that I am aware of by any party, including the Screen Producers Association of Australia, to demonstrate how producers or others would be worse off if this very minor right were extended to part VA. Indeed, the Senate committee made that same observation in their report at paragraph 3.26. It does not seem fair or consistent with the granting of a retransmission right that a right for education use should not be similarly granted. For now, we simply note the disappointingly limited right that this bill confers. Yes, it is a small first step, but there is a long way to go.</para>
<para>Generally, the longevity and success of a particular work or film depends very much on the original vision and its execution by the director. Even though the likelihood is that in many instances directors, under this legislation, will have contracted away their rights, long-term success is a guarantee for investors and directors alike, so sharing a right should not be an impediment to the success of a work. Here I am referring to the essentially collaborative nature of the engagement between film-makers and film producers. Ultimately, they go hand in hand to the marketplace, and ultimately the open, sometimes defined but necessarily cooperative, nature of that collaboration is essential to their success. After all, this is what occurs in many other fields of creative and commercial endeavour. There is no reason why it should not happen in Australia as well, where the films made by directors and the efforts they put into making these films shape and embolden our identity and add immeasurably to our national store of culture.</para>
<para>This legislation was too long in coming, but it affords us the opportunity not only to recognise the contribution that directors make in the production and bringing to the market of a creative work but also to highlight some of the insufficiencies evident in the track record and the current state of health of the Australian film industry. I was reading—browsing, you might say—through the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of 2 August and I noted that Australian culture now rates ‘zilch’ in the latest international survey of how people see Australia. The days of Aussie cinema being celebrated overseas unfortunately seem to me to be disappearing. This is a serious state of affairs. It requires resolute action by this government, who are charged with the responsibility of ensuring that our culture is healthy and buoyant and continues to grow. We need to be able to tell our stories here, and we also need to be able to sell them overseas.</para>
<para>There is no denying the talent that we have in this country. A number of actors—whose names people would be well aware of—producers, directors and directors of photography have found eminence working both here and overseas. Whenever we take the opportunity to watch the films they make and to see their success against their contemporaries, particularly their American contemporaries, we know that we have capacity and talent that is equal to the best in the world. However, they need the opportunities and the platforms. We need to make more films in order to see those successes play out not only here but also in other parts of the world.</para>
<para>There is no denying the current poor state that we are in. We are optimistic for the future, but some 300 films land off the slate into our cinemas and onto our television screens every year and the majority are American. Very few of them are Australian films. It is high time that this government did something about that state of affairs, and this legislation should not have taken as long as it did to reach the House.</para>

<para>—I am pleased to rise this evening to speak on the <inline ref="R2313">Copyright Amendment (Film Directors’ Rights) Bill 2005</inline>, and I am pleased to have the opportunity to follow the member for Kingsford Smith. I put on the record at the outset that the member for Kingsford Smith would know significantly more than most in this chamber about issues of copyright and the economic rights of authors who seek to protect copyright material. However, I was quite disappointed to hear the member’s rather lacklustre contribution. You had to cut through the platitude about the government needing to do more—that it should have acted more promptly and done something for Australian film. I would have liked to have heard about the Labor Party’s policy on this issue.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I agree with many of the tenets of the opposition member. I agree that the Australian film industry is running through a particularly dry patch and that it is high time that we provided directors with the opportunity to reap some economic benefit from their artistic talent and the artistic merit that lies behind the construction and creation of film. As a number of speakers before me stated, this bill does that in a limited capacity. However, in my humble opinion, the greatest debate in the arts community today is about the best way forward. There is no point being shrill and saying: ‘We’ve got problems that should be fixed. The government should have done something.’ What is required is for people to make clear their thoughts and their recommendations to improve the situation. Quite frankly, I was disappointed that the member for Kingsford Smith, despite having 20 minutes at his disposal, took zero opportunity to engage in deliberations on the Labor Party’s position about the best way forward.</para>
<para>I noted some weeks ago that the Australian Labor Party supported a bill—as they support this bill—that extended the film tax offset to television series. I was surprised to hear in that debate that the federal Australian Labor Party did not support product bundling yet the Queensland Australian Labor Party—the state level—support bundling in extending the film tax offset threshold to television. I am not sure why there is this inconsistency between the federal Australian Labor Party and the Queensland Australian Labor Party. I think the time has come to reach beyond the populist rhetoric about needing to do something for Australian film and television and to start developing some plans. In this vein, I could not disagree more with the member for Kingsford Smith about the best way forward. It is not about building an industry based on Australian stories told by Australian voices. In my view, the very reason that the Australian film industry is suffering considerably is that a cultural elitism has been perpetuated by members opposite such that the best thing the Australian film industry can do, and the greatest aspiration that the Australian film industry could ever have, is to go forward and to tell Australian stories with Australian voices.</para>
<para>In my view, the net result of this policy thrust—which we saw when the Australian Labor Party was in government for some 13 years and it still comes from some agencies and some bodies within the cultural sector of this economy—was that we got 30 people into a cinema who feel really good about themselves, but that is all. It is time that we recognised that art is a business and business is an art. When it comes to film, nothing could be more true. Quite frankly, it is time that we started to recognise that Australia has great potential in film and television creation, in maximising the talents of our actors and our directors and in maximising the returns that can flow to government agencies and to the private sector by selling Australian film and television to the world.</para>
<para>That does not mean that it has to be an Australian story with an Australian voice. It means that we need to sell that which is desired by the consumer in the marketplace. If it is a case of developing scripts that will sell into North America, the United Kingdom and the Australian market, then let us spend time exerting effort to create scripts that meet the latent demand of consumers. We have not done that. The sooner we do that, the sooner we will see a significant revival in the Australian film and television industry.</para>
<para>The member for Kingsford Smith talked about how he saw some parallel between human rights and copyright. I thought that was really pushing it. I am not sure there is a link there. Copyright is probably more to do with our seeing some recognition of the economic value that flows from investment into the services side of the economy. As someone who holds themselves out, as I do, as an advocate of intellectual property creation, I believe that the new economy will hold our country well into the future. I like the extension and the creation of economic rights—albeit in limited circumstances, but it is a start—and providing Australian directors an opportunity to harness the economic potential from investing in the copyright that flows directly from their creation of Australian film.</para>
<para>The member for Kingsford Smith also commented that the box office share of Australian films has dropped from nine per cent to 1.6 per cent. Again, there are very mixed messages within the marketplace about what is driving this. As I said, in my view it comes from the fact that we have not been focused on consumers but, rather, have been more concerned with satisfying cultural elites. When we get refocused on consumers, we will see a resurgence in Australian films. We will see films like <inline font-style="italic">Moulin Rouge</inline>, <inline font-style="italic">Crackerjack</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">The Castle</inline> go from strength to strength.</para>
<para>As wonderful an example of Australian culture as <inline font-style="italic">The Castle</inline> was—an Australian story told with an Australian voice that did very well in Australia—it barely moved any units internationally. I am not being critical of it; I am simply taking this opportunity to highlight the difference between a film that has export potential and one that does not. Not many Americans or Brits understand <inline font-style="italic">The Castle</inline>. We are competing with films and intellectual property generated in the heartland of films—Hollywood—and have to recognise that we need to make what sells.</para>
<para>I have been very buoyed in recent years to see that Brian Rosen, the CEO of the FFC, is directing that agency in a way that should be applauded. He is directing it—no pun intended on the word ‘directing’—down a path that is about recognising the need to make a stronger business case and taking that forward.</para>
<para>The member for Kingsford Smith also said that there should be two key points to the creation of public policy when it comes to film. One is to provide substantial direct investment into the film industry, which this government does, carrying on a proud tradition of a number of previous governments of both persuasions. We also need to encourage leveraging from the private sector in the investment in Australian film. With regard to that, the Macquarie Bank, for example, recently offered high net worth investors the opportunity to invest in a number of Australian films. They unfortunately did not return a dollar for every dollar that was invested. The return was significantly less than the initial investment that was put forward.</para>
<para>These kinds of problems are what must be overcome. Despite all the good policy in the world, if we cannot even provide a dollar-for-dollar return to the private sector, then how can we ever truly expect to get the private sector to invest? It might be politically opportunistic for members opposite to say that the problem is policy, but the problem is not policy. We saw the creation of an investment fund from the private sector putting millions of dollars into the Australian film industry, and the problem was the product. There will be many members of the Australian cultural community who will take issue with my comments, but I believe that those who are most honest with themselves will recognise that it is an issue that needs to be addressed, tackled headfirst and improved.</para>
<para>If we do not do that, if we do not have the intellectual rigour to undertake that process, we might as well go down the path of having an industry that we simply put $100 million a year into—or whatever the figure is—and then we can all be proud that we have this little industry sucking on the government teat, an industry which is not producing great films but which the 30 or 40 people who do happen to go and see the films can feel really great about. That is not the path that I believe we should go down. I do not believe that that satisfies the public interest or the expectations of the truly aspirational film-makers within Australia. It might satisfy the cultural elites, but that is it. I certainly believe that, in the long term, we have to continue to make some hard decisions and appoint key people into positions that focus on ensuring that the creation of Australian film and television series is firmly focused on meeting consumer demand.</para>
<para>When it comes to this particular bill, I am very pleased that there has been widespread industry consultation about some of the measures it takes. The public consultation with various stakeholders in the industry has been about the principle of providing directors’ rights in films. There has been additional stakeholder consultation on the draft bill. Flowing from all of that has been widespread support for the changes that this bill incorporates. The Australian Screen Directors Association said:</para>

When we have seen so many films not work, it is important to reflect that those who do make it work have a very special gift indeed. Most certainly, I applaud providing the flow of some economic rights back to the director who has that magic touch. In time, I would like to see an extension of this. I would like to see an extension of economic rights to embrace a variety of different platforms and circumstances in which copyright revenue would flow. It is important that directors have an economic interest in their films, beyond those that their contract provides for.</para>

<para>—I will ignore that interjection, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am aware that the member for Maribyrnong has a particular interest in certain aspects of the Gold Coast film industry, and I applaud him for getting behind the Gold Coast film industry and encourage him to purchase as much product as possible. But, beyond that, our collective interest as a government in ensuring that even nascent industries like the film industry on the Gold Coast prosper and go forward is one that we can attempt to facilitate through good policy.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>This bill is good policy. It builds on other good policy that we have that provides opportunities to those who seek to make film and who seek to grow the Australian film industry. But let us all ensure as much as possible that, in taking Australian film and television to the world, we do so with a common goal in mind: to ensure that, as much as possible, we provide quality product, that it is inventive, that it is original and that, more importantly, it is something for which people will be willing to take their wallets out of their pockets and go to their local cinemas to watch. If we do that, and if we focus on that, I believe the film industry in this country will go from its weak point at this stage to a great position of strength.</para>
<para>I commend this bill to the House, and I would like to hear any alternatives that may be put forward from the opposition as to whether they believe there is a better course forward that we can adopt. I would certainly welcome their contribution in that regard, and I welcome the fact that they support this bill.</para>

<para>—I will at some point comment upon alternatives; the member for Moncrieff can rest assured that the Labor Party has concerns about the parlous state of the film industry and looks at ways to improve the condition of the industry. However, I will turn to the <inline ref="R2313">Copyright Amendment (Film Directors’ Rights) Bill 2005</inline>—something the member for Moncrieff failed to do for 15 minutes—and make some comments on that.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>But, before I do, I will respond briefly to the member for Moncrieff’s comments about how important government support is for an industry—whatever the industry. It is true to say that there is a direct correlation between encouragement and support—support in all sorts of ways—of an industry by a government, and I think there is clear evidence that the Howard government has failed in its commitments towards this industry. That is very clear. Since the election of the Howard government in 1996, we have seen the diminution of the industry—a direct correlation of a lack of support and a lack of funding—and, as a result, we have seen a decline in film features being developed and produced in this nation. Given that the member for Moncrieff represents an electorate where Australian workers work in that industry—unfortunately, in many cases for foreign productions—it is unfortunate that he does not seem to understand that there needs to be support.</para>
<para>It is also fair to acknowledge the first Prime Minister who realised the national importance of assistance to the film industry. It was John Grey Gorton, the former Prime Minister—</para>

<para>—Yes, the last good Liberal, as the member for Maribyrnong has pointed out, who ended up being elevated to the prime ministership. One thing he did was to realise the importance of the film industry being encouraged by the national government in this country. It is true to say that, upon the election of the Whitlam government, the support grew, but I think it is important to note that John Grey Gorton showed his support by creating the Australian Film Commission and by providing leadership and government support for this industry in the late sixties. That was followed by further support by Labor governments.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>However, the obvious decline since 1996 has occurred as a result of the government not sharing the same interests of John Gorton. Clearly the Prime Minister and the ministers responsible do not believe that this industry is of such significance as to warrant support at the level it once had. Notwithstanding that, Labor support this bill. It is a meagre bill, but we do believe that film directors should have their creative roles in the Australian film industry recognised through the recognition of economic rights.</para>
<para>For the first time in Australian law, this bill recognises that directors are essential creative contributors to the film industry and that, as with other creators, their creativity should be rewarded through provisions of copyright law. This bill should be seen, therefore, as part of a gradual evolution in the understanding of copyright ownership, moral rights and economic rights law in this country, particularly in relation to the things made by artists.</para>
<para>The bill includes directors of non-commissioned films in the definition of ‘maker’ of films for the purposes of section 98 of the Copyright Act. However, it then limits the effect of this change to the statutory scheme for the payment of royalties for the transmission of free-to-air broadcasts—that is, the scheme outlined in part VC of the Copyright Act. It will therefore have little positive practical impact on the Australian film industry or on investment in that industry, and this is a very serious limitation of the proposed legislation.</para>
<para>It confers limited rights on directors in the transmission of free-to-air broadcasts but does not extend to commissioned films, which are the overwhelming majority of films currently being made in Australia. Nor does it automatically extend to employed directors. This is a serious limitation of the bill and may show that the government’s intentions were cosmetic at best. This is because industry practice in this country is for directors to assign any copyright they may have to the producers of the film they are to direct. The bill is so modest, in fact, that we wonder why it has taken the government five years to pay up on their promise to review the issue and present another bill, after Labor agreed to the passing of the Copyright Amendment (Digital Agenda) Bill in 2000.</para>
<para>Earlier in the debate I heard the member for Wentworth indicate that somehow Labor should not be disappointed at this delay, because consultation had to occur. However, many of the submissions that were made to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee indicate that there was not genuine consultation. Indeed, even if the government were apparently listening, they were clearly not listening hard enough, because very few of the recommendations made by those who drafted submissions and put their arguments forward were properly addressed by the government. So I have to disagree with the member for Wentworth. There is no point in suggesting that the government are listening and consulting when, in fact, there is no evidence that some of the suggestions made by a number of witnesses were put into this bill.</para>
<para>Very little has changed, therefore, in five years. It should not have taken this long. There was a bipartisan position in relation to all the major tenets of the bill, but the government has delayed, delayed and delayed the passage of this bill. And there does not really seem to be any good reason for it. There does not seem to be any decent reason for the government to argue that it had to delay to provide for the process, given that nothing really eventuated as a result of those five years of delay. So the opposition suggests that the only reason for the five-year delay through this sham process—or at least a disingenuous review by the government—is that the government has no regard for this industry. If it did, it would have enacted the legislation, with the support of the opposition, much earlier.</para>
<para>It has been argued most sharply by film producer bodies that diluting the producers’ hold on sole possession of copyright could endanger future investment in films by making agreements more complex and therefore more difficult to achieve. It would also, so the argument goes, increase the cost of producing films in Australia. However, the number of countries that recognise directors’ economic and moral rights is increasing all the time without any adverse effect on the viability of their industries. In fact, compared to the current parlous state of the film industry in this country, many of these industries are in rude health, even those with a similar population base and systems of economic incentive and sponsorship. The member for Parramatta listed the progress of the film industries of many other countries. I have to say that we seem to be on the decline when compared to other countries, certainly countries of comparable wealth and size.</para>
<para>There is also an interesting correlation with the ongoing controversy in the industrial relations arena regarding independent contractors. I presided over an inquiry that went to those matters of trying to delineate the relationship between employees and independent contractors, and I suggested that much of the government’s motive in that area was to deny employees particular entitlements or to shift obligations from the employer to the employee by using some form of disguised employment, in many cases dressed up as independent contractors. The bill would deny a director who was employed by a production company the right to have the bill, if enacted, apply to him or her. So we have a situation where, if a director is employed by a production company, on the face of it this legislation would not apply.</para>
<para>By including directors of non-commissioned works in the retransmission scheme, the bill will give these directors additional clout at the bargaining table. That is a good thing. Copyright is assignable by contract, so a change like the one proposed will become the position where bargaining begins. In slightly reframing the negotiation in this way, the bill recognises directors’ creative contribution to film. As with other creators, that input should be recognised through copyright law. In practice, it is possible that very few directors will benefit, however, from the limited copyright given by this legislation. The Senate committee heard that the percentage of uncommissioned films made in Australia is very small—perhaps one or two per cent—since directors waive most of their rights under the terms of their contractual arrangements with producers. Again, whilst the intent of the bill is good, its application is very narrow and therefore its effect is negligible. I contend that the bill will affect only a handful of directors.</para>
<para>We should be concerned to provide an incentive structure to encourage and support creative directors at a time when levels of production in the Australian film industry are hitting all-time lows. Over the last century, Australian directors have made a significant contribution to the development of Australian culture. As the member for Kingsford Smith was saying, by telling our stories, they reflect our society, history and culture to us. In a time when cinemas are once again closing down in our capital cities and our screens and airways are saturated with foreign culture, we need our own stories now more than ever.</para>
<para>I could not for the life of me understand the member for Moncrieff’s concerns about the apparent lack of adaptability of Australian products overseas. At one point the member for Moncrieff indicated that viewers of film in Britain, the United States and other countries would not understand the nuances in a film like <inline font-style="italic">The Castle</inline>. I disagree with that. Firstly, that was a very good production with good writing and acting. Good film done well—comedy in particular—is universal in its application for viewers. I did not understand his concerns that it was somehow too peculiar to Australian filmgoers to be able to succeed overseas.</para>
<para>I do not think we should be diluting or changing the way in which we behave on film so as to make some producer or distributor in another country happy. I do accept that it is important to get a return on film. Yes, there is the need to have viable film, but I disagree with the member for Moncrieff, who suggested that somehow the good films that we have made, even in recent times, are not able to be appreciated by audiences across the world. I do not believe that at all.</para>
<para>It is clear that there has been a real decline in the film industry and I believe that that has affected our ability to tell our stories in our own way. Aside from these intangible benefits, Australian film is an increasingly important export industry. As communications technology transmits higher quality video at faster and faster speeds, Australian film increasingly competes in a global market. One of the strongest rationales for including directors in the transmission scheme is that it assists our directors to receive reciprocal royalties from retransmissions of their work in foreign countries that may not give directors economic rights. This is a further stream of export revenue which can be tapped to support our industry.</para>
<para>This bill will not do much to help the established directors but it will assist those struggling to find a place in the industry. It will also help directors of more marginal films like documentaries, animations and trade and educational films. It will help directors like Adam Elliott, the maker of <inline font-style="italic">Harvie Krumpet</inline>, who only a short time before his international success was never certain of his ability to continue in his chosen field due to the sorts of economic pressures that this bill might go some way in alleviating.</para>
<para>We acknowledge the concerns raised by the Australian Writers Guild that screenwriters should also be considered owners of the copyright in the films for the purposes of the retransmission scheme. We support the recommendation of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee that the government consult with relevant stakeholders on such a change. As I said earlier, over five years—from the year 2000, when a similar bill was introduced into this place, until now—very little genuine consultation has taken place between the government and the stakeholders. That is a crying shame and a reflection on the government’s disregard for this industry.</para>
<para>It is also important to note that, as has been indicated by the Writers Guild in their submission to the Senate inquiry this year, there was an inadequate consultation process. I am not the only one making that claim. The guild say in their submission:</para>

</quote>
<para class="block">They also mention that in 2001 the government made an election policy in ‘Arts for All’, but then go on to say that only lip-service has been paid to do that particular promise.</para>
<para>I would also like to make reference to the submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee by the Australian Screen Directors Association. Clearly, the screen directors do support the bill in principle. They do not believe it has gone far enough. On page 5 of their submission, they say:</para>

<para class="block">In line with this determination, the Government has included the introduction of director’s copyright as an election commitment in its two subsequent election platforms.

<para>The Coalition Government will amend the Copyright Act to give, for the first time, film directors rights to copyright in the films they direct.</para>
<para class="block">ASDA’s concern is that the current Bill does not appear to give effect to this policy.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">What we have from the representatives of the directors in this country is a damning conclusion that, whilst they support the thrust of the bill in principle, they effectively say that the promise that was made by the government prior to the election would ensure that directors would be protected, indeed supported, in this particular way—that is, that the film directors’ rights to copyright in films would occur. Clearly, that has not happened in all but a very few cases. They make that very clear in their submission.</para>
<para>Unfortunately, the government did not properly attend to the concerns of the industry in drafting this bill. Labor supports the bill, but it is a very modest attempt by the government to assist the film industry and, indeed, a very modest attempt to recognise directors and their role in making films and to protect their rights once their hard work has manifested itself in an Australian film. I do have reservations with the lack of application of this bill. Therefore, I ask the government to consider widening the application for all directors and other professionals in the film industry in future. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talker>
<para>—At the outset of this debate on the <inline ref="R2313">Copyright Amendment (Film Directors’ Rights) Bill 2005</inline> I want to say that I am indebted to Jonathan Chowns in the law and bills digest section of the Parliamentary Library for his excellent work. Without it, I would not be able to speak on the bill. In this presentation, I will draw heavily on the work that he has done.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>People who have spoken so far, beginning with the Attorney-General in his second reading speech, have time and time again outlined the fact that this is a finely drawn bill with minimal impact: that it creates a new class of rights for a small group of people—and in practice a much smaller group of people than one might think to start off with—but that those rights are narrowly constricted. If we look at the previous situation in regard to the operation of copyright, we can see that here, because we are dealing with cinematic and other works, we are dealing with works dealt with in the Copyright Act—film, video, audio works and so on—that are not strictly classified as works. If you compose something, it is a work; if you write it, it is a work; and so on. What is in here is about the extra stuff.</para>
<para>For people who were directing films and were given moral rights to a film, a director’s moral right essentially recognised the fact that they had a part in the creative process and that our copyright law might say something about that. But there was no money to go with the moral right. There was simply recognition and the fact that they could play some part in what happened to the work they had created. But effectively that part was simply to ensure that what they put together in the first place was not cut to pieces and did not end up on a cutting room floor or as part of a digital wasteland. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline>, part IX of the Copyright Act 1968 refers to:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... the right to be recognised as the author of a work; a right of attribution; and, a right to prevent others from modifying, distorting, or otherwise interfering with the integrity of that work.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That recognition of a moral right gave some slight power over the work that a director was responsible for: it could not be pulled to pieces and used in ways that they did not intend.</para>
<para>As the previous speaker, the member for Gorton, indicated, the government has had more than five years to come up with a result in regard to a discussion of whether there should be not just a moral right but some kind of economic right given to directors. There is a narrow economic right in work that they have been centrally involved in included here in this bill.</para>
<para>When I first looked at the bill, I thought, ‘This is great.’ I thought that it was about time that directors had a say in producing product and the moral right to say that what they had done should not be badly dealt with or handled in such a way as to destroy its validity and its purposefulness. I thought that finally they would be able to make some money out of their part of the creative process. In the film industry, graphic design, animation and a range of areas in Australia the level of remuneration is very small for most people involved. And apart from that level of remuneration, there is the casual nature of a great deal of the work and the uncertainty as to whether people will get work after projects have finished. Often projects will be 12 weeks or so in duration. People live a very uncertain life. For a person who is a key part of that creative process, the director, to be able to get some remuneration is a great thing.</para>
<para>When you look at the detail of the bill, though, that great thing is remarkably reduced. What we are talking about here is not an economic right equivalent to that of a producer. The Copyright Act says that if you are going to make something, if you are the manufacturer of a film or a documentary—if you are the person who puts the whole thing together, the producer—you have a right, a copyright entitlement, and you are the one who can get the money. In order to have that production up and running and sold to free-to-air TV, sold to pay TV or sold for cinematic release, the person who is the engine-driver is the producer. Often the creative genius is simply to see that there is a capacity to make the film in the first place. Quite often, you will find that it is six or eight years in the making. It needs a great deal of dedication. That is economically rewarded for producers.</para>
<para>The problem the government faced here was what would happen if there was recognition that directors actually play a part. Screenwriters and composers who play a part can have a specific copyright: works that they have produced or composed can be protected separately, because they are works. The problem was then whether there should be some kind of remuneration.</para>
<para>It is interesting to note the process here. There was recognition of that. Prior to the last election, after a fairly lengthy period of gestation, the government, in its arts program, said it was going to do something about this. It then had four options on how it might go about it. There was some input in regard to that. But, as I understand it, there was not all that much consultation with directors or the community at large before we got this bill. If you look at the consideration that was given to it by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, that is part of the problem—that, of the options that were there, the option that was finally determined is so narrowly focused that people have argued quite readily that only one to two per cent of people will end up getting a cut out of this.</para>
<para>Why is the provision narrowly focused? Because this creates an economic right for directors only in an area where there has previously been no remuneration whatsoever. There is a right for free-to-air broadcasters to put to air material that they have paid compensation to producers for. They buy the material or the right to use the material. But pay TV have a specific right that allows them to rebroadcast without the intervention of the copyright owner saying, ‘No, you can’t rebroadcast that.’ There is a prescribed right that pay TV can rebroadcast what has been broadcast on free-to-air but they should reasonably compensate those people who own the copyright. Up until this point in time that person would just be the producer. This bill says that we are going to create a new class of economic right for some directors and they will get some compensation out of this once this right is established and once people work out how much they are going to pay.</para>
<para>But the class of directors who are capable of earning anything out of this is narrowed and prescribed, because there are a couple of groups of people who are cut out. One of those means that, if you are directing under contract, you do not get a zack because you do not get any right. If you are employed to produce something, whether it is under contract or as a direct employee, you do not get a zack because there is no economic right. Guess what? Most of the directors are employed or under direct contract—most of the people working for Film Australia, for the larger entities such as Fox Studios and so on. Unless a person is pre-eminent enough to have built their directorial capacity such that they have enough bargaining power to determine what the outcome is, they are going to be in that class of people who will not get much out of it at all.</para>
<para>The reality is that, within Australia, there is only a very small group of people who have any bargaining power. This is part of the broader story—the single individual versus the enterprise. The Labor point of view is that they should be helped and assisted as much as we can, because there is an inequality in economic power and therefore an inequality in economic outcome. There is also the problem that, for those people who work extremely hard, for those who are trying to actually do something to get the engine of the Australian film, video and animation industries up and running, this bill is really not going to do it, despite the fact that it creates this very new small class.</para>
<para>I will give a couple of practical examples of that, which go to another bill: the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Amendment Bill. That bill dealt with those products that were developed in order to push on the Olympic Games in Australia, protecting them for a period of time up until the games. I argued that that should be extended further. There probably was not much reason to extend it further after the games, after the fact, because although a person had the creative genius to invent the mascots—they not only invented them but spent four years developing them on a contractual basis—when we got to the games we ended up with a boxing kangaroo instead of the three official mascots being pushed forward.</para>
<para>I am still annoyed about that because Matthew Hatton, who is my nephew, is the person who invented those. He had the directorial rights in regard to those; he actually produced those works—it was slightly different to what we are dealing with here—but he also did them for the disabled games. What Australia stood to gain from the exploitation of those products was lost, because some boofhead in charge of this program decided that it was all too difficult to have three mascots, so why don’t we just go with the boxing kangaroo. It was a massive loss of what could have been earned for the country—because Matthew had no direct right in terms of what he would get out of it—from the exploitation of these mascots. It was a loss that said a lot about Australia and a lack of creative thinking on the part of the people who were actually in charge of running the games and running this part of the commission. Even worse, to waste four years of creative activity is very strange.</para>

<para>—Minister, I do have a cartoon of Michael Knight done by my nephew Matthew, with Michael on a charger with the three mascots being impaled. I think we get the message. But it was not particularly the minister himself at that time; it was someone within the organisation who had power over this. I think they misused their creative power.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I will go to a further illustration of what can happen and how people on very narrow incomes who should get more out of this, do not. Part of the argument is that not only directors but other people involved in the creative process should have an economic right and be part of this. Matthew is a graphic designer who has moved into the film world. He primarily works at Fox Studios. He lives down there during the week and goes home to Katoomba on the weekend to be with his wife and children. It is a very hard sort of life but one through which he has moved into a much broader range of skills. He has worked with some of the best directors in Australia—George Miller of Kennedy Miller, for instance, who has recently spoken so eloquently about the dire situation of the Australian film industry and the fact that it is necessary to get it re-energised and producing Australian films and film product that is so compelling that Australian audiences will be brought back to it. It is a sad fact that we have had very little of that since 1996.</para>
<para>Matthew’s experience over the last couple of years has been as a storyboard artist. He has been directly involved on the <inline font-style="italic">I, Robot</inline> series of films and on a number of others. He has been directly involved in what I would call directorial work because, as a storyboard artist, each frame of the film comes from him—he has had to draw it up. It is not just about how the film is on a piece of paper but how the film will be realised—where the lighting should come from, where the next shot should be, how it would intersect, whether or not it would work better directorially to have a different camera angle and so on. It is very complex but very rewarding work—not monetarily, but rewarding in what he has been able to gain in extra experience and the fact that he loves the work. But he suffers from what a lot of other people in the industry suffer from: there is not enough remuneration, it is extremely casualised and there is no extra economic input. I doubt that storyboard artists will ever have that, but it is very similar to directors in terms of the creative input; they work together to create this content.</para>
<para>We have in the bill a very narrow focus with the government asking, ‘How do we get out of this problem?’ On the one hand, they have said, ‘We need to do something for directors, but we don’t want to upset the existing producers in the way they raise money to produce stuff. So we will create a new class of right, an economic right, but we will do it in such a way that it will be prescribed that only those free-to-air broadcasts, where previously a producer was paid, which are picked up by pay TV will have an economic right of which directors can be a part while having to share remuneration with producers.’</para>
<para>I hardly think this measure will re-energise the Australian film industry and I doubt whether the minister at the table does either. In his second reading speech he referred to the bill’s scope being made narrow and the fact that it was the right thing to do—and Labor members have had no demur in that regard. But it is also indicative of a fundamental problem: there has not been enough thought given to or enough work done on a key driver of the Australian economy.</para>
<para>I happen to know a little more about that because, in June last year, the report <inline font-style="italic">From reel to unreel: future opportunities for Australian films: animation, special effects and electronic games industries</inline> was brought down in this parliament. It was produced by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, on which I served as deputy chair throughout the last parliament. It was critically clear from those proceedings that the Australian film industry had entered a parlous period—to use a Goughism; it had gone into a trough. There were significant problems with creative input and funding for Australian films. There were further difficulties with greater power, particularly that of the United States. In addition, further problems had occurred in areas where we had had work previously, particularly in post-production. Right throughout production facilities on the Gold Coast—where there is the electorate of the member for Moncrieff, who also served on that committee—the cry arose from those industries that we needed to do a great deal more because things were rapidly changing within the film industry.</para>
<para>One of the key changes has occurred in post-production, where we had had a great deal of strength. Now, because the digital pipes running across the Pacific are much bigger, it is possible for post-production work to be done in Los Angeles and other areas of the United States; those who are putting up big money for these films are choosing to do that work there. So the capacity for people to get post-production work in Australia, in order to fill in between the bits and pieces of casualised work they can find, is being eroded by the march of technology and the capacity of broadband links, but it is also being eroded dramatically simply because there is a determination on the part of major producers in the United States to use their own people because they can now do so. That is one of the reasons we have difficulties.</para>
<para>But there is a further problem in that the engine of growth in terms of creativity in the Australian film industry seems to have died out. If George Miller is right, it is because there is a lack of self-belief in our own product. I think he is right to say that it is not the case that Australians are not bothering to turn up because they can go and look at the footy, because people are more interested in AFL or league or whatever else than they were a few years ago. We just have not put enough energy into producing product that is sufficiently compelling and that will sufficiently tell our stories in the way that we used to. I think a good part of that is the fact that the government just does not seem to get it about the Australian film, games and animation industry. They think they can run on their own. Like many other industries in the past, they need the government behind them. They need the government talking up the industry. They need the government supporting and helping to re-energise the industry. They need an active and innovative government that is willing to go in and put in the effort to support the games industry, which is almost as big now as our film industry in terms of its economic output and its capacity to work within the world market.</para>
<para>So, while I support it, this bill is tragically minor in its approach and tragically minor in its effect. But it is indicative of the fact that the government has a very narrow range of view in regard to one of our biggest and boldest industries—not just one by which we project ourselves to the world but also one where we have earned a great deal of money in the past and where we should earn a great deal of money in the future.</para>

<para>—in reply—I thank honourable members from all sides who have participated in the debate. But, in relation to the comments we have just heard from the member for Blaxland, I might say that he suggested that much of what he had to say was sourced from somebody’s contribution that he had read. I thought his contribution was well informed and reflected his own interest from not only his family linkages but also his experience on the relevant parliamentary committee. I commend him for being a lot less political than some of his colleagues and very much more informed. I hope I have not damned him with faint praise.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The member for Gellibrand has contributed, as has the member for Parramatta, the member for Fraser—the member for Watson had a one-minute intervention—the member for Kingsford Smith and the member for Gorton. If you read their contributions, you will know what I mean. My colleagues the members for Wentworth, Pearce, Fisher and Moncrieff were obviously very much more supportive, as you might expect.</para>
<para>The <inline ref="R2313">Copyright Amendment (Film Directors’ Rights) Bill 2005</inline> is relatively simple. It delivers on a commitment made by the government in its strengthening arts policy at the last election. It delivers that commitment in a way that seeks to balance interests—and there are interests that need to be balanced. The producers may feel that those rights are an incursion on their rights; directors may feel that the rights proposed do not go far enough. The reality is that the government has to seek to strike a balance and, as ever, those issues are difficult.</para>
<para>The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee and the government consulted and heard from key stakeholders and interests. The government and the Senate committee believe the bill strikes the right balance and for the first time will recognise directors as having a share in the copyright of their films. It will give directors a right to share in royalties to be payable by subscription television broadcasters for retransmitting free-to-air broadcast of films. However, as accepted by the committee, the bill will not affect the existing revenue streams on which producers so heavily rely in order to seek investment in the Australian film industry. I might say that it is interesting in the context of this debate how much emphasis was put by some on the need for investment in the Australian film industry.</para>
<para>The bill furthers the government’s aim to recognise and encourage the creative contribution of our many fine Australian directors. At the same time it avoids the potential for adverse effect on investment in Australia’s important film industry and on existing revenue sources that are so vital. I would also like to note that the government is of course proud to be able to move Australian law into line with that of many other countries in the world.</para>
<para>I observed that there were some criticisms. Some suggested there was delay. The member for Gellibrand did this, but the member for Wentworth correctly pointed out that there was a contradiction. While we were on the one hand accused of unreasonable delay, we were also accused of not having consulted enough. If you read some of the submissions to the Senate committee, the consultation was commented on by a number of the contributors. Dr Rimmer said to the Senate committee that the consultation was comprehensive and lengthy because stakeholders could not agree.</para>
<para>It is important to understand the context in which these changes are being addressed. They are not being addressed in isolation. The fact is that there have been many significant changes in Australian copyright law in the last four years or so. There have been major changes around the implementation of the American free trade agreement. There has been parallel importation legislation for software and computer games. I note that there have been other areas in which we have been engaged in undertaking comprehensive reviews. They include the fair use provisions and how they might be implemented to bring us more closely into line with what is happening in the United States; the technological protection measures; and the resale royalty issue, which I have been examining and on which I will have some statements to make shortly.</para>
<para>As members will know from dealing with me over a period of time, I am outcome driven and I want to see these issues moved on, and moved on effectively, but in a way which includes consultation. In relation to some of these issues, I would like to think that, rather than playing the man or woman, we would hear some positive contributions about what is being achieved in areas like this where it is said there is in fact no substantial difference between us. In that context, I thank the members who have contributed but I do not necessarily thank them for the personalised comments where they have been made.</para>
<para>Some other issues were raised. The member for Parramatta raised some issues, which I will write to her about to clarify. But in this matter the government believe that the amendments proposed in the bill honour our commitment in a way which fairly balances stakeholder interests. This legislation represents a milestone in giving recognition to the important creative contribution of directors, without disturbing existing practices for securing investment in the Australian film industry—something which a large number of members have commented on during the course of this debate. Again, I thank all those who have contributed and look forward to the bill receiving a speedy passage.</para>

<para>—Throughout 2004 the inflationary effect of the safety net on specialist fees was apparent to everyone but apparently not to the minister for health. Health journalists reported on the way the safety net was providing obstetricians with an incentive to restructure their fees to shift in-hospital costs to out-of-hospital costs that were then eligible for the safety net rebate. Perhaps this was attractive to patients, but it led to Medicare rebates for obstetricians increasing by 62 per cent from the first quarter in 2004 for the same period in 2005. Obstetrics fees increased by 151.8 per cent in the period from March 2004 to March 2005.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Health care inflation was the real story of the safety net. Out-of-pocket costs for patients for all services have increased by 9½ per cent over the six months to June of this year, with patients now forced to pay an average of $24.61 per medical visit compared to $21.02 last December. But in this legislation there are no solutions to address inflationary health costs, and no amount of savage pruning can avert the safety net’s inevitable demise.</para>
<para>Since its introduction, the safety net has proved to be popular with patients. That was no surprise to the government. After all, it was the centrepiece of their so-called ‘Strengthening Medicare’ campaign at the last election. Within the first three months of the safety net policy, the cumulative number of families and singles that had registered for the safety net had reached half a million, while the first signs of a cost blow-out began to emerge as actual expenditure outgrew the estimated expenditure by 40 per cent. That is quite a blow-out.</para>
<para>Through the work of Senate estimates committees, we know that the Minister for Health and Ageing was well aware of these cost blow-outs by mid-July 2004. By August 2004, when the election was called, the difference between estimated expenditure and actual costs had reached an astounding 70 per cent, but the silence prevailed. Again, Senate estimates hearings revealed that both the minister for health and the minister for finance were aware of this cost blow-out but failed to tell the Australian public prior to the election. Apparently, there is real protection for ministers in the Howard government when it comes to accountability but no protection for the Australian people.</para>
<para>Who can forget that infamous <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners</inline> interview last September in which the health minister—who will no doubt be remembered for this—was asked:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Will this Government commit to keeping the Medicare-plus-safety-net as it is now in place after the election?</para>

</quote>
<para class="block">The minister declared:</para>
<motion>
<para class="block">That is an absolutely rock solid, iron-clad commitment.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">That is more political farce. But it was not just this interview in which the minister misled the Australian people. There were dozens of occasions of deceit. Four days prior to the <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners</inline> interview, the Treasurer had a go. He insisted that the parameters of the Medicare safety net ‘will not change’. Even the Prime Minister got in on the act during an interview with Ray Hadley on radio 2GB when he said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">In fact, we have a better Medicare system now than our opponents are offering because we have this new beaut safety net. If you’re a cardholder or a family tax benefit recipient and your out of hospital out of pocket expenses go over $300 a year, you get 80 per cent of the excess back.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It did not take long for this ‘new beaut safety net’ to unravel. In April 2005, the Prime Minister told ABC radio that if the current threshold levels were maintained, the cost of the safety net would be $1.65 billion over the next four years. The sad stories always emerge. This is almost four times the original projections. So the ‘new beaut safety net’ was indeed in a tangle and would have to be cut after all.</para>
<para>This government’s disregard for the truth and its obvious willingness to betray the trust of the Australian people is scandalous. Let us not forget that the Medicare safety net policy was sold to the Australian people quite literally as part of the Liberal Party’s $20 million advertising campaign—an advertising campaign, paid for by the Australian people, that perpetuated the government’s lies and deceit. It does not get much more scandalous than that, although we do see a lot of repeat offences occurring right now.</para>
<para>Labor opposed the safety net policy at the last election because of its potential to increase health inflation, and instead put forward a range of policies, such as the provision of free specialist services provided through clinics at public hospitals, to address the very real problem of high, cumulative, out-of-pocket health costs. To combat out-of-pocket expenses for GP services, Labor proposed a range of powerful incentives to get doctors bulk-billing again. In March 1996, under Labor, the bulk-billing rate in Newcastle was 83.2 per cent. After nine long years of the Howard government, it is now at 66.9 per cent after reaching its lowest point in December 2003. Under current management, Medicare continues to advantage the more wealthy areas in major cities, while regional and rural areas continue to miss out on the health dollar.</para>
<para>Minister Abbott does seem to be missing in action on many health issues. The crisis in the medical work force compounds the problems of health care delivery in regional and rural Australia. In my electorate, general practices continue to close and patients continue to wait far too long to see their GP. Recruitment of general practitioners to the existing model of health care is just not happening. The latest figures from the Hunter Urban Division of General Practice show that our region has an unacceptably high ratio of one full-time equivalent GP for every 1,485 people. Their survey has also found that almost half of the doctors in our region would not have become GPs if they had their time again, with the top reasons given being paperwork, bureaucracy and government demands.</para>
<para>The Hunter Urban Division of General Practice put forward a proposal to minimise the demands of red tape on GPs, but apparently it has not heard back from the government on this issue. This is disappointing, but not surprising, given that the health minister did not have any idea about what his own department would be submitting to the current Productivity Commission inquiry into the health work force. The Hunter Rural Division of General Practice has also been vocal on the growing GP shortage. This is something they believe could actually cripple rural towns and their hospitals. They are calling for more nurse practitioners and home-grown GPs, but reform, unfortunately, is not on the health minister’s agenda.</para>
<para>Of course, the Medicare safety net broken promise has been well publicised, because John Howard chose to announce it while his minister was overseas, and in a bizarre act of fake contrition Minister Abbott announced that he had considered quitting over the issue. I am sure there will be some in both state and federal politics on his side who will regret that he did not act on that. But the real losers from his mismanagement of the health portfolio are the people of Australia. Rather than tackle real reform of this difficult portfolio, the government has simply walked away from the challenge and put the burden back on individuals, who now have to fend for themselves.</para>
<para>Another example is the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme—a Labor designed scheme. Unfortunately, in the face of the ever-escalating cost of the PBS, the Howard government has only ever had one response: increase patient contributions. Following the latest increase of the co-payment in the first six months of 2005, the number of concessional scripts written grew by only one per cent. There is a real fear that this slowdown represents poorer, older Australians and chronically ill Australians, who are finding it increasingly difficult to afford their medicines due to the co-payment increase. In my own electorate, I am told of aged people halving their dosages to make their medications last longer. This is not much of a saving given the health risks such actions can lead to.</para>
<para>Minister Abbott has compounded this risk. In August this year, he actually invented a whole new category of medicines on the PBS to which a special patient contribution applies. What is so ‘special’ about this new patient contribution? It conveniently plugs the funding black hole created by another of Minister Abbott’s broken election promises—to make $1 billion in savings to the PBS through his failed 12.5 per cent price-cutting policy. It just never happened.</para>
<para>The minister favours the bludgeon over the scalpel when it comes to managing health care costs. He has failed to effectively manage the detail of the PBS budget, so he is hitting out at the chronically ill to make up for it. He is slugging the sufferers of lung cancer, epilepsy and depression to pay for his failure to negotiate proper pricing arrangements. The minister apparently no longer has the stomach to take on the big guys, so he is taking on the ones who cannot fight back. So, for example, lung cancer sufferers are paying a ‘special patient contribution’ of $460 for the medicine Alimta.</para>
<para>Cancer Council of New South Wales statistics show that Hunter residents are more likely to die of cancer than those in any other part of New South Wales; cancer death rates are higher than the New South Wales average. It is widely accepted that for most forms of cancer early detection is one of the key factors in increasing the chances of survival. Yet the people of the Hunter have no access to Medicare rebates for positron emission tomography—PET—scans. PET scans are effective in the early detection of head, neck, lung, bone, colorectal and bladder cancers. The scans are also extremely accurate in the staging of cancer—that is, determining how advanced a cancer is and therefore being able to determine the most appropriate treatment.</para>
<para>Next year about 5,000 residents of the Hunter and New England region are expected to be diagnosed with some form of cancer. Yet Medicare-rebated PET scans are only available at two hospitals in Sydney. This is despite Newcastle’s Mater Hospital already having a PET scanner installed and running. Indeed, the PET scanner was purchased and can now scan limited numbers of patients using money raised through local cancer and nuclear medicine specialist trust funds, local community support and the activities of various local organisations. Given the cancer rates for my region, the demand for this service far outstrips its capacity, and people have to go to Sydney. I again repeat that Labor in the last election made the offer of making sure that regions had access to Medicare-rebated PET scans. I call on the government, as has the state government and as has our local Newcastle City Council, to make sure that Medicare rebates are given to PET scans in the Hunter.</para>
<para>The Australian people are sick—they are sick of the Howard government slugging patients to patch up a health system that its unrealistic election promises continue to punch holes in. If Mr Abbott had any fight left in him at all, he would use his energies and he would take up the challenge. He would start with supporting Labor’s amendments to limit the damage from this flawed legislation and take on real health reform to benefit every Australian.</para>

<para>—I would like to start my contribution on the <inline ref="R2376">Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005</inline> with an observation after a period of approximately nine or 10 months in this House. Often in addressing legislation there is a very clear difference among the ministers of the government who are presenting the legislation. Sometimes I am faced with a minister who has a genuine interest in their policy area, a real commitment to understanding the challenges that the nation faces in that policy area, and who is putting forward legislation that they genuinely believe will make a positive difference. Sometimes on this side of the House we agree with that legislation, sometimes we do not. But in many of those cases, despite the fact that I might vehemently disagree with the solutions they are putting forward, I can respect the commitment and professionalism that goes into what they are trying to present. On the other hand, as is the case tonight, I feel quite honestly that the Minister for Health and Ageing has very little interest in his policy area. In fact, this minister demonstrates a level of arrogance about his policy area. Having made that comment and that distinction about the frontbench on the other side of the House, I will leave it up to the individual frontbench ministers of the government to decide which category they fall into. I only want to identify that I particularly feel that the minister who is presenting the bill to us tonight falls into the latter category.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The minister consistently presents a very political and a very short-term view in the way that he handles his portfolio. It reminds me of a sporting team or a business team which, faced with a particularly strong opponent or problem, gets together and says: ‘Look, guys, we need somebody to go out there and to take a fall to take the other team out. It’s going to destroy your credibility. You’ll look like a complete idiot afterwards, but you’ll be doing it for team and we’ll all appreciate it.’ I think the minister for health is one of those who goes: ‘Yes, pick me. I’m up for that challenge. I’ll take one for the team.’ He does that in the hope that, when he comes back to the locker room, they will like him so much better. That is exactly what has happened on this occasion. This bill has clearly destroyed the credibility of the Minister for Health and Aging. After his ‘rock solid, ironclad guarantee’ no-one believes a word he says.</para>
<para>One of the most transparent tactics to use when you actually know little about your portfolio, have no commitment or interest to it and are merely filling that seat because that is what is available to you is that you believe that if you repeat a mantra often enough it will become truth. The reality is that mantras are powerful in politics, but only if there is some substance behind them. In this case, the minister for health’s repeated claims that this government is ‘the best friend that Medicare has ever had’ covers an absolute absence of solid commitment. In fact, what we have seen, particularly in the run-up to the election, where most of the current health policy that we are dealing with in legislation came from, is that little player from the team running out, saying whatever he has to, willingly and in the full knowledge that he will take a fall after the election in the hope that the team will be grateful. I suspect that they are less than grateful, to be honest, given the decreasing enthusiasm for his repeated mantra in the place of solid policy decisions and sound arguments on behalf of those positions.</para>
<para>This bill changes the thresholds which will apply on the Medicare safety net. It raises the threshold from $300 to $500 for low-income earners and increases the threshold from $700 to $1,000 for others. But it also changed the threshold of truth in election commitments. The minister was directly challenged on whether or not this very piece of legislation would ever appear in this House after the election. That is when he said it was a ‘rock solid, ironclad’ guarantee. He set his own benchmark. He set it high, and he failed it abysmally. It is a broken promise, and the minister should, at the very least, resign his portfolio.</para>
<para>The very least our constituents expect of each of us is the truth: fact not fiction. They do not mind a change in position or a change of mind, especially if they are convinced that those changes are the result of new information such as a financial blow-out. But what they expect is the truth, the old-fashioned ‘facing the music’. Instead, they were fed misleading information and one-liners by the minister and the Prime Minister in repeated interviews, doorstops and, indeed, massively publicly funded commercial television, radio and newspaper advertising. They were told that the Medicare safety net was safe. It was responsible. It was a rock solid, ironclad guarantee. It would not change. It would not be altered in any way, said both the minister and the Prime Minister. It was fully costed. It was funded in the budget, assured both the minister and the Prime Minister.</para>
<para>The $20 million advertising spree repeated those assurances, sometimes three or four times a night with viewing on commercial television. I have to say that I have constituents who complain about being harassed by advertisers on the telephone. Many of them expressed to me the feeling that this particular advertising campaign was very similar. It was a massive advertising campaign.</para>
<para>All the while, however, the government fully knew that their Medicare safety net was blowing out, that it was inflationary and putting considerable pressure on budget outlays. Did they tell anyone? Did they even hint that there might be problems? No. Why not? Because there was an election to be won. There was a public to try and dupe.</para>
<para>Labor, however, knew there was a problem. We knew the Medicare safety net policy was blowing out. We knew it was inflationary. We knew its weight could not be sustained in the budget forward estimates. We said so. We opposed the policy because we knew that it was irresponsible. We knew it was a bandaid for the health system of this country—indeed, we knew it was a bandaid for the electoral fortunes of the government at the election. For our trouble, of course, the government led a chorus of indignation. Those opposite said that we were running a scare campaign to frighten families and pensioners. We were, it was claimed, undermining Medicare. The government urged anyone who would listen to believe the television and radio ads.</para>
<para>But it all came crashing down in this house of cards after the election. The Prime Minister rushed out just prior to the budget to announce that Labor had in fact been right all along—although, if I recollect correctly, he did not actually put it in those terms. Out came the measure to increase the threshold and rein in the fiscal blow-out. The minister, of course, having taken his fall and having been made to look like a fool in his own portfolio area, was nowhere in sight, with no credibility and nothing to say on a major issue in his portfolio.</para>
<para>Many issues relating to the health portfolio have been on the political agenda this year. We recall that the Prime Minister—the Prime Minister, I would point out, not the clayton’s health minister, who obviously has no real interest in his policy area—established a task force inquiry into the health interface after the election. The report, while leaked in parts—and I do not believe there has been any pursuit of that leaking—has not been sighted. COAG is currently assessing health services through a committee and is scheduled to report by the end of this year. Several of the state premiers have been making comment on potential changes to health arrangements. All the while, the minister has said nothing and done nothing constructive, his only contribution being to put up private health insurance premiums—the tick that he is quite happy to provide every year—and to withdraw medicines from the PBS.</para>
<para>When the minister was appointed to counter the very effective campaign of highlighting this government’s dismal performance on bulk-billing and hospitals by my colleague the shadow minister for health, the minister was a veritable ferris wheel of ideas and proposals. He even proposed a takeover of funding and administering hospitals by the Commonwealth. The minister has no credibility on health matters, which has been proven time and time again. He should do the decent thing and resign the portfolio, but the minister will stay to tough it out, because ruthless arrogance abides in these sorts of decisions in the government today. It is the same extreme and ruthless arrogance that promotes an industrial relations agenda with no need to explain why it is truly necessary for Australia’s future.</para>
<para>The government considers that its part in explaining anything can be done by a quick television, radio and newspaper ad, no price too large—$20 million for industrial relations, $20 million for Medicare. We are more than happy to outspend Coca-Cola on advertising in this nation. Since it came to office in 1996, this government has spent nearly $1 billion on advertising alone, not only more than Coca-Cola but more than Toyota or indeed McDonald’s. John Howard has become an adman with absolutely no peer.</para>
<para>But the health minister cannot dodge the statement he made on a doorstop on 16 September last year. He said: ‘I absolutely guarantee that the safety net, as the government has put it into operation, will continue. I absolutely guarantee that. This government does not believe in cutting health spending. The MBS is not a budget limited, bureaucratically controlled program.’ Perhaps it should have been. This language is as unequivocal as you can get. A statement was made to the press, laden with words like ‘absolutely’, ‘guarantee’ and ‘we do not believe in cutting health spending’. What precisely does this bill do? It cuts health spending and reduces access. I am sure the Treasurer was probably one of those egging on the minister to go out and take the fall for the team. The Department of the Treasury, and Finance, have made it clear that the MBS is indeed budget limited and bureaucratically controlled. This is the point of this bill.</para>
<para>The minister has been forced to eat his own words—to squirm through his broken promises and his misleading of Australians before the election. The minister has not told us precisely when he knew that the Medicare safety net was in trouble. He should come clean in this debate. He should try to regain some credibility as the Minister for Health and Ageing. It is clear from information Labor obtained through Senate estimates—a process that the government, with its control of the Senate, now wants to tame—that the department knew that the Medicare safety net was in strife in mid-July 2004. Bear in mind that this policy was adopted by the government only in March of that year.</para>
<para>The pattern of blow-out in expenditure continued throughout the caretaker period, which began on 29 August 2004. It is absolutely inconceivable that the minister was not aware that the Medicare safety net policy was a financial albatross, which this side of the House had predicted. Indeed, not only was the policy flawed but data which the minister released on 16 September 2004 indicated that the rebates paid under the Medicare safety net policy were heavily skewed in favour of high-income electorates. The rebate figures released by the minister revealed that poorer electorates received very little benefit from this safety net. In my electorate, for example, the safety net rebate for September was $144,037. In the electorate of my colleague the member for Throsby the rebate was just $74,117. Compare this with Bradfield, $911,828; Wentworth, $822,545; or indeed the minister’s own electorate, which received $634,791. Even the cheapest of the government ministers’ electorates received five times that of an electorate such as mine. Bennelong, the electorate of the Prime Minister, scored payments of $419,895.</para>
<para>The Medicare safety net policy is a fiasco. The minister will not release an update of the statistics that he published last September to enable me to provide this House with an updated position—although I doubt very much that he would have hesitated to release those figures if the situation had changed and a more equitable share of that Medicare safety net money had been spread across all areas. The threshold increases—in other words, the cut to Medicare accessibility that this bill will implement—exclude one million people, or ‘claiming units’ in the sterile language of the bureaucray, from eligibility for the safety net. I believe that Australians have a right to know how the excluded one million ‘claiming units’ will be apportioned. The minister should provide details during the course of this debate, as he should have done prior to the election.</para>
<para>The other minister who should bear some responsibility for this fiasco is the Minister for Finance and Administration, who sits in the other place. Clearly, he was the team player who said, ‘No, I won’t go out and take that fall; I’m sure my colleague’s much more appropriately placed to do so.’ Several weeks ago, on the ABC <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> program, my colleague the honourable member for Melbourne called the minister a soft target and a cheque writer for this government’s policy incompetence. The minister’s weak rejoinder was to ask Maxine McKew if it was comedy hour. The time line of the safety net fiasco, which Labor had to tease out during Senate estimates, confirms that the ministers for health and finance, joined by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister, could take this show on the comedy festival tour circuit.</para>
<para>It would be a comedy hour if the issues were not so serious. The cover-up, denial and outright misleading of the electorate are hallmarks of this government’s policies and they are the strategies of a health minister with no commitment to better health outcomes for Australians. The absolute hollowness of the so-called Charter of Budget Honesty has been revealed. The charter, enshrined in the statute books, is a joke. Apart from using the Senate estimates process, Labor had its initial scepticism of the safety net policy confirmed by the charter process. The massive blow-out in the budget’s forward estimates was confirmed only when Labor sought Treasury’s and Finance’s costings of our pledge to abolish the government’s program.</para>
<para>The unfairness of the Charter of Budget Honesty has been raised in this place by my colleague the honourable member for Fraser, and I consider that his concerns are well founded. The honourable member for Lalor outlined in a speech in Queensland the operation of the Congressional Budget Office in the United States. I strongly believe that all members should seriously consider the establishment of such an office in the Australian parliament.</para>
<para>Health care is fundamental to Australia’s wellbeing. Labor governments, from Chifley to Keating, have recognised that the nation’s health care is vital to so many other policy areas—to name just two: the labour market and the productivity growth of the nation. A healthy people with access to medicines, doctors and hospitals has been the principle of Australian health care for the Labor Party. It is why the PBS was established, why Medibank was founded and why Medicare was created. Labor built the health care system to cater for people regardless of income. I do not want to see a return to the days when Australian families put off seeing the doctor, until they could stand the pain of sickness no more, because they did not have the cash in their wallet—or, indeed, because they had such a large outstanding debt that the debt collectors were after them. I do not want to see a return to the days when the choices of a mother were to pay the mortgage, to put food on the table or to visit the local GP.</para>
<para>There is a very good book entitled <inline font-style="italic">The politics of Medicare: who gets what, when and how</inline> by Gwendolyn Gray. It was published by the University of New South Wales Press. Anyone interested in the complexity of the Australian health care system should read it. I am sure that that the author would be happy to put out an abridged version with cartoons for the minister. The books says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">For over 50 years, Australian health care policy has oscillated backwards and forwards between systems of private and public health insurance. Each time a Labor government has introduced a public scheme, an incoming coalition government has dismantled it. Radical change of this magnitude is unique: nowhere in the OECD have major programs been introduced and terminated with every change of national government.</para>

</talker>
<para>—It is fair to say that the <inline ref="R2376">Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005</inline> is just another example of the incompetence and arrogance of the Howard government. It is a bald statement of the Howard government’s contempt for the Australian voting public. As my colleague the shadow minister for health, Julia Gillard, has said in this place previously, from the time this bill was first legislated it was abundantly clear to every health expert that the design flaw in the safety net was that it was going to be inflationary and it was therefore inevitable that the costs would blow out. History has proven us right.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This was a problem lost only on Minister Tony Abbott and the Howard government generally. There is a collective responsibility for the Howard government to front up to the fact that, without a doubt, it has misled the Australian voting public with respect to its proposed Medicare safety net. Certainly the government knew from a Health Insurance Commission audit in 2004 that the scheme, budgeted at $440 million over four years, was going to blow out to around $1.2 billion. The government had knowledge of those figures, yet the Australian public are asked by the health minister, the finance minister, the cabinet and the Howard government collectively to believe that they knew nothing about it and therefore were not required to take the Australian voting public into their confidence with respect to this proposed blow-out. This is incompetence and arrogance in the extreme.</para>
<para>Alternatively, perhaps we should seriously think about whether or not the Howard government did understand the implications but were prepared to deliberately mislead the Australian public for the sake of political expediency. That is the real question that we have to consider in this debate. Perhaps they really knew the figures and sought to go out of their way not to make them fully known to the Australian public. This is borne out by the history of the Howard government’s announcements on the Medicare safety net. I remind the House that the safety net was rushed through this place to give the government an advertising platform on health in the lead-up to the 2004 election, just 12 months ago.</para>
<para>We all know that the Howard government had their eyes firmly set on their own re-election and firmly off any suggestion that elections are about truth and honesty in government. The Minister for Health and Ageing, Mr Abbott, and the Prime Minister and their associates repeatedly guaranteed the voting public, the Australian community, that the safety net would stay in the form that it was in prior to the election. That was a bald, black-and-white undertaking given by the minister for health and the Prime Minister to the Australian community. They very clearly stated on numerous occasions that the $300 and $700 thresholds would proceed, not the $500 and $1,000 thresholds now proposed by this bill before the House.</para>
<para>The minister for health, Tony Abbott, likes to promote himself in the eyes of the coalition government and the Australian public as a knock-around bloke who likes to keep his word. He likes to shake hands and enter into ironclad guarantees with people who he gives his word to. I want to remind the House of what the minister for health infamously said. He said:</para>
<motion>
<para class="block">That is an absolutely rock solid, iron-clad commitment.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">He went on to say that the $300 and $700 thresholds would stay. He did not say anything about raising them to $500 and $1,000 respectively. What worries me is that this is not the first, nor will it be the last, occasion that that type of commitment has been given by the Howard government, especially during the course of an election campaign.</para>
<para>By way of further example, I can think of another serious problem confronting the Australian public where similar ‘ironclad guarantees’ were given by a senior government minister during the course of the 2004 election campaign. I move from the ‘ironclad guarantee’ of the Medicare safety net given by the minister for health, Tony Abbott, to a similar ‘ironclad guarantee’ given by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell, with respect to the proposed location of a low-level nuclear waste disposal unit.</para>
<para>I want to take the House to the transcript of a radio interview concerning a nuclear waste dump on Thursday, 30 September 2004 on Darwin radio. It raises similar images to the minister for health’s ‘ironclad guarantees’ on the Medicare safety net during the campaign and reinforces why the Australian community should no longer trust the Howard government. We have heard before about core and non-core promises and honesty and integrity in government. So let us go to another example of what they did during the election campaign and what has occurred since the election. We note that, since the election, all of a sudden this nuclear waste dump should be located at one of potentially three areas in the Northern Territory. This is what Senator Campbell said on Darwin radio about a nuclear waste dump:</para>

<para>—It is also related to the fact that, in terms of health care and the Medicare safety net, the waste from nuclear medicine is the type of waste that will be stored in the low-level dump proposed by the Howard government for the Northern Territory. It is clearly related to the bill before the House this evening. On his undertaking to the people of the Northern Territory, Senator Campbell went on to say:</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<quote>
<para class="block">So we can be quite categorical about that cause. The Northern Territory is on the mainland. And can we also say that our preferred option and the only options that we are pursuing are on the offshore islands.</para>

<para class="block">He then went on to say that this:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">… is interesting given the nature of the debate before the house this evening. “We had decided to be very open and honest about where we want to pursue a waste dump.”</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Senator Campbell was building up his capacity to give that undertaking to the Australian public about a nuclear waste dump. It reminds me of Minister Abbott’s statement when he said that it was an absolutely ‘rock-solid, ironclad commitment’ with respect to the Medicare safety net. This is how Senator Campbell builds himself up as a person of integrity and standing. I quote:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I—</para>

<para class="block">Minister Campbell—</para>

</quote>
<para class="block">Mr Tollner—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">asked me to come on the program and make a definitive statement and I’ve made that.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He then went on to suggest that, alternatively, the Labor Party was running a scare campaign about the Howard government’s real intentions about the new low-level dump and the proposal to locate it in the Northern Territory. I simply use that by way of example to reinforce that, be it on the Medicare safety net—the bill before the House this evening—or, alternatively, where a nuclear waste dump is to be located in Australia, the Howard government is a serial offender when it comes to misleading the Australian electorate. There are numerous examples of this government saying one thing during the course of an election campaign—giving ‘ironclad guarantees’—and doing another thing after the election. In essence, the government cons the Australian public into believing one thing—the so-called core promise—and then does another thing after the election: the Prime Minister’s famously coined phrase, the ‘non-core promise’. This issue is at the crux of the proposals before the House this evening.</para>
<para>I suggest that the safety net is therefore very unattractive, because it is not what the Australian public voted for at the last election. It is a serious decision by the Howard government to break an election promise, and I therefore reject the statement by the Minister for Health and Ageing in his second reading speech where he says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Increasing the Medicare safety net thresholds has been a tough decision.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It was not a tough decision. The minister for health basically said, ‘I got away with it. We won the election and I got away with it, and to hell with the Australian public. If they were silly enough to believe me, that’s their stupidity and I’m the winner.’ That is the type of conduct we have to consider when we look at how the Howard government conducts itself with respect to serious public policy issues in Australia. I believe it was either Howard government incompetence or Howard government lies, and I encourage the Australian public to seriously consider that question.</para>
<para>The minister for health, Mr Abbott, and the Howard government have never been interested in the real problem. The real problem is the growing out-of-pocket expenses of Australians when they need to see a specialist or take a diagnostic technological opportunity. As it has done in many other areas, including child care and health, the Howard government has structured a program that encourages the providers of services to increase their fees, a program that means that those who are supposed to benefit are short-changed yet again. Not only are consumers facing higher costs as providers raise their prices in response to the safety net provision, but the changes proposed to lift the thresholds now mean that the most disadvantaged in our community will suffer yet again. For the wealthy in our community, such as a minister of the Crown—the minister for health, Mr Abbott—an extra $200 or $500 is not hard to find. For those types of people, it will guarantee that their health care needs and those of their families, their children and their parents are met, because they can afford it. But, for middle-income Australians and the poorer members of our community, another $200 or $500 before higher rebates kick in will not be easy to find. That effectively means that, unfortunately for the health of this nation, a sizeable section of the Australian community is potentially going to place its health outcomes at serious risk. In the long term, that is going to cost the Australian public more because of the potential deterioration in the health of Australians.</para>
<para>As all the available statistical information proves, the least wealthy in our community face poorer health outcomes than the wealthiest in the Australian community. There is real pressure on these people at the moment, and this potential change in the safety net will only make it more difficult for these people to try to attend to the essentials of life. Lower income households spend just $22 a week on health, whilst the wealthiest households spend about $77 a week on health. This means that there are people in our community who are simply going to go without treatment because they cannot pay for health care. This is on top of all the other pressures that we are experiencing as a community at the moment.</para>
<para>I will just refer in passing to the spiralling costs of fuel. To be truthful, there is little we can do at this point because of international pressures, but we have people now at the lower income levels who have to make decisions about whether to fill the tank every week or every second week, whether to put food on the table for their children, whether they can afford a school excursion or whether they can afford a pair of runners necessary for the kids to put shoes on their feet. They are the hard decisions that Australian battlers have to make at this point in time. They have to make choices about whether to spend a dollar on food for the table or whether to use the money to fill the tank. On top of that, they are now going to be in serious difficulties with respect to their health care and that of their families.</para>
<para>Rather than making it harder for them, I think we as a community ought to be trying to help these people to maintain their health and, where possible, improve their health care. The truth is that many of these people will not be able to meet the increase in costs associated with the proposed changes to the Medicare safety net. That means, beyond any doubt, that under the Howard government universal health care has disappeared. It fulfils the long-term ambition of the Prime Minister to always develop a two-tiered system—one system for the most wealthy and one system for the least wealthy. In essence, more than ever those with less just have to go without.</para>
<para>But that is not new; it is the philosophy of the Howard government right across the board. It is about accepting a growing divide in the Australian community between the haves and the have-nots. One million people who otherwise would have qualified for the safety net will no longer qualify under the higher thresholds. That is a sizeable section of the Australian community—one million people. They are the people already doing it the toughest. They are likely to be from middle Australia or the poorest parts of our community. The safety net is highly skewed towards the wealthiest electorates and away from the poorest electorates in Australia. Some of the poorer electorates, I might say, are represented by coalition members, especially in regional communities. They ought to seriously think about the impact of the changes to the Medicare safety net before the House.</para>
<para>The proposed increase will exacerbate the situation. In particular, as I have stated, people in rural and regional Australia will suffer. For them, access to specialist services and diagnostic care often involves taking time off from work, at additional cost, or taking time away from their families to travel to the services, with additional costs. That is in addition to all the proposed additional costs which are going to be put in place by the bill before the House. It is in stark contrast to the proposals by the opposition for a decent, attainable, universal health care system. We should remember that, during the last election campaign, Labor proposed the provision of specialist outpatient clinics and access to diagnostic technologies in public hospitals—a huge proposal. People who need specialist care or diagnostic services would have been able to access them with no gaps and no out-of-pocket expenses.</para>
<para>The Labor proposal entails a system which does not send price signals to service providers to take a slice of the pie from the safety net. This system focuses on the real problems of the less well off in our community, such as their inability to pay out-of-pocket expenses for health care services that they and their families need. Labor is for a universal health care system, not health care and health outcomes based on whether or not you can afford to pay for them. That is the crux of the debate.</para>
<para>Labor does not support this bill. It condemns the government’s two-tiered approach to Medicare and health outcomes. I totally reject the statement made by the Minister for Health and Ageing at the beginning of his second reading speech to the bill, where he said:</para>
<quote>
<para>The Howard government is committed to protecting and strengthening Medicare and delivering high quality, affordable health care to all Australians.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The bill does the exact opposite. As an alternative, I say on behalf of the opposition that Labor in government would deliver a fairer, more equitable Medicare system which would strive for good health outcomes for all Australians irrespective of their level of wealth and which would provide access to health care services on the basis of need, not the capacity to pay for health care services or to buy health outcomes.</para>
<para>I will finish on this point: given the example of this Medicare safety net bill and a range of other examples over the last 9½ years, the Australian public has to seriously think about whether it will take the Howard government’s word seriously yet again. The government says one thing during election campaigns and does another thing after elections. From as early as I can remember, I was taught that if you give your word you keep it. No-one can believe the minister for health, Tony Abbott, when he says yet again to the Australian public, ‘I propose an ironclad guarantee.’ I suggest that when he says that in the future he will be proposing a deliberate lie. He will go out of his way to mislead the voting public and con them with one thing before the election and then walk away from the undertaking after the election. The opposition is correct to raise these issues, because this is a debate not just about the Medicare safety net; it is a debate about honesty and integrity in government and whether you can trust the Howard government yet again.</para>

<para>—The <inline ref="R2376">Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005</inline> attempts to modify the extended Medicare safety net, which came into effect on 12 March 2004. Under this so-called safety net, Medicare meets 80 per cent of out-of-pocket expenses for professional services provided out of hospital once an annual threshold is reached—all a little complex for the average family. The annual threshold is currently $300, as indexed, for concession card holders and families in receipt of the family tax benefit part A; and $700, as indexed, for all other persons. Indexation is applied annually to the thresholds as per section 10A of the Health Insurance Act 1973. In accordance with the legislation, the thresholds were indexed on 1 January 2005 at $306.90 for the lower threshold and at $716.10 for the higher threshold.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Safety net thresholds have been increased because the government have suddenly realised this is costing them more. The thresholds will be increased to $500 for concessional individuals and families in receipt of FTBA and to $1,000 for all other individuals and families. As the thresholds are to be set at $500 and $1,000 for 2006, indexation will not be applied to these amounts for 2006, but will be applied from 1 January 2007 and will be indexed annually thereafter, as prescribed in section 10A of the act.</para>
<para>This legislation is not acceptable in its current form and is a broken promise from the election. The Minister for Health and Ageing sold the Australian people a big lie. This government should be criticised for the decision to increase the amount people must pay for health care before the Commonwealth’s Medicare safety net catches them so soon after the election, where it was a foundation of the Liberal Party health policy. But they deserve far more censure for adopting this safety net in the first place. It was Medicare fool’s gold, bad politics and worse economics. It was exactly the sort of expensive tripe the health minister has been bribing the electorate with since the wobbles at the start of 2001—costly policies, poorly targeted, that are politically difficult for him now to claw back.</para>
<para>We had a universal Medicare system where everybody had access to health care whatever their circumstances. Those who could paid a levy through their income tax, and those who could not could access all the essential services free of charge. That was a Labor reality and it worked well. People could take out private health insurance if they wanted to for elective care but, if they could not afford it, they could still get proper care. There were no second-class citizens under Labor.</para>
<para>Hospitals could also get access to proper funding, were not fighting with private hospitals for private insurance money and were funded to do the emergency job that they are equipped to do. Even private hospitals refer patients when they cannot deal with them. What have we got with this situation? A huge load on the federal government’s budget that they have decided they cannot afford. A recent article by Leeder and Boxhall published on New Matilda puts it more clearly. It says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Health accounts for a substantial and growing proportion of the government’s total budget and of national expenditure - in 1991-92, according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare health costs amounted to 8.1% of GDP and 9.5% by 2002-03. The Departments of Treasury and Finance undertook a detailed costing analysis of the safety net policy prior to the election. The department identified the likely cost blow-out. When quizzed after the election about this assessment, Abbott pleaded ignorance, claiming that departmental officials had not told him about it before the election. This is reminiscent of other missing intelligence concerning the ‘children overboard’ scandal, when the Prime Minister claimed that he (like Mr Abbott in the next election) was never informed that the children had not been thrown overboard.</para>
<para class="block">Yet, the safety net policy design faults should have been obvious to Mr Abbott’s staff, even if Treasury had kept the unworkability of the safety net to themselves. Perhaps Mr Abbott himself might have guessed that it would not work. Because the safety net is an uncapped subsidy for the cost of medical treatment, it was inevitable that Medicare items would expand to include services previously not covered (like a lot of fringe services for women undergoing IVF) and that medical fees would also rise. These flaws in the policy should have rung alarm bells for the government for two reasons: first, an understanding of them is basic economics, and second, the precedent of what happened with the private health insurance rebate.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I am not an expert on things medical or economic, but I believe that the flaws that these people are pointing out are very serious and that the government is just flicking them off as though the health of some 500,000 Australian people does not matter. Where have we seen this recently? Perhaps with the Prime Minister’s best friend, George Dubya, flicking off those unfortunates trying to survive in New Orleans.</para>
<para>Following the estimates investigation after the budget this year, it was plain that the government must have known the problems. Our shadow minister Julia Gillard pointed out in an <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> commentary on 28 May 2005:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The inconsistencies that have been revealed in Senate estimates have revealed the Howard Government’s true agenda on the Medicare safety net. The Howard Government never intended to keep it.</para>
<para class="block">The Medicare safety net was a cruel hoax and Senator Minchin clearly played his part.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">And the health minister still did not know there was going to be a blow-out? Even Senator Harradine picked up that this legislation was a pig in a poke. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">In negotiations with the Government it was clear it was not willing to put in the required money to provide some guarantee of reviving Medicare bulk-billing rates. So the only way to offer some protection for people against high out-of-pocket, non-hospital medical costs was to have a safety net.</para>
<para class="block">A safety net is necessary because medical costs are increasing, but the insurance coverage offered to patients through Medicare is not keeping up. The increasing gap between the Medical Benefits Schedule and what doctors charge is hurting Australians.</para>
<para class="block">... as bulk billing becomes less available, fees become more common. The safety net is about giving low-income families real cash relief because they face real fees ... Now those families face an extra $200 before any relief.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The doctors themselves are not impressed with the changes, as can be gathered from an article in <inline font-style="italic">New Doctor</inline> in 2001. This article points out that a health scheme based on public funding is ‘best at cost containment, equity and efficiency’. It says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Federal Government continues to express support for Medicare. However, some of its actions suggest it is slowly moving away from the Medicare system as it was originally conceived.</para>
<para class="block">Instead of putting extra resources into solving real problems of the public health system, the Government has put these into private health insurance—despite its demonstrated inefficiencies and poor value. The provision of massive subsidies totalling some $2.5 billion per annum to private health insurance contradicts the international evidence about the best way to fund health services.</para>
<para class="block">International experience demonstrates health systems which rely predominantly on public funding and public provision of services are generally best at cost containment, equity and efficiency. While Australia has a mixed system the Federal Government appears bent on shifting us closer to a publicly funded private provision model. International evidence proves that reliance on private health insurance cannot achieve universal access and equity.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">These arguments reflect that many people have assessed this new Medicare and found it wanting. With these proposed changes, we have a scheme that is costing the government more than it needs to. The government is continuing to prop up the private insurance companies and is now making pay those who can least afford to and those who now rely on the government’s safety net. I can see many families just not going to the doctor because they cannot afford those first payments. If they have to see a specialist and the dollars mount up for them, it is going to be less and less likely that people on fixed incomes will take this up.</para>
<para>This costs the government in the long run. But it is a way this federal government transfers costs to the state. Hospitals have to pick up these cases when they become critical. People who do not go to the doctor when they are ill and who end up critical are picked up by the state public health systems. We are not like America, and I do not want to see us copy these American ways, where you have to pay up front to see a doctor and you can be admitted to hospital only if you have the cash in your hand. This is what the federal government wants—everybody to pay.</para>
<para>It has been bad enough with the Telstra debate in this lower house. Few people could actually comment on the legislation in detail as it was not introduced into the parliament until late in yesterday’s sitting. Parliament must be allowed to debate these issues properly and to scrutinise legislation. This bill is yet another example of sloppy and rushed workmanship. The government is hoping to solve a problem that it has created by knocking off all the good points of Medicare.</para>
<para>I am not happy with this legislation. It once again waters down the whole purpose of Medicare and sets the agenda for getting rid of Medicare altogether. I am very worried and very disappointed that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Ageing have broken their promises again. This minister is not on the case of health; he has failed. He has shown that he cannot win arguments in his cabinet—or that he never wanted to. There are ironclad guarantees and millions of dollars spent on advertising. This was a political exercise by this government that the Australian people should remember. They lied to the Australian people and this bill shows that they have.</para>

<para>—There are lies, damned lies and statistics. It would not matter which measurement from those three that you chose, the Minister for Health and Ageing would be found wanting. In all my time here I have never seen anything so ephemeral as what we see before us today, statistically put line by line in this flimsy bill, the <inline ref="R2376">Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005</inline>—except the outcomes for the people who have been conned by the minister for health and by the Prime Minister; less so by the Treasurer, because he did not involve himself in this as much as the others. People have been conned for more than a year, from November 2003, when this was first mooted.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>When the government first looked at bringing in a Medicare safety net it was a ‘magnificent idea’ from the minister for health—someone on the way up, someone charging towards the future leadership of the party. It was some bright idea from a former practising journalist that would grab the attention not only of the media but also of the public at large. What a ‘beaut little idea’, in the words of the Prime Minister—a beaut little thing to have to fix the out-of-pocket expenses of people who had to spend extraordinary amounts in the medical area. Once people reached a certain level of expenditure it would refund 80 per cent of those out-of-pocket expenses. So if someone went to a GP and the GP did not charge the prescribed fee but charged $100, or if they went to an obstetrician and the obstetrician, as a guiding specialist, charged $10,000, both the $100 and the $10,000 could be taken into account as out-of-pocket expenses.</para>
<para>Everyone in this country knows that specialists are more expensive than GPs. I think that by now, since March 2004 when the original bill was before parliament, there is not a person in the parliament or in the community at large who does not know that—apart from the minister for health. The penny does not seem to have dropped yet for the minister for health, who has attempted to defend himself month after month, week after week, in tragic incident after tragic incident in relation to the core of this bill. Even the minister for health should have known, given the advice that the people in his department gave him before this bill first came in.</para>
<para>When the government were first looking at this they were told that for health care card holders, pensioners and concessionaries there needed to be a level of about $500 before people could claim out-of-pocket expenses and a level of about $1,000 before people who were non health care card holders and non-concessional people could claim out-of-pocket expenses. But, politics being the way that it is, with compromise ruling so much, in order to buy off the votes of some senators and to do a deal with them, they came up with a different set of figures: $300 for people who were concessional and $700 for people who were not. The secretary of the department, the other advisers in the department of health, the people in the ministerial office and the very minister himself knew what was advised, but they also knew and were party to those lower figures.</para>
<para>When they signed up to that we were told that there would not be any blow-out, that this was a great new thing to give to Australians—a terrific thing; you could fix their out-of-pocket expenses. It was just like all of the rest of Medicare—the Medicare benefits scheme and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme—because it is all demand driven and, if people took it up, that would be okay because that would just show how successful it was.</para>
<para>I do not think I have seen any example in the time I have been here, since 15 June 1996, to match the effrontery of what has happened in this area or the boneheadedness of the minister in initially denying and then denying time and time again that there was a blow-out in costs. That was matched only by the Prime Minister in election mode from March until October 2004 and by the fact that what is being changed here has its very genesis in the design of this bill. It is structurally flawed. It is structurally boneheaded.</para>
<para>It is a bright idea to go and buy off the electorate and say, ‘We understand you’ve got lots of out-of-pocket expenses; we understand how much a specialist costs; we understand that they’ve got no price signals out there, except for the other people in the market.’ Anyone who has any experience with some groups of specialists allied to the AMA, particularly those hip specialists under one surgeon who for years was a formative influence on the Liberal Party, knows that the price signals simply were not out there to hold some of those back, in the most effective trade unions in the country, the medical associations of specialists, which regulate the number of people who can actually be in their speciality and then regulate the fees. They may do a great job but they are not dumb. The minister might be but the specialists are not.</para>
<para>What we have in this flimsy bill is very small but very telling for the majority of Australians. Most of it deals with subsection 8(1A) of the Health Insurance Act 1973. Section 1 of the bill states:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Omit “$300”, substitute “$500”.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is how brutal this is. Section 2—we are almost halfway through the bill—states:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Omit “$700”, substitute “$1,000”.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Section 3 states:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Omit “$300”, substitute “$500”.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">And, just for a bit of variation, section 4 amends subsection 10A(1) of the act to omit ‘2005’ and make it ‘2007’.</para>
<para>With this flimsiest of bills presented to this parliament there is an impact on all those people who were conned by the minister for health and the Prime Minister prior to the last election. People believed that they would be able to claim 80 per cent of out-of-pocket expenses. And they believed, they were told, that it would not actually cost that much. But if you look at the work done by Angela Pratt in the Parliamentary Library there is an interesting set of figures and an interesting time line in terms of how much things cost. There are also some interesting statements around when this bill was introduced.</para>
<para>Don’t you just love the Prime Minister? This was to come into force in March 2004 and there was a nice run-up from that date to the election. At multiple times and in multiple places—like over a little cuppa at the Colac Otways Performing Arts and Cultural Centre—the Prime Minister was asked what he thought about the government’s great new scheme. He said, in part:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">So what that does is to provide a peace of mind, a security against unexpectedly large medical expenses ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It is what you would expect him to say—‘You can be very relaxed and comfortable about this. This is something that we’ve got for you.’ A little later, on 12 May last year, he said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Now, that new safety net is funded in the budget, although it was announced several months ago but it is funded in the budget.’</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In July 2004, after some criticism that it was not sustainable because of its design—the fact that there were no price signals and no caps at all on this—at the Solomon Community Hall morning tea in the Kalymnian hall, the Prime Minister says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... most recently through the introduction of the Medicare safety net, which is daily looking after more and more Australian families. They are some of our goals, not only for the next three years but, indeed, for the next ten.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">What a forward-looking, visionary Prime Minister who looks to his next 10 years in office bringing this sort of thing to the Australian people. He crowned that on 28 August 2004 by saying:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">As the months go by the 220,000 Australians that have already benefited from the safety net will grow, and grow, and grow.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">And the price to the Commonwealth, I would add, will grow like topsy—because since November 2003 that is exactly what has happened. But to give him his due, the Prime Minister twice again, once before the election, reiterated just what a terrific thing this was and effectively what he thought of the minister for health for coming up with this bright idea. In a radio interview with Ray Hadley on 2GB, he said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">In fact, we have a better Medicare system now than our opponents are offering because we have this new beaut safety net. If you’re a cardholder or a family tax benefit recipient and your ... out of pocket expenses go over $300 a year, you get 80 per cent of the excess back ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">And didn’t he think that was wonderful to campaign on for the October election. But just before the election some concern was voiced dramatically. The Prime Minister, just after the election of course, came to a bit of a different view. What had been argued for a year all of a sudden was a bit different. He talked about the increase in numbers from a quarter of a million to many more. In fact, it had gone up into the 400,000s and then the 600,000s—600,465, I think. Within a few months of it coming in, we had 650,000 Australians claiming. But on 8 October 2004 at a press conference in Sydney, he was asked about the safety net in a sort of roundabout way, ‘Isn’t it true that it is costing more money and something will have to be done about it? Are you going to keep it? The Prime Minister replied:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Well I commit to keeping it in place but I also commit to taking whatever action is needed if there is clear evidence that anybody’s trying to exploit it.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Those who were trying to exploit this were the minister for health, the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the rest of the government. They were the ones exploiting a system that they had introduced. They were the ones who had tried to convince Australians that they should take it up in droves—and so they did. The Prime Minister continued:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">But bear in mind that Medicare is a demand driven policy, there is no cap on the availability of Medicare services, it’s one of the fundamentals.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">There is also another fundamental of Medicare: there are price caps, there are regulations and there are regulatory mechanisms to take care of the price pressures so that it does not explode as this has done. What is the key difference, as pointed out by Angela Pratt in the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> and others who have commented on this? The key difference is that, when you go to the extra charges over and above the scheduled Medicare fees—we know that many GPs out there do not charge the scheduled Medicare fees; we know that specialists certainly do not charge them—there are no regulatory, price or capping mechanisms to keep this in control.</para>
<para>This is a policy that is completely out of control. We have seen not only an escalation in the number of people but also an escalation in the cost. We also know—and this is completely evident, if you look at who benefits from this most—that it is weighted towards Liberal electorates. It is weighted towards electorates where there is a higher per capita income. It is weighted against electorates like mine. Indeed, in the electorate of the member for Bradfield, the safety net rebate paid as at September 2004 was $911,828, with an average of $1,759 for those people who claimed. If you go to the next page of the document, you see that in the electorate of Blaxland 212,186 people claimed, their claims averaging $839. You can run through every Labor and National Party electorate—because National Party electorates are usually, with ours, the least well-off electorates—and you will find the same kinds of figures repeated again and again. This is a policy that gives to those who have and to those who choose to have higher expenditure and to run that higher expenditure in a particular period of time.</para>
<para>In the past our tax system has generally taken care of this. Labor condemned this proposal when it came in—this bright idea from the minister for health—and we pointed out that it was more important to reinvigorate bulk-billing Australia wide. The other day, the minister for health—extremely ungraciously and very clumsily—tried to make a point not only about me but also about another member and the fact that we had high bulk-billing rates in our electorates. Yes, we do—and, yes, I said it was under threat from this government.</para>
<para>One of the reasons it is under threat is the dopey idea that the minister for health came up with that you should bring in this Medicare safety net, which imperils the good governance of the rest of health policy in Australia. The dimensions of that are pointed out in the parliamentary digest on a time line that the Parliamentary Library has provided. Even with the original figuring that was given in November 2003, when the proposal first surfaced, when the government thought the levels should be $500 and $1,000—those contained in this flimsy here before the government did its deal with the senators—what was the expected cost of this in the first four years of its operation? It was $266.3 million. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will not be surprised—and no-one else in Australia will be surprised now—that, by March 2004, as a result of the new thresholds, the government expected the cost to be $440 million.</para>
<para>Yet some few months later, just prior to the election, that was denied by the health minister, denied by the Prime Minister and denied by the Treasurer. So what was the cost? The cost came from a reputable source. Ken Henry is not only a good economist but a good servant of the public. As Secretary of the Treasury, he released the following in September 2004:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Treasury figures show the cost of the Safety Net as $142 million <inline font-style="italic">higher</inline> than the approximately $120 million originally forecast for the 2004-05 financial year. Subsequently, the cost over four years (2004-05 to 2007-08) was estimated to have blown out to approximately $1.05 billion.</para>
</quote>
<para>That is a pretty big blow-out. That was before the election and that was from Treasury. They have tried hard, but they have never been completely accurate in their determinations of what the cost would be. And I tell you what: it has escalated somewhat.</para>
<para>In April 2005, fully a year and a month after this bill was introduced into the House and brought into action, the Prime Minister—having earlier had a go at the member for Hotham, saying that the idea that the cost would be $1 billion was completely ludicrous—confirmed that, if the current threshold levels were maintained, the cost of the safety net would be $1.4 billion over the period to 30 June 2008. And guess what? Up to 30 June 2009, the cost will be $1.65 billion—that is, 400 per cent more; four times the projected cost at the lower levels because the lower levels had expanded by four. Accordingly, the government announced that it would move to increase the safety net thresholds.</para>
<para>We have here the government’s determination that they will go back up to those thresholds. But what has been pointed out, not only in the advice given by the Parliamentary Library in their digest but by commentators on health Australia wide, is that this bill addresses threshold levels. Maybe it will work for a few months or even six months; the government may be able to constrain the cost of this. But this will not fix the structural faults that are inherent in this bill. The reason this measure was so appealing to the people who have used it in extraordinary numbers—650,000 in just a few months—is that there is no cap. There is no regulation. There is no pull-back, apart from these levels, and there is no reason whatsoever to rein this in. This is dumb policy which prejudices the Commonwealth’s control of health funding in Australia.</para>
<para>The minister for health has put himself in a position where he has no way out. Prior to the election, he told us that there was no way at all that the $300 and the $700 would ever be changed. Ticky Fullerton gave him a series of questions and his answer on whether these thresholds would be changed was:</para>
<motion>
<para class="block">That is an absolutely rock solid, iron-clad commitment.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">The Treasurer even jumped in and said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The parameters of the Medicare safety net will not change.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This tells you a little about this health minister. I will finish with a quote from him—it is a beaut:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The MBS is not a budget-limited bureaucratically controlled program; it’s a demand driven patient-initiated program. That’s the way the MBS has always been and that’s the way it will always continue under this government and that’s one of the reasons why medical services in the community have been much more effective and much more efficient than some other aspects of the overall health system.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">If you believe that, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, you will believe anything. This is really silly. As I said at the start, we have lies, damned lies and statistics. The statistics involved in looking at this problem say that this has betrayed the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth’s demand for structure in the health system. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—The <inline ref="R2376">Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005</inline> is to amend the Health Insurance Act to increase the annual thresholds above which benefits under the extended Medicare safety net are payable. The thresholds will increase from $306.90 to $500 for concession card holders and other low-income families and from $716.10 to $1,000 for all other families and individuals from 1 January next year. That is the summary of the bill, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline>. But we know what this bill really signifies.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We know this bill is a reflection of the government’s failure to concern themselves with ordinary battling families; we understand that. We know this bill is also a reflection of the government’s failure to understand the economic consequences of their own promises; we understand that. We also know that, once the government did understand the consequences of their promises, they did not tell the public. They did not tell the Australian public the consequences of the government promising a particular safety net before the election until after the election.</para>
<para>There are all sorts of words people could use to describe that behaviour but there is no need because the Australian public are not foolish. When someone comes to them and says, ‘I promise that I’ll do this. I’ll personally make an absolutely ironclad commitment to undertake the following,’ and then waits until after the general election to say, ‘Look, hold on a second here. We looked at the figures and we can’t deliver this,’ then the Australian community know exactly what has gone on. They know exactly what the minister for health has done by not coming clean before the election.</para>
<para>While we are in possession of those facts, one of the reasons that led us to conclude that the minister, the government and this Prime Minister have no regard for the Australian people who need decent health services is that they were aware of the cost blow-outs prior to the election but failed to indicate that publicly. This is very reminiscent of the Telstra fiasco, the Telstra scandal, where matters have been brought to the attention of the executive government and they have held them back—not sharing them with mum and dad shareholders—despite the reality that those facts in the possession of the government could possibly have adverse consequences for ordinary families—families that were encouraged by this government to buy the shares in the first place.</para>
<para>The situation with the Medicare safety net is comparable to the Telstra scandal that has beset this government. The Minister for Health and Ageing was well aware that the promise that he undertook to make to Australian users of health services was not sustainable in the least. I know that earlier members commented on some of these facts. I would like to draw the attention of the House to a number of the calculations that were made by the department from the time of the promise to the post election reversal of that promise.</para>
<para>In November 2003, the safety net as originally proposed—I remind the House that is with $500 and $1,000 thresholds—was expected to cost $266.3 million in the first four years of its operation—just over a quarter of a billion dollars was calculated as the cost by the department. In less than four months the department revised the four-year cost of the safety net as a result of the reduced thresholds negotiated, as we all recall, in the Senate and estimated the cost to be $440 million, an amount that was still sustainable. Treasury figures in September 2004 showed the cost of the safety net as $142 million higher than the approximately $120 million originally forecast for the financial year 2004-05. Subsequently, the cost over four years was estimated to have blown out by $1.05 billion.</para>
<para>These facts were in the possession of the government prior to the election. I suppose we cannot blame the minister for health entirely and that we have to assume that, when you are making such a huge public policy decision as the government was making, it would involve the finance ministers and the Prime Minister. We now know as a result of the embarrassing backflip by the Minister for Health and Ageing that the government confirmed in that month that the cost of the safety net, if the current threshold levels were maintained, would be $1.4 billion over the period to 30 June 2008 and $1.65 billion to 30 June 2009. Accordingly, the government announced that it would move to increase the safety net thresholds.</para>
<para>I have put it as plainly as I can. People say that a lot of politicking goes on in this place. I do not have to use any hyperbole to explain the behaviour of the minister and the executive government. Ordinary Australian families will understand that. Families who are not able to apply for the safety net now because they do not meet the threshold know exactly what this government has done to them. The awful truth is that it is going to affect the lower income earners more than the higher income earners—again. We see not only the failure by this government to economically determine the costs of their health policy decision but, when they look to correct their fundamental error—an error that was not revealed to the public before the election—that they choose to hurt people who can afford it least. The government choose to hurt families who can afford it least.</para>
<para>It is not surprising that earlier speakers talked about the inequity that we have in this current system whereby, because of the safety net, members from wealthier constituencies are likely to receive a larger piece of the pie. This is because of the way in which some families are able to expend on health care as compared to others. It is quite clear, in particular, that many seats held by government members in metropolitan capital cities and some other areas will receive a higher proportion of the safety net as a result of the proposed changes to the threshold. This will compound the inequity in the current system. It is most disappointing that there have been no government members willing to raise concerns about this matter. Whilst I have already said the majority of the government members may see their seat being favoured in this distorted backflip policy, the fact is that there are also government members holding seats, particularly in country Australia, which in terms of socioeconomic factors are more akin to the city areas that do not have a great deal of wealth. Those particular seats will also suffer.</para>
<para>I would have expected, for example, the forthright and outspoken member for Indi—who, by the way, notwithstanding the boasts of the Minister for Health and Ageing, still has a seat that has less than 50 per cent bulk-billing and has a socioeconomic dimension that would mean that these changes will not benefit her seat—to have come to this place and have said: ‘Hold on a second. This is not right for the constituents of Indi.’ I am not sure how often the member for Indi actually visits her seat. She does speak her mind, I am told; I read about it in the paper all the time. I would have thought that she would have had the decency and the integrity to consider remarking on the adverse consequences for her constituents.</para>
<para>There are other country seats that will not benefit as a result of these changes. I think it is incumbent on members to come in and explain why they would support a bill that is going to hurt the people who voted for them to come here and represent them. If I can put it another way, it is incumbent on those members to explain why they will not speak out when the government is choosing to hurt those constituents who are from low-socioeconomic families, who have difficulty in making ends meet and who therefore would hope that their federal member in this place would at least raise concerns. But we have not heard from them. In fact, in the long list of speakers on this bill, I do not know if any government members have spoken at all.</para>
<para>We are talking about a fundamental public policy. We are talking about the Medicare safety net. I do not know what the government members have to be embarrassed about. If they truly supported the Minister for Health and Ageing, they would show their support for him—and indeed the finance minister and the Prime Minister—by coming in here and defending the government’s position with respect to this bill. But there has not been one government member—certainly not one today and I do not know whether there has been one at all—speaking on this bill and defending the actions of the government. There has not been one government member defending the government backflip in telling the Australian public one thing before the election and another after the election—explaining that and defending why that happened.</para>
<para>This bill shows either the government lacking integrity when it comes to being honest with the Australian people in terms of public policy or a lack of economic credibility, because the blow-out in cost of this policy was so astronomical that the Treasurer had to rein in the Minister for Health and Ageing, to embarrass him, as did the Prime Minister, and explain to him that his promise was not in any way sustainable. It really did show a lack of economic credibility by the government. Either that or it understood the consequences—exactly understood that it could not sustain the policy—but chose not to tell anybody until people cast their vote in the 2004 ballot. Which one would the government wish me to choose: that it is economically incapable of calculating a very important public policy like the Medicare safety net or that it deliberately chose to say one thing before the election and wait until after the election to say another? Either way this government is damned by its own behaviour. Either it is incompetent or it has misled the public. It has been loose with the truth. It has not been honest in explaining what could occur, given the open-ended nature of the policy.</para>
<para>We are getting sick of the walking cliche—the Minister for Health and Ageing—coming in here and answering about 50 questions with the same answer. It really is getting a little tiring. If he only has one sentence in the box, why don’t we just get a dummy in here and pull the string? Because we know that the government are not the best friend that Medicare has ever had. If the government could get away with destroying Medicare, they would do it. We know what the Prime Minister’s longstanding position is and what he would love to do to Medicare. We know that position is shared by the Minister for Health and Ageing and, indeed, by many other frontbenchers and the majority of the government. We really do not need to hear any more cliches from the Minister for Health and Ageing; we need to see him focused on his job. We need to see him not worrying about the internal workings of the New South Wales Liberal Party, not making off remarks about former leaders of the New South Wales Liberal Party but focusing on his job and delivering decent health services to this country.</para>

<para>—It is a pleasure for me to have this opportunity to talk about the <inline ref="R2376">Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005</inline>. The safety net came into effect in March 2004. This bill proposes two amendments which will put into place changes to the thresholds for the Medicare safety net and which the government wants to have come into effect on 1 January 2006. For the sake of explaining the mechanics of the safety net, I refer to a note done by Angela Pratt from the Parliamentary Library:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">Under the Medicare Safety Net, patients are reimbursed for 80 per cent of their out-of-pocket costs (that is, the cost over and above the relevant Medicare rebate) for medical treatment received in a non-hospital setting, once a certain threshold is reached in a calendar year. This includes out-of-pocket costs for things like GP and specialist consultations, and diagnostic tests such as X-rays and pathology exams.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I read that very specifically because it is important that we all understand exactly what is being changed here. The government set the original thresholds for the safety net after quite a deal of argy-bargy, if I may say so, with minor party senators. They set the thresholds for access to the safety net at $300 for concession card holders and family tax benefit B recipients and $700 for all other people. We opposed the policy at the time, on the grounds that we believed it would prove to be inequitable and it would have an inflationary effect on health prices. Of course, we were criticised and told that we were wrong and that we had got it all completely skew-whiff—that in fact this was the best thing the government could ever think of for Medicare. We disputed that at the time and we still do.</para>
<para>In 2004, in the lead-up to the election and during the campaign, extensive government advertising across all forms of media from around March to June, and adding to the previous minister’s A Fairer Medicare package, cost around $20 million. In other words, about $20 million of taxpayers’ money was spent out there trying to convince people that this idea of the safety net with threshold levels of $300 and $700 respectively was really worth the consideration of the community.</para>
<para>Serious concerns emerged after this came into place. It was evident within three months of the safety net being in place that higher numbers of families and single people were registering. I believe the government’s estimate was that about 450,000 people would register in one year, yet in the first few months alone almost 650,000 people qualified. This meant that Treasury figures released during the election campaign in September last year showed more than a doubling of the approximate $120 million originally forecast for the year 2004-05 in costs. Therefore the total cost over the out years would have reached over $1 billion, more than double the original projections.</para>
<para>It has to be said that it was not just us on this side of this House who were alarmed; there were journalists and other commentators involved in health issues, professional organisations and people writing commentary who were all saying the same thing as us, all singing from the same song sheet—that is, of course, that the costs were going to be very difficult to contain. However, the minister and other senior ministers through the whole of the election campaign period continued to deny that we had a problem on our hands.</para>
<para>There was all this pressure on the system, against the background that the minister had bargained the original bill into reality. At the risk of repeating what has been said many times in this place—but I must—it was during that election campaign that the minister gave that famous and now sadly infamous rock solid, ironclad guarantee that the thresholds would be maintained at those original levels that he had bargained into reality in the first place. Despite all the evidence, despite everybody saying it was just not mathematically financially possible, he said nothing would change. He gave that wonderful guarantee to the community of this country. They wonder why sometimes people get a little bit cynical, to put it kindly, about undertakings given by this government. Here is yet another example where an undertaking—in fact, more than an undertaking: a rock solid guarantee, an ironclad thing—was given, and yet it was just disposed of at the flick of a wrist.</para>
<para>From that point during the election campaign we fast-forward to April this year. The government then released figures showing a further increase in those projected safety net costs. The Prime Minister went on ABC radio saying that if those current thresholds were maintained the cost of the safety net would be $1.65 billion over the four years to June 2009. This was almost four times the original projections. This government, the Treasurer and all these people are supposed to be in charge of this economy. Everybody was saying this could not be done. Everybody was saying this could not be maintained. We had an ironclad guarantee from the minister. Yet, in April this year, the Prime Minister said, ‘I’m terribly sorry, but we think we got it wrong; it’s a little bit too expensive.’ So the government says after all of this that it must now change these thresholds to the safety net at the lower level from $300 to $500 and at the higher level from $700 to $1,000. To say those families and single people out there were misled is an understatement. It was more than misleading; it was a dramatically misleading action by this government.</para>
<para>How many people do we think might be affected as a result of this change? According to the department at Senate estimates in June, if current thresholds were maintained, in 2006 we would have 2.5 million people qualifying. Under these increased levels, approximately 1.5 million people are expected to qualify. What is the difference? One million people out there who have been told by this government in the past that they would have access to this financial assistance with their medical costs will now not receive it.</para>
<para>I represent an electorate here that in statistical terms is relatively well off. We still have ordinary families on ordinary incomes in that electorate. There are people who find it really hard even to find a doctor in some parts of my electorate. Why isn’t all the government effort going into making more GPs available? Why isn’t the government effort going into ensuring that people can actually find a doctor and see them when they need to, especially when they have families and young children in tow, and they really need to be able to do that and afford to do it? Instead, we have a government that stands up and basically just misleads the community, tells them whatever it wants and does whatever it can in a campaign leading up to an election to ensure in some way that it gets those extra votes.</para>
<para>After the election, it is another ball game altogether. After the election, the government said that we were wrong. But no way were we wrong. We knew all along that these costs were going to blow out, and so did a lot of other people. I believe many senior members of this government knew that as well, and they did nothing about it until after the campaign, after the election, after winning the majority in both houses. Then they think they can just do what they want.</para>
<para>The people in my community and, I believe, in the communities around Australia are waking up to this. They are no longer going to be willing to be taken for granted on issues as important as this. This is fundamental to the economic wellbeing of families around Australia. I am sorry to think that I have been witness to such a deceit by this government of Australian families and the Australian people.</para>

<para>—Yesterday the last elements of the Israeli army left their posts around the settlements in Gaza. The Israeli army remains in control of all border areas. Gaza is now a Palestinian ghetto—a prison for its 1½ million people. All flows of people and goods must pass through Israeli border controls, which has resulted in the World Bank’s reporting that unemployment and poverty will rise in Gaza. As the world watched the tearful removal of illegal Jewish settlers from Gaza, its attention was turned away from other forced removals. While 8,000 illegal Israeli settlers will be compensated by as much as $A500,000 each, there was no compensation—not one cent—for the 23,000 Palestinians in Gaza whose homes were bulldozed by the Israeli army.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Illegal settlements to the east of Jerusalem will be expanded by up to 15,000 people, in defiance of President George Bush’s road map for peace. The ever expanding wall now cuts the occupied West Bank in half and, in parts, will be 25 kilometres inside the green line which defines the occupied West Bank. Palestinians have been cut off from their work, their fields and families without any compensation. While there was world attention on the tearful settlers, there were few tears for the 680 Palestinian children shot dead by the Israeli army in the past five years. If the 1½ million Palestinians in Gaza have anything to celebrate, it will be the return of the 25 per cent of their land that a mere 8,000 settlers illegally occupied; however, the Israelis can celebrate their relief from the cost of $500 million a year to watch over those illegal settlers.</para>
<para>Israel’s attempt to colonise Gaza has failed. It was hoped that, by circling its settlement wagons, the cavalry would keep the natives on their reservation. But it was too costly. Now Israel will rule Gaza like a walled ghetto, a giant penal colony, a concentration camp. Israel controls all air, sea and land borders. The same is happening in the West Bank as the illegal wall cuts it into small, walled ghettos and completely cuts off the Palestinian state from its heart in East Jerusalem.</para>
<para>Physically, Palestine exists only as a few ink blots on a map but, in spirit, Palestine possesses a strength to be reckoned with. In the year 2000 I visited the Jabalaya refugee camp in Gaza, where over 100 people were killed by the Israeli army a year ago. Eighty thousand people live in one square kilometre. The schools have two shifts a day to cope with the number of children. I spoke to a father of seven children and his pregnant wife in their clean and tidy three-room home. He was a third-generation refugee. His grandparents had fled Israel in 1948. When I asked him why he had so many children, he smiled and said, ‘We are fighting them in the bedroom.’ If you look at the booming Palestinian population, his strategy is clear.</para>
<para>The Palestinian people have resisted the ethnic cleansing that the colonising Israeli settlers had hoped for. Israel will rule an empire where the Arab population outnumbers the Jewish population. Israel will be neither a democratic nor a Jewish state. That is what the member for Wentworth was referring to last week when he recalled Moshe Dayan’s 1967 warning: ‘You want the dowry but you do not want to marry the bride.’</para>
<para>The Gaza disengagement, which is accompanied by the expansion of settlements, should be seen as another tactical step by Israel—a way to freeze the peace process and to claim East Jerusalem. It is a strategy which flouts international law. As Israel’s Deputy Prime Minister has said, the strategy is to maximise the number of Jews and to minimise the number of Palestinians—something my friend in Jabalaya is doing his best to fight. We are witnessing the ethnic cleansing of East Jerusalem, the heart and soul of the Palestinian nation. The world must not allow this to happen.</para>

<para>—It is no secret that, as proud Australians, we are all saddened by the loss of the Ashes last night, but we congratulate England on their victory. We all face challenges in life—some we conquer; some we lose. We all know that Kim Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, went to a lot of trouble shifting to Sydney to be closer to the political action but, sadly, it did not restore his status as patron of the Newcastle Knights. His demise from that role is a very sad and sorry tale, one that perhaps should be revealed only behind the closed doors of the party room and then in jest at the official briefing.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is fortunate for Mr Beazley that, when he was rolled by Latham for the leadership, he was dropped as the patron of the Knights. He was rolled for the job by Michael Costa, who is now known as ‘the minister for wooden spoons’. It is fortunate; otherwise we naturally would have blamed Kim for the Knights’ poor season and the wooden spoon. Or would we?</para>
<para>Everyone will understand that I only mention this story in humour and jest, but it is a story that I do not think the Leader of the Opposition can weasel out of—or, should I say, wriggle out of. But I will not say that, because it conjures up a vision. I say this in the same humorous way that Kim described the Prime Minister in the privacy of the caucus room. ‘Wriggle’ conjures up a vision that I do not think even Mr Beazley’s most ardent supporters would want to spend much time visualising, so I say ‘weasel’ rather than ‘wriggle’.</para>

<para class="block">“You can have your rugby tests, you can have international soccer, but this is what matters and there has been a frittering away of the spirit and he (Mr Beazley) holds that weasel (Mr Howard) responsible for it” a spokeswoman quoted the Labor leader as saying.</para>

<para class="block">Read: Julia Gillard, member for Lalor, leadership aspirant and official briefer for the Labor caucus. The Leader of the Opposition was not helped today by Senator Stephen Conroy in an interview with Jason Morrison on 2GB. I will recount this for the benefit of members present.</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Morrison: ... did you hear him say that about Mr Howard today?</para>
<para class="block">Conroy: I was in the party room and I can say to you I am a little surprised at the reporting. It was very much tongue in cheek and my understanding is that ... Julia Gillard gave a briefing to the gallery where she went through a lot of Kim’s comments so in terms of I’m not aware if people rushed out and told people but my understanding was Julia Gillard gave a report to the assembled.</para>
<para class="block">Morrison: I think that how it worked out is that Julia Gillard was asked questions about it because already some pretty senior and well known identities of the ALP had already run upstairs and told everybody to make sure you found out about it.</para>

<para class="block">Whilst Mr Beazley may dismiss this as the work of someone else, at the doorstop it was all his own work. When questioned on why he called the PM a weasel and why he chose that particular description, his transcript is different to the full version. It was unfortunate for him that Alison Carabine on 4BC Drive with John Miller played the full grab:</para>

<para class="block">Kim Beazley: Look I was speaking in jest. I don’t believe that the Prime Minister is responsible for us having lost the Ashes— not completely.</para>

<para class="block">Kim Beazley: Thanks very much. Good on you. See you later.</para>
<para class="block">Carabine: So he was only joking, but when he was given the opportunity then to withdraw that description, he declined to do so.</para>

<para class="block">It would appear that, in regaining the Labor leadership, Beazley inherited Latham’s air brush for selectively cleaning up press transcripts to suit. Latham left it on the desk for Kim—a useful tool, no doubt.</para>

<para class="block">Kim Beazley’s got to be kidding doesn’t he?</para>
<para class="block">Reports out of Canberra have him blaming John Howard for the Ashes loss and calling him ‘a Little Weasel’.

<para class="block">Now name calling is pretty pathetic when you get to that level of federal politics and do we really want the alternative PM using such language? As for the Ashes jibe ... it was just stupid.</para>
<para class="block">Kim Beazley plays right into John Howard’s hands with this sort of stuff, the electorate doesn’t like it and while many might disagree with John Howard’s policies and the direction he’s taking the country in, we don’t like the highest office in the land and the highest officer in the land being called a ‘weasel’.</para>

<para>—It is all dust and ashes in the mouth—that is all I can say about the previous contribution. Sixty years ago, people in this country had war foisted upon them. We were part of the British Empire and had not signed up to the Balfour Declaration of 1931 or the Statute of Westminster, so when Britain declared war on 3 September 1939 we were necessarily at war.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Earlier this year, we celebrated the 60th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day. Just recently, we celebrated the 60th anniversary of the Victory in the Pacific—or, as it is known to most people of my mother’s age group, Victory over Japan. We did what we do too few times in this House and we celebrated it. There is an ongoing debate in the Main Committee with regard to VP Day, but in our national life we have not celebrated enough those who experienced the depths of the Depression and all the difficulties that it created for their lives and who, coming out of that, went into the greatest and most total war that this planet has ever seen.</para>
<para>I am grateful to the government for providing funds for each electorate to commemorate it—$10,000 for each electorate, including Blaxland. I am grateful to the member for Banks, Daryl Melham MP, who ensured that $2,500 of his $10,000 was combined with what was available to Blaxland. I am also grateful for the work done by volunteers at the Australian Aviation Museum at Bankstown, under the leadership of Barry Thompson and with help from the Bankstown District Sports Club and the Bankstown City Council, to make our celebration on 21 August—a week after the main events of 14 and 15 August—something very important and central to everyone in the city of Bankstown.</para>
<para>Bankstown Airport is at the geographical heart of the city of Sydney and it is at the historical heart of Australia’s participation in the war in the Pacific. It was established as a military airport and had the distinction of being, at one and the same time, a naval base for the British, an Australian aviation base and a facility for the Americans. Our people who fought in the air were trained at Bankstown Airport in the surrounding fields of Villawood and Chullora. Armaments factories supplied their planes and the armaments for our ships and soldiers on all the various fronts, not only in the Pacific but elsewhere. It was in that war period that Bankstown established itself as an industrial area.</para>
<para>Black Charlies Hill overlooks the city of Bankstown—it was then a municipality—and, to the west, Bankstown Airport. Underneath that hill, in a bunker, was the command centre for the war in the Pacific. All naval shipping in the Pacific was controlled from that area, as well as air movements in Bankstown and elsewhere. It was one of General MacArthur’s prime command posts and it served throughout the war. Dr McNally, who was one of the recipients of a medal that day, had served in the Pacific war from a young age, breaking the Japanese kanji code and sending back intelligence information to our soldiers at the front. After the war, Dr McNally served under Black Charlies Hill in that defence establishment doing intelligence work.</para>
<para>Also at the function were people like Bert Collins, who served in West Papua New Guinea, now Irian Jaya. He and others fought—as they are fighting now—to try and get recognition for their service. He was one of 6,000 Australian soldiers faced with a Japanese force of 193,000. They expected the Japanese force to bear down and obliterate them. He survived malaria, infestation, dengue fever and the ravages of a long time in that climate, with ulceration and so on. He showed the proud spirit of the people of Bankstown and the strong desire of Australians to defend themselves and their people. I salute the courage of all those Australians who received medallions on the day or who will shortly be receiving medallions, people who with might and main fought their way to victory in the Pacific. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Tonight I rise to speak about welfare in contemporary Western democracy, particularly relating to Australia and to Indigenous issues. I quote from a report presented to parliament last year on behalf of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. In giving evidence to the committee in Adelaide on 23 September 2003, Reverend William Edwards said:</para>

<para class="block">Commonwealth finance was unavailable for Aboriginal work. The Presbyterian Board of Missions provided staff salaries—which were fairly low—and occasional extra funding for development work, such as fencing, well sinking et cetera. They also provided a budget in 1958 of $9,600 for general running expenses.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He went on to say that the South Australian government provided additional funds, that the craft room brought in some income and that there were various employment opportunities. He continues:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Older couples were employed as shepherds. Women were employed as school and clinic assistants and in staff houses and in the craft room. During these years Ernabella—</para>

<quote>
<para class="block">All children attended school regularly and the clinic provided good or adequate medical services. There were few social problems.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That set the scene for something like 40 years ago. I will move on to an editorial from the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, dated 12 August 2005, which said:</para>

<para class="block">If there is anyone out there who still thinks our long history of regarding Aborigines principally as candidates for welfare has achieved anything, they should study the photograph on the front page of <inline font-style="italic">The Australian</inline> yesterday—</para>

</quote>
<para class="block">…         …         …</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... <inline font-style="italic">The Australian</inline> drew national attention to petrol-sniffing in 2001, as much as $12 million has been allocated to combat sniffing in the Anangu Pitjantjara region of far north South Australia alone. None of it appears to have done a lot of good. Take that as a microcosm of the state of indigenous policy generally. Aborigines die 20 years earlier than other Australians, are 15 times more likely to be in jail and 10 times more likely to be murdered.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It further says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">And, as Warren Mundine, a member of the National Indigenous Council and incoming national president of the ALP, has pointed out, it means releasing Aborigines from the socialist dreaming of the chattering classes and giving them individual, rather than collective, property rights over the land and houses they occupy.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Another editorial which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 27 May 2004 said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... In his sorry day speech at the Sydney Opera House last night, former prime minister Malcolm Fraser persisted with an older way of speaking about Aboriginal disadvantage in which the root cause is white racism. We need to become far more compassionate, he said. It would be hard to argue with that, but easy to argue about just what it means. For example, what is the properly compassionate response to the riot on the Block in Redfern in February that caused $1 million worth of property damage and injured 40 police? ... NSW parliamentary inquiry into it, we have heard racism, especially among police, trotted out as the spark that lit the inferno. The riot had many causes, heroin not least of them, and suggestions that only racism was responsible get us nowhere—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It was put that:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... the solution is to decriminalise heroin and set up an injecting room at Redfern—beggars all belief. The real solution is something like the opposite: zero tolerance, and an urban version of the grog bans pioneered by Cape York leader Noel Pearson in far north Queensland.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I will conclude by quoting the incoming national president of the Labor Party, Warren Mundine, a man for whom I have immense respect and regard, along with his wife; they are great leaders in this country. This immediate past weekend Mr Mundine said that a group of Indigenous leaders wished ‘to preserve us’—Aboriginal people—‘as museum pieces as well and keep us locked in poverty and socially dysfunctional communities’. He made the point that it keeps those who are running these things at the moment in a job. Clearly Mr Warren Mundine is going to set a new course in this area. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Last week I attended the annual award night for the Granville District Soccer Football Association—a gala event attended by over 400 people—and I had the pleasure of watching one of my clubs, the Wenty Waratahs, win the prestigious Club of the Year award. The waratahs have been an active club for the past 50 years and provide sporting teams of various ages. During the last season, there were 633 players with the club, making up 23 junior teams, 12 senior teams and 11 Rooball teams.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In a tremendous, all-round effort, the club had eight grand final teams, and six were victorious. I had been present at the presentation of medals for one of those teams the previous Saturday and was pleased to hear the comments by their opponents that it was a delight to compete against a team that just played soccer—a clear reference to the fair play of the Wenty Waratah teams. I should point out that winning the Club of the Year award is not just about winning games. The scoring system also recognises fair play. Clubs are penalised for yellow cards—I will not mention which club received over 1,000 yellow cards during the season; let us just say that it was not Wenty Waratahs. They won the award because of the quality of their coaching, consistent wins by the broad range of their teams and fair play.</para>
<para>Unless you are directly involved in soccer you might miss what an extraordinary thing it is that our local soccer competitions happen on the scale that they do. There are thousands of clubs around the country, held together and flourishing, decade after decade on the dedication of small groups of people. Some are parents, some are ex-players, some are just soccer enthusiasts and many are soccer fanatics. There is one person in the Granville district who walks around wearing an alarming soccer ball covered tie—and all those in Granville district know who I am talking about. All these people give their time out of commitment to the game and to their club.</para>
<para>In the Granville District Soccer Football Association, there are currently 10,735 registered players. Of those, 9,500 are male and about 1,200 are female. The numbers are up from last year and continue to grow. Attend the weekend games and you will see the world come together in our local parks. There are young boys and girls, and men and women, many whose families have lived locally for decades and others who have come to Australia from all over the world and brought their love of soccer with them. The sport is a great leveller in our community. It is a game that is known and loved around the world. It is an activity shared by those born and bred here and those new to our shores. Each team carries the characteristics of its local community. If you want to see just how successful our multicultural society is, just hang out at the local oval in my neck of the woods and see some kids kick around a ball.</para>
<para>Today I most want to acknowledge the volunteers who make all things possible when it comes to weekend sport: the people who hassle local councils to support them with the provision of ovals; the people who raise the funds and give their time to keep those sporting fields up to scratch; the people who each month organise and manage hundreds of games and many more training sessions; and the people who raise the money, work in the canteens, coach, umpire, clean up and wash the jerseys. It is remarkable that people give so much to their clubs. It is even more remarkable that, in the case of Granville and District Soccer Football Association, people have been doing it for over 100 years.</para>
<para>The Granville and District Soccer Football Association is recognised as the oldest football association in the Southern Hemisphere. It celebrated its 100th birthday in 2002. The original club, the Granville Soccer Club, was formed back in 1882 by a group of Scottish steelworkers from the Clyde Steelworks, together with English and Welsh migrants. It became known officially as the Granville Soccer Club and initially games were played at Brunton’s paddock, which is currently the site of the Granville Returned and Services League club.</para>
<para>The football association was formed in 1902, incorporating a number of clubs, with its boundaries encompassing approximately 35 per cent of the current Sydney metropolitan area, stretching from Gladesville in the east to the Nepean River in the west. It was not until the 1950s that population growth started to shrink its boundaries. Now it represents over 30 clubs, including those in my electorate: Dundas United, Ermington United, Hills Brumbies, North Rocks, Parramatta City, Parramatta Eagles, Pendle Hill, St Joseph’s Rydalmere, Toongabbie, Winston Hills and, of course, the club of the year, the Wenty Waratahs.</para>
<para>I congratulate all the players this season, but I particularly wish to thank all the people who made the games happen and the clubs flourish. I know that, for most of the volunteers who keep the faith, the sport—soccer—is the point of their efforts, but local sport and soccer in particular play an essential role in our community beyond the sport itself in bringing people together and networking children and adults across cultural and economic divides. We would be a much poorer community without the Granville and Districts Soccer Football Association and its team of dedicated volunteers.</para>

<para>—As a candidate for election last year, I promised to be honest, to work hard and to give my best. I promised to stand up to governments of any colour if my community needed me to. I promised to be myself, a person who believes in the value of Christian values. I know that I am not perfect and I know that I cannot possibly solve all the world’s problems. But is it reasonable to be lectured by a lazy Labor senator who would not know how to stand up for a local community if it bit him on the bum, who willingly misleads the Australian Senate and who deliberately misquotes his opponents?</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>During the election campaign, I worked closely with local people because I wanted to understand what the local issues were and how I could help with them. One issue was phone services in Nunamara, a small town on the Tasman Highway just to the east of Launceston. The local network itself was in need of ongoing maintenance. I am pleased to see that Telstra listened to our concerns and last week announced a million dollar upgrade of the network for early 2006. It is the right thing to do. It will be appreciated by the local community and, I believe, further demonstrates how federal government regulation has left Telstra little room but to make the needed investment.</para>
<para>Importantly, though, it is impossible to get mobile phone reception in this area. I became concerned about this and decided to do something about it. This is not just an issue for the townspeople of Nunamara; perhaps more importantly it is an issue for the 8,000 or so residents of the north-east who commute to Launceston on this road. For a substantial section of the journey, mobile phones are unusable. To address this I promised to lobby for funding for a CDMA tower. Those are my exact words from the advertisement that I have just tabled. It is a promise I have kept and I will keep working. I think it is worth pointing out that no other candidate offered any such assurance of assistance whatsoever.</para>
<para>I have persistently pushed the matter of improving services in Nunamara: I have spoken in the House; I have raised the matter in my party room within the hearing of my colleagues, including ministers and the Prime Minister; I have written to and spoken with Senator Helen Coonan about how the government can assist Telstra to improve mobile phone services at Nunamara; and I have held discussions, even with Telstra, since October.</para>
<para>This brings me to Senator Kerry O’Brien’s remarks in the Senate today, where he reported his own—wrong—version of events in order to try to mischievously suggest that I have not kept a commitment. He said that I guaranteed funding to deliver the mobile tower, as if the coalition had accepted to pay for it as part of our election promise costings. He further claimed that after my win I promised delivery of this fanciful commitment within 100 days. That is absolutely wrong, and the senator knows it. Some people would say that Senator O’Brien is a barefaced liar—</para>

<para>—I do withdraw. In my view the $3.1 billion package to address shortcomings and to future proof telecommunications gives us a realistic chance to get this project up. The taxpayer should not have to stump up the full cost; Telstra should contribute too—after all, they will benefit. They will gain a new asset and it will benefit their customers, which will deliver them more income. That is what I will continue to push for, and I know that if we do get a result it will be because I have taken this issue to the government and Telstra in a constructive way.</para>

<para>For what it is worth, hardly anyone in Tasmania even knows who this senator is. I think that his whinging in the Senate today is partly motivated by hatred of the Liberal Party and partly by guilt because he knows that, as a supporter of the Latham forestry policy, he sold out the very same community that he has been using today in an attempt to attack me. Now I find that he has even promised to vote against the very funding package—Connect Australia—which could make this upgrade possible. In closing I would say that Senator Kerry O’Brien should be ashamed of himself for misleading the parliament and for his grubby attempts to diminish my reputation as a member who works hard and does his best for the people of Bass.</para>

<item label="(a)">
<para>Total Australian Government funding for government schools is not reported at the level of detail requested. Australian Government General Recurrent Grants for government schools are provided to the government education authority in each State or Territory, on the basis of total enrolments. The State or Territory determines where the grants are used. Payments to individual schools are not recorded.</para>
<para>The Department of Education, Science and Training only provides postcode detail for General Recurrent Grants and Establishment Grants to non-government schools, and Capital Grants, Flagpole funding and funding for the Boys’ Education Lighthouse Schools (BELS) project and values Education Study to both government and non‑government schools.</para>
<para>No Capital Grants funding was provided to government schools in the electoral division of Werriwa and identified postcode areas in 2004. Grants totalling $5,887.17 under the Flagpole funding initiative, were provided to government schools in the identified postcode areas for 2004.</para>
<para>BELS funding is provided to a nominated ‘lighthouse’ school in a “cluster” of schools, both government and non-government, in a defined region. The Lighthouse School within the cluster at the postcode of 2560 in the electoral division of Macarthur, Airds High School (a government school), received BELS funding amounting to $19,318.20 in 2004 on behalf of other schools (government and non-government) in the cluster.</para>

<para>—The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:</para>

<quote pgwide="yes">
<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>In financial year 2004/2005 Australia provided $6.2 million to UNRWA, comprising $4.2 million in core funding and $2.0 million to support UNRWA’s 2005 Emergency Appeal.</para>
<para>(2)   (a)                   I am aware of the statement made by the then UNRWA Commissioner-General, Peter Hansen. My Department raised this matter with UNRWA. Mr Hansen clarified that he was referring to likely Hamas sympathisers, but that this did not in any way mean UNRWA supported terrorism or employed terrorists. UNRWA has maintained that it expects its staff to adhere to strict codes of conduct, including non-involvement in political activities and being impartial servants of the UN.

<para>I am aware of the statement made by the then UNRWA Commissioner-General, Peter Hansen. My Department raised this matter with UNRWA. Mr Hansen clarified that he was referring to likely Hamas sympathisers, but that this did not in any way mean UNRWA supported terrorism or employed terrorists. UNRWA has maintained that it expects its staff to adhere to strict codes of conduct, including non-involvement in political activities and being impartial servants of the UN.

<para>I am aware that Israel has raised concerns about these sorts of issues. There has been dialogue between the relevant parties and efforts made to overcome these concerns.</para>

<para>I am aware of the accusations and again my understanding is that there have been discussions between Israeli authorities, the Palestinian Authority and UNRWA on these issues.</para>

<item label="(e)">
<para>I am aware of the allegations. In my meeting in January 2004 with Mr Hansen I raised the issue of incitement in UNRWA school textbooks. Mr Hansen advised that in accordance with a longstanding agreement with UNESCO, the UN was obliged to use host government textbooks. Mr Hansen also noted that independent scholars had reviewed the Palestinian textbooks. The UNRWA website (www.unrwa.org) also seeks to respond to these issues. My Department continues to pay attention to this matter.</para>

<item label="(f)">
<para>While we have not seen reporting that would confirm these allegations, the Government is deeply concerned by the debilitating effect corruption has had on the economic prospects of the Palestinian people. Australia is working alongside other international donors to help combat corruption.</para>

<para>Hamas’ Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) were recently specified under the Criminal Code Regulations 2005 as terrorist organisations for the purposes of section 102.1 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (the Criminal Code). These Regulations took effect from 5 June 2005. These organisations were re-listed as terrorist organisations under the Criminal Code as the Attorney-General continued to be satisfied that HAMAS’ and PIJ are organisations directly or indirectly engaged in preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act (whether or not the act has occurred or will occur).</para>

<item label="(6)">
<para>Yes. AusAID’s formal agreements with UNRWA address aid effectiveness by directing Australia’s contribution to specific purposes and requiring accountability through appropriate financial and reporting mechanisms. The agreements also specify compliance with relevant counter-terrorism legislation.</para>

<para>The process for establishing the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Facility (‘the Facility’) is:</para>
<para>-       field studies will be conducted at three Defence properties in the Northern Territory (as announced on 15 July 2005) to determine their suitability or otherwise to host the Facility;</para>
<para>-       after evaluation of the sites, a decision will be made on a preferred site that will be referred to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage for assessment under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999;</para>
<para>-       should the Minister for Environment and Heritage approve construction of the Facility at the preferred site, licences to site, construct and operate the Facility will need to be sought from the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA).</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>The Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Facility will manage low and intermediate level radioactive waste generated by Australian Government departments, agencies and statutory authorities.</para>
<para>Low level radioactive waste includes:</para>
<para>-       contaminated laboratory equipment, such as protective clothing, paper, rubber gloves, plastic and glassware;</para>
<para>-       lightly contaminated soil arising from previous CSIRO research into mineral extraction that had been transported to Woomera by the former Government in 1995; and</para>
<para>-       low activity disused radioactive sources (for example smoke detectors and exit signs).</para>
<para>Intermediate level radioactive waste includes:</para>
<para>-       residues from overseas reprocessing of Australian spent research reactor fuel;</para>
<para>-       waste arising from the production of radiopharmaceuticals by ANSTO; and</para>
<para>-       higher activity disused radioactive sources arising from industry, medicine and research.</para>

<para>Information on State and Territory radioactive waste management arrangements was provided to the Commonwealth through the former Commonwealth/State/Territory Radioactive Waste Consultative Committee. Information on national radioactive waste holdings obtained through this process is summarised in DEST’s radioactive waste website http://www.radioactivewaste.gov.au .</para>
<para>ARPANSA has recently asked State and Territory Governments to provide up to date inventories of radioactive waste holdings in accordance with Australia’s obligations under the international Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management. ARPANSA will shortly commence an audit into radioactive waste held by Australian Government departments, agencies and statutory authorities.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>It is estimated that low level radioactive waste is stored at over 100 locations around Australia in government stores and in universities, hospitals and in factories. In addition, low level radioactive waste is disposed of at the Government of Western Australia’s Mt Walton East Integrated Waste Management Facility. The Queensland Government operates a purpose-built radioactive waste store at Esk.</para>
<para>The Australian Government stores radioactive waste at Woomera in South Australia and the Lucas Heights Science and Technology Centre in Sydney. Radioactive waste is also stored at Department of Defence facilities in or near Melbourne, Ipswich, Wodonga, Adelaide, Newcastle, Darwin, Sydney and Nowra; at CSIRO facilities in Canberra, Sydney, Adelaide, Mt Gambier, Brisbane and Melbourne; and at the Australian National University.</para>
<para>Questions regarding the location of radioactive waste that is under state or territory control should be directed to the relevant agency in each jurisdiction.</para>
