<para class="block">This is an enormously difficult day for the Labor Party. Today is a day when the vacuous nature of all of its policy and the shallowness of its contribution to public life is on full display. Mark Latham tells us what we need to know about the individual characters that make up the Labor Party, that lead the Labor Party and what its collective character is. And it is all brought to bear on this debate where the Labor Party has vacated the fieldâit does not contribute constructively or the like. This is a government that reforms administration and that has the courage of its convictions. Today is the fruition of a policy that we took to election after election. We faced the voters and we put out our policy proposals, unlike the Labor Party.</para>

<para>âThis is the last minute, drop in the ocean inducement to the National Party to sell out rural and regional Australia. This is the Backdown Barnaby and National Party sell-out of rural and regional Australia. In the last series of electionsâin 1998, 2001 and 2004âthe National Party and the Liberal Party went to the Australian people saying that Telstra would not be fully privatised unless there was a guarantee of adequate services in rural and regional Australia. On every objective examination of that, on the Besley inquiry, on the Estens inquiry and on Telstraâs own admission, in its secret advice to the government on 11 August, Telstra itself acknowledges that it does not have the adequate capacity to deliver effective services to rural and regional Australia. This is a breach of faith by the Liberal and National parties to the Australian people and a massive sell-out by the National Partyâthe last minute, drop in the ocean payment, the last minute drop in the ocean inducement, the last minute drop in the ocean bribe to Backdown Barnaby and the National Party to sell out rural and regional Australia.</para>

We will have had 2Â½ days of debate in this House by the time these matters finally come on for a vote at about 12.30 today. That is 2Â½ days of debate in this House on top of 10 years of debate in the country on top of debate over the course of four election campaigns. I contrast the 2Â½ days of debate on this matter that we have had in this House with the one hour that the former government allowed to debate the sale of Qantas in 1992 and the five hours and 12 minutes that the former government allowed to debate the sale of the Commonwealth Bank in 1995. There has been more than enough debate on this issue. The time for debating this issue is passing and the time for deciding this issue has finally come.</para>

<para>âOf course we remember the days when the Leader of the House was the bovver boy standover man of Australian politics. Now he is just pathetic. This is a pathetic motion moved to try and guillotine this debate through the House by a minister who only yesterday was complaining about debate being guillotined. This is an act of hypocrisy by the leader and an act of hypocrisy by everybody who votes for it. We know this is about containing debate to try and keep dissenters in the cart in the desperate hope that none of them split on the floor today. If any of them in cockiesâ corner have got the courage of their convictions they will not be voting for this motion and they will not be voting for the telecommunications legislation this afternoon.</para>

<motion>
<para>That these bills be now read a second time.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">Today I am bringing forward into the chamber for consideration two telecommunications bills. The bills are an integral part of a comprehensive package of measures designed to enable the Commonwealth to sell its remaining equity interest in Telstra and to give Australians access to first-class telecommunications services now and into the future. Three further bills with additional measures and appropriations make up the package.</para>
<para>Together, this legislation forms a broad, integrated package that is designed to:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>provide an appropriate framework for a Telstra sale scheme;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>provide a settled regulatory framework that promotes an open, competitive telecommunications market;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>address concerns, particularly of rural and regional Australia about the adequacy of telecommunications services; and</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>reinforce the universal service obligation, digital data service obligation and the customer service guarantee.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para>This package of legislation builds on the strong foundations that the government has already laid for the telecommunications sector. This includes enhancements of an already robust pro-competition regulatory regime and further measures that support the strongest telecommunications safeguard arrangements in the world.</para>
<para>The government has demonstrated that it remains fully committed to this approach regardless of the ownership of Telstra.</para>
<para>This legislative package will also give effect to a number of Connect Australia initiatives that were announced by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts on 17Â August.</para>
<para>The four key planks of the Connect Australia package are:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>an investment of $1.1 billion in services;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>a perpetual $2 billion Communications Fund to generate revenue for rural telecommunications services into the future;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>improved competition regulation including a requirement for the operational separation of Telstra to deal with ongoing concerns about Telstraâs high degree of integration; and</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>enhanced consumer safeguards which build on the existing universal service obligation, the customer service guarantee and the digital data service obligation.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para>Connect Australia is an initiative for both now and into the future.</para>
<para>It is designed to address gaps in the provision of mobile and broadband services. The program will facilitate the roll-out of affordable broadband connections to people living in rural, regional and remote areas; extend mobile phone coverage; build new regional communications networks; and set up vital telecommunications services for remote Indigenous communities.</para>
<para class="bold">The <inline ref="R2436">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2005</inline>
</para>
<para>There is a close interplay between competition, consumer safeguards, targeted assistance and the governmentâs commitment to sell our remaining share in Telstra.</para>
<para>The government believe there is an inherent conflict of interest in the government being an owner of the nationâs largest telecommunications carrier while at the same time being the policy maker and regulator for the industry.</para>
<para>The <inline ref="R2436">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2005</inline> amends the Telstra Corporation Act 1991 to repeal the provisions that require the Commonwealth to retain 50.1 per cent equity in Telstra Corporation Ltd.</para>
<para>While the government is moving to establish the legislation immediately, it has undertaken not to proceed with any further sale of Telstra until it is fully satisfied that arrangements are in place to deliver adequate telecommunications services to all Australians, including maintaining the improvements to existing services, and that there is value for taxpayers from any further sale.</para>
<para>The bill provides for the timing of the sale to remain open.</para>
<para>To assist in achieving this objective, the bill also gives the Commonwealth the flexibility to develop detailed arrangements for the sale process which will protect and optimise the Commonwealthâs interests.</para>
<para>The governmentâs policy on foreign ownership of Telstra is unchanged. Telstra will continue to remain an Australian owned and controlled corporation. The maximum foreign ownership allowed in Telstra will remain at 35 per cent, whilst the maximum individual foreign ownership will remain at five per cent.</para>
<para>Telstra will be required to continue to comply with its reporting obligations and remain subject to a ministerial power of direction under the Telstra Corporation Act 1991 until the Commonwealthâs direct shareholding in the company falls below 15 per cent.</para>
<para>The Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill reaffirms the cornerstone requirements of the universal service obligation, the digital data service obligation and the customer service guarantee. These requirements will continue to apply to Telstra and other carriers, regardless of their ownership structure.</para>
<para>Changes in Telstraâs ownership status, however, will not affect the governmentâs ability to protect the interests of consumers, competitors and the public generally. Consumer regulatory safeguards such as the universal service obligation, the customer service guarantee, price controls, network reliability framework and the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman will be maintained into the future.</para>
<para class="bold">The <inline ref="R2437">Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Issues) Bill 2005</inline>
</para>
<para>The government is strongly of the view that competition provides the best means of delivering greater choice and improved and more innovative and affordable telecommunications services for consumers.</para>
<para>The competition reform measures in the Telecommunication Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Issues) Bill 2005 that I will be bringing forward shortly into this chamber strike an appropriate balance between the need for regulation which promotes competitive services and investment in new infrastructure and allowing Telstra the scope to meet changing market conditions and demand for services.</para>
<para>Telstra will be required to introduce operational separation between its retail and wholesale businesses. Operational separation is designed to ensure that Telstra, as the dominant carrier, treats all other carriers on a fair and transparent basis. The model has been developed with expert advice and in consultation with Telstra and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). The model provides a sound approach to achieve transparency, without the risks of forced structural separation.</para>
<para>Compliance with operational separation will be enforced through a legislative framework that imposes a licence condition enforceable by both the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts and the ACCC.</para>
<para>A number of consumer protection measures, such as retail price controls and the customer service guarantee, will be strengthened. These measures build on the comprehensive system of consumer safeguards that are already in place.</para>
<para>The bill also amends the Telecommunications Act 1997 to make changes to numbering plan consultation requirements and repeal provisions relating to industry development plans, and it includes measures to encourage any-to-any connectivity. The bill will increase the range of enforcement mechanisms that are available to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) to ensure compliance with telecommunications regulation.</para>
<para class="bold">The <inline ref="R2438">Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Future Proofing and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline>
</para>
<para>The bills that will be considered in the chamber this morning are complemented by an equally significant piece of legislation.</para>
<para>The <inline ref="R2438">Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Future Proofing and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline> provides the necessary appropriations, on passage of the Telstra sale legislation, to commence funding of the governmentâs commitment to Connect Australia and allows for long-term funding to be available for telecommunications services into the future.</para>
<para>The future requirements of Australiaâs 21st century telecommunications services are still an unknown quantity. No-one knows what services will be required. What is needed is to put in place an effective process that will both assess needs as they arise and provide the necessary funding as required.</para>
<para>To achieve this, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Future Proofing and Other Measures) Bill implements one of the key recommendations of the Estens inquiry to establish regular independent reviews into the adequacy of telecommunications in regional, rural and remote parts of Australia.</para>
<para>The independent reviews will be conducted by an expert committee, the Regional Telecommunications Independent Review Committee (RTIRC), appointed by the minister for communications. The bill requires the first review to be commenced before the end of 2008.</para>
<para>The government has already imposed a licence condition on Telstra requiring the company to implement and maintain an effective local presence in rural, regional and remote Australia.</para>
<para>The bill will also create a dedicated and perpetual Communications Fund of $2 billion. Revenue generated from the fund will be spent on implementing the governmentâs responses to recommendations contained in the reports of the independent review committee to respond to identified market failure in the provision of additional telecommunications services in regional, rural and remote areas.</para>
<para>The amendments proposed to this bill:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>make clear that the Communications Fund can only be used to implement a government response to recommendations of the RTIRC that relate to telecommunications in regional, rural or remote Australia;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>provide that the statement the government is required to make and table setting out its response to the recommendations of a review will explain how that response will improve telecommunications services in regional, rural and remote Australia;</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>require that at least one member of the RTIRC must be nominated by an organisation that represents the interests of people in regional, rural or remote Australia; and</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>require future reviews to be completed within three years of the tabling of the governmentâs response to the previous review. This will ensure that the time between the beginning of one review and the beginning of the next is no more than three years and six months.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para>The future-proofing bill will also include amendments to the Telecommunications Act relating to the development by telecommunications industry bodies of industry codes that deal with consumer related issues. The amendments made by the bill will require the Australian Communications and Media Authority to reimburse industry bodies for their costs in developing consumer related industry codes, as long as certain conditions relating to consumer participation in the code development process are met. This measure will provide for more equitable financing of consumer related industry codes and will allow more consumer participation in code development.</para>
<para class="bold">The <inline ref="R2435">Telecommunications (Carrier Licence Charges) Amendment (Industry Plans and Consumer Codes) Bill 2005</inline>
</para>
<para>This bill gives effect to the requirement that industry be reimbursed for the costs of development of consumer codes in the manner I have just outlined and that those costs can be recouped through carrier licence charges.</para>
<para>I draw my remarks to a close and state on behalf of the government that we believe this is a comprehensive and forward-looking package and a significant demonstration of the governmentâs ongoing commitment to ensuring that Australiaâs telecommunications system combines the best elements of competition, customer service and government assistance in the face of market failure.</para>
<para>It represents the biggest commitment by any Australian government for telecommunications servicesânot only for rural Australia, but for all Australians.</para>
<para>The legislative package will allow the government to focus on its core business of setting the rules for the whole telecommunications industry. Telstra will be able to focus on being competitive and delivering the best services to its customers. Consumers can be confident that telecommunications services will continue to improve, service quality will be maintained at high levels and existing consumer rights protected, regardless of Telstraâs ownership. Rural Australia can be assured that ongoing targeted funding will allow them to access 21st century telecommunications services that are comparable with those in metropolitan areas.</para>
<para>All Australians will have the opportunity to share in the benefits from this legislative package.</para>
<para>I commend the bills to the House and present the explanatory memorandums.</para>

<para>âWe oppose the <inline ref="R2436">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2005</inline> and related legislation in its entirety, as we have done consistently since the government first brought this forward. This is a shameful moment for the transparent political process in Australia as the government bulldozes through the sale of Telstra legislation. It is a sad moment for the Australian people, who are overwhelmingly opposed to the sale. We witnessed both in this chamber and in the other chamber an almost obscene dance by our political opponents when this legislation passed throughâobscene against the fact that there is a note of sadness in its carriage for ordinary Australians because they do not want this to happen and they are obliged to witness an arrogant government triumphant on the subject.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is a day when our countryâs national interest has been sacrificed for one manâs old extreme ideology. The whole shameful saga has been characterised by deceit, cover-ups and backroom deals, presided over by a Prime Minister who cannot be bothered to be in the country today to witness the final shabby episode. As his decade-long obsession approaches realisation, where is he? He is strolling in Central Park and spending night after night at the luxurious Hotel Pierre in a cloud of self-aggrandisement, phoning home occasionally to issue instructions to his henchmenâthe Treasurer, the Minister for Finance and Administration, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, and his fumbling deputy. The Prime Minister is thousands of kilometres away in New York, but he is up to his neck in the political manoeuvring to complete the deal to sell off Telstra, whatever it takesâmore pressure on Barnaby Joyce; more bullying and sledging of Telstra executives; more buck-passing, trickery and deceit, culminating in yesterdayâs disgraceful Senate gagging, arrogantly ramming the legislation through as Telstra service complaints hit the 14 million mark. Secret documents reveal thousands of Telstra jobs will go, and the share price continues its inexorable decline.</para>
<para>In a last desperate plea, regional and rural Australians trapped and now forever imprisoned by ancient technology begged their elected representatives to stand up and say no. It was a call unheeded by Barnaby Joyce, who rolled over like an old kelpie yesterday. After building his election campaign on a âno saleâ platform, he is now the puppet of the faceless delegates of the Queensland National Party conference. But the plea from the bush is not too late for the member for Hume and the member for Riverina, both of whom contrived to be absent on 14 occasions when we voted on this legislation. Today they have a chance to win back the trust and respect of their constituents and not go AWOL but cross the floor and vote with us. The deceitful manipulation that has characterised these last few weeks reveals an obsessive government determined to implement its extreme proposals at any cost to Australian consumersâmum and dad shareholders, small shareholders, the thousands of Telstra workers now fearing for their jobs and the integrity of the parliamentary process.</para>
<para>Over the past months Australians have flooded talkback radio demanding that the PM, his deputy, the Treasurer, the communications minister, National Party senators and coalition backbenchers get on with the job and fix Telstra, not sell it off. But the Prime Minister says there is nothing he can do and that the only way he can sort out the bushâs problems is by selling Telstra. He does not have any ideas to help people in regional and rural Australia. He says it is a $3 billion package, but he is fiddling the figures. When you look at the detail of the Telstra plan, the so-called $3.1 billion, you realise it is all an illusion. There is $1 billion and then a slow drip off the earnings of a $2 billion base. That means it will take 20 years before they have spent $3 billion on the communications infrastructure from the fund.</para>
<para>While the Prime Minister may have succeeded in pulling the wool over Barnaby Joyceâs eyes, most of the western Queensland farmers will be shaking their heads in bewilderment that the National Party has been sold a very mangy looking pup. And all the time there has been the relentless noise of the Prime Minister incessantly protestingâhe has repeated this hollow claim 19 times since November 2001âthat services in the bush are âup to scratchâ. It has been something for us on this side of the House. We know the National Party spokespeople are actually Liberalsâlike their leader and like the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. You see them constantly pulling the wool over the eyes and putting the pressure constantly on those who represent something old and authentic in the National Party, and there are not many of them left. It has been a not particularly edifying spectacle for all of us here. But what you know is this: whatever concerns anybody has about the bush as far as communications are concerned and whatever concerns, frankly, there are in Telstra, cease today. It is all overâfinished. What you see now in regional Australia is what you get. That recordâthat which infuriates those people in the bushâincludes the thousand exchanges that are obsolete and in desperate need of upgrading to ensure basic landline services; the prime ministerial spin that provokes the New South Wales Farmers Association to describe bush telecommunications as âa jokeââthe drivel that drives 80 per cent of farmers in New South Wales to oppose the sale.</para>
<para>The only way we can guarantee that all Australians can get decent standards of phone services is to hang on to Telstra. All Australians know this, especially the 1.6 million shareholders who have been deliberately kept in the dark about the true financial position of the companyâthe mum and dad small T2 investors who have suffered a 41 per cent loss since listing, representing a $3,580 loss on the purchase of 2,000 T2 shares in 1999âand the consumers, who have made a whopping 14 million complaints about services; fourteen per cent of lines are faulty. And then there are those who know as a result of reading the documents that we saw leaked last week that for $5.8 billion they could have had a first-class communications service, but they will never have it. It will never happen.</para>
<para>What have we learned in the last few weeks about government manipulation and deceit over Telstra? We know that at the 11 August secret briefing to the PM, his deputy, Treasurer, finance minister and communications minister, the new Telstra boss, Sol Trujillo, blew the whistle. It was a crucial briefing for the majority shareholderâand one denied the rest. The rest had a legitimate right to know that Telstra was borrowing billions of dollars to pay dividends. They had a right to know that Telstra had not made the investments that it had needed to make and that it had underinvested in its core infrastructure and capabilitiesâthat the government needed to invest an estimated $2.6 billion to benefit 1.1 million families and businesses predominantly in rural and remote areas. All that information was denied to shareholders and the bush.</para>
<para>How did the Prime Minister and his ministers respond to Mr Trujilloâs revelations? Did they immediately recognise that they were in possession of price sensitive information that every shareholder was entitled to share? Did they acknowledge that on the brink of the sale the company was engulfed by financial weaknesses and infrastructure failings that they were obliged to fix before any sale? No, not at all. They did not say a word. They stayed mum. They took a gamble that this explosive information would not leakâat least until they got their sale legislation through. But once the word was out, they squirmed in their lame attempts to explain who knew what and when. Take the Prime Minister on the <inline font-style="italic">7.30 Report</inline>:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Well, Kerry, the question of what precisely my ministers knew in relation to particular things, I would have to speak to them in relation to those particular things before I could answer that question.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">A decisive Prime Minister sharing the burden with the community! And then the communications minister and the finance minister, both present at that infamous meeting, were at serious odds with one another. Questioned specifically about whether she knew that Telstra had underinvested in infrastructure, Senator Coonan said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Well, no, of course not. I mean, thatâs not something that the Government is privy to as Telstra rolls out its capex expenditure.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In a way you hope she was misleading. In a way you hope that the sort of briefing that she had received she had understoodâshe is, after all, the communications minister. It is almost a worse story if she is out there not misleading than if she is out there misleading. Finance Minister Minchin appears much better informed, anyway. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">And of course, theyâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Telstraâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">kept us fully informed, as they did the whole market of what their capital management plans were ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">And then when the briefing document is leaked, what does the Prime Minister do? He blames the whistleblower. He denounces the Telstra executives as a disgrace for talking down the companyâs share price and campaigning against government regulatory proposals. He makes this extraordinary remark:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I think it is the obligation of ... Telstra to talk up the companyâs interest not to talk them down. That is a view which I have communicated very directly to the chairman of the board on behalf of the government.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In other words, what the Prime Ministerâs ill-judged words did was to tell the chairman of Telstra to commit an illegal act. That is basically what the Prime Minister was instructing the chairman of Telstra to do. It is an extraordinary thing. I thought it was such a delight yesterday to watch the Treasurer mince around that particular proposition. But he let us all know, and more particularly let his backbench know, exactly what he thought of the Prime Minister on that subject. In reality, he was delighted to do so. He was absolutely delighted to shaft the stiletto into the Prime Minister. The only thing that upset him, of course, was that the Prime Minister was absent from here to witness the stiletto sinking in.</para>

<para>âAs you say, no doubt he will send the video. There is no doubt about that. Now those ill-judged words of the Prime Minister are under intense scrutiny and ought to be part of a thorough ASIC investigation of Telstraâs compliance with its continuous disclosure obligations.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Leadership means having a vision to carry the nation forward. There has been nothing visionary about the spectacle that we have witnessed here over the last week, just a dishonest dash to sell Telstra before anyone finds out just how bad things are and a Prime Minister who resorts to lawyers and bureaucrats for cover, who bullies Telstra management, instructing them to lie to the Australian people, and whose government has sucked billions of dollars out of Telstra and ripped the guts out of its services. Any Australian can tell you that Telstra services are nowhere near up to scratch. We know that Telstra is paying dividends out of reserves, and that is unsustainable.</para>
<para>We know that the Prime Minister knew what was going on but did not tell the other 1.6 million investors. At first, he righteously opined that he would be breaking the law if he told them what he and his ministers knew. The next day, he completely changed his tune, claiming it was all public knowledge that has been known in the marketplace since July last year. The public certainly did not know about the faults. They did not know about the extent of the looting of Telstraâs reserves. They did not know about the underinvestment. They did not know about the developing obsolescence of the work force. The Prime Minister can waffle on about legal obligations all he likes. He can wriggle and make excuses and resort to hiding behind his lawyers. But today he has not only failed all Australians; he has failed their children and grandchildren. He has carved up Australiaâs greatest national assetâdeath to public process and bereft of any vision for our future.</para>
<para>As I look ahead to where we can be in 2025, I see a nation that is bigger and stronger than it is today, a nation that lives within its means, that produces quality goods and services that the world wants to buy, a nation whose imagination is energised by Australiaâs global leadership in surging industries like alternative energy and biotechnology. I see a nation that says to its young people: âYou can be whatever you want to be. Weâll invest in your skills and know-how and weâll back you all the way.â I see a nation that says to its regions and towns: âYouâre part of the country, just as much the strength of this nation as people living in our suburbs and big cities, and weâll never leave you behind.â I see a nation where there is less politics and more vision and ambition from government, a nation characterised by respect and decency that can believe in itself, a nation that is good, does good and feels good about itself.</para>
<para>Our nation faces economic change and external threats, and some want us to change who we are and what we stand for, but we know who we are. We are Australians, we are all equal, and we will look after each other. In the Labor Party now, as we confront the consequences of this legislation passing, that means making absolutely certain that, as the government struggle with what they have chosen to do, as the government sell outâbecause there is only one way that they can sell this between now and the next election and that is a fire saleâwe hold up before them all the information that is out there now on what is absolutely needed in communications in the bush and in our suburbs. We are not going to let this issue go. We are going to campaign on this issue right down to the next election. We know this absolutely: whatever proportion of Telstra is sold, it will not be the lot. There will be the hope in the public mind and in the mind of regional Australia that somebody will be there to make a stand for them, to make sure that they still have a capacity from governmentâ</para>

Before doing so, I intended to rebut the arguments that I heard today from the Leader of the Opposition, who opposes our policy of selling the rest of Telstra. I have just sat here and listened to him speak for about 17 minutes. Sadly, I heard only one argument that he has put to us today about why the government should not sell the rest of Telstraâthat is, the Australian people oppose us doing so. I think that is a relatively poor argument, considering that this is the fourth time we have been re-elected with selling the rest of Telstra as part of our platform to govern.</para>

<para>âI doubt that very much, Member for Cowan. But I would like to address the two bills that we are discussing here today: firstly, the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2005, and then, following that, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Issues) Bill 2005. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline> Both of the bills that we are looking at today are part of a package of measures that I was very proud to campaign for during the last election campaign. It will be a good day for the residents of Stirling when these bills are passed. I am genuinely pleased that the passage of these bills will bring to an end one of the most absurd aspects of public policy in Australia today, where the largest telecommunications company in Australia remains in a hybrid form of ownership, half owned by the private sector and half owned by the government. That, plainly, is a ridiculous situation.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>We have heard from the Leader of the Opposition today about how services will suffer as a result of the passage of these bills. When you are in opposition, and you cannot seem to work out what you stand for, all that is left is opposition for its own sake. We have heard fearmongering on a grand scale in this debate and in the industrial relations debate, and we will continue to hear it until Labor comes up with some positives for Australia.</para>
<para>If Labor, under their current leadership, knew why they wanted to governâif they had a set of coherent ideas that they could take to the Australian people about improving the countryâit is just possible that they could have contributed in a constructive way to the creation of a new regulatory regime of telecommunications in this country. Alas, what they chose instead was blanket opposition, which contributes absolutely nothing to todayâs debate. What we have heardâand what we will no doubt hear, drearily, from speaker after speaker todayâis an ideological argument against privatisation. Amazingly, that argument was put this morning by somebody who championed privatisation when he was last in government.</para>
<para>The reality is that the continued health of telecommunications services in Australia has absolutely nothing to do with Telstra remaining half-owned by the government. When the Prime Minister addressed this chamber on 6 September this year, he said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The reality is that, until we get the burden of majority government ownership off Telstraâs back, it will not be able to operate as a fair dinkum company in the Australian telecommunications market. That is the reason why we are going to sell it. It has nothing to do with budget proceeds; it has nothing to do with ideology.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Government ownership will not provide all Australians with access to first-class telecommunications. This has never been the case and never will be, whether the industry we are talking about is telecommunications or otherwise.</para>
<para>Perhaps the best example of this is the woeful situation that existed when Telecom Australia, as Telstra was then known, was 100 per cent owned by the government. When Telstra was 100 per cent in government hands, it took up to two years to get a telephone service connected. Now, no matter where you live in Australia, whether it be in the remotest part, the longest you will wait to get your phone connected is 20 daysâ20 days as opposed to two years when Telstra was 100 per cent in government hands.</para>
<para>The quality of services will be determined by the regulatory framework that the government will establishâa framework that will guarantee all Australians a base level of services. The government will retain the right to intervene when market failure does occur and to either enforce individual companies to remediate the problem or to fix the problem itself. Not only does this system of oversight allow a base level of services but it also ensures diversity within the market, which will result in more competition and therefore better services for all Australians. Government ownership does not ensure this; proper regulation does. I will continue to maintain that government ownership of Telstra detracts from its ability to provide services effectively when it is competing against up to 100 other competitors. The reality is that, since we came to government in 1996 and half privatised the company, telecommunications services have continued to improve.</para>
<para>Privatising Telstra is part of a longer term agenda to increase competition and efficiency in Australia and to strengthen our economy. Effective rules and regulations will guarantee services. Since 1997, telecommunications expenditure and commitments by the Australian government have exceeded $4 billion. Of this, $1 billion has been invested directly into telecommunications services in rural and regional Australia. This targeted funding investment has supported the provision of important telecommunications infrastructure and services. The new targeted funding package recently announced by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts and the Prime Minister, which comes on top of all that has been done to provide services already, is a key element in the governmentâs strategy to future proof regional Australiaâs telecommunications services. The underlying message of this package is that it is the governmentâs priority to ensure that all Australians will have access to world-class phone and internet services.</para>
<para>I also rise today in support of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Issues) Bill 2005. This forms part of the package of telecommunications legislation which gives effect to key components of the governmentâs Connect Australia telecommunications package. It gives effect to the competition and consumer regulatory changes that the government announced in August. I commend the governmentâs commitment to strengthening competition and consumer protection measures.</para>
<para>The bill guarantees that full privatisation of Telstra will be preceded by strong regulatory safeguards to protect and stimulate competition and encourage growth and diversification within the industry itself. The government will strengthen the framework to continue to promote an open and competitive telecommunications market to ensure that competition continues to develop now and into the future. The changes will beâvery sensiblyâtechnologically neutral, avoiding the mandating of any particular technologies in what is a very rapidly changing sector. The changes strike a balance between the need for regulation that promotes competitive services to consumers and the need to invest in new infrastructure. This is a twofold mechanism, allowing Telstra the scope to meet changing market conditions and the demand for services.</para>
<para>Since 1997, competition has already delivered tangible benefits to consumers in the form of lower prices and a greater choice of service providers and products. There are now over 100 companies providing telecommunications services. The benefits of this competition are most evident, I believe, in the area of international phone calls and mobile telephony. I well remember that it was a big occasion to make an international phone call when I was growing up and Telecom Australia was in charge of all the international calls going in and out of the country. Nowadays, due to competition, it is a lot cheaper and the benefits to consumers in that area and in mobile telephonyâwhere we have seen prices consistently reduce over the past decadeâshould be obvious for all to see. Competition has revolutionised our telecommunications market. We should remember these great advances when we are here today debating the benefits of competition. It is grossly unfair for players within this market, apart from Telstra, who are forced to compete against their own governmentâa situation in which true competition on an equitable basis can never occur.</para>
<para>There are many aspects to the governmentâs new regulatory and competition reforms that will benefit consumers. The bill will introduce operational separation to ensure that Telstra treats its wholesale customers fairly. It will also provide greater certainty for companies looking to make new investments in infrastructure, and clarify and speed up decision making by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.</para>
<para>Perhaps the most significant advancement in all of this is the objective of operational separation, which will achieve transparency for Telstraâs wholesale customersâwho are of course their competitorsâso that they can be confident that they are getting a fair deal, compared with Telstraâs own retail businesses. This will work through the government introducing processes that ensure Telstra does not unfairly favour its own retail businesses over wholesale customers by imposing separation measures. This robust and effective measure is necessary to police Telstraâs behaviour post sale and will further make sure that collusion will not affect the market environment.</para>
<para>The requirements will mean that Telstra will have to implement separate retail, wholesale and key network business units, including separate premises and staff incentive programs based on the performance of those business units. This process will ensure that price and non-price terms and conditions are provided on an equivalent basis to Telstraâs retail and wholesale customers and that the government and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission have oversight and enforcement. This model provides a sound approach to achieving the objectives without slicing and dicing Telstra into pieces. It is credible, cost-effective, durable, enforceable and tailored to Telstraâs business. The government are committed to ensuring that competitors get opportunities in what is a fiercely competitive market. We are determined to make Telstra accountable for their actions.</para>
<para>Other measures of this bill give the minister power to direct Telstra to amend the plan, if it is found not to be complying with that plan, and the power to rectify its behaviour. The minister also has broader powers to direct Telstra to amend the plan if it is found not to be operating effectively. By committing Telstra to an open and fully consultative process, it ensures fairness and transparency for Telstraâs competitors.</para>
<para>I would like to take this opportunity to make mention of the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Coonan. Her commitment, along with the commitment of others in the government in providing better telecommunications for all Australians, has been relentless. Recently she visited my electorate of Stirling, which is suffering from some broadband black spots. She announced a renewed commitment from Telstra through additional funding which will go a long way towards eradicating those black spots. I would like to thank the minister for doing that.</para>

<para>âThat is not true. You will find that all those black spots will be filled. I am happy to discuss that with the member for Swan afterwards. While the details are yet to be finalised, this extensive plan is going to strengthen competition and regulation through other measures.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Also as part of this bill, the government will amend telecommunications-specific access and anticompetitive conduct provisions of the Trade Practices Act to provide greater certainty for new investment. This will ultimately improve the operation of the telecommunications access regime for competition, creating more options for consumers. To provide greater certainty to investors in new networks, the ACCC will be required to consider the costs and risks associated with new network investment when making access decisions. This builds on existing provisions which allow companies to seek certainty about how they will be treated by the ACCC prior to making investments. Obviously, our providing that certainty within the market is vitally important when they are making business decisions.</para>
<para>To improve and speed up decision making by the ACCC, the government will be providing additional resources to that body to enable them to fulfil their mission effectively. Also, by streamlining the ACCCâs processes and requiring the ACCC to make procedural rules for declaring new services, assessing access undertakings and arbitrating access pricing disputes, the federal government is further enhancing the body that will effectively regulate the telecommunications sector. This will be reviewed again in 2009, which will ensure telecommunications competition arrangements keep up with the demands of consumers and the market.</para>
<para>Furthermore, the current price controls on Telstra expire at the end of the year. The government will introduce new price controls on Telstra, to commence from 1 January 2006. These price controls will maintain the 22c cap on untimed local calls; ensure parity in local call prices offered to regional and metropolitan customers; cap increases in the charges for connecting phones, in line with inflation; ensure that, on average, there will be no price increases across a basket of Telstraâs line rentals, local calls, STD, international and fixed-to-mobile calls; protect consumers from major line rental increases by allowing only basic line rental products to increase to match inflation; and, finally, require Telstra to have a package of services targeted to low-income consumers. However, the new price controls will no longer cover services provided to large businesses. This ensures that the benefits of all call price reductions are passed through to consumers and small businesses. This is an important aspect of the governmentâs commitment to protecting its current and future customers and making sure that their hip pockets are safeguardedâanother avenue where the Australian government protects its taxpayers.</para>
<para>Recognising that continued evolution of competition may place pressure on Telstraâs national pricing structures, the government will be looking further into the interaction between the current approaches to wholesale and retail pricing, in consultation with Telstra and the ACCC. These changes will ensure competition continues to develop in Australia and will continue to bring benefits to consumers in the form of lower prices and new and improved services.</para>
<para>The Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2005 forms part of a package of legislation that coincides with the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Issues) Bill 2005. The bill will enable the Commonwealth to sell its remaining shares in Telstra, and it is imperative that this happens. Passage of this bill will trigger our commitment to providing $1.1 billion in funding for broadband, mobile and Indigenous community services, as well as the establishment of the $2 billion Communications Fund, to be maintained in perpetuity for funding future upgrades as determined by regular reviews. Despite owning Telstra, the government does not control Telstraâs operations. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âLabor opposes the <inline ref="R2436">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2005</inline> and related bill. These bills do not just sell Telstra; they sell out Australia and they short-change Australians. There are two related elements to these debates, and both of them lead to the same conclusion: Telstra must not be sold. The first element is a consideration of the parlous state of the network. I have just heard the member for Stirling talk about how good things are, but this is a network that this government and successive Telstra boards have brought to its knees. The second element is the treatment of small Telstra shareholders, who have been short-changed by this governmentâs unhealthy obsession with the Telstra sale.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This is a government that ought to be ashamed of itself for what it has done to Telstra, not just by these bills but over the last nine years. It is a cumulative disgrace. We are dealing with not just another broken election promiseâa promise that the government would not sell a further share in Telstra until the system was up to scratchâbut the fact that the government has overseen massive underinvestment in the Telstra network, which has denied many Australians access to a world-class telecommunications system. Everyone knows that the economic future of this country has to be built around participating in the services economy, in particular, and having access to world-class telecommunications. If the regions, in particular, cannot get hooked up to world-class broadband services, they will not be able to compete and cannot be part of the growth opportunities, and that is where a government that owns and controls what is almost a public monopoly in terms of the provision of this infrastructure quite frankly has to play a role.</para>
<para>I remind the House that, for the whole of the past nine years, the government has been the majority shareholder. It has been able to influence decisions of the board. As the national government, it has had the capacity to directly invest in the nationâs infrastructure, but it has failed on that task. If in fact the system is not up to scratch now when the government has owned and controlled the company, how does anyone seriously expect the system to improve when it is fully privatisedâexcept at a price? And that is the rub. That is one of the aspects this government will not tell you about. On top of all thisâon top of the failure to invest, on top of the fact that the company has massively underinvestedâthe government just did not tell us; it failed to disclose, and it failed to allow to be disclosed, the true state of the network. It took a new CEO straight off the plane from America to reveal the state of Telstraâs network and the boardâs unsustainable dividend policy. What was the Prime Ministerâs response? His response was to attack the management of the company. But attack them for what? He attacked them for telling the truth.</para>
<para>The Prime Minister had form in this regard. Remember the ânever, ever manâ in terms of the GST? This is a person who does not want the truth told when it does not suit the governmentâs interests. This is a failing that has not only held back the economic development of the nation; it has ultimately hurt the company. Largely forgotten by the government have been the T2 investors. Those investors have been horribly burnt. They have seen a 40 per cent decline in the value of their investments.</para>
<para>I have heard the Prime Minister talk in this House about one of his so-called proudest achievements: the way in which ordinary wage earners have been able to get real wage increases. How proud is he of telling people to buy the T2 sharesâthe second tranche of Telstraâand to have faith in the government, only to see their value decline dramatically by 40 per cent? The truth of it is that these investors paid more for their shares because the government did not tell them the truth. They were told by the government that the Telstra share value was growing strongly and that investment would help them plan for their future. Some future! They have lost 40 per cent in value. Thousands of dollars have been lost by these investors.</para>
<para>Apart from the fact that the government has not got the system up to scratch, it should not have brought these bills into the House before it answered these two critical questions in relation to the investorsâthe mum and dad investors. First, how was the T2 price calculated or substantiated? Second, why did the subscription price drop so dramatically? The government has an obligation to answer those questions. These are the questions that matter, not only to the T2 investors, who have a right to know, but to the potential victims of the T3 float.</para>
<para>The bills purport to future-proof regional and rural Australiaâs telecommunications. They do not. They consign regional Australians to a second-rate telecommunications future. We now know by virtue of the secret dossier that was presented by Telstra that the government has overseen underinvestment to the tune of $2 billion to $3 billion in the Telstra network over the past three to five years. Rural and regional Australians have been by far the biggest losers. Telstra reveals in the secret document that one in seven lines is faulty. Just think of itâa government telling us the system is up to scratch, but Telstra telling us that one in seven lines fails. How can the government say the system is up to scratch when one in seven lines fails?</para>
<para>The worst of the worst exchangesâa list that I released last weekârevealed that the extent of Telstraâs network failings was worst in rural and regional Australia. The overwhelming majority of Australiaâs failing exchanges are located in regional Australia. I have talked before about how regions will not be given the opportunity to grow, to create jobs, to take part in the prosperity, unless they get access to world-class communications. The system is failing all around the country, but the biggest failures are in the regions. Many of those areas are located in the electorates of National Party and Liberal Party members. They have sold out their constituencies.</para>
<para>Senator Joyce capitulated, but at least he had a go. He asked the questions. He pushed the government. It is a huge disappointmentânot only to us but more importantly to the constituents in Queensland he claims to representâthat he was mugged, bruised and bullied and that he conceded. He voted with the government. The members for Riverina and Hume have abstained from voting in this chamber. They know how poisonous this decision is within their electorates. They should have a bit more courage and come in and vote with us against the sale. As for the rest of The Nationals, they might as well be members of the Liberal Party. These days the National Party is just a paid-up sub-branch of the Liberal Party.</para>

<para>âIt is an absolute disgrace. So great is this betrayal by the National Party that this vote will do to them what the GST did to the Democrats. The government said that they would not sell another share in Telstra until it was up to scratch. I have already said that one in seven lines fails, and that the worst of the worst are in the regions. But this was not a promise that was made once by the Prime Ministerâit was certainly made before the last electionâit was a promise made on at least 20 other occasions where we have access to the records. The Prime Minister promised the country not to sell a further share in Telstra before services in the regions were up to scratch.</para>

These were members of parliament who went to the last electionâforget about the Prime Ministerâs word; we know that it is worthlessâin each of their seats with the same promise: âWe wonât sell another share until the system is up to scratch.â We have just heard the minister for communications praised in this House by the other side. What did she concede recently? She conceded that services outside the capital cities are not as reliable as other services. That is straight from the horseâs mouth, straight from the person praised. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Mr Pearce, who is at the table, laughs. This is the governmentâs responseâthey gloat, they smirk. They have all taken smirk lessons from the Treasurer. They think it is so effective. The fact is they have made lying an art form.

<para>âI wonder about that. Certainly the leadership seems to be in that camp. It makes one wonder at what point Mr Corish and his colleagues were themselves mugged, like Barnaby Joyce. I remember Mr Corish in the Senate inquiry, in the one-day assessment the government allowed the Senate to undertake.

This is what the South Australian Farmers Federation had to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Some rural and regional areas in South Australia have some of the oldest and poorest telecommunications infrastructure in Australia. If this is not fixed before the full sale of Telstra, we will be passing on substandard infrastructure to generations to come, which will make their farm businesses and rural communities unsustainable.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I can understand the government not caring about rural Australia but not the National Party. What is its base, if it is not the farm sector? We have a circumstance in South Australia where the farmersâ representatives are saying, âWe will have unsustainable businessesâ, but the National Party does not want to hear that. It turns a deaf ear; it turns against its constituency. I tell you: no party will survive if it ignores its base. The National Party has ignored its base and will pay a heavy price.</para>
<para>âUnsustainableââindeed! The word âunsustainableâ is not my word; it is the word of the farm sector in South Australia. Why do they say that? They say it with good cause, because we now know that Telstra estimates that investment of $5.7 billion is necessary to deliver next generation broadband to households and businesses across Australia. How can farms survive and sustain themselves in the future unless they are going to have access to that? How do they get up-to-date weather reports? How do they follow where the prices are? How do they make those sorts of decisions that are so vital to modern businesses? How do they do it if they do not have the services? They do notâthey suffer; they go out of business; they are forced off the land. Well done, National Party! That is the sort of future you are consigning your base to.</para>
<para>The governmentâs sale package, whatever it says, will not deliver that investment. It will not even fix the current holes in the network. The proposed Connect Australia program falls far short of what is needed. We have seen the examples of the rorts programs. There is absolutely no guarantee that the funds will not fall victim to the same sort of rorting that the government has turned into an art form.</para>
<para>Let the House understand this: returns from the proposed Communications Fund will not begin to flow until 2008âthat is three years awayâand will provide only a fraction of the existing Telstra dividend stream, which, on most estimates, is $100 million a year. Forget about the $2 billion; that is what is being invested in a trust fund. The only thing that will be available from it for telecommunications improvement is the earnings on the fund. Do you think $100 million is going to be enough per year, especially set against a dividend stream that has been producing in the order of $1.3 billion to $2 billion a year? What nonsense. How could the National Party fall for this stupidity? The simple truth is that the investment in telecommunications infrastructure has been funded from Telstraâs existing dividend stream.</para>
<para>The Acting Prime Minister yesterday, in his answer to a dorothy dixer from the member for HinklerâI recall this wellâchallenged Labor to say what policy it had ever put forward to fix the infrastructure problem in telecommunications. I will tell him. Back in 1998 Labor proposed the establishment of the Telstra reward fundâa fund that would see not all of the dividend from Telstra but 35 per cent of it paid into a fund to improve rural, regional and other infrastructure particularly associated with telecommunications. We repeated that policy on a number of occasions. I got the Parliamentary Library recently to calculate what that fund would be worth today had it been invested in. Do you know what it would be worth? $5.3 billion. What does that tell us? It tells us that the problem in telecommunications can be fixed without selling Telstra. That is the point. If you have the will, determination and preparedness as majority shareholderâas a government that actually believes that investing in our future and telecommunications is important for regional Australiaâyou make sure the investment happens. You either do it as the majority shareholder sitting on the board and reinvesting the companyâs profits or you do it as a government from the dividend stream that it gets.</para>
<para>But we have seen that the government has only had two purposes for the dividend. One is to prop up its budget surpluses. We know back in 2001-02 that, if it had not been for the Telstra dividend stream, the budget would have been in deficit. The Treasurer does not like deficits; the Treasurer does not want them, so he will do anything. He will raid Telstra. He will tell it that it cannot invest again in the system; it has to invest in us, the government, and in our survival! The second reason that it has been keen to get these dividends is to keep the share price fattened, to keep it up, and to make people believe that this payment of dividends means that the company is travelling well and therefore the share price is worth something. Why was that important? Because it had to con people even more that T2 was worth something. We now know that T2 is worth lessâa lot less; 40 per cent less.</para>
<para>This is a government that has not had a vision for telecommunications and the layout of its infrastructure. I say this to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, who is at the table: read Laborâs policy and understand what could have been achieved in this. It is a policy that demonstrates that you do not need to sell Telstraâjust fix it, and you can fix it without selling it.</para>
<para>The policy that we proposed was important not just in terms of the infrastructure. We have also demonstrated that selling Telstra is bad for the budget. We have done this on a number of occasions, and our calculation has been confirmed by the Treasury. There is an excellent article by David Uren in todayâs <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> that shows that this sale of Telstra, on his calculations, is bad for the budget. Even on his most generous forecast, it will cost the budget at least $290 millionâand, having sold it, you do not have the dividend stream which comes year in, year out; you lose that forever.</para>
<para>Not only is it bad for the bush; it is bad for the budget. Why would you do it? That is the point in terms of this governmentâs obsession. They say it is not ideological. What is it? It is not based on any sense that it is going to improve regional infrastructure. It is not based on any sense that the investment is going to be guaranteed in a world-class telecommunications system in this country. It is not based on anything that says that it is going to be great for the budget. There is more pain for the T2 shareholders. They have seen their share price drop even further since the release of the secret document.</para>
<para>There is a very interesting question here in relation to a class action if in fact, on 11 August, Telstra came here and said, âWe have a shocking system; we have a system that has been underinvested in; we have an unsustainable dividend practice,â and the Prime Minister said, âOh, thatâs no good; keep that hidden; donât tell anyone about that.â But then it got out. I think there is a very interesting question. What about the people who invested in T2 between 11 August and the time of the revelations in the document? Donât you think they are entitled to action against the board of directors of Telstra for having been kept in the dark and making an investment believing what was out there in the marketplace when the deceit of what was out there in the marketplace was different from what was being said in the secrecy of the cabinet room?</para>
<para>The Prime Minister gets a secret briefing but he does not want the truth out. But it gets out. Indeed, when it gets out, the Prime Minister is asked to release it and he says no, it was a secret briefing. So concerned is the Securities and Investment Commission, the watchdog, that it is now investigating Telstra and, as I understand it, investigating the Prime Minister and his statements. Well, it should. The legislation that we are passing today in this parliamentâcourtesy of the Liberal Party and the sell-out National Partyâis bad for the bush, bad for the budget and bad for investors. That is what it is about. We will campaign on these issues around the country, day in, day out, to make sure that people understand not only the lost opportunity but the dudding that they have been getting. That is a solemn promise.</para>
<para>The value of T2 shares has fallen by 40 per cent since the listing. This week the shares are languishing at a two-year low. How does the government explain that fact? How does it explain the collapse of share value for mum and dad investors who believed the government when it told them that T2 was a good deal? Quite simply, it cannot, and it does not. No company engaged in such deception would be allowed to get away with it, but, as always, there is one rule for this arrogant government and one rule for everyone else. It is clear that the interests of small shareholders have been the last thing on this governmentâs mind. The government has sold out the bush and it has sold out small investors. A good government this one! Just remember it next time you are asked to vote for it. It is in the clear interests of small shareholdersâ</para>

<para>âYes, go down a hole; I think that is the best solution for him. These shareholders deserve the truthâthe truth about their investment. At the briefing on 11 August, Telstra revealed that its network is crumbling from massive underinvestment, one in seven of its telephone lines is faulty, the staff are undertrained, its IT systems are hopelessly inadequate, and its dividend stream is built on unsustainable borrowings. Well, that is a good scoresheet! I wonder what the market would think of that. I know what it already thinks, and it means another loss to T2 shareholders. Customers deserve this information; T2 investors deserve this information. They only got it because Labor forced the governmentâs hand. As I say, the Prime Minister was perfectly happy to keep it hidden.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>This government does not want the sale subjected to any scrutiny. That is why we have seen this dreadful guillotining, this shameful abuse of the democratic processesâno scrutiny. There are questions that still need to be answered. What will happen to the share price now that Telstraâs dividend policy has been exposed and, according to its own board, is unsustainable? We need to know the answer to that. We also need to know how a toothless local presence plan will stop Telstra packing up and deserting regional communities when it cannot turn a buck. And we need to know how the government will stop a rampant privatised Telstra putting the interests of its shareholders first and the interests of the customers and employees last. On the employee issue, it is not just the secret document the other day but also another document that the government will not releaseâ14,000 job losses.</para>
<para>Yesterday Labor revealed a chilling email written by Mr Greg Winn, another one of the amigos, in which he said that they âDo not expect any radical moves to strip people out until we are readyââin other words, until the bills are through the parliament. Once it cannot be held up to anymore scrutiny, then we will sack them, then we will cut more services, then we will disinvest in the company. All for the purposes of getting this grubby deal through the parliament, they will sit quiet on it. It is little wonder Australians oppose this sale. They oppose it in droves and they will have that opportunity when we campaign around this. I said that we oppose these bills.

<para>âOf course, they donât want to listen. We listened in quietness to the member for Hotham, with his old-fashioned Fabian socialist ideas of how he wants big government to own every enterprise in the whole model that was shown to the world as being one of failure. Point to a socialist system that has worked effectively and that provides for its workers, for the members of the country, a very significant increase in their standards of living. I will show you one on the other side of the agenda where real growth occurs, where the private sector is the one that runs the economy, not the government owning large enterprises. It cannot respond to market changes in a whole different, dynamic world. That is the fact.</para>

<para>âI have heard the member for New England arguing before his old-fashionedâ<inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline> As I was sayingâand I thank the Chief Opposition Whip for drawing the attention of my colleagues to what I am sayingâthe members opposite are living in this brave new Fabian socialist world, where big government controls big business and everything that happens in it, rather than in a free market economy, where the governmentâs role is to get out of business and to be there simply as regulator. That model has proved successful in those countries around the world that have adopted it. That model, which responds to modern economic conditions, has delivered to those countries the right economic returns with growth in GDP, significant improvements in real living standards and reductions in unemployment and in inflation.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The member for Hotham has outlined the model of previous days at great length. We know that today, with the Latham diaries dominating the events of this House, all those opposite are following the line, regardless of what they actually think. Mr Latham has highlighted the fact that those opposite are finished as a political forceâand this, the Telstra debate, is a prime example of why they are finished. They live so much in the past, with past ideology as to the management of the economy. In contrast, this side of the House is concerned with appropriate management of the economy and with providing real results for the people of Australia.</para>
<para>Let us look at the results in terms of GDP growth. Since this government has been in power, we have had an average GDP growth of 3Â½ per cent per annum. We now have the lowest unemployment rate that we have seen in this country for over 25 yearsâdown to five per cent. I know, Madam Deputy Speaker Bishop, in your seat and in mine, those figures are down to about 2Â½ per cent. So the people in our areas know that this government delivers. Then there are real wages. Whether they be blue-collar workers, white-collar workers or management people, the real income of people in Australia has risen by over 15 per cent since this government came to power. With all your unionist mates and their Fabian socialism, under your government real wages only rose by three per cent. It highlights the fact that, under a free market economy under appropriate management, we have real growth for the average worker of this country. This is what we have in terms of the privatisation bill before us. This bill is about allowing government corporations to compete in the private sector without being trammelled by the numerous regulatory constraints of a government body.</para>
<para>There is some degree of hypocrisy in this exercise. If we go through past speeches, as I have been doing, we find out what those opposite did when they were on this side of the House. On 17 September 1990, in speaking about the privatisation of various bodies, Mr Beazley said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">When someone raises such a matter we are entitled to expect that person to come into the chamber with a coherent privatisation strategy.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">They were the words of the Leader of the Opposition in September 1990âand how he changes his tune pragmatically when Leader of the Opposition. Then in October 1990, in praising Bill Kelty, Mr Keating said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">He has been powerful because, basically, he has moved the trade union movement to this policy. But he has stood in support of the sale of Australian Airlines Ltd and Qantas Airways Ltd. The Opposition could never do these things.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">There they were, privatising Qantas, as they privatised Australian Airlines and the Commonwealth Bank. When they were on this side of the House, it was all okay. They spoke about the great moves they were makingâthe great economic reforms. Mr Hawke, in a speech on this issue, said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">These decisions are yet another instalment of the Governmentâs drive for micro-economic reform, a process that is creating a more dynamic and efficient Australian economy, an economy that can take on and compete with the worldâs best.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Precisely; that is the type of government we want in this country and the type of economic reform we want to see in itâbasic microeconomic reform which moves this country forward. We compete in a globalised world, where corporate bodies are out there looking for every opportunity. Unless we move forward by taking the advantages of reform, we will slip further down on the table of economic performers. We are very proud that, within the range of OECD countries, we sit amongst the top economic performers in the world. What a great achievement that is.</para>
<para>Turning to this bill, let us look at some of the comments appearing in the newspapers. Do they support the opposition in its stand? Let us take the editorial in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>. About the sale of Telstra, it says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">This is good, if long overdue, news, a result <inline font-style="italic">The Weekend Australian</inline> has advocated for many years ... By getting out of telecommunications, the Government will release about $30 billion. Treasurer Peter Costello has talked of using this money to pay for public service pensions, which would free up tax revenues to be spent on useful social programs. There is no reason not to do it.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It goes on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">There is no longer any need for the public sector to own telecommunications infrastructure, anywhere. Rural rent-seekersÂ ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">may have their commentsâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">But as <inline font-style="italic">The Australian</inline>âs Newspoll showed this week, 79 per cent of people outside the capital cities are satisfied with their phone service, 6 per cent more than the comparable city figure.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">But we were not content with that. With this proposal, the government is putting in $3Â½ billion to improve our telecommunications network around this country and in country areas. So the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> strongly supports our proposal to privatise Telstra.</para>
<para>The <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> says:</para>
<quote>
<para>Notwithstanding the tortuous nine-year path to this point, the prospect of finally privatising one of Australiaâs biggest companies is relief.</para>
<para>Telstra will be free to chart its own course, subject to regulation. And the governmentâs paradoxâbeing both owner and regulatorâwill disappear.</para>
<para>Let the market make its verdict on the performance of the company. And let management and shareholders do the work of grappling with the regulator.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is the advice of the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline>. I am sure that very few members opposite bother to read what the financial sector has to say about the governmentâs proposals. The <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline> says: âThis is a good idea. It is long overdue. It is important for microeconomic reform and it is important for the reform of our economy.â</para>
<para>What a great contrast with the speech we have just had from the member for Hotham, who is back in the pastâback controlling and owning these large government corporations; never mind the marketplace. He talked about the share value. If the government had had its way, we would have seen the privatisation long ago and in a different market situation. The question is: what do the editorial writers say? They are fully supportive. What do the newspapers say? They are all fully supportive. Who says anything different? The only people who say anything different are the unions, who are living in the past, living in their own Trotskyist little cells out there and saying, âLetâs take over the old companies, letâs put our mates on the board and letâs run them as a public service network.â This is what they want for the future.</para>
<para>The Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2005 will empower the government to sell its remaining shares in Telstra at some point in the future when the government deems the conditions to be right to proceed with the sale. It will remove the requirement in the Telstra Corporation Act 1991 for the Commonwealth to maintain a 50 per cent plus one share in Telstra. This is all supposed to be very radical, according to the opposition, but this is exactly the same requirement and bill that they put through in relation to Qantas when they diluted the amount of government ownership in that. We supported that move totally, but all you people on the opposite side can do to show how irrelevant you are is say: âWeâre against it. No matter what the government proposes, weâre against it. No matter what our track record is in privatisation, weâre against it. No matter what it might do to free up the economy and improve competition from other telcos, weâre against it.â</para>
<para>This bill has been designed to allow as much flexibility as possible in setting the terms of the sale. The Future Fund is so important in allowing us to prepare for the futureâthe future requirements of the government in the area of superannuation liabilities and infrastructure building across the country. How important is that? If you look at the United States, they expect there will be a significant gap. In 10 years time, 23 per cent of the economy will be required for or involved in their social security payments, their superannuation liability for public servants right across the board and their Medicare obligations. The current government take is 15 per cent, and there is a lot of concern about how they will bridge that gap. But this government has recognised the problems of the future, including the demographic changes that are occurring, and is preparing for the future through the Future Fund, which is a very significant, innovative step forward and one to be supported.</para>
<para>The bill will remove a number of ministerial discretionary powers and reporting obligations once government ownership falls below 15 per cent. It also affirms the universal service obligation and the customer service guarantee, which are so significant. It is not as if we are cutting and running. The government will continue to look at community service obligations and at what we need to do to look after the interests in the bush.</para>
<para>Despite the protestations from the member for New England, telecommunications service in the bush under this government and Telstra has improved dramatically. We have seen the provision of $1.1 billion in funding for broadband, mobile and Indigenous communications services. A further $2 billion Communications Fund is to be maintained in perpetuity for funding future upgrades, as determined by regular reviews into regional communication. This bill will also allow the government to remove and redress the conflict of interest that arises from having the government as both the regulator and the largest participator in the communications marketplace.</para>
<para>In conclusion, may I say that the members opposite continue to live in the past, in an old socialist world of the government owning all the major companies. This government is moving forward in response to the demands of the time and providing a competitive environment so that Telstra, cut free of the obligations of being government owned, will service the community and have competitors. At the same time, through the amount that is received from the sale of the shares, we will achieve a significant plus in terms of looking to the future of this country. We will put that amount into infrastructure and into paying off liabilities. Of course, members opposite have no concern about future liabilities. We know how they racked up some $96 billion in debt. Their economic responsibility is clear for everyone to see, and their hypocrisy is clear for everyone to see, given what they did with the sale of the Commonwealth Bank, the sale of Qantas and the sale of Australian Airlines. The government have said consistently that we aim to sell Telstra as part of our move for microeconomic reform in this country. I support the sale strongly, and I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para>âToday we see the government ramming through its ideological obsession with the full privatisation of Telstra in less than a morningâs debate. It has had this ideological obsession, shared by John Howard and Peter Costello, for a long time. In ramming through its ideological obsession this morning in less than half a dayâs debate, what do we find? We find the Howard-Costello governmentâthe Liberal and National partiesâdoing that in breach of an express election commitment made to the Australian people. That commitment was not just made on one occasion, in the run-up to the 2004 election. There was an express commitment made in the 2004 election, the 2001 election and the 1998 election that the government would not further privatise Telstra unless there was a guarantee of adequate services to rural and regional Australiaâunless, as the Prime Minister has put it, services were up to scratch. And that faithful promise, that faithful commitment to the Australian people, is being broken today.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I have been a member of this parliament since 1993, and at every election since thenâ1993, 1996, 1998, 2001 and 2004âthe Liberal and National parties have gone to the Australian people with a commitment to privatise part or privatise more of Telstra, and on every occasion the Labor Party has gone to the Australian people opposed to any or any further privatisation of Telstra. Today we meet that faithful undertaking that we made to the Australian people at successive electionsâ1993, 1996, 1998, 2001 and 2004. Today the government is pursuing its ideological objective. In the course of pursuing its ideological objective, in the course of pursuing its obsession with the privatisation of Telstra over the last 9Â½ long years that the government has been in office, we have seen the government comprehensively neglecting a whole range of telecommunications issues, which has rendered Australiaâs international competitiveness in telecommunications down at the bottom of the scale. That applies in particular to some of the competitive and regulatory arrangements which I will come to in due course as I make some remarks on the <inline ref="R2437">Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Issues) Bill 2005</inline>.</para>
<para>The Australian people and this parliament should not forget that when John Howard made his election promises in 1996 he said to the Australian people that he would go to the 1996 election with a promise to privatise one-third of Telstraâwhat we know famously as T1. In the run-up to the 1996 election and in the so-called great debate in that election campaign, John Howard was asked on a number of occasions: âYou only want to privatise one-third? That leaves one-third private and two-thirds public. Doesnât that leave you a bit pregnant?â In response, John Howard said on more than one occasion: âNo, no. Thatâs the right public policy mix.â So, having told that to the Australian people in 1996 so that he could slide through and get himself elected by hiding the complete extent of his ideological obsession, he said: âNo, thatâs a fine public policy mix. There is no drama attached to that. That is not unusual. There are over 30 telcos in OECD countries that have a mix of private and public ownership. Telstra is not unique in that respect.â But suddenly these days, of course, this becomes the reason why. The Prime Minister says there is a yoke on Telstra, that the great burden on Telstra is the two-thirds, one-third mix of public and private ownership. If that is the caseâwhich I do not agree with and which I rejectâit is a yoke or a burden the Prime Minister has put on the company himself.</para>
<para>When we look at the history of the governmentâs privatisation efforts with the T1 privatisation and the subsequent T2 privatisationâwhen the parliament, courtesy of Senator Harradine, authorised a further sale from 33â per cent to 49 per centâon both those occasions we have seen the governmentâs economic management credentials being very seriously challenged and questioned. On the first occasion, T1, the analysis of the Auditor-General after the event was that the government had put those shares out to market at a substantially lower price, at cost to the taxpayer. With T2, the nearly two millionâthe 1.6 to 1.7 millionâsmall shareholders know to their cost the incompetent economic management by the government.</para>
<para>We will all recallâI certainly recallâthe Prime Minister, when asked about what investors should do in respect of T2, saying in the context of that further privatisation that it was a great deal. The question was put to him: âWhat should worried investors think about Telstra?â He said, âItâs a great deal.â The then Minister for Finance, one of the formal shareholders of the Commonwealth, Mr Fahey, said on the floor of this chamber that it was a worthwhile investment and people should contemplate in the context of that investment the fact that the Commonwealth continued to have substantial assets and holdings in Telstra.</para>
<para>So we had the Prime Minister saying in 1996 that one-third, two-thirds, a mix of public and private, is an ownership mix which does not cause any public policy difficulties. We had the then Minister for Finance saying in the context of T2, and following on from the Prime Minister saying that it was a great deal, that one of the reasons it was a great deal was that the Commonwealth government had a shareholding, an ownership arrangement. Those small investor shareholders out there who purchased their T2 shares at $7.80 are perfectly entitled, as letters to editors and radio talkback feedback indicates, to feel that they have been ripped off by the government in respect of their shareholding arrangements.</para>
<para>I return to that solemn pledge that the Liberal and National parties made, not just in the 2004 election but in 2001 and in 1998, that they would not further or fully privatise Telstra unless services to rural and regional Australia were up to scratch. Let us look at the objective record: I can recall month after month the reports of the old Australian Communications Authority detailing service deficiencies in outer metropolitan Australia and in rural and regional Australia and the government, in pursuit of its ideological obsession, trying to establish inquiry after inquiry to try to get any inquiry to say that services were up to scratch.</para>
<para>Their first inquiry was chaired by Mr Besley. Even before Mr Besley took any evidence, he was on the public record quite happily saying that he was a supporter of the full privatisation of Telstra, that he was a full privatiser. Yet not even Mr Besley could be brought to the barrier; not even Mr Besley could recommend in a report that services in rural and regional Australia were up to scratch. Having failed with Mr Besley, in a subsequent parliament the government moved on to Mr Estens. They got a bit closer with Mr Estens. Mr Estens said that if you adopt these 39 recommendations and implement them then there is some chance that services in rural and regional Australia might be adequate.</para>
<para>The problem for the government is, firstly, that not all those recommendations have been implemented and, secondly, that the National Farmers Federation, both its national body and its constituent state branches, is out there saying that, despite a partial implementation of the Estens inquiry recommendations, services to regional and rural Australia are not up to scratch. As if you needed any further adviceâthe government could not get the Besley inquiry up to the mark and it could not get the Estens inquiry up to the mark. If we fast forward to the current context, we now knowâout of the horseâs mouth on 11 August this yearâthat Telstra itself was providing the government with detailed advice that shows conclusively a failure to invest in Telstra over recent years in the order of $3 billion to $4 billion, which included paying dividends out of reserves, and Telstra is incapable of providing adequate service to rural and regional Australia or to outer metropolitan Australia. We find in Telstraâs once secret advice on 11 Augustâwhich the government was happy to try and keep secret, but we know how the cat got out of the bag on that oneâthat Telstra has received 14 million phone fault reports and that over 14 per cent of Telstraâs lines are faulty. On Telstraâs own admission, how could you in any sensible or plausible way expect that that would lead to adequacy of services in rural and regional Australia?</para>
<para>In that context we find earlier today the amendment coming back from the Senateâthe drop in the ocean, last-minute, âBackdown Barnabyâ, National Party inducement. Where has the National Partyâthat once great National Partyâbeen on this issue? Black Jack McEwen would be rolling in his grave at the way in which the current National Party has tugged its forelock to the Liberal Party lawyers from Melbourne and Sydneyâa once great National Party, who once saw it as its role in life to stand up for the interests of rural and regional Australia. Where are they now? They are tugging their forelocks to the Liberal Party lawyers from Melbourne and Sydney. What would those once great National and Country Party ministers, AnthonyâAnthony senior, of courseâNixon, Hunt and Sinclair, be thinking as they look in now? What would those once great National Party ministers be thinking looking in and seeing the decline of a once great National Party now led by Mr Vaile, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, supported by his own deputy, Mr Truss, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, and the last cab off the ministerial rank for the National Party, Mr McGauran, who has the responsibility for the passage of these bills through this parliament? What would those ministers be thinking looking in at the decline of a once great political party led now by Mr Vaile, previously led by Mr Anderson, the former Deputy Prime Minister? It is a regrettable fact on an analysis of Australian politics that the current leader and former leader make Charles Blunt look like an effective leader of the National Party. At least you could say of Charles Blunt that he put his stamp on the National Party. The only stamp that is being put on the National Party these days is the stamp of the Liberal Party from Melbourne and Sydney, driven by an ideological obsession with the full privatisation of Telstra.</para>
<para>As a consequence of that ideological position there is no concern about the interests of the Commonwealth taxpayer, as reflected by the T1 privatisation, no concern about the interests of small investor shareholders, as shown by the aftermath of T2, and no concern for the national interest, as shown by their ideological obsession. They are refusing to baulk in any way at the secret advice received from Telstra on 11 August and refusing to baulk in any way at the suggestions that Telstra themselves remain very concerned about their capacity to meet their obligations to rural and regional Australia.</para>
<para>Part of that ideological obsession has seen a serious neglect so far as the government is concerned of some major regulatory and competitive issues. We find the culmination of those regulatory and competitive issues now contained in the additional legislation: the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Issues) Bill 2005. It is quite clear that the model that the government has adopted in that bill is fundamentally flawed. The problem for government is that it has adopted a model of operational separation that is fundamentally flawed. The operational separation regime outlined in the bill is considered by the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee inquiry into the bill as containing very little detail as to how that final operational separation model will operate. The bill merely provides a very broad framework for that operational separation model and then allows Telstra three months to prepare a draft operational separation plan for approval by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. In other words, the government is effectively saying that it wants to set up a regulatory regime for Telstra, but it is happy to let Telstra write that regulatory regime, with the minister giving it the tick behind closed doors.</para>
<para>The legislation also provides that the pricing principles which will govern the provision of Telstraâs wholesale services will be determined at a future date by committee consisting of Telstra, the minister and the ACCC.</para>
<para>I suspect from the ACCCâs view that that is a two to one majority against it. Here is a situation in which the government is openly saying that they want to enshrine in legislation that a minister goes and sits in on commercial and regulatory negotiations between the regulatorâthe ACCCâand a company, Telstra. It is of course the case that these commercial negotiations materially affect any communications competitors that Telstra has. The simple, fundamental question that needs to be asked here is: why should the minister be involved in determining prices in the marketplace directly with Telstra, by far the major telco in the marketplace? Why should the minister be sitting on a committee determining prices? Where is there any transparency or independence here? These negotiations between Telstra and the regulator about the competitive regime and the regulatory regime should be free from interference from the minister and should take place directly between the ACCC and Telstra.</para>
<para>The practical effect of this is likely to be that companies that rely on ministerial decisions in many other areas will be afraid to speak out about their view of what is going on. Telecommunications companies will be afraid to criticise the legislation, because their future commercial operations rely on the goodwill of the person who is determining the prices they will be charged and will be able to pass onânamely, the minister. It is wrong in principle to put Telstra, its competitors, the ACCC and the ministers in that position.</para>
<para>We have no objection to the notion of operational separation, but the way in which the government is implementing it is fundamentally flawed. Indeed, the Chairman of the ACCC, Mr Samuel, noted during his evidence to the Senate inquiry that a number of issues required further consideration, including the precise details of the operational separation plan and Telstraâs obligations in relation to that plan, the scope of the services that will be subject to the operational separation plan, the enforcement regime associated with compliance and noncompliance with the operational separation plan, the powers to investigate whether or not compliance has occurred, and the development by the proposed working partyânamely, the working party between Telstra, the ACCC and the departmentâof the internal wholesale pricing and the pricing equivalence regime. So there are some fundamental flaws in those regulatory and competitive arrangements.</para>
<para>If you speak to Telstraâs competitors over the years, you will find that their essential complaint has been that very serious competitive and regulatory issues have been ignored and neglected by the government. There is a very simple explanation for that. The government has always been very slow out of the blocks, not wanting to move on competitive and regulatory issues which might have an adverse impact so far as Telstra is concerned in the marketplace but a beneficial impact so far as competition is concerned, because it wanted to ensure that the Telstra share price would be as high as possible, to enable the government to have an argument to slide through the further or full privatisation.</para>
<para>The problem for the government is that that game has now been comprehensively sprung by Mr Trujillo and the other Telstra executives who gave that formal and frank advice to the government on 11 August. What did the government do? The government tried to do everything it possibly could to make sure that that did not become public or that the community was not aware of that before it slid through the legislation to fully privatise Telstra.</para>
<para>All these issues will come home to roost. In the 2007 election, which you can currently expect to be in the last quarter of 2007, the Australian community will again have a stark contrast between the Liberal-National parties and the Labor Party. The Liberal and National parties, in breach of a faithful election promise, will have passed legislation to fully privatise Telstra, ignoring the needs of rural and regional Australia, ignoring the national interest and pursuing a Liberal Party ideological political interest. In stark contrast to that will be a Labor Party with a firm and proud record of wanting to say: âWe need to ensure that our international competitiveness in communications is right at the top of the list, not at the bottom of the list, and the absolute, essential condition is to ensure parity and adequacy of services in telecommunications to regional, rural and outer metropolitan Australia.â That stark contrast will be there for all to see, and it will be there at great cost to the Liberal Party and the National Party.</para>

<para>âThe <inline ref="R2436">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2005</inline> and the <inline ref="R2437">Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Issues) Bill 2005</inline> form part of a package of telecommunications legislation which enables the government to proceed with its longstanding policy to fully privatise Telstra. The key features of this legislation include the removal of the current requirement in the Telstra Corporation Act 1991 that requires the Commonwealth to maintain a minimum of 50.1 per cent of shares in Telstra. Incidentally, we currently own 51.8 per cent. They include flexibility for the government to determine the structure of any further sale of Telstra, including the ability to offer hybrid securities or to transfer shares into the Future Fund or the Communications Fund; and confirmation that shares transferred to the Future Fund or the Communications Fund are not to be considered shares owned by the Commonwealth. They include the removal of a number of ministerial direction powers and reporting obligations related to the governmentâs majority shareholding when the Commonwealth shareholding falls below 15 per cent. This does not, however, affect ministerial direction powers relating to specific telecommunications regulation or Telstra licence conditions such as operational separation. A further key feature is the affirmation, by specific inclusion in the act, of the governmentâs commitment to the universal service obligation and the customer service guarantee as basic telecommunications consumer safeguards.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The core component of this legislation is the removal of the requirement that the Commonwealth maintains a minimum of 50.1 per cent of the shares of Telstra. Why is this important? The government is currently responsible for the regulation of the telecommunications industry, whilst having a direct financial interest in the operation of the main telecommunications carrier in the industry. Divestment of its remaining shareholding in Telstra will allow the government to concentrate solely on the regulation of Telstra for the benefit of consumers and industry. At the same time, it will allow Telstra to focus on the business of providing telecommunications services without the distraction of the government as a shareholder. The divestment by the government of its remaining shareholding should also dispel any thoughts amongst competitors that Telstra is gaining special benefit by virtue of government ownership.</para>
<para>The current requirement to maintain a 50.1 per cent shareholding in Telstra by the government has a negative effect on the business operations of Telstra. As long as the government is required to maintain a 50.1 per cent shareholding, Telstra cannot raise new equity capital or introduce a dividend investment plan, because that would reduce the Commonwealthâs ownership below this level. This inability to access markets and the consequent need to rely on debt markets adds to the cost of capital and limits the amount of funds that can be returned to shareholders. It is estimated that the ALPâs opposition to the full sale of Telstra has not only cost the taxpayer some $30 billion but reduced the value of the shares and dividend returns of the several million Australians who own shares in Telstra.</para>
<para>In a free market, Telstraâno longer owned by a regulator with a vested interest in its profitabilityâwould be just one among a number of private companies required to compete for customers and meet certain standards. As long as Telstra remains a state owned enterprise, there will always be the temptation for future governments to shift the regulatory balance away from protecting consumers and towards maximising revenue streams from this huge asset. This was covered by the previous speaker.</para>
<para>The <inline font-style="italic">OECD communications outlook 2005</inline> stated that countries such as Australia and France that have laws requiring the state to maintain majority ownership of the incumbent operator have now rescinded these laws and have made it clear that they are willing to reduce state ownership to below 50 per cent. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline> Australia and France are willing to reduce state ownership below 50 per cent and in certain cases have made commitments to privatise completely. This process needs to be encouraged, to avoid situations which have occurred in previous years, where government ownership of incumbents conflicts at times with best practice regulation and policy making. In only two OECD countries, Luxembourg and Turkey, is the incumbent telecommunications operator still wholly owned by the state.</para>
<para>In other countries where there is state ownership of the incumbent, some progress has been made in reducing the governmentâs share in operations. Government ownership is expected to decline over 2005-06 throughout all OECD nations. The sale of the remaining shareholdings will enable a number of initiatives that were announced in the Connect Australia package, which was presented in August this year. The Connect Australia package involves an investment of $1.1 billion in services; a perpetual $2 billion Communications Fund from the proceeds of the Telstra sale to generate revenue for rural telecommunications services into the future; improved competition regulation, including a requirement for the operational separation of Telstra to deal with ongoing concerns about Telstraâs high degree of integration; and enhanced consumer safeguards which build on the existing universal service obligation and the digital data service obligation.</para>
<para>Service levels are not linked to government ownership of Telstra. The less the government has owned of Telstra the more services have improved. Ten years ago the government owned all of Telstra, and prices were higher, services were slower and the range of products was much smaller. With consumer safeguards in place there is no longer any practicable public interest role in continued government ownership of Telstra. The telecommunications regulatory structure provides wide powers sufficient to allow the government to regulate Telstra without relying on or needing to own Telstra.</para>
<para>This bill affirms these consumer safeguards, namely the universal service obligation and customer service guarantee. The universal service obligation entitles all Australians to access to a standard phone service and payphone regardless of where they live or carry out their business. In general terms a standard phone service means a basic fixed phone line with access to local, national and international calls; 24-hour access to the emergency call service number; operator assisted services; and itemised billing, including itemised local calls on request. If the universal service obligation provider cannot connect or repair a line in the specified time frame, it must offer an interim service such as a mobile or satellite phone until the permanent service is provided or restored.</para>
<para>The customer service guarantee entitles all Australians to timely service for connection and repairs to their standard phone. Currently Telstra is the only universal service obligation provider in Australia. The customer service guarantee applies to Telstra and to all other telecommunications companies. The sale of the remaining shareholdings in Telstra will be in line with other reforms that have been introduced over the years that have been focused on giving all Australians equitable access to telecommunications services and ensuring that Australia as a nation takes full advantage of the benefits that new technology can bring in increased productivity and better delivery of services.</para>
<para>Australiaâs telecommunications sector has developed progressively from a largely centralised, publicly controlled monopoly structure, through a managed competitive model, to an open and competitive market regime with an emphasis on industry self-regulation. From 1901 to 1975, telecommunications was widely regarded as a government service. The Postmaster Generalâs Department was a department with its own minister and directly provided telecommunications and postal services to the public. In 1946, the Overseas Telecommunications Commission was established to provide international telecommunications services, again as a government service.</para>
<para>From 1975 to 1988, the Postmaster Generalâs telecommunications functions were moved to the newly corporatised Telecom Australia. Telecom was established as a statutory authority operating with greater independence from the minister for communications, providing domestic telecommunications services on a monopoly basis. Nevertheless, Telecom retained some governmental functions, notably a large range of explicit regulatory powers regarding technical matters such as technical standards for equipment connected to the network.</para>
<para>In 1981, an additional publicly owned carrier, AUSSAT, was established to operate a domestic satellite system. AUSSAT started commercial operations in 1985. From 1988 to 1991, liberalisation of the sector progressed. As part of the reforms implemented under the Telecommunications Act 1989, value-added services, customer cabling and customer equipment markets were opened to competition, and Telecomâs regulatory powers were vested in a new, independent regulator, AUSTEL. AUSTEL was given the role of facilitating competition in these markets and given several consumer protection roles. Explicit price controls were imposed on Telecom for the first time. The 1989 changes also subjected Telecom to a range of accountability and management reforms designed to provide it with a more commercial focus, no special benefits accruing from government ownership, greater operational freedom, management independence and accountability.</para>
<para>From 1991 to 1997, the market was opened to duopoly competition at the network level, and the services market opened up with the removal of prohibitions on the resale of basic services. A second full service competitor, Optus, and a third mobile network operator, Vodaphone, were licensed. The Telecommunications Act 1991 introduced a carrier-neutral approach towards the communications market. It gave the minister for communications wide-ranging powers to impose obligations on carriers, including a flexible and powerful licensing regime. AUSTELâs role was considerably widened to deal with resourcing issues such as numbering, intercarrier disputes, anticompetitive behaviour, tariff and pricing issues, law enforcement and a wide range of other matters.</para>
<para>The Telstra Corporations Act 1991 merged Telecom and the Overseas Telecommunications Commission into what has become known as Telstra. Telstra became a public company registered under the Corporations Law. Being an independent corporation, Telstraâs board and management were responsible for the day-to-day running of the company. This included Telstraâs strategic direction and decisions of an operational nature, such as employment and investment issues and how the organisation carried on its business.</para>
<para>1997 saw the introduction of reforms which further liberalised telecommunications services, with the opening up of the market for infrastructure as well as services. The Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Act resulted in one-third of Telstra being divested, with the first shares being traded on 17 November 1997. The bulk of the sale proceeds from the partial privatisation were used to retire government debt. Around $1.49 billion was used to fund the Natural Heritage Trust. Around $250 million was applied to the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund. The gross proceeds from the sale were $14.24 billion and direct costs of the sale were $260.61 million.</para>
<para>During this time, a comprehensive competition framework was put into place to facilitate efficient market entry, and a wide range of consumer and other protections were established. The Australian Communications Authority replaced AUSTEL as the industry regulator, with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission regulating the new telecommunications specific provisions of the Trade Practices Act.</para>
<para>Before the divestment of 1997, Telstra aimed to connect new phone services in remote Australia within 810 daysâalmost in the same league as countries such as Hungary and the Czech Republic, which had waiting times for a new line of roughly 1,058 days and 2,170 days respectively. Today, however, Australians can get a new phone service within 20 days, wherever they live.</para>
<para>Since these reforms of 1997, the average price of telecommunications services, including both call prices and line rentals, has fallen by some 20 per cent. The reforms were also a huge boost to the economy. It is estimated that the economy is $10 billion larger than it would have been without the reforms. Small business is estimated to have benefited by $2.16 billion, and households by around $924 each.</para>
<para>Since 1997, the regulatory regime has been progressively refined in relation to consumer safeguards, to the point where Australia arguably has the most comprehensive telecommunications consumer protection regime in the world. The governmentâs policy since 1998 has been the full privatisation of Telstra. 1999 saw legislation passed authorising the sale of a further 16.6 per cent of Telstra. The majority of the revenues of this sale were allocated to further debt reduction. Funds were also made available to upgrade services in rural and regional Australia under the social bonus. Gross proceeds of the sale were $16.04 billion, with direct sales costs of $169.23 million.</para>
<para>Today, access to high-quality, affordable telecommunications services is more important than ever if Australia is to keep pace with other industrialised countries. The governmentâs primary role is to establish the Australian telecommunications policy framework, which is primarily directed at maximising the long-term interests of the end users of telecommunications services in Australia. The government will facilitate the development of an efficient and competitive market; underpin this market based strategy with a regulatory safety net which is amongst the tightest in the world; address particular areas of need through targeted funding; and provide leadership to the sector and to governments at the state and local levels. None of these strategies for improving communications services rely on the ownership of Telstra. The coalition government are committed to enabling Australians access to affordable, reliable communications services. The final sale of government shareholding in Telstra will enable us to get on with the job of doing this.</para>

<para>Today I want to deal with a number of the underlying issues that are relevant to the question of whether or not Telstra should remain in public ownership and relevant to the future of telecommunications in Australiaâwhere it is likely to head under the Howard government and how it is likely to fare following the privatisation of Telstra in the wake of the governmentâs extreme obsession with privatisation, which has prevailed over all other issues in telecommunications in Australia. The first issue I would like to consider is competition, which in my view is at the core of telecommunications issues in Australia and has been sadly neglected by the Howard government. The Keating government introduced competition in telecommunications in 1992, which began with a duopoly with Optus, and the preparations were in place for open competition to be introduced. That was subsequently put in place by the Howard government in 1997 in accordance with the timetable originally specified by the Keating government and in accordance with policies originally adopted by the Hawke government.</para>
<para>Since then, we have seen a sequence of regulatory failures under the Howard government and an inability to come to terms with the fact that Telstra remains overwhelmingly dominant in telecommunications in Australia and that competition has failed to take root in a way that we would have liked. The end results of this have been a grossly inadequate rollout of new technologies like broadband; Telstra making an EBITDA, as the terminology has itâthat is, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisationâthat has, at times, been over 50 per cent; and Telstra achieving a rate of earnings, a rate of return on its investments, that most Australian companies would kill for.</para>
<para>We have seen a squeeze on ordinary consumers, with massive increases in line rentals for the privilege of having a phone line into their home. In many cases, it has applied to phone lines which have been in place for decades and which cost very little to maintain and keep in place, yet line rental fees have gone up to $30 a month. That is not only a very big imposition on the ordinary consumer; it also squeezes competition. Because the line rental is effectively a uniform part of the total package that a provider supplies to a consumer, it narrows down the scope for differentiation of product and price that is available to would-be competitors of Telstra.</para>
<para>If we want to see how Telstraâs dominance and the inadequate regulatory structure with respect to competition in telecommunications diminish outcomes and results for consumers in Australia, all we need to do is to compare broadband with 3G telephony, or third-generation mobile phone telephonyâvideo and photography over mobile phones. Because there is no immediate and direct significance to the Telstra fixed-line network on the 3G side of the spectrum, Australia has been very much leading the world in 3G. We were one of the early adopters and are one of the countries that have made very major progress with that technology. This is in contrast to broadband, where Telstra is ubiquitous, where what it does with its network is fundamental to the rate of progress with broadband and where we have the unhappy situation of Australia now being 21st on the OECD list of developed countries in terms of broadband access. We have been falling steadily over the past few years, because a few years ago we were 13th on the list.</para>
<para>The governmentâs approach to regulating competition has been spectacularly unsuccessful. We have seen occasional attempts over the past few years to strengthen the competition regime. For example, under former Minister Senator Alston, we saw the introduction of accounting separation at the end of 2002, which was designed to increase the rigour with which the regulatory arrangements ensure that access to Telstraâs network by competitors occurs on a genuine level playing field basis, with proper pricing that reflects the true cost of that access. That accounting separation regime has been a manifest failure, and the government has implicitly acknowledged that by putting forward yet another regulatory system. The reason it has been a failure is that Telstra is still able to game the system; it is still able to use the regulatory regime as a means of exhausting its opponents with very lengthy and difficult disputes that inevitably involve large expenditures of money on lawyers.</para>
<para>At the last election, with me as the shadow communications minister, Labor advanced as its key regulatory reform a policy of the virtual separation of Telstra. The idea behind this is that Telstra should be effectively split internally between its wholesale or network activities and its retail activities in order to ensure that the regulator can, at a glance, see whether Telstra is giving itself the same terms, conditions and prices for use of its network to deliver telephony and other telecommunications services that it is providing to its competitors. This kind of approach has been in place for a number of years in the United Kingdom, and it has been in place for a number of years in Sweden. Although there are obviously differences of detail and there are further reforms in the pipeline in Britain, it clearly is a much more effective way of ensuring that the publicly owned network and publicly created network can be used on a level playing field basisâon an even, open basisâby competitors.</para>
<para>There are some commentators who suggest that Telstra is already being forced to provide to its competitors access to its network at below costâat below the true price and at below the true price it offers itself. There is no evidence of this. In fact, the simple question that should be asked of these commentators is: if that were the case, why havenât Optus, Primus, AAPT and all the other competitors effectively taken over dominance of telephone services in Australia? If Telstra were effectively being forced to provide them with access to its network at prices below the price it would effectively have to pay itself, one would assume that over time that would mean that those competitors would effectively put Telstra out of business or, at the very least, make massive inroads into its market share, which has not occurred.</para>
<para>Although the government has adopted Laborâs policy from the last election with respect to the operational separation of Telstra, it has failed to follow through. That is hardly a surprise, because it reflects precisely what has occurred previously. It has sidelined the ACCC. It has asked Telstra to write the rules. It has decided to split Telstra into three sections, not two, and effectively created a differential arrangement between how Telstra deals with itself on the one hand and how it deals with competitors on the other. Rather than having a network division and a wholesale division as a single entity, it has decided to separate them, so there will be a different process and a different pattern of dealing for competitors. Most significantly of all, the government has decided to have the minister of the day, the minister for communications, directly involved in regulatory decision making, in particular with the requirement for the minister to issue a rectification notice where Telstra is in breach of its obligations under operational separation.</para>
<para>This is an extraordinary development because the government has, over time, gradually pushed one claim to the fore in its arguments for privatising Telstra, and that is the alleged conflict of interest involved in the government being both an owner and a regulator of Telstra. I will get to that issue in some detail in a few minutes. The government says that it is a terrible situation for it to be both the owner of this entity and its broader regulator. On the governmentâs own admission, Telstra could remain in public ownership for at least another year or two or possibly longer, and there could be a substantial minority public shareholding in it for an even lengthier period. In those circumstances I find it extraordinary that the government is adopting a model that involves a direct role for the minister in regulating Telstra. Up till now that role has essentially been performed by the ACCC, so there has been an armâs length regulatory arrangement. So, in spite of all of the governmentâs rhetoric about there being a conflict of interest, it is putting the minister directly into the regulatory loop.</para>
<para>I turn now to the state of Telstraâs network, one of the key issues in this debate. It is revealed in the infamous Telstra document of 11 August that 14 per cent of Telstraâs lines around Australia are faulty. The government has responded by saying, âAha. But the Australian Communications and Media Authority data on the number of faults reported for the month of July was that only one per cent were faultyâ99 per cent of lines were reported to be fault free.â We have seen this trick before. When I was shadow minister I exposed the fact that the ACA, as it then was, was effectively aggregating the monthly statistics and averaging them. It was saying that on an annual basis the lines were 98 or 99 per cent fault free, because the average in a given month for the totality of telephone lines in Australia was that 99 or 98 per cent were fault free. But that is a totally misleading statistic when you average it out, because it is not the same phone line that is incurring a fault every month; it is different phone lines. So the 14 per cent is a much more realistic figure, one that gives you a true picture and demonstrates that a very substantial proportion of phone lines in Australia have faults.</para>
<para>Having been all around Australia, having talked to people who work in Telstra and to the many people who use telecommunications and having seen with my own eyes the dilapidated and deteriorating state of Telstraâs network, I know that it makes sense that there is a very high level of faults, because Telstra has been substantially diminishing its investment in its network. In the late 1990s its total capital expenditure was about $4.5 billion. In the last couple of years, that has dropped below $3 billion. And guess where that is coming from? It is coming from investment in the network. So it is no surprise that Telstra reported to the government that there was a $3 billion gap in terms of routine mainstream investment in its network as a result of those decisionsâall of them coming from the governmentâs obsession with privatising Telstra.</para>
<para>The thing that is different about the three amigos and Mr Trujillo is that they are looking beyond privatisation; they are looking at how they are going to run the company and make a decent return. The previous management, understandably, shared the governmentâs obsession with privatisation and subordinated everything they did to the privatisation goal, which meant underinvesting in the network, pumping up the dividend stream unsustainably in order to pump up the share price, and a variety of other things. It is clear that telecommunications services around Australia are not up to scratch, particularly in regional Australia but also in many parts of metropolitan Australia. It is abundantly clear that the government misled the Australian people in the last election campaign by claiming that telecommunications services were up to scratch. It is equally clear that very little is going to be done to fix the problem.</para>
<para>The government have relied over the years on a range of smoke-and-mirrors initiatives, window-dressing initiatives that are designed to make it look like the government are doing something. But those initiatives have not achieved very much. The government have primarily focused on pork-barrelling in appropriate marginal coalition seats in regional Australia. The Networking the Nation fund saw about half a billion dollarsâa very substantial amount of moneyâdribbled out around the country. The Auditor-General, when he examined the fund, reached the conclusion that it was impossible to determine whether the fund had benefited the nation, because there were no benchmarks, no targets, no performance standards. There was no way of telling whether the fund had produced any serious benefit for Australia.</para>
<para>We have more recently seen the HiBIS scheme, the broadband subsidy scheme, which has been dribbled out in the same way. During the election campaign, the government announced specific broadband micro-initiatives for particular small towns that just happen to be at the heart of vulnerable marginal electorates. So rather than building Australiaâs telecommunications infrastructure for the 21st century, rather than ensuring that we have an up-to-date network with decent speeds, accessible to all Australians, the government has been using large sums of taxpayersâ money to window-dress, to create an impression of things happening at the same time as it is pursuing its obsession with privatising Telstra, to the great disadvantage of Australian telecommunications consumers.</para>
<para>On the broadband front, as I said, we are now 21st in the world and slipping, and Australian speeds are very ordinary compared with those of many of our competitors and other nations. We are flattered, if anything, by the OECD statistics because their indicator level is 256 kilobits per second, which is a pretty ordinary broadband speed. Many people would argue that it does not even constitute true broadband. Our take-up rate is only a half to a third of the take-up rate of equivalent nations like the United States and Canada.</para>
<para>Broadband is fundamental to the future of this country. Getting access to decent broadband in the future is going to be as important as getting access to electricity was during the 20th century. It is going to be essential to virtually all kinds of economic activities. A couple of years ago I visited an industrial estate in the electorate of Cowan and discovered that there was a sausage factory there, of all things, that was having a significant problem because it could not get access to broadband. That was having a major impact on its competitive position, because it had to deal with suppliers and customers by fax rather than over the internet. Even for something as apparently mundane and old economy as making sausages, the question of availability of broadband was fundamentally important.</para>
<para>The issue that our nation should be dealing withâthe question that we should be addressingâis not who owns Telstra; it is what Telstra is going to do and what our nation is going to do to ensure that we are at the forefront of the developed world in rolling out high-speed, high-quality telecommunications infrastructure and services that will be the backbone of our economic future. That is the issue that the government has totally neglected. That is the issue that has been the basis for the governmentâs window dressing, its pretending to do something, its trying to look like it is doing something, and its pouring dribs and drabs of money all around the country in various marginal seats for its own political benefits without achieving anything substantial for the nation.</para>
<para>I want to touch briefly on the future of Telstra as a private company. It has been run de facto as a private company for many years, because the government has chosen not to make use of its ownership for broader community purposes, generally speaking. As a result, the government was quite happy for Telstra to seek to launch a takeover bid for the Channel 9 network. Similarly, the government ticked off on Telstraâs attempt to take over the Fairfax newspaper group.</para>
<para>It is pretty clear that once Telstra is privatised, particularly if the government is successful in getting the abolition of cross-media ownership rules through the parliament, it is so big, so profitable, and has such an enormous cash flow that its ability to gobble up half or more of the existing Australian media will create a situation where we could have a massive concentrationâa narrowing downâof power and control in our media. It is eminently possible that a privately owned Telstra will, in rapid order, acquire one of the free-to-air TV networks and possibly the Fairfax newspaper group or parts of it. At the same time it will be establishing internet TV networks. It is already well and truly running down that path; it is 50 per cent owner of the monopoly pay-TV network Foxtel. The implications of this for Australia, for democratic debate and for diversity of public opinion are enormous. That is one of the key reasons why I think Telstra should remain in public ownership. It should be forced to focus on its primary responsibilities and activitiesâtelecommunications ânot media.</para>
<para>I want to make an observation on the matter of conflict of interest that the government places so much emphasis on. The claim is that the government cannot own Telstra because it also regulates telecommunications. Other than the peculiarities of the regulatory regime that has been introduced as part of this set of legislation, which I referred to previously, it is worth pointing out that that regulatory arrangement does occur at armâs length through the ACCC, as it should.</para>
<para>It is also worth pointing out that there are other organisations that the government owns and regulates, which it regulates in a sector where there is competition. The most obvious example, which I completely clean bowled the Prime Minister with in question time last week, is Australia Post. The government is adamant that it has no intention of privatising Australia Post. Eighty-five per cent of Australia Post revenue comes from fully contestable and competitive activities, yet it is owned and regulated by the government, which regulates postal services generally. The situation is precisely the same as that of Telstra. The government both owns the institutionâin this case it has 100 per cent ownershipâand regulates the market. Australia Post competes on a whole host of activities with a lot of private companies. The government does not appear to think that that is a problem, but it is the key reason why Telstra needs to be privatised.</para>
<para>You can make the same observation with broadcasting. The ABC and the SBS compete, in effect, with commercial broadcasters, particularly the SBS, which is competing with commercial broadcasters for advertising revenue. But they are both competing with commercial broadcasters for eyeballs, and the government regulates broadcasting. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI rise today to speak on the <inline ref="R2436">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2005</inline> and the <inline ref="R2437">Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Issues) Bill 2005</inline>. Passing the <inline ref="R2436">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2005</inline> will allow our government to sell down its shareholding below 51 per cent, but it will also maintain the flexibility to put Telstra to the market in the best position for the people of Australia. This is not a rushed sell down; this is about the government divesting itself of a corporation that governments should not be in the business of running. As the member for Melbourne quite rightly said, the issue is not that of who owns Telstra; the issue is where we go from here and what will be done with Telstra and communications.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The <inline ref="R2437">Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Issues) Bill 2005</inline> will legislate to impose on Telstra, through its licence conditions, a requirement for operational separation. It will give the minister the power to determine matters covered by the operational separation plan and the services it covers, require the ACCC to take account of the costs and risks of new network investment when making a decision under the telecommunications access regime, amend the Trade Practices Act to speed up and streamline ACCC decision-making processes and allow the powers of ACMA to be enhanced to accept court enforceable undertakings to ensure compliance by industry participants and to enforce compliance with industry codes. And there will be other changes that will be driven by the minister.</para>
<para>There are also non-legislative parts of this communications package. They include price control determinations. The government has announced that from 1 January 2006 new price control arrangements will come into effect. These arrangements will be implemented by way of ministerial determination. The new arrangements will be brought into effect by ministerial determination prior to January 2006.</para>
<para>The one that really has an effect on my local area is that the government will introduce a local presence plan. This will be imposed on Telstra through licence conditions that will require Telstra to put in place the local presence plan. Telstra has to conduct public consultation on its proposed plan, and the plan must be provided for ministerial approval in December 2005. Once the plans are approved, they must be continually updated and approved every three years.</para>
<para>In this House, over the nine-odd years that we have been in government, there has been a lot of debate. It was this government that introduced the customer service guarantee. There have been many aspects of this, ensuring that we maintain certain levels of communications service and affordability in the area of telecommunications. Backing that up is the universal service guarantee. I have spoken many times on that and I do not wish to go back to it at this point in time.</para>
<para>Earlier this week in the House, we debated three bills that were largely appropriation bills. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline> The young boys and girls from school who are up there in the gallery are probably wondering what has happened. I need them to know that the Labor Party tend to shut people down when they are making constructive points on bills under debate. It is their way of denying freedom of speech.</para>

<para>âThank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Today we are discussing and debating the privatisation of Telstra. But earlier this week there were three bills which I would like to reflect on. Those bills in particular provided for $3 billion, just about 10 per cent of the residual value of Telstra shareholdings by the Australian government, to be invested in future proofing our communications. There was $2 billion for the Communications Fund, which will be administered by an independent board with representatives from rural and regional areas such as mineâ$2 billion that will be invested into the communications network. And, importantly, there is $1.1 billion, of which $878 million will be invested in Broadband Connect, providing all Australians with affordable broadband network services.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>There will be $113 million for Clever Networks, to improve the delivery of health, education and other essential services over the broadband networks. I have a large electorate of nearly 10,000 square kilometres, and I have a lot of satellite hospitals through Hunter New England Health. They will benefit by being able to go online to access health information. I am also impressed by the $30 million for Mobile Connect, to extend terrestrial mobile coverage where it can be commercially maintained and to provide continued handset subsidies for satellite communication. Quite often we hear members of the opposition talk about there being no mobile communications in some areas. There is, and has been for quite some considerable time now, the ability to have satellite mobile phone technology. A lot of my constituents are in remote and distant areas where topography prohibits the use of handheld CDMA or digital phones because of the valleys and mountains in the region.</para>
<para>I would like to reflect on the services prior to this government coming into power. The Labor Party did a deal to increase competition. I welcome that. However, as part of that deal, it agreed to shut down the analog phone network. It shows how city-centric the Labor Party was with its plans when it intended to shut down the analog mobile phone network: the digital or GSM phone network operates predominantly in city areas.</para>
<para>Rural and regional areas, like my electorate of Paterson, relied on the analog phone system. There were only a few areas where it worked because the Labor Party had refused to instruct Telstra to install analog transmitters throughout the country in rural and regional areas. We were left with a situation where the Labor Party had introduced a time line for the shutdown of the analog phone system but without a plan. They had no plan to have telephone services in regional and rural Australia, yet they complain.</para>
<para>It was interesting to note earlier in this week in the debate on the three bills that provide $3.1 billion for investing into our telephone networks that all of the members of the Labor Party, all the Labor members in the Hunter region, voted against $3.1 billion worth of investment. I thought they would be smart politicians. I thought they would vote for the $3.1 billion to be invested, particularly in regional and rural areas where they come from, but they opposed it. I intend to make sure that the public in our area understand that they opposed those bills and did not want the investment in their area.</para>
<para>As we grow and we use technology I am glad to report to this House that, over the last nine years and the sell-off of the first half of Telstra, my communities have benefited. In the number of speeches that I have made in this House I have repeatedly talked about the advancements achieved through the community technology centres and the HiBIS system, the Higher Bandwidth Incentive Scheme, and of the money that has been invested to repair TV blackspots so that people in my area can have access to what most people in the city consider to be normalâaccess to TV channels like 9, 7, 10, 2 and SBS. That has been a great investment. There is still work to be done. We have introduced demand aggregation brokers that have brought people together to build up the demand so that we can put a case forward for increased broadband supplement.</para>
<para>There have been investments in commercial radio blackspots and in the highway mobile phone coverage. I have going through my electorate a part of the New England Highway but I have a large slab of the Pacific Highway and we have improved mobile phone communications on that highway. There has been an extensive roll out in investment in providing mobile telephone communications to towns of under 500 people. In fact, in my electorate now there are over 32 mobile phone transmitters. When I came into office in 1996 there were some five analog transmitters in my electorate.</para>
<para>There are now 26 exchanges in my electorate enabled for broadband roll out. I remember that when I came to parliament in 1996 dial-up internet services were not even considered. The internet was a new thing. Now we have moved to broadbandâand it will never be enough; already we are seeing new technologies emerge. I am glad that we are putting away $3.1 billion to help invest. But it is also important to note that that $3.1 billion will not just be there for the benefit of Telstra; it will be for the benefit of all those other players that have come into the market that do support the increased competition and the privatisation of Telstra because it will give them an opportunity to start competing on an equal footing.</para>
<para>The other thing that the Labor Party omits to advise the House is that, since this government came in and implemented universal service guarantees, we now have untimed local calls in large places throughout Australia. In fact, all call costs have been reduced dramatically. The prices of overseas calls, interstate calls and STD calls through increased competition have reduced dramatically.</para>
<para>As I said, my colleague but opponent the member for Hunter in this chamber criticised me for not speaking on the legislation on Monday. But I am speaking here today and I am putting forward the views of the people in my electorate of Paterson. They demand services; they do not demand ownership. What we will see is an increased roll out, because it is the local member who pushes and strives for such things in his electorate.</para>
<para>The member for Hunter is the Shane Warne of politics. I do not say that because of his ability to put a spin on things. I say that because of the similarities, as we have witnessed in the chamber, with his ability to use the old SMS. I am sure there would be some interesting readings on that and that the similarities between him and Mr Warne would be extraordinary.</para>
<para>It is good to see people using technology for their own advantage. I would like to see an increased roll out. I am looking forward to the increased roll out of XDA, the CDMA high-speed mobile phone broadband network. I am looking forward to seeing the black spots being fixed up in my area. But I know, and my constituents know, that when it comes to mobile telephony there can never be 100 per cent coverage with a CDMA or GSM network. We have a satellite system for those who, through topography or for reasons of distance away from main towns, will not have the ability to use the standard phone systems. It is important and great to see that this government will continue to subsidise call costs and handsets to make them affordable for people. Of course, the more people who take up satellite mobile communications, the cheaper the operation will be because the atomisation of costs will be over a broader area.</para>
<para>I wholeheartedly support this legislation. I will be telling my constituents that I support this legislation. I support the three bills that went through earlier this week guaranteeing $3.1 billion. But I will also be supporting and driving my government to make sure that we, either through legislation or providing incentives, continue to get increased competition and development for the provision of telephone services, whether it be mobile, landline or broadband, into areas such as mine. I support this legislation and commend it to the House.</para>

Let me read out to this House the rollcall of the National Party members who have given effect to the sale of Telstra in this place. Hitherto they will be known in rural Australia as the dirty dozen: the member for Gwydir, the member for Page, the member for Parkes, the member for Mallee, the member for Cowper, the member for Riverina, the member for Dawson, the member for Gippsland, the member for Hinkler, the member for Maranoa, the member for Wide Bay and the member for Lyne. These people comprehensively betrayed rural and regional Australia with this decision.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Let me remind the National Farmers Federation, which caved in to pressure from the government, of the extent of the betrayal that we are witnessing on the floor of this House today. The New South Wales Farmers Federation conducted a survey of farmers in June 2005 and this is what that survey said: 80 per cent of the farmers surveyed opposed the sale. They were asked, âIs your landline reliable?â Noâ29 per cent. âIs your mobile phone reliable?â Noâ63 per cent. âAre you satisfied with your internet speed?â Noâ60 per cent. Here today we have a betrayal of their interests.</para>
<para>We know that Senator Joyce in that other place is known now as âMr 65 per centâ, because he said, âWell, Iâm only 65 per cent happy with the decision.â You cannot be a little bit pregnant in this place. You cannot be 65 per cent sort of happy with it. Let me tell you, Senator Joyce and members of the National Party: you might be 65 per cent happy with the decision that you have madeâbut, out in rural Australia, farmers are 100 per cent disillusioned and unhappy with the decision that you have made.</para>
<para>This is one of the most comprehensive betrayals that we have witnessed on the floor of this parliament. Telstra itself has said in this document that the faults in Telstra are enormous. The services that are being provided to farmers and their families are below par and not up to scratch. What sort of dream time are you living in if you believe that, when this document says you need $5.7 billion to bring Telstra up to scratch and you allocate $3 billion, these problems that have been identified by Telstra management will be overcome? The simple fact of the matter is this: on the sale of Telstra, the spivs, the merchant bankers and the brokers will pick up some $850 million to $1 billion, and the government will invest only $2 billion, with a return each year of $100 million, to address some of the major faults that have been identified by Telstra. Telstra itself has indicated that there has been a massive underinvestment in this telco.</para>

<para>âTwo years ago, when debating the governmentâs 2003 budget changes to Medicare and bulk-billing, the Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare and Private Health Insurance) Bill 2003, I made very clear what I thought about the governmentâs proposal to introduce the then new safety net arrangements. At that time I asked the Prime Minister in question time if the estimated cost of the new safety net had taken into account the likely fee increases under the new regime, which in turn would mean that the thresholds would be met earlier, with a considerable blow-out of the $67.1 million the government had then designated for the safety net over four years. The Prime Minister answered that he did not believe that these outcomesâthe higher fees and consequent higher patient contributionsâand therefore a blow-out in the cost of the safety net for the taxpayer would occur. In the ensuing debate I made the observation that this was wishful thinking, saying:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">As surely as the sun comes up, so too will this copayment be free of its current shackles and head upwardsâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">and so with it, the cost of the Medicare safety net. Here I will pre-empt any suggestion, such as that which the Prime Minister made in answer to my question two years ago, that no copayment exists in the governmentâs Medicare policy by again quoting the 1999 Productivity Commission report on private hospitals, which defined copayment as âPortion of the cost of an insured health service met by the userâ. Needless to say, I could not support that 2003 bill that was going to expose low- and middle-income families to significantly higher costs for their basic health needsâhigher costs that should be borne by a broader, progressive tax system and a hypothecated Medicare levy that delivers universality, particularly to those middle-income and lower income earners.</para>
<para>Fast forward to September last year, just six months after the lower Medicare safety net had passed the Senate. Surprise, surprise: the anticipated 450,000 people per year accessing the benefits of the safety net had blown out to almost 650,000 people qualifying in the first few months alone. The new blow-out of projected costs was over $1 billion, more than double the original projections. And still the rock solid, ironclad guarantee that the current lower thresholds could beâindeed, would beâmaintained was given by the Minister for Health and Ageing during the election campaign in September-October, 12 months back.</para>
<para>Just over a year after the Prime Minister answered my question by saying that he did not accept that there were going to be the consequences that I dared to suggest in relation to the cost of the safety net scheme, the Prime Minister himself told ABC radio that, if the current threshold levels were maintained, the cost of the safety net would be $1.65 billion over the next four years to 30 June 2009. That is almost four times the original projections.</para>
<para>The proposal in the <inline ref="R2376">Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005</inline> to raise the thresholds to the original levels is anticipated to bring that projected cost back down to $1.15 billion, but this is a projected cost for only the next four years, and it is still more than double the cost forecast by the government in March last year, when the safety net was introduced. Yet this still means that one million fewer people will qualify for the safety net. How on earth is the government going to keep trying to restick this Medicare safety net bandaid over the long term, when the bandaid itself started falling off as soon as it was stuck on? How many more people will fail to qualify for support when they need it, and who will qualify when they do not?</para>
<para>An examination of the electorate-by-electorate figures shows a growing bias to well-off seats anyway. Let us look at some comments made from various sources over the last little while. As the Minister for Health and Ageing said:</para>
<quote>
<para>From 1 January 2006, the extended Medicare safety net thresholds will increase from $306.90 to $500 for concession card holders and families in receipt of family tax benefit part A, and from $716.10 to $1,000 for all other families and individuals. The current thresholds will continue to apply to all families and individuals for the current calendar year.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> for this legislation says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... the reason expenditure on the Safety Net has blown out ... is a result of the Safety Netâs structure, whereby Safety Net benefits are not tied to any price signalsâthat is, they are uncapped and effectively unregulated.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">As the member for Hotham said in this second reading debate:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">If Medicare were functioning properly and if it were funded properly, there would not be a need for a safety net.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Therein lie the exact reasons why we have this gradually increasing unfairness built into the safety net process. Any benefit the safety net might offer is entirely contingent on the amount charged by the practitioner. It is not tied to any price control whatsoever, unlike the normal Medicare rebate, which is hooked to the Medicare schedule fee. As I have continued to point out for a number of years, consumersâbut not the governmentâcan see that medical fees will continue to rise with the unlimited expenditure that comes with the Medicare safety net. Raising the threshold only begs the question about who exactly is going to benefitâthe medical practitioners charging way beyond normal prices and their well-heeled patients? Certainly not the sick and poor, who can ill afford to access these specialists in the first place, let alone afford to spend enough on their health care to reach that new threshold. The government has no problem with asking the taxpayer to fork out at least $1.65 billion to support those who have been able to afford to reach the higher threshold, because it is not explicitly obvious to the taxpayer.</para>
<para>But, if I dare to suggest that we attend to the core of the problem by properly investing in a universal health system for the long term, both sides of the House bury their collective heads in the sand. I have long argued that both the schedule fee and the Medicare rebate to doctors, and the schedule fee on which the rebate is calculated, should be raised to realistically reflect the cost and worth of medical consultations for GPs in particular. Certainly, in previous years, the AMA and the Productivity Commission have recognised thisâand perhaps I would take the Productivity Commissionâs assessment before the AMAâs. They have said a $50 standard consultation fee is far closer to the mark than the current schedule fee, which stands at $30.</para>
<para>Most of the electorate know that this is an acceptable thing to do and are prepared to pay for a fairer system, as long as their money, through Medicare and through their taxes, is going into the Medicare bucket. But this bill ensures that Australiaâs money is instead, by stealth, redirected not into a universal health care system but into the pockets of higher fee charging medical practitioners. Poorer, often more elderly, constituents are left to struggle with not only their illness and disease but the inability to afford the specialist care they badly need. Often they cannot afford even to make the journey to the medical help and support that they so desperately need.</para>
<para>This is tackling health care from the wrong end and building inflationary pressure into health care costs, to the disadvantage of the needy. I cannot support this legislation. It will be very interesting to see what Senator Joyce and Senator Fielding, in that other place, think of the âfamily friendlyâ elements of this piece of legislation.</para>
<para>In an overview of the figures that have been put out about the safety net provisionsâI do not have them with meâit is interesting to see the electorates that are showing a marked increase in access to this benefit. They are certainly not those rural and regional electorates where the poorer recipients of health care and those who are in desperate need of that support live. On that note, I reiterate that nothing in this suggests to me that there is any plan by this government to properly protect those most vulnerable in our society, who demand and deserve the medical protection that they certainly need. They will be left without it, and this is skewed entirely in favour of those at the other end of the spectrum who can certainly afford to pay more for their health care.</para>

<para>âWho would expect the Howard government to be any different from previous conservative governments? Laborâs Whitlam government in the 1970s introduced much needed free hospital treatment and the Medibank rebate system. The Fraser Liberal government took those services away, only for them to be replaced with Medicare by the Hawke Labor government in 1984. Since the 1970s the conservatives have never really been supportive of Australians receiving free medical treatment. This was apparent when the Howard government suggested changes to Medicare to make it look like the American two-tiered system and named the package, very inappropriately, A Fairer Medicare. These changes were only prevented because the coalition did not have the numbers in the Senate to pass the legislation. If the proposed A Fairer Medicare legislation had been allowed to pass it would have meant the end of Medicare as we know it.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>However, with the assistance of Independent senators and a lowering of the initially proposed thresholds of $500 for concession card holders and other low-income earners and $1,000 for all other individuals and families to $300 and $700 retrospectively, the Minister for Health and Ageing, Mr Abbott, was able to get support for the MedicarePlus reforms introduced in March 2004. Even prior to these reforms being legislated, there were grave concerns that the cost of the safety net provision would blow out. If only the minister had listened to the health experts. If he had taken the time to listen, he would not now be going back on his election promises. Instead of listening, Minister Abbott gave his now famous ârock solid, ironcladâ guarantee for safety net threshold amounts.</para>
<para>Why did the minister and this government fail to listen to advice given by health experts regarding the risks associated with the safety net? It was clear to these health experts that the proposed package contained serious design flaws which would be inflationary and would lead to the blow-out of costs for the safety net component of the package. Only one conclusion can be drawn from the governmentâs inability to listen to the experts: the government has no real commitment to providing a long-term solution to a real issue.</para>
<para>The real issue that Australians are constantly being faced with is the escalating out-of-pocket expenses associated with seeing a specialist or with the use of diagnostic technology. The Howard government invented the safety net as an advertising stunt to win votes. The coalition government was well aware of the concerns many Australians had with Australiaâs health system prior to the election. As previously pointed out, coalition governments do not have a good track record in providing Australians with affordable and adequate health services; on the contrary, coalition governments have a proven track record in dismantling and dissolving public health services.</para>
<para>While some might say that this is history, the Howard government has done nothing concrete to prove any commitment to providing all Australians with long-term, sustainable and affordable health services. The Medicare safety net provided only a short-term solution to a long-term problem. This was evident during the election campaign, but Minister Abbott and Prime Minister Howard chose to ignore what they were being told. Even their own Treasury tried to warn the government that the cost of the Medicare safety net would be more than double their original forecasts for the 2004-05 financial year. This forecast was made in the pre-election fiscal and economic outlook of September 2004 published by the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Finance and Administration. So a month before the federal election the government had formally been advised by its Treasury that the total cost of the safety net would blow out greatly. Forecasts were given that the blow-out would be more than double the original projections, but did Minister Abbott listen? Apparently not.</para>
<para>This is why Australians are now faced with the real possibility of an increase in the safety net thresholds. It is completely unacceptable. This election promise was instrumental to the coalition parties winning government. Without this policy, which we can now assume was a scam, the Howard governmentâs success may not have been achieved. Why did the minister choose to ignore the Treasuryâs advice? Was it because if he had changed his proposed policy the attractiveness of it would have been lost? Was it because the governmentâs credibility would have been questioned? Yes, of course the attractiveness of this proposal would have been lost and, yes, of course the governmentâs credibility would have been destroyed. So Minister Abbott chose to ignore the flaws in his policy and mislead electors. He led the Australian public to believe that the Medicare safety net proposal was a bona fide election promise and that if the coalition government was re-elected it would enact that policy.</para>
<para>The only problem was that electors believed from the coalitionâs advertising that the safety net thresholds would be in place for a considerable time. With the safety net proposal being a part of the coalitionâs MedicarePlus policy, the Howard-Abbott team invaded electorsâ emotions, suggesting that if re-elected they would provide a better health system for all Australians. As all Australians would remember, the coalition government embarked on a massive advertising campaign to tell us how much better off we would be if the coalition won government. The advertising campaign to promote MedicarePlus was forced into every household and householders received the MedicarePlus booklet in their mailboxes. It was nearly impossible for families and individuals to avoid the onslaught of television, radio and newspaper advertising used as part of the federal governmentâs propaganda campaign to win votes at the upcoming election.</para>
<para>The government advertising that was intended to persuade and convince Australians to vote for the coalition worked. Many Australians voted for the coalition believing that all aspects of MedicarePlus were fully costed and affordable. Little did voters know that the federal government was receiving advice from Treasury that the policy was flawed. I suppose if the federal government had given the Australian electors this relevant information it may have ruined its chances of being re-elected. Would that have been the price of informing the general public of the true facts? Surely Australian voters had the right to all the information, not just the propaganda being distributed by the federal government.</para>
<para>Less than six months following the election of the coalition, Minister Abbott introduced the Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005. There is no surprise that, in this bill, he suggests an increase in the safety net thresholds. And it is not a surprise that the suggested increases are the same as the government tried to get through the Senate previously. They were unsuccessful then but, with a majority in the Senate, they are certain to get the increases through now. From 1 January 2006 the Medicare safety net thresholds will increase from $300 to $500 for concession card holders and low-income families and from $700 to $1,000 for all remaining Australians. Minister Abbott is now acknowledging his estimates need to be revised. However, this is a bit late. He knew when his government initially proposed the safety net idea that it was not feasible to reduce the threshold, but he did so just to get it through the Senate. In the ministerâs second reading speech on the Health Insurance Amendment (Medical Safety-nets) Bill 2005, he told us that an overriding concern for the government was the long-term sustainability of the safety net, yet he failed to inform the general public of these concerns. Through the federal governmentâs advertising campaign the minister pushed the lower amounts as bait. Minister Abbott knew prior to the federal election that he could not sustain the $300 and $700 thresholds, yet he led the Australian public to believe he could.</para>
<para>Now the minister wants the Australian public to believe that the government had not foreseen the blow-out in the costs of this initiative. I challenge Minister Abbott on this matter. He and his government were fully aware, when introducing this proposal in 2003, of the full costs associated with the introduction of the safety net. He knew this because he was aware that, to be economically responsible, the safety net thresholds would have to be $500 for concession card holders and low-income earners and $1,000 for all other Australians. The minister received relevant advice from Treasury during the federal election campaign that the costs of the Medicare safety net would be more than double the forecast for the 2004-05 financial year. But during the election campaign he gave his famous rock-solid, ironclad guarantee. There was nothing rock-solid or ironclad about his guarantee at all. This guarantee has now become a patina of respectability covering a vacuum of inconsequentiality.</para>
<para>Minister Abbott also stated during his second reading speech on the bill that more people than expected qualified for the safety net benefits and that the out-of-pocket medical expenses turned out to be considerably higher. Surely the minister had access to figures which outlined those eligible for assistance under the safety net provision. The federal government would have available to them the current statistics and forecasts.</para>
<para>The Australian people deserve better than this from their federal government. Minister Abbott should come clean and tell the Australian people the true facts regarding the Medicare safety net. The Australian people should have been told that from the beginning the federal government was aware that the safety net thresholds, which the Senate accepted, were too low. The federal government was aware that there would be a blow-out in estimated costs. The federal government was fully aware that it would have to increase the Medicare safety net thresholds to ensure that the blow-out would not continue. If the federal government was fully aware of all these facts, why wasnât the Australian public?</para>
<para>Also in his second reading of the bill, the minister would like to blame some specialties for shifting charges onto Medicare out-of-hospital items so that their patients could claim the safety net entitlements. He is quick to blame others for the faults of his governmentâs legislation. Why was the governmentâs legislation able to be penetrated by specialties? Surely the government should have been able to ensure there were no loopholes in their legislation to enable this. The minister should be strong enough to take full responsibility for the failures of his governmentâs Medicare safety net legislation and not try to blame others for the blow-out. The failure of the Medicare safety net legislation rests plainly on the shoulders of the federal government and the minister in particular.</para>
<para>What will happen as a result of the federal governmentâs decision to increase the safety net thresholds? One million Australians will miss out on higher Medicare benefits. That is one million Australians who will be disadvantaged through the federal governmentâs mishandling of the safety net facts. According to an article printed in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper:</para>
<quote>
<para>Health Department officials revealed in Senate estimates hearings ... that under the old scheme, 2.5 million patients would have reached the safety net next year.</para>
<para>But after the Government broke a key election promise by raising the thresholds at which the safety net kicks in, the estimate has plummeted to 1.5 million.</para>
<para>This means there will be two-and-a-half times as many losers as the Government suggested when it announced the cuts in April.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">These losers, the one million Australians who will miss out on assistance from the safety net policy changes, will be those who live in rural Australia, those who live in regional towns, people who live in outer metropolitan areas and people who live in the inner city areas associated with low incomes. Constituents in my electorate, Charlton, will miss out. Many in my community can ill-afford to be disadvantaged by the proposed changes in these thresholds. Although I am appalled that the federal government is even contemplating the increase in the safety net threshold, I am even more appalled that the Medicare safety net is skewed towards the upper income end of Australian society. Through the ABS survey of household expenditure, it was revealed that the higher a personâs income the more likely they are to have a high expenditure on health. This means that there are people with discretionary income, who can sustain high out-of-pocket costs, who will have the treatment and, therefore, are more likely to add up the out-of-pocket costs, which will enable them to access the safety net.</para>
<para>While the minister and the government would like to lead Australians to the conclusion that the most in need benefit from the safety net, this is not the case. As proven with past and present coalition governments, there is no desire to provide all Australians with adequate health services. When will a coalition government provide adequate health services to all Australians regardless of income? Never.</para>
<para>I take this opportunity to challenge the government and Minister Abbott, who is responsible for health, to address the health issues facing Australia. It is the governmentâs job to improve health services in Australia. It is not their job to move the goalposts to disadvantage those on low incomes. While Labor did not support the safety net policy, we do expect Minister Abbott to keep his word. The government spent an enormous amount of taxpayersâ money spreading their propaganda regarding the safety net and the amounts that would be applied. The government gave a pledge to the Australian people. It should now keep that pledge.</para>
<para>Â âChanges take the knife to Medicare safety-net benefitsâ and âBudget measures mean that out-of-hospital and drug costs will riseâ were the headlines in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> of 14 May 2005, following the last federal budget. The article said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">For 29-year-old Andrea Holden, cuts to major health entitlements in this weekâs federal budget mean her recent knee operation just got a lot more expensive.</para>
<para>Health benefits were about the only thing to be cut in a generous first budget for the Howard governmentâs fourth term.</para>
<para>And the government made sure the bad news about restrictions to the Medicare safety netâunder which the government pays 80 per cent of a patientâs out-of-hospital costs once theyâve spent a certain amountâwasnât around to muddy the news of the tax cuts, announcing it a few weeks before the budget.</para>
<para>And while the government is offering a tax-cut calculator for the punters to work out how the largesse applies to them, there is no similar health-cut calculator. Thatâs because if you get sick, like Andrea, the government suddenly looks a whole lot less generous.</para>
<para>According to Catholic Health Australia chief executive Francis Sullivan, the government, like a reverse Robin Hood, is taking from the sick to give tax cuts to the healthy and wealthy.</para>
<para class="block">â¦Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â¦Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â¦</para>

<para class="block">says Australia is moving to a situation where âwe say âwell, itâs just bad luck if youâre sick, you just have to pay moreâ.â</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">What if you are not in a position to pay for health services? Do you just go without? Does the government really care? If the government really cared about Australians it would not have introduced the MedicarePlus policy, which included the Medicare safety net provision. It would have introduced policies such as the ones proposed by Labor. Laborâs policies would have provided equal health services for all Australians, not just the rich. Labor is prepared to assist people to avoid high out-of-pocket costs when they need specialist care or access to diagnostic technology by making that care and technology available out of the public hospital system. Laborâs hospitals package offered Australians specialist care and access to diagnostic technologies in public hospitals, without the obligation of paying a gap. This is what the Australian public want and deserve. Why canât the government deliver appropriate heath services to all Australians? Why canât it handle its finances so that all Australians can be entitled to better health services? Even the Treasurer, Peter Costello, has warned that Australians will have to get used to paying a bigger share of their health care costs to fireproof government spending. This just proves that the government has no intention of caring for all Australians, just the ones who can afford to look after themselves.</para>
<para>So the truth of the matter is that the Howard coalition government is no different from previous conservative governments. The government has no real desire to improve Medicare. Its only intentions are to dismantle it, as previous coalition governments have done. The Howard government misled the general public by its propaganda during the federal election campaign, and continues to do so by not admitting to what it has in store for Medicare and the millions of average Australians who rely on it for basic medical needs.</para>

<para>âThe purpose of the <inline ref="R2376">Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005</inline> is to increase the level at which patients can access the Medicare safety net. Right now the safety net can be accessed once a family or individual spends $716.10 in a calendar year, or $306.90 for a family or individual holding a Commonwealth concession card or who is eligible for family tax benefit A. The safety net reimburses 80 per cent of all out-of-pocket expenses met by a patient once the threshold has been reached.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The bill is notorious now because it breaks the rock solid, ironclad guarantee that the Minister for Health and Ageing gave the electorate in the last election campaign period. That guarantee was that the threshold for the safety net would not be increased. When the safety net was first introduced in November 2003 the governmentâs proposal was for thresholds of $500 and $1,000. The initial cost of this measure was estimated to be $266.3 million for the four years 2003-04 to 2006-07. In order to get this legislation through the Senate the government negotiated with individual senators, and the thresholds were eventually reduced to $300 and $500. The revised cost of this was set at $440 million. This was in March 2004.</para>
<para>This legislation before us now is to restore the thresholds to the original proposals of $500 and $300, effective from 1 January 2006. There are a number of issues worth thinking about in relation to the bill, and these are the initial reason for the safety net, the sense or otherwise of the principle of the safety net as a public policy, the consequences of the safety net to date, the ability of the safety net to assist those struggling to meet medical costs and the behaviour of the government and the minister in managing this policy.</para>
<para>So why was the safety net introduced in the first place? The original legislation has to be seen in the perspective of the time it was introduced. We are talking about 2003, with an election looming within 12 months. One of the consistent themes of a restless electorate was access to affordable health care. Medicare was seen as being not as useful as it once was in delivering affordable health care, because bulk-billing rates were decreasing rapidlyâthat is, the number of doctors prepared to offer bulk-billing to their patients.</para>
<para>From the time that Medicare was introduced in 1983, bulk-billing grew steadily. It reached around 80 per cent in 1996. From there, it turned south, and by 2003-04 the rate had dropped to an average of 68 per cent across Australia. In Isaacs bulk-billing was 83 per cent in 1996, and this had dropped to around 70 per cent by 2003-04. I want to make it clear that I do not altogether blame the doctors for moving away from bulk-billing. A doctorâs practice has many expenses and needs to operate on a sound financial footing. After all, doctors and their staff are entitled to make a reasonable living, as is everybody else. The rebates being paid under Medicare had not moved for a long time, and many doctors discovered that they were falling behind financially. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the bigger practices were doing better than the smaller ones or the one-person practices.</para>
<para>At the same time that bulk-billing was declining, the gap that patients were asked to pay when they visited their non bulk-billing doctor was growing. Many doctors were asking patients to pay their fees up front, and this was putting enormous stress on many people. We know that mothers with a couple of sick kids would take one child to the doctor, thus incurring only one doctorâs bill, get a prescription for that one child, have it filled and then share the medicine around the rest of the family. In that way they were doing nobody any good at all.</para>
<para>I recently spoke to a cancer patient who approached me while I was doing a mobile office. She told me that she had her condition under control but needed to see her specialist from time to time when the pain got bad. She said that things changed for her when the specialist stopped bulk-billing and introduced an up-front fee. Now, if the pain arrives in a week when dollars are short, my constituent does not get her pain reliefâshe cannot afford to. She was getting her health care on the basis of her financial situation and not on the basis of her health needs. This is the sort of thing that was being heard right across Australia, and the government recognised that it at least had to be seen to be doing something. It would have been better, though, if it had actually done something.</para>
<para>So the government introduced the safety net. The government hoped that, if a patient or family could see that their doctorâs bills would not grow beyond a certain level, they would be reassured and stop agitating for the issues facing Medicare to be addressed properly. How does the safety net stand the test of sensible public policy? It does not. This point was made at the time by the opposition and by many in the health sector. The argument was, and is, that this measure simply writes a blank cheque on health costs whilst not assisting many of those who are finding it hard to afford decent health care. The financial constraint on Medicare is the regulation of how much a doctor is paidâthat is, the rebate amount. Whilst there is criticism of the current level of the rebate, that does not take away its function as a regulating device. The safety net has no such regulation; it is unregulated and uncappedâin other words, a blank cheque. The scheme pays 80 per cent of an unregulated fee for an indefinite time.</para>
<para>There is nothing stopping unscrupulous doctors from noting that a patient is on the safety net and hiking up fees. We have had anecdotal evidence of some doctors rearranging the fee structure for managing pregnancy so that most of the fee now applies to care outside the hospital, which qualifies it for safety net purposes. The scheme was always going to be hard to control, and that is exactly what has happened. It is intriguing that a government which prides itself on good economic management could introduce a runaway train such as this scheme. What happened once the scheme got under way? Surprise, surpriseâthe costs went through the roof. The schemeâs original estimated cost, with the new thresholds, was $440 million for the three years from 2005-06 to 2007-08. This was the estimate in March 2004, as it was introduced. Twelve months later, in April 2005, the estimate had moved to $1.4 billion for the same periodâover three times the original amount. The estimate for the four years to 2008-09 was $1.6 billion. Clearly, the runaway train was gathering speed at an alarming rate.</para>
<para>This blow-out was entirely predictable. But, despite all the money flowing around the system, the scheme is still not helping those who are struggling to meet their doctors bills. If the young mother or the constituent with cancer about whom I spoke earlier have to look in their purses before ringing the doctor, this scheme does not help. It will help once they reach the threshold but, until that point, they are still in trouble. If the cash is not there now, no amount of promises of future relief will help. A person on a tight budget is still left looking in their purse first and ringing the doctor second.</para>
<para>This type of assistance is starting to become a pattern. Just recently, we saw a bill to introduce tax rebates for child care. That arrangement will give relief to a family long after they have paid the child-care bills, but it does not do a single thing to help a family who cannot afford child care today. The safety net scheme is the same. It is fine in the long term but does not do a thing to help those who are facing immediate financial difficulties. I do not know whether the government genuinely cannot see this point or just does not care. A family on a tight budget is like a business on a tight budget: cash flow is a real issue every day. I challenge the minister to show me how the safety net can help those whom I have spoken about.</para>
<para>It is worth noting some interesting stats which show very clearly that this scheme is not helping those in real financial need. An analysis of how much has been spent on the safety net, and where it has been spent, shows that the electorate with the highest average income, Bradfield in New South Wales, had received the highest amount of safety net rebate as at September 2004. Bradfield has an average income of $1,759 per household and received $911,000 in rebates. Isaacs, with an average income of only half that amount, or $959 per household, received just over $226,000âa quarter of the amount the residents of Bradfield received. The analysis shows a marked correlation between income and the amount of rebate received. This means that those with a higher disposable income are taking advantage of the safety netâand why wouldnât theyâwhilst those with much lower incomes are not able to do so. Of the 150 electorates in Australia, 20 received more than $400,000. Only two of those electorates had an average income of under $1,000 per weekâthe rest of them have an average income of over $1,200 per week. Twenty-two electorates received less than $100,000. Four of these electorates have an average income of over $1,000 per weekâthe rest of them are well below that figure.</para>
<para>Finally, I want to talk about how the government and the Minister for Health and Ageing have managed the cost blow-out in this scheme. In a real sense, the entirely predictable cost blow-out has not been managed at allâas I said earlier, it is a blank cheque. The changes proposed by this bill simply raise the bar a bit, before patients can access the safety net. Those who spend more will eventually benefitâprovided that they can afford to seek the medical treatment they need in the first place.</para>
<para>The question I really want to address, though, is the political managementâor mismanagementâof this issue. It was entirely predictable that the cost of this scheme would blow out. If the minister was not able to work this out for himself, plenty of people around him were telling him so, including many on this side of the House. Information which came out in Senate estimates showed that the minister would have been briefed by the department as early as July 2004 on the fact that there were serious financial problems with the safety net. The minister did not take any action. Throughout the 2004 election campaign, the minister stuck to his story that the safety net would not be altered. He gave the now infamous rock solid, ironclad guarantee that it would stay as it was.</para>
<para>As with so many other matters the government deals with, it is difficult to work out whether the minister did not understand the implications of the legislation he was developing or he understood precisely what he was doing and went ahead with it anyway to try to avoid the flak on the growing problem of medical costs in the electorate, in an election year. From a political point of view, there are two aspects of the management of this problem: firstly, the delayed admission that a problem existed and, secondly, the denial that the system would be altered.</para>
<para>The safety net scheme came into effect in March 2004. Very quickly it became clear that it was going to be a problem. Within the first three months of operation of the safety net, 500,000 individuals and families had registered for it. Actual expenditure on the safety net rebates exceeded the estimated expenditure by 40 per cent. This reached 60 per cent by July 2004 and 70 per cent by August 2004. By then, of course, an election was looming, and it was called at the end of August. During the election campaign period, the Charter of Budget Honesty process threw up costings which showed that the safety net was then costing almost double original estimates.</para>
<para>Let me give you just one example of the Treasurer and the Minister for Health and Ageing each guaranteeing that the safety net would remain as it was before the election, despite the cost blow-out. We have the famous words that the health minister used on 6 September 2004 in response to repeated questions from a journalist about the safety net. The journalist asked:</para>
<quote>

<para class="block">Earlier, on 2 September, the Treasurer, at a doorstop interview, said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The parameters of the Medicare safety net will not change.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Very clearly, the government was telling us that the Medicare safety net would not change. During that election campaign, the Prime Minister was always ready to scoff at Laborâs health policies. At the same time, he sang the praises of the safety net and reinforced his commitment not to cut it.</para>
<para>In a press conference in Sydney on 8 October, the Prime Minister made it clear that he was aware of some doctors exploiting the scheme and said that he would deal with that problem. He acknowledged, in a backhanded way, the problems of the uncontrolled nature of the safety net. He tried to defend this by saying that there was no cap on the availability of Medicare services either. But he missed the point: there is a cap on the rebate available for a service under Medicare because the rebate is linked to an approved fee for each service. This is not the case for the rebate available under the safety net arrangements; it is essentially a blank cheque.</para>
<para>In summary, the safety net scheme does not help people get affordable health care when they need it. It is a cruel deal for those who believed the government in the election campaign period when they talked about the rock solid, ironclad guarantee. The government were dishonest about the scheme during 2004 and leading up to the election campaign. This is not good policy. It is a blank cheque. And it does not address the problem of providing affordable health care for all Australians.</para>

<para>âThe <inline ref="R2376">Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005</inline> is another broken promise of the Howard government. After nine long years of the Howard government being in power, we are debating in this House yet another of their broken promises. Members and the community will know that the bill that we are debating here today, relating to the Prime Ministerâs much vaunted Medicare safety net, is but one broken promise that the Prime Minister has made.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I will recast for the House some of the other broken promises of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister said that he would never, ever introduce a GST. And he did. He betrayed the trust that was given to him by the Australian people when he went back on that commitment. If we look at what the Prime Ministerâs policies said on Iraq and his justification for Australia and Australian troops being committed to war, we find that there never were any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Yet that was what the Prime Minister gave to the Australian people as a reasoned basis for our involvement.</para>
<para>Today in this House we have been debating Telstra bills and the sale of one of Australiaâs great economic assets. Those bills went through this parliament barely an hour ago. I can recall the Prime Minister telling the Australian people that he would never, ever privatise Telstra; but when he did, with T1 and T2, he still gave a commitment to the Australian peopleâa commitment that he broke. And here we have in the Medicare safety net legislation before us today another example of the deceit of this government. This government does not believe in cutting health spending. That is what Minister Abbott said on 16 September 2004. So I say to the House: why are we here debating this Medicare safety net legislation? On 16 September 2004 Mr Abbott said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I absolutely guarantee that the safety net as the government has put it into operation will continue. I absolutely guarantee that.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">If anybody in the Australian community was listening then to the words of the Minister for Health and Ageing, they would be pretty frightened and disappointed with this piece of legislation. You cannot get anything stronger than an absolute guarantee. But, as we know, the absolute guarantees of the Prime Minister are worth nothing, and now we know that the absolute guarantees of the minister for health are worth nothing. You cannot get a commitment any clearer than:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I absolutely guarantee that the safety net as the government has put it into operation will continue. I absolutely guarantee that.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Any young Australian listening to this Liberal minister for health, any young Australian listening to that rock solid commitment from a politician, would assume that the politician meant it. Well, welcome to the Liberal nightmare, because when a Liberal Prime Minister makes a promise you can guarantee it is a non-core promise. And when a Liberal health minister makes an absolute guarantee you know it is a guarantee that is not worth the paper it is written on. That is why we have this legislation in the House todayâbecause the minister for health and the Prime Minister have betrayed low-income earners in this country yet again.</para>
<para>Why are we debating this bill? Is it because the minister cannot count or, worse, that the Treasurer cannot count? Perhaps that is why the Treasurer said nothing during the election campaign. Perhaps he said nothing to maximise the ability of the government to exploit the policy when it was popular and then cut it loose as soon as they were returned to the treasury bench. You cannot get anything more cynical and deceptive than a Liberal minister in this government. The minister for health gave an absolute guarantee that the Medicare safety net would stick. That would be the policy that would be implemented, and there would be no changes. He said, âI absolutely guarantee that.â</para>
<para>What example is this Liberal minister setting for the young people of Australia who look to the political system for some degree of truth and some degree of morality? Does the Prime Minister of this country, whose government lied to the Australian people on Iraqâwith the subsequent death of thousands of innocentsâand whose words mean nothing, have any conscience when it comes to these matters? When you give a guarantee to the Australian people, when you give a guarantee to young people in this country, when you give a guarantee to older Australians, when you give a guaranteeâan absolute guaranteeâthen there is a reasonable expectation that you would meet it. That ought to be the underlying morality of the Australian political system: some degree of truth from the Prime Minister and some degree of truth from the minister for health.</para>
<para>But why should we be surprised at this deceit? When has this government shown any compassion for the low-income earners in this community? Calling them âmateâ and saying, âWeâre in there defending the little Aussie battlerâ is an obscenity when you put a piece of legislation like this into this House. It does not pay the bills for the low-income earners when you put another burden on them. In my electorate of Corio, in Geelong, we have a lot of people who are on low incomes. They are not only the pensioners, or the disadvantaged, who must rely on the government for their incomes. They are the working poor. They are people who work and cannot actually afford to pay their bills. And those people have a reasonable expectation that when a minister of the Crown in a government makes a commitment then that commitment will stick.</para>
<para>This increase will affect low-income earners as their capacity for discretionary spending will be further diminished. Senate estimates revealed that one million people who previously qualified will now miss outâone million people who were told by the Prime Minister that this was a policy that would be implemented, and no sooner had the Prime Minister been elected than he ratted on the solemn commitment. But that is not the only promise that this Prime Minister has ratted on. He is the master of the non-core promise. I come from a rural background. My father was an honourable man. If I had ever said to him, âDad, Iâve just made you a non-core promise,â I hate to think what would have happened to me. Yet here is the Prime Minister of Australia and a government that are masters of deceit making commitments and then going back on them after an election and, in doing so, lowering standards in politics in this country.</para>
<para>I call on the minister to direct his department to reveal what proportion will be in the lower threshold and, therefore, on lower incomes and concession cards. Did not the minister state that his government does not believe in cutting health spending? Could the minister not see the gathering clouds on this blow-out or, having spent the first yearâs operation boasting at regular press briefings about the high level of registrations and successful claimants for the safety net, did he think he could somehow just avoid the inevitable? In June 2004 actual spending on the safety net was 40 per cent more than estimated. In July 2004 spending on the safety net was 60 per cent more than estimated in the budget. In June 2004 the department of finance was starting to look at the estimates, as there were indications that the program was growing more rapidly than estimated.</para>
<para>The <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> reported in 2004 that an internal HIC audit revealed evidence of changed billing practices amongst doctors to help patients reach the safety net faster. This same report showed that more than 3,000 patients in Victoria slipped into the safety net in only one month. The audit revealed a $1.4 million blow-out of the scheme in Victoria alone. In August 2004 the office of the Minister for Finance and Administration was contacted about the blow-out, and Minister Nick Minchin was subsequently briefed. This occurred prior to the caretaker period before the election. So we ask ourselves this question: âWhy didnât the minister react in a timely and responsible manner to this blow-out, as any competent minister would in these extreme circumstances?â No, it is just easier to wait until after the election and then lift the thresholds and go back on your promise.</para>
<para>I have heard the arguments about lags in timing of these reports but, even allowing for this, by mid-July 2004 any competent minister would have acted promptly, read the signs and done something. So if there was no conspiracy to deceiveâas the health minister maintainsâdoes this mean he personally had no conspiracy to deceive but rather was misguided in his blind faith that his senior cabinet colleagues would not betray him? Delusions and incompetence: that is double jeopardy for any minister.</para>
<para>Sadly, this program has contributed to increased levels of health inflation. Over the 12 months to the March quarter 2005, health costs rose by 5.7 per cent, compared to the CPI in all groups which grew at 2.4 per cent. Health CPI is the second fastest growing group in the CPI basket, and only education CPI has outgrown health CPI. The cost of hospital and medical services rose by 5.8 per cent. This increase is largely attributed to increases in fees for specialist services. This program has also contributed to higher specialist fees, making it harder for lower income Australians to access the specialist services they need in the first place. The governmentâs own Medicare data has shown that there is a high correlation between incomes and levels of Medicare safety net rebates claimed. In the last five years, household spending on health has increased by over 40 per cent. This means that in 1998-99 an average family spent around $14 a week on health care and medical expenses, but in 2003-04 this weekly average increased by 46 per cent.</para>
<para>There are very important principles at stake in the bill that we have before the House. Let me read into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the extent of the deceit of this federal minister on this issue. The transcript of an interview with Ms Ticky Fullerton on 6 September 2004 proceeds as follows:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">TICKY FULLERTON: Will the Government commit to keeping the Medicare-plus-safety-net as it is now in place after the election?</para>

<para class="block">A very clear and unequivocal question. The transcript continues:</para>

<para class="block">TICKY FULLERTON: Thatâs a cast-iron commitment?</para>
<para class="block">TONY ABBOTT: Cast-iron commitment. Absolutely.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It was absolutely a cast-iron commitment that Minister Abbott never intended to deliver, because they already knew, before the election, that the program was in a blow-out phase. The Howard government deceived the Australian people when the minister went on that particular program and made those statements. On 2 September 2004, Treasurer Costello said, âThe parameters of the Medicare safety net will not change.â</para>
<para>I notice that the member for Corangamite is in the House this afternoon. The member for Corangamite, some would say, is an honourable man.

<para>âWe had a cast-iron guarantee, and this legislation now goes back on that cast-iron guarantee. The young people of Australia have a reasonable expectation that their politicians will not lie to them. So do the mums and dads with their familiesâthey have a reasonable expectation that their government will not lie to them. The older Australians in this community and in the seat of Corio also have a reasonable expectation that they will not be lied to. Yet here in this piece of legislation we have the most cynical manipulation you will see in politics, from the Prime Minister down to the minister for health. This legislation will give effect to a broken promise. A solemn promise is broken in this legislation, and those who will pay will be the most disadvantaged in the community.</para>

<para>âThe reason we are debating the <inline ref="R2376">Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005</inline> is to facilitate the breaking of a promise on the part of the Howard government. The promise that was madeâan ironclad promiseâwas that the Medicare safety net that was put in place before the election would be retained after the election. The government was asked about the Medicare safety netâs sustainability on a large number of occasions for one reason and for one reason only. That is that Labor was very concerned that this Medicare safety net that had been established in legislation by this government was not financially sustainable and, on the basis of questioning by the member for Lalor, the shadow health minister, the media took up the cause and asked on numerous occasions whether in fact this Medicare safety net would remain in place if the Howard government were re-elected.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Who made the statement, âTruth is absolute; truth is supreme; truth is never disposable in national political lifeâ? The answer is the current Prime Minister of Australia, who made that statement 10 years ago on 25 August 1995 on the ABC radioâs <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> program<inline font-style="italic">.</inline> You would believe that having been elected to the high office of Prime Minister of Australia this man would insist that not only his conduct but the conduct of all his ministers would meet that standardâthat standard being that truth is absolute, truth is supreme and truth is never disposable in national political life. Yet today, in this parliament, we are debating the breaking of an ironclad promise by this government.</para>
<para>On so many occasions the Minister for Health and Ageing, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister were asked about the sustainability of the safety net. The minister for health on 16 September last year, not long before the election, said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I absolutely guarantee that the safety net as the government has put it into operation will continue. I absolutely guarantee that.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">On 6 September, just 10 days before, the same minister was asked:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Will this Government commit to keeping the Medicare Plus Safety Net ... in place after the election?â</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The minister replied yes. He was asked:</para>
<motion>
<para class="block">Thatâs a cast-iron commitment?</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">And the minister said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Cast-iron commitment. Absolutely.</para>

<para class="block">He was asked again:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">80 per cent of out-of-pocket expenses rebatable over $300, over $700?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The minister said:</para>
<motion>
<para class="block">That is an absolutely rock solid, iron-clad commitment.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">I say to everyone listening to this debate in the parliament: how else do you interpret a ministerâs statement that he has just made an absolutely rock solid, ironclad commitment? There are not two ways of interpreting that statement. It is either a rock solid, ironclad commitment or it is not. And yet this government after the election has debased truth by arguing that no such commitment could be rock solid or ironclad because the Medicare safety net costs had blown out. This was a problem to which Labor had referred, which Labor had identified, and yet the government continued with the pretence, for one reason and for one reason onlyâthat is, to ensure its re-electionâthat the Medicare safety net was financially affordable.</para>
<para>It was not just the minister for health. The Treasurer on 2 September last year, again in the context of the federal election campaign, said, âThe parameters of the Medicare safety net will not change.â Yet at that very time the Minister for Finance and Administration of this government and of this country knew that the cost of the Medicare safety net was blowing out. The finance minister knew it was blowing out, the Treasurer knew it was blowing out and the health minister knew it was blowing out. Yet here they were making ironclad, rock solid guarantees that there would be no changeâand today we are debating a change in those arrangements to make them more affordable. It was not just the health minister and the Treasurerâthe Prime Minister got in on the act. On 12 May last year on the Neil Mitchell program on 3AW he said, âBut it is funded in the budget.â He was referring to the Medicare safety net. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Now, that new safety net is funded in the budget, although it was announced several months ago but it is funded in the budget.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So here is the Prime Minister saying that the Medicare safety net will stay, that it is fully funded in the budget, that it is sustainable. On 7 September, right in the middle of the federal election campaign, he said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">In fact, we have a better Medicare system now than our opponents are offering because we have this new beaut safety net.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So here is the Prime Minister saying we have got a âbeaut safety netâ. How beaut was it? It did not last past the election date because, as soon as that election passed, the ministers got together with the Prime Minister and said that they were going to have to tell the truth to the Australian people, a truth that they had evaded all the way through the election campaign, the truth being that the member for Lalor, the shadow health minister, was right that this Medicare safety net was not affordableâwhich is what we were saying all along.</para>
<para>The health minister is very fond of the word âabsolutelyâ. He talks about the Medicare safety net being an absolutely rock solid, ironclad commitment. It made me realise that he does use the word âabsolutelyâ a lot. I thought I had better find out where he has been using this word before. On the <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners</inline> program in 1998, the minister was asked about financial backing for Terry Sharples to help undermine Pauline Hanson. The reporter said, âSo there was never any question of any party funds or other funds from any other source?â The minister: âAbsolutely not, absolutely not.â âBeing offered to Terry Sharples?â The minister: âAbsolutely not.â So we know whenever this minister uses the words âabsolutelyâ or âabsolute rock solid guaranteeâ he means exactly the opposite, because he was not telling the truth on the <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners</inline> program in 1998 and he was not telling the truth in the lead-up to the last election when he said this was an absolute commitment. And we wonder why. Because the standard of truth is set by the Prime Minister, who said, âTruth is absolute; truth is supreme; truth is never disposable in national political life.â And here we areâthe truth overboard yet again. There is the Treasurer: he was in on the act too. He was in on the act before the last election saying: âAbsolutely. This will remain an ironclad promise. We will deliver in full after the next election.â But they all knew the truth. They just did not want the Australian people to know the truth, and that is that the cost of the Medicare safety net had blown out.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. The member represents the largest electorate in Australia, which covers a great expanse of Western Australia. He has been a very keen supporter of this package to ensure that there is an opportunity to invest significantly in telecommunications infrastructure well into the future and to give certainty to all Australians and particularly to regional Australians.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Connect Australia telecommunications package will give Australians access to first-class telecommunications services, with a $1.1 billion roll-out of broadband and mobile phone services. It will also deliver a $2 billion perpetual Communications Fund, which will deliver on a yearly basis an earning stream to invest in future telecommunications needs across regional Australia. It delivers a more robust regulatory framework and it enhances competition. It also strengthens safeguards to protect consumers.</para>
<para>The package has received support not only in the Senate and the House of Representatives but also across Australia from a number of interested groups throughout the community. I give some examples: the Australian Telecommunications Users Group, ATUG, told the Senate hearing last Friday that it supports this package. Yesterday the National Farmers Federation threw their weight behind the package. They said it should be supported; it should go through. They want to see this investment in telecommunications in regional Australia. Most importantly, today, in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline>, Dick Estens has thrown his support behind the package. Dick Estens is the man who conducted the most comprehensive review of regional and rural telecommunications in Australia. He said he supports the Connect Australia package.</para>

<para>âThe answer to the second part of the question is no. How do I feel? I feel very good because this is the biggest investment in telecommunications in regional Australia. On the day that the Labor Partyâs former leader has opened the book on the Australian Labor Party, on every single member that sits on the front bench and on the Leader of the Opposition, I say to the Labor Party and to all those who voted against this package that they have voted against the opportunity to invest $3.1 billion in regional telecommunications. They have voted against the opportunity to ensure a better regulatory framework. They have voted against the opportunity to improve competition in telecommunications in regional Australia. The government very proudly supports what we have put forward. As I said in my earlier answer, this package delivers on the Estens inquiry and it delivers the largest investment in regional telecommunications in this countryâs history.</para>

<para>âI thank the honourable member for Moncrieff for his question. Today is a historic day here in the parliament because the ownership and the status of Telstra have been finally resolved, and resolved in a way which will put this carrier on a modern, competitive footing to deliver good services to the people of Australia over decades to come.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It was back in 1993 that the coalition, then in opposition, first proposed privatisation in relation to Telstra. Back in those days of course the Australian Labor Party was very gung-ho about privatisation, privatising Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank. This idea that the Labor Party has always opposed privatisationâyou would have to have a short memory to actually believe that for a moment. Our government have been up front and honest about our policies. We believe that telecommunications can be delivered by the private sector, as indeed it is in countries like the United States, the United Kingdom and New Zealandâin fact, in most of the modern developed economies of the world.</para>
<para>We have resolved the status of Telstra ownership whilst putting in place a competitive framework so that there is competition to drive prices lowerâa competitive framework which has been endorsed by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. We have also invested in a regional telecommunications fund. That will be a $2 billion fund, the earnings of which will be available to upgrade services in regional areas for decades to comeâan investment that would not have been made if Telstra had remained with majority government control.</para>

<para>âI spoke earlier of the Australian Labor Partyâs penchant for privatisation. There is one big difference between this government and Labor. When Labor privatised the banks and the airlines, it spent the total capital in full in the year of receipt and then still drove the budget into deficit. At the end of the year, there were no shares, there was a bigger budget deficit and there were greater borrowings. Labor totally dissipated the proceeds of the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas. Our government believe that the proceeds should be invested for future generations. We will do that through the Future Fund to give young Australians opportunities in the futureâa sound financial footing from a government that has set this country up to cope with the impacts of demographic change.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Hinkler for his question. I again recognise the invaluable contribution that the member for Hinkler has made with regard to telecommunications across Australia for the entirety of his time in this place. The member for Hinkler asked about consumer protection. The government have strengthened consumer protection in four key areas as part of the $3.1 billion Connect Australia package that was passed through the parliament this week. We are reaffirming the universal service obligationâlet us never, ever forget that it was our government that introduced, through legislation, the universal service obligation. We are strengthening the customer service guarantee, something else that our government introduced. We are improving the network reliability framework and requiring Telstra to submit a local presence plan.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The government has reaffirmed the universal service obligation in its commitment to providing basic phone services in rural and regional areas. The government has strengthened the CSG so that Telstra and all other phone companies must connect and repair phone services quickly or pay compensation. The government has increased the amount of compensation by 21 per cent with regard to this. On an issue that I know the member for Hinkler is very interested in, the government will ensure that phone companies cannot use the mass disruption clause to unreasonably claim exemptions from the customer service guarantee.</para>
<para>The government has also tightened the network reliability framework, which requires Telstra to monitor the number of faults in its lines and upgrade them if they have repeated faults. As part of that, Telstra will now be required to upgrade at least 480 cable runs of its copper network a year, as determined by the Australian Communications and Media Authority. The government will review the network reliability framework in 2007 and tighten it even further if necessary.</para>
<para>This package is about giving regional and rural Australia certainty and confidenceânot just today but into the futureâthat, regardless of who owns Telstra, there will be a visible and effective presence in rural and regional Australia and their services will be provided.</para>

</talker>
<para>âI thank the honourable member for his question. There will be significant challenges in the year ahead to manage the economy. For example, the rising petrol price will undoubtedly add to inflation. It will be felt in full in the September CPI. As the Reserve Bank has already said in its August statement on monetary policy, in the near term headline CPI inflation is likely to be above underlying inflation, reflecting the pass-through of the current strength in oil prices. But underlying inflation is expected to increase gradually. In other words, the petrol price will go into the CPI. It will move the CPI up, but what the bank will do and what the government will focus on is underlying inflation when you take that first-round effect out. We will, of course, look at second-round effects if it gets into the general economy.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In addition to that, the task ahead in relation to economic policy will also be to manage current global imbalances, particularly imbalances between savings in investment between China and the United States. The task ahead will be to reform the industrial relations system. The task ahead will be to bed down a competitive regime in relation to Telstra.</para>
<para>Are there any alternative views on managing the economy? The opposition did say that they planned this term to build their credibility in relation to the economy. Those of us who fought the last election will recall that during the last election the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Latham, fought the campaign on the basis that all he had to do to keep interest rates down was to sign a big pledge and that, once he had pledged to keep interest rates down, that was it. Members of the opposition might laugh at that proposition, but they put out leaflets all over Australia claiming that the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Mark Latham, would be able to keep interest rates down.</para>
<para>I have an election leaflet which was an open letter to the people of Western Australia. On the front of it is a letter which was signed by Kim C Beazley. The opposition would have you believe today that Mr Latham is erratic or untruthful or cannot be believed. That was not the story 12 months ago during the federal election.</para>

<para>âNow that the legislation has passed through the parliament, the next step is the development of an operational separation plan. The ACCC is obviously going to be extensively involved with the government in developing the operational separation arrangements. It already has been and will continue to be in the future. Certainly the ACCC has made it clear in the past that it has concerns about the structural arrangements in the telecommunications industry. Indeed we know that from Mr Graeme Samuelâs comments at the Senate inquiry held last Friday. But, at the same time, the ACCC has agreed that the governmentâs model is workable. It indicated at those committee hearings that it believes there are a number of matters relating to operational separation that have to be carefully addressed during the process of developing the operational separation plan. So the interests of regional and rural subscribers as well as the interests of all Australians will be served by this discussion and negotiation between the ACCC and the government in drawing up the operational separation plan. There is no mystery to this. It is as would be entirely expected. The views of Mr Samuel and his colleagues, of course, will weigh heavily with the government.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Greenway for her question and for her interest in ensuring that people in her electorate of Greenway can find jobs. Todayâs ABS figures show that long-term unemployment in Australia is at a 19-year low. This comes on top of the figures of last week which show that the unemployment rate in Australia, at five per cent, is at a 29-year low. That means that there are now 88,700 people in Australia who are long-term unemployedâthat is, who have been unemployed for 12 months or more. Compare this to the situation in 1993, when the Leader of the Opposition was the minister for employment and the long-term unemployed numbered 330,000âthat is, there is a difference of almost a quarter of a million long-term unemployed between the figures in 1993 and the figures released by the ABS today.</para>

<para class="block">There is a stark contrast between that attitude, which says, âWeâre not worried about the long-term unemployed,â and the attitude taken by our government to reduce the numbers by almost quarter of a million. The $3.6 billion of welfare to work measures we are taking include $360 million over four years to help the long-term unemployed into work. We think 88,000 is too manyâand 330,000, when the Labor Party was in government, was an absolute disgrace. Amongst this expenditure are measures for extra places in the personal support program, extra places for vocational rehabilitation, extra Wage Assist places and a $50 million employer demand strategy.</para>
<para>What this is all about is the government getting on with the job. It is about providing more jobs, higher wages and greater opportunities for Australians, including those who are unemployed for the long term.

<para>âI thank the member for Lindsay for her question. I note that, thanks to the reforms that this government has put in place, the GP bulk-billing rate in the electorate of Lindsay has gone up to 89.5 per cent. As the Prime Minister and all the state Labor premiers recently concluded, Australia already has an excellent health system.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The policies and reforms of this government are making a good system even better. We have boosted bulk-billing rates for children and country people to an all-time high; we have increased medical student numbers by 30 per cent; we have introduced a Medicare safety net that will help 1Â½ million people next year; and we are working with the states to ensure better coordination between different health programs and more seamless delivery of health services.</para>
<para>I have been asked about alternative policies. There are no serious alternative policies, because members opposite are now indulging in an orgy of political cannibalism. Back in December the shadow minister for health said of Mark Latham: âCan I say that my faith in him is undiminished.â In fact, the shadow minister for health and the former member for Werriwa seemed to have had the undying political devotion to each other of Lord and Lady Macbeth.</para>
<para>Perhaps health reform was discussed at a dinner the shadow minister for health attended last night. It is a new Labor dining society. Labor MPs have put all their eggs in the one basket case. Of course they are not interested in health reform because, according to the former leader, the current Leader of the Opposition is more interested in preparing a dirt file than he is in developing good policy. This is what the former leader says of the current leader: âPeople are still writing Beazley up as a decent loser, but he is one of the most indecent politicians I have come across.â When Labor MPs were last asked to choose between health reform and health inertiaâ</para>

<para>âThe answer to the first part of the question is that certainly a large quantity of ammonium nitrate is shipped into Australia. We have significant demands for this product with our burgeoning mining industry, and of course ammonium nitrate is also important in agriculture. So significant quantities of ammonium nitrate come to Australia. About 99 per cent of our trade is involved with foreign ships, so it is quite likely that a significant proportion of it comes in on foreign ships.</para>

<para>The Leader of the Opposition was in Gladstone a few weeks ago on that accident-prone trip and tried to make something of the fact that ammonium nitrate was being moved between Australian ports on ships that had a single-voyage permit. The reality is that the alternative to moving ammonium nitrate around Australia by ship is to move it by truck. Instead of this ammonium nitrate going from Sydney to Gladstone by ship, it could have gone by truck. It would have taken 500 semitrailers to make that journey. And which do you think is saferâ500 semitrailers going up the road or one ship?</para>
<para>The reality is that we have a safety regime in place. It is much safer to transport ammonium nitrate by ship than by road. I think the Australian public would want us to continue that kind of transport regime.</para>

<para>As the foreign minister has told this House before, Prime Minister Sharonâs disengagement initiative is a positive step by the Israeli government towards bringing about the goals of the road map for the Middle East, which the Australian government strongly supports. Likewise, the government welcomed Palestinian President Abbasâs commitment to stopping terrorism and incitement to further bloodshed in the context of that disengagement. On these matters, the government believed that it had bipartisan support for these views. Obviously the comments of the member for Fowler are quite contemptuous of these matters.</para>

Is the Acting Prime Minister aware that a foreign vessel, the <inline font-style="italic">Thor Hawk</inline>, was trading on the Australian coast last week, carrying dangerous cargoes, including ammonium nitrate. Isnât it the case that this vessel is in such poor condition that, while in Newcastle, its crane broke, dropping the volatile cargo into the shipâs hatch and putting lives at risk? Is the Acting Prime Minister aware that fuel mixed with ammonium nitrate is potentially lethal and that the shipâs engineer did not even know how to attach the fuel line when the vessel was refuelled in Gladstone? Given the complacent attitude of the transport minister displayed in his answer to the last question from the opposition, why should any Australian trust the Howard government to keep us safe from a terrorist act or accident involving ammonium nitrate?</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Hasluck for his question. I can inform him that today I was delighted to announce the appointment of the Hon. John Lloyd as the first Australian Building and Construction Commissioner. Mr Lloyd brings a long background of involvement in industrial relations at the state level as well as the Commonwealth level, most recently as a senior deputy president of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, to this role.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>What the establishment of the ABCC involves is the culmination of a four-year process commencing with the royal commission under Mr Justice Cole, which established a clear and undeniable case for a comprehensive clean-up of the building and construction industry. The Econtech report of a few years ago showed that the benefit of cleaning up the unlawful practices in the commercial building and construction industry could be worth up to $2.3 billion to the Australian economy, yet the ALP has opposed every single measure that the government has put forward in an endeavour to do this.</para>
<para>We have had some more examples today in the media. Yesterday the Western Australian Assistant Secretary of the CFMEU, Joe Macdonald, was convicted of assaulting two managers of a Perth building site after he attempted to gain unauthorised entryâanother example of this sort of behaviour.</para>
<para>Then we have seen another report where the full bench of the Federal Court ruled that the Victorian government, having resisted providing documents to the Building Industry Task Force for some 2Â½ yearsâat a cost of some tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars to Victorian taxpayersâmust hand over documents in relation to an investigation into allegations that it manipulated a government tender process to award contracts to a company that was favoured by the CFMEU. This is serious. This is an allegation of a deliberate manipulation of a government contract so that it did not go to a company that employed non-unionists in relation to this tender.</para>
<para>The point of this is that, if a state government can succumb to union pressure, what hope have the little subcontractors out on the building sites around Australia? It is another example of why the establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission is long overdue. When it comes into operation from the beginning of October this year it might finally bring about a change in the culture and the behaviour in the commercial building sector in Australia.</para>
<para>What this shows once again is that this side of the chamber, this side of politics in Australia, is about law abiding and productive building and construction sites in Australia and that the Labor Party, in fighting this tooth and nail, year after year, stands for the protection of the rackets and the rorts that go on in the building and construction sector.

I awoke this morning to a headline in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper entitled âStudents unable to write a sentenceâ. The story is that there has been a survey of 660 Australian Defence Force Academy students and it reports that intelligent students are graduating from high school and entering university with writing skills so poor that they are not able to structure a sentence. In fact, the ADFA Associate Dean of Education, Stephen Yeomans, is reported as saying:</para>

In this particular studyâwe are talking about students who achieved a tertiary entrance rank of 80 or moreâonly one in six of those students could achieve 70 per cent accuracy in basic grammar.

In the Saturday <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline>, the front-page story was âVCE English âdumbed downâ: one book a year could be enough under âEnglish liteâââstudents would have to read only one single book in year 12.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I would also point out to the Houseâand I am happy to table theseâthat I have three examples of minimum passing results by students in the year 12 Higher School Certificate in New South Wales. One student, for a 40-minute essay question, was able to write only 63 words. That essay included spelling mistakes and 21 of the words repeated the question. That student passed year 12 advanced English in New South Wales and presumably now is undertaking a university program.</para>
<para>The government is doing three things to address this. The first is that very shortly I will be receiving the report of the national inquiry into reading. I am informed by the chairman that 30 per cent of Australian children are leaving the education system essentially malfunctioning, as far as their basic literacy and ability to read is concerned. The second is that the member for Cowper, very ably supported by the member for Port Adelaide, is conducting an inquiry into the training of teachers in Australian universitiesâand there will be major reform. The third is that the government is driving an Australian certificate of education. We are determined through the Australian Council of Education to drive a nationally-consistent high-quality year 12 qualification.</para>
<para>I also inform the House that I will be commissioning some independent work to assess the academic rigour of English, chemistry, physics and mathematics at the year 12 level throughout Australia and I will be making it available to communities so that they can compare the standards in one state with another. The battle for international competitiveness is going to be fought and won or lost in Australiaâs schools. It is not just about the fulfilment of human potential in our children; it is about Australiaâs place in the world and the standards that we expect.</para>

<para>âBoth the Prime Minister and I are right. I say to the member for Sydney that, as I said the other day, the government believe there are considerable benefits in people being able to work where they are capable of working. We believe that far too many people have been locked out of the economic life of this country. For example, something like 700,000 children in Australia are growing up in jobless households. That is unacceptable, and that is why the government are putting in place some changes in the Welfare to Work measures.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In the past the welfare system has been based on the proposition that either people could work full time or they could not work at all. Today there are many people in Australia who work part time and we believe that, if a person is capable of part-time employment, then there should be some obligation to do that. If they do that and work for 15 hours as required at the normal award classification wages for adults, that effectively means that a sole parent on the minimum wage for 15 hours a week will have $484.24 a week to take home. This compares to a sole parent pension recipient who does not work who receives $58 a week less. This is effectively about saying that we are going to give those people an opportunity to be in the economic life of this country and that we are going to do something about stopping the intergenerational poverty which is caused by allowing the current situation to go on. If the honourable member and her colleagues on the other side of the table were interested in helping out people in that situation, they would get behind these measures.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Barker for his question and acknowledge his interest in aged care issues in his electorate. The Australian government is committed to ensuring that older Australians have peace of mind while living in aged care homes. Today I announced new measures to strengthen existing protections around accommodation bonds. There will be a new prudential scheme which will strengthen financial management of accommodation bonds, and there will be a guarantee scheme that will ensure that bond balances are repaid in full.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Under the prudential scheme approved providers will be required to comply with three prudential standards to enhance and improve the financial management of the bond holdings. Under the guarantee scheme, in the event that there is a default by a provider through bankruptcy or liquidation and there is default in repaying the bond, the government will step in and repay that bond to the resident or their families and then proceed to recover the debt and costs from the provider or, if necessary, to levy the aged care industry. The Australian government is committed to ensuring that older Australians have peace of mind while living in residential care. We are providing an assurance to all residents and their families that their bond balances are secure.</para>

<para>âYesterday the Chief Opposition Whip asked me a question about dress standards for the chamber galleries. As a matter of routine, staff in the Serjeant-at-Armsâ office respond to queries about what clothing is acceptable for visitors in the galleries by saying that it is not acceptable to display political slogans or anything else that could be seen to constitute a protest in the galleries. The Serjeant-at-Arms has advised me that no-one in that office has ever been asked whether it would be acceptable for a large group of visitors to wear into the galleries specialist work clothing with the clear purpose of drawing attention to the group. Were this question to be asked, the staff would respond by saying that such clothing would not be acceptable.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The rule against protest action in the galleries is longstanding and serves to maintain the dignity of the House and its proceedings. The rule is a statement of principle, for, as the honourable member would appreciateâand I think all members would appreciateâit would be impossible to have a list of every item of clothing and example of behaviour which would be inappropriate in the galleries. As all honourable members would know, the presumption is that persons attending in the galleries of the chamber do so to observe the proceedings of the House. It is not appropriate for any persons in the galleries to engage in behaviour which would be likely to draw attention to themselves or to disturb other observers in the galleries.</para>
<para>In the particular case raised by the Chief Opposition Whip, I understand that it was the intention of a group of firefighters visiting the galleries to wear their specialist protective clothing with large reflective panels on the chest and leg areas. I appreciate that all members of the group complied with the request to remove the outer specialist clothing before they entered the gallery. I believe it would be unacceptable behaviour for a large group of persons attending question time to wear into a gallery clothing which, by its very purpose, is intended to draw attention to the wearer. It would be very difficult to interpret this action as anything other than a protest or disturbance in the gallery of the chamber.</para>
<para>I, like all members, heartily welcome the attendance in the chamber galleries of visitors to this place, including firefighters, who are able to attend and observe parliamentary proceedings. Nevertheless, it would be inappropriate to permit any behaviour whose purpose is to divert attention away from the parliamentary proceedings.</para>

<para>âIn relation to the ruling that you have just given about distinctive and particular work clothing, and given the context in which it has been referred to, those uniforms that many people wear as distinctive and unique work clothing is designed specifically to draw attention to their uniqueness. That does not simply include individual military personnel who may come here from time to time either in their dress uniform or in their camouflage uniform; from time to time it also includes large numbers of military personnel who come here precisely in their uniform, as a group, to draw attention to their presence as a group. In the context of the statement you have just made, will you look at that situation and consider whether or not your statement requires some adjustment?</para>

<para>âThe member for Perth rose and referred to a ruling that I was not obliged to make, because there was no question raised this morning. The point about it is that in the written amendment the word does not attach to any individual, which is what the standing orders do not allow. Mr Speaker, the point that you just made is a valid one except that it goes further: the word must be attached, as no doubt the Clerk will advise, to an individual. In the case of the amendment, that did not happen. However, had the matter been raised with me, had anyone draw my attention to it this morning, I might have ruled otherwise.</para>

<para>âIn that speech the minister claimed that at a large rally in Western Australia last year I advocated that the price of petrol should be $2.50 and that that was ALP policy. As I told the House on a previous occasion when a similar allegation was made, firstly, I made no such recommendation but simply spoke at the launch of a policy document by the Sustainable Transport Action Coalition without endorsing its recommendations; secondly, it is not an ALP policy; and, thirdly, it was not a large rally but a small meeting.</para>

<para>âMr Speaker, this is a matter I wanted to raise on indulgence, because it is so serious. The Minister for Education, Science and Training has just tabled three pages that look to me to be papers written by individual students. The minister says that they are HSC papers, and looking at the papers I see that they are HSC papers from 2001. It is extremely serious that studentsâ HSC papers are being tabled in the federal parliament. I would ask you to investigate how the minister came to have access to these papers.</para>

<para>âMr Speaker, further to that matter, I would like you to examine the timing of this. When the Minister for Education, Science and Training got up and made his remarks here, he implied that the material was from an immediate examinationâa current state of affairsâyet it appears that the documents he tabled are from 2001. That is from four years ago, not immediately. This would be a clear case of misleading the parliament. Given that the date is there, it would have to be said to be deliberately misleading. In those circumstances, of course, it would be a serious matter indeed. So both from that point of view and from the point of view of the matters raised by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, this is a matter that needs to be pursued further.</para>

<para>âTrust in our parliamentary institutions is something that we all should value. There have been a number of occurrences in recent years which have meant people are starting to distrust their parliamentary institutions, and I think it is paramount that we all recognise that and try to do something about it. Whether it be in relation to issues like âchildren overboardâ, the Iraq war, the drought and the misrepresentations that occurred there, the free trade agreement, Telstra or climate change, the information that is transferred within this chamber and the other chamber is, from time to time, found later on not to be correct. That leads to a situation where the general populace do not trust the institution and do not trust the political process. Irrespective of who is in government, who is in opposition and who did what in the past, I think that is starting to erode the facilities of government itself. So I ask that we as members of parliament take this issue seriously and try and do something about it.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Just in recent weeks, and even today, the trust in the parliament was abused. The Deputy Prime Minister, for instance, said today: âThere has been, in terms of the Telstra sale, a $3.1 billion investment in telecommunications infrastructure.â That is not correct. What has happened is that there has been a $1.1 billion investment in broadband and mobile services and a fund of $2 billion set aside, from which the interest will be used to invest in telecommunications infrastructure. That is not $3.1 billion. That is misleading the public. When they find out the truth, the publicâs view will be that that they have been misled by the parliament.</para>
<para>There have been a number of issues in relation to Telstra, such as the term âup to scratchâ. A lot of people who vote assumed that in this case the National Party would abide by the terms on which it went to the last electionâthat it would not sell Telstra until it was âup to scratchâ, until all the recommendations of the Estens report were in place. That has not happened, and the National Party has voted for the full sale, the full privatisation, of Telstra. People are wondering why and how they can trust their parliamentarians when that sort of activity is occurring.</para>
<para>Another phrase, âdown the trackâ, came into the parliament in the last week, used by Senator Minchin. Things will be right âdown the trackâ. They are not up to scratch nowâwe have been shown by the new CEO and others that there has been a massive underinvestment et ceteraâbut apparently, out of this package of $3.1 billion, which is really only $1.1 billion and the interest from $2 billion, things will be right âdown the trackâ. When you look at that, though, you find that the interest from that $2 billion fund is $100 millionâand those are the words of Mark Vaile, the Deputy Prime Minister, not mine. One hundred million dollars is less than the $125 million that the government has been providing annually over the last eight yearsâa $25 million reduction in expenditure on telecommunications infrastructure. And here we had again today a lack of openness when the Deputy Prime Minister, the Acting Prime Minister, said $3.1 billion is being invested.</para>
<para>We have had the absurdity with the National Farmers Federation in the last few days. The farming community right across Australia, in all the surveys that have been done, have indicated that the service is not up to scratch, that they are opposed to the sale, that the Estens recommendations have not been fully implemented, that Sol Trujillo has said that there has been massive underinvestment and that particularly the underground infrastructure is in a messâdefinitely not up to scratch. We saw the absurdity the other day of the President of the National Farmers Federation, Peter Corish, coming into this place and suddenly reversing the decision, and the outrage that has been expressed by the farming community about that.</para>
<para>I questioned the President of the National Farmers Federation as to why that had happened. In a press release, the National Farmers Federation said that they had received a guarantee from the government that there would be pricing parity with telephone services and broadband. When questioned in the parliament yesterday, the Acting Prime Minister could not find where in the legislation that guarantee was delivered. In the Senate yesterday afternoon, Senator Conroy questioned the minister responsible, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, and she categorically said that there was no guarantee in terms of broadband services. That is in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. These are the sorts of things about which the community is being misled. There is no guarantee in the legislation; it was mentioned in a speech by the minister.</para>
<para>I remember, when the goods and services tax was introduced, the National Party once again standing up and suggesting that, based on the price, there would be a degree of inequity in the application of the goods and services tax between city people and country people.</para>

<para>âThere is, as the member for Hunter said. The government put in place the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme to compensate for the inequity. Where is it now? It has gone, but the inequity has not gone. The application of the goods and services tax has not gone, but the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme has gone. The same brand of the same parliament that instituted it, for good reasons, has decided, âThatâs long enough; it can go,â and that is exactly what will happen with Telstra: âThatâs long enough; it can go.â It will drift away.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I questioned the President of the National Farmers Federation as to why there was a reversal. Some of the state organisations were very angry about that decision. I made certain comments to the press that the President of the National Farmers Federationâit was no secretâwas contemplating a political career and considering seats in the north of New South Wales and southern Queensland. He has not denied that. However, a strange person has come out of left field; the member for Gwydir has entered this debate. The member for Gwydir, in an article by Michael Thomson, was reported as saying:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">There is no deal for Peter Corish. There can be no deal. No-one is in a position to offer such a deal. The most powerful man in the National Party could not have arranged such a thingâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">for him.</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Even if he were to run, heâs got to win preselection. It will be a very strong field, indeed. Five or six people have indicated they want to run; itâll will be a battle royal.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I did not mention the National Party to Michael Thomson when I talked about Peter Corish. I did not mention the seat of Gwydir. All I said was that it was no secret that this man was contemplating a political career in southern Queensland or northern New South Wales. That career may well be as an Independent in New England.</para>
<para>The former Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party seems to know quite a bit more about this man that he has defended. When it comes to openness and frankness, they are the sorts of things that the community has a right to know. To add insult to injury, the President of the National Farmers Federation, Peter Corish, appeared in a radio program yesterday afternoon on 2AY in Albury, and I happened to be on the same program talking about Telstra. This was after Senator Joyce had made his decision, not by way of voting but by publicly announcing it. About an hour after that, Mr Corish said that the National Farmers Federation did not support the full sale of Telstra. I thought, âThatâs a bit absurd; that is not what he was saying the other day.â He then went on to say that the NFF did support the bills before the House. I have had involvement with the National Farmers Federation over many years. I was one of those who organised busloads of people to come down to Canberra to rally against former Prime Minister Hawke.</para>

<para>âIt was easy, and a lot of people came to rally against the indecencies of government in those days and to rally for honesty in government. To see the National Farmers Federation dragged to this all-time low and then purport to represent the farming community of Australia is quite disturbing. I have had phone call after phone call from people who are involved in the associated organisations. I was on the general council of the New South Wales Farmers Association, and I was on the Grains Council of Australia. They have become puppets of government as well in respect of their attitude to ethanol. Some of these representative bodies have to make up their minds if they are to have any credibility in parliament, irrespective of who is in government. They have to start to represent the issues that their constituents believe in, and that is a broad reflection on the political process.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>We saw the farce in relation to free trade. The President of the National Farmers Association was involved in that well. There were concrete guarantees, when they left here, that sugar would be in, that there would be very strict rules in relation to open access to trade and that the beef industry would be entitled. A few words from Mark Vaile in the United States and that all fell apart.</para>
<para>There is a whole range of issues on which we need more openness. We saw the development of national competition policy, and how that was underwritten, over the years. The two major parts of national competition policy on water reform were about a market being developed, which has partially been done, and property rights being recognised. It is 10 years on and they still have not been recognised. We have had all this palaver about how great it is with the bilaterals, the intergovernmental agreements et cetera. The people have been misled. Those people who have been sitting out there waiting for their property rights to be recognised when an environmental change occurs have been misled once again.</para>
<para>There was Regional Partnershipsâno wonder people are cynical about the political process. I hope the committee that is currently looking at that program makes recommendations to the Auditor-General, because I think there is a number of instances there where it is far greater than the traditional pork-barrelling that we would all accept to a certain degreeâwe might not agree with it on the day but it is part of the political process. But it seems to me that there may well be some corrupt activity in relation to where some of these funds have ended up and whether they have even been found. That might need a further inquiry.</para>
<para>I have talked about the Fuel Sales Grants Scheme, ethanol, Iraq and other issues. In terms of the Telstra debate and political representation, I will be working to get people into this parliament who actually represent the people who they purport to represent. I will be part of it and I will be proud to be part of it. I encourage other members of parliament to stand up for the people they represent, irrespective of what side of parliament they are on or whether or not they are in a party. It is about time, particularly in relation to regional and country issues, that we started to stand up for those people. We have seen this classic example, an example greater than any other that I can remember, where country people have said to this parliament and all their parliamentarians by way of survey and carrier pigeon that they do not want Telstra sold. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI was expecting to hear something from the honourable member for New England, but what he said had nothing to do with the matter of public importance; it was more about getting the dirt off the honourable member for New Englandâs liver. Quite frankly, that is all that we heard.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>If we want to talk about honesty and integrity in government and having people look up to politicians, I dare say that we have to start here. Most of it is generated from this particular chamber and from statements made here that are not entirely true. It does not just include this side of the House or that side of the House; it includes Independent members as well. This motion today is not so much about honesty or openness in government; it is more about relevance deprivation syndrome. Quite frankly, that is what it is all about.</para>
<para>The honourable member for New England has been in parliament for a number of years: he was in the New South Wales parliament for a number of yearsâhe was there when I was thereâand he has been here for a number of years. Except for one term in New South Wales when he had the balance of power with the coalition government, he has achieved absolutely nothing in politics. He is bitter about that, and that is where most of these problems that he has at the present time come from. If people do not entirely accept the view of the member for New England, then of course there must be some ulterior motive, he thinks.</para>
<para>We just heard a spray on the National Farmers Federation. I will say something about this Telstra debate because I think it is relevant to the whole process. There is no doubt in my mind that, as far as the people of Australia are concerned, the sooner we get some competition in this field the better. There have been many articles in the papers over the last few days showing how far behind we are in Australia compared to countries that have competition. Yet the honourable member for New England, the honourable member for Kennedy, the honourable member for Calare and those over on the opposition side would prefer to see us live in the Dark Ages. They do not want to see some of this competition. They then say: âOh well, the government are not being honest. They are not being honest with the people.â As far as honesty is concerned, we are saying it exactly as it is.</para>
<para>The honourable member for New England goes on about the services of Telstra, that it is not âup to scratchâ, as he puts it. If any electorate in New South Wales has benefited from the billion dollars that has been spent by our government over the last few years, it has been the electorate of New England. We still have the funds available to continue that. The member for New England is never honest enough to say that to the Australian peopleâthat is the issue here today.</para>
<para>When the member for New England had the balance of power in New South Wales, I remember one big statement he made over an issue in his electorate where he was looking for something from the government. He said that Greiner came along with a brown paper bag in his hand. That is what he said in New South Wales. It is a little bit duplicitous on the one hand to accuse people when on the other hand he has said similar things himself.</para>
<para>Let us have a look at the openness of our government. I have heard those opposite and the Independents talk about the GST debate. I have also heard the cries of ânever, everâ from over there about the Prime Minister saying at a previous time that he did not want to have a goods and services tax. But one thing I will say is that we went to an election with that as a policy. If anyone has ever fought a hard election, I can tell you that that was a hard election because we were being open with the people about what was going to happen. The GST did not go to our government; it was for the benefit of Australia so that the state governments could get a growth tax to provide the services that they need in their states. It was nothing to do with us. We almost committed harakiri in the name of the country. If that is not honest, I do not know what honest is.</para>
<para>It is the same when it comes to the words that are thrown around this chamber about âchildren overboardâ. Have a look at the Senate inquiry. While at that particular time the Senate inquiry showed that the words may not have been used, children were thrown overboard only two or three days before. It was proven to be a policy of these people and what they were doing, yet in this parliament the Labor Party, in particular, try and distort the whole debate by just picking a few words out here and there instead of being absolutely honest about the whole debate.</para>
<para>As I said, this is not the real reason behind this matter of public importanceâthe real reason has nothing to do with the words on the paper; it is to try and get the dirt off the liver of the member for New England.</para>

<para>âWe will have a look at this fuel sales tax because it is something that the member for New England has been on about for a long time. It was not this governmentâs policy; it was to get the GST through the Senate by a deal done with the Democrats. If the member for New England were patient, he might see something in the future, but he is never patient to see what might happen. That deal had to be done because the Democrats had this complicated policy. I was not very happy about it at the time either, but if we wanted to get the legislation through there were a few things that we had to agree to. There were a few compromises that we had to make. We did not have the luxury of being an Independent, sitting back there being irrelevant and throwing your opinion around the place. When you are in government, you have to make some decisions and you sometimes have to make some compromises. But you make those decisions and those compromises in the interests of the country.</para>

<para>This whole debate about Telstra shows a lack of vision by the Independents, in particular, and the Labor Party. There is no vision to see where we are going in the future with telecommunications. In fact, I suppose they could almost be classed as troglodytes, because the fact is that, if you want to see where we are going in the future, you will find that it is moving at a rapid rate, because we have competition. Only yesterday I noticed an article in the newspaper backing up what I said in my speech on Telstra the other day. It said that we can now give broadband across an electricity line. It is being rolled out in Tasmania. There is a second networkâcompetitionâand yet we are hearing this rubbish from the Independents that somehow or other the world is going to collapse. I can assure you that we are going to get better services, not because we have had any vision from those opposite but because people were prepared to sit down, have a look at the options and work through this.</para>
<para>I also heard the member for New England mention climate change. I can only suspect that he was talking about the Kyoto protocol. I would be absolutely amazed and absolutely surprised if the member for New England were prepared to sell Australian jobs overseas.</para>

<para>âWe now have the idiot fringe over here talking about how ethanol will change that. Let me put it to you this way: if these fuels were competitive with oil at the present time, they would be in the marketplace. You hear all the ranting and the raving, but go and have a close look at the cost of these fuels. If they were competitive, they would be in the marketplace. I have heard the member for Kennedy before on ethanol and sugar. Let me say this to you, Mr Speaker: I will not be growing sugar for ethanol because you cannot make enough money out of it. That is just an absolutely nonsensical argument.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>With regard to the Kyoto protocol, obviously the member for New England is prepared to say, âWeâll cut back on all our emissions, destroy our opportunities to develop and destroy our jobs in this country so that we can let undeveloped countries take over all those jobs and all those opportunities.â I do not think that is fair. The governmentâs policy to reduce emissions overall and to give some encouragement for worldâs best technology in underdeveloped countries is the right one. Have we been dishonest about that? We have been quite open about it; we have told everyone exactly where we stand on that. So I think that that particular position is absolute nonsense.</para>
<para>We hear a lot about these issues but I have yet to hear one word that I could believeâand I did not hear it in this debateâthat showed where this government had not been completely honest with the Australian people. The issues here are the fudging of the edges. I suppose that is politics, but to make the claim that someone has been deliberately dishonest is a dishonest statement.</para>

<para>âIf you have a close look at these grants, you will see that they are right across the board and not just in government seats. If you want to talk about rural Australia, you must ask: who represents rural Australia? It is the government members who represent rural Australia, so, naturally, if there are going to be grants in seats in rural Australia, more government members will be involved than opposition members; they represent Sydney and Melbourne. Obviously that is going to happen. But then you make the claim that something is dishonest about this. Is it any wonder that people have concerns about it when the member for New England is out there throwing the mud around? Obviously people will start to believe some of this. I think it was Goebbels who once said, âTell them often enough and theyâll believe it,â and that is certainly the attitude that has been adopted. I would reject completely the allegations that have been made against the government in this debate, because, quite frankly, I have never served under a government that has been so open to the Australian people. We have gone to elections making it very clear where we stood.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The member for New England talked about Iraq. If you want to go back to where the Iraq situation all started, the United Nations believed, Mr Butler believed and the British and Americans believed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. We are all very wise in hindsight when we start to throw things around, but, at the time, the world believed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. He was offered the chance of having inspectors in there and he refused. But now we have these wonderful people who, in hindsight, say, âYou were wrong.â Hindsight is great, isnât it? But where were they leading? Where were they with their ideas? All they can do is sit back and snipe. That is their only ambition, and that is their only use in lifeâto sit back and snipe.</para>
<para>The member for New England has been doing it now for a number of years. His absolute obsession with some of these things has to be seen to be believed. Yes, he missed out on preselection for The Nationals. He stood as an Independent and won the seatâcongratulationsâbut, since then, he has been bitter. That is where the whole thing comes fromâthe whole attack and all the issues. If something is going to be put up by the government, especially by The Nationals, he will oppose it; he will do anything to undermine it. We have heard it today. He wants to stand members in seatsâthat is not new. He has been out there before, standing Independent members in seats, but they have not won. I think that one or two seats went to Independents in certain areas, but then they came back again. That issue has been out there for a long time.</para>
<para>I saw in the paper this morning that the member for New England was gloating and saying, âThis is the end of The Nationals.â Let me tell the member for New England: as people realise that the policies that have been put in place are going to benefit those in country areas and as people realise what not just The Nationals but Liberal backbenchers from the country areas fought for in Telstraâto see that services in those non-profitable areas were protectedâthey will understand. We will continue to roll out those services. They will also see the competition that is going to come into the marketplace. They will see that the prediction of doom and gloom by the member for New England and others was wrong. I have to say to you, Mr Speaker, that they will be grateful, because at the present time families in Australia are saving $750 a year because of the changes that have come into place in telecommunications, and they will save more in the future. Those in the isolated areas that are served by the member for Kennedy, for instance, now get subsidised satellite, and they have never had a better service. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI agree with the previous speaker, the member for Page, in saying that services from Telstra are goodâwell, I am not saying that they are good; I should say that they are acceptable. It has never been my position to condemn the services from Telstra. But if they are acceptable then why are you selling Telstra? If something is not broken, why do you want to fix it? Like me, the honourable member for Page has been a long-serving minister in a government. My policy was always: if it ainât broke, donât fix it, because we have enough broken things out there that do need fixing.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I admire the member for Page in many ways, as I have said in this House on many occasions, but I cannot resile from my duty to point out to the House the statement by the government that they are going to provide $3,000 million to meet the requirements of rural Australia. I can skite; it is open to me to get out there and skite, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, because, with all due respect, in sharp contrast to what you just said previouslyâthat we have achieved nothingâif we were not here, if I had been beaten at the last election or the election before last or if the honourable member for New England were not here, we would not have lobbied the senators, and Telstra would have been sold the last time the government wanted to sell it. It would have been sold and there would not have been the $3,000 million that you people are claiming. I will come back to the $3,000 million, because we are talking about truthfulness, openness and honesty here.</para>
<para>According to Telstra Country Wide, last year they put $231 million into new services. According to government papers, there was $280 million put into Networking the Nation and there was a further $163 million spent this year by Telstra Country Wide. If you add those up, you get a figure of $700 million. If Telstra had been sold, there would have been no $700 million thereâand it would have been sold if we had not lobbied the Independent and small party senators. Three of them had made statements which at best were equivocal and, at worst, certainly indicated that they were going to vote for the sale of Telstra. That was until we did the heavy lobbying. I do not want to or have time to go into the detail, but it would have been gone. If you people are standing here today skiting about securing the $3,000 million, you should remember that there would have been no $3,000 million. It would have been sold three years ago. So if there is anyone to be thanked for this, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, by your own arguments it is the three gentlemen, the three amigos, sitting in this part of the House.</para>
<para>Let me move on. Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, you said that we were ineffective. The honourable member for New England and I secured money before the last election campaign which would make maidens blush. If they had been National Party seats, they would have got considerably less. They would have got the same as all the other National Party seats. But, because Mr Anderson, the then Deputy Prime Minister, wanted to indulge his own personal hatreds and vitriol, largesse was poured into our electorates like we had never seen before. But if we had just held up our hands and voted with the governmentââGofer, send a rubber stamp and a photograph to this placeââthen there would have been none of the largesse pouring in before the last election. I most certainly thank the government for the $227 million they poured into Kennedy in discretionary funds on the eve of the last election.</para>
<para>I am not in a position to disclose what happened in the banana industry, but suffice to say that the imported bananas are not in Australia at the present moment. We still live in fear and terror that they are going to come in, but that was put off because of my actions, and I do not resile from saying that or apologise to anyone for saying it.</para>
<para>The beef quotas came out and they were enormously detrimental to the grinding beef market of Australia. They helped the plate beef market, but they were dreadful for us. Again, I cannot outline what actions I took, but suffice to say that the quota arrangements were changed.</para>
<para>Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, you are a very skilled person who knows a very great deal about the sugar industry, but you are not up to speed on this. With regard to the Brazilian ethanol program, the document I hold was produced by the Brazilian government and Unicaâwhich you would be familiar withâand is to be presented at a Queensland seminar on ethanol. Page 9 says that, regarding the cane sector in Brazil, âEthanol makes gasoline cheaper. There is no pure gasoline in the Brazilian market today.â There is E25 at US90c; and E100, which is pure ethanol, at US50c a litre. Working that back into Australian currency, the good people we have in the library tell me that it works out to 66c a litre. I am sorry, but the figure in Australia is 76c a litre. When you add 12c a litre, which the government is applying in tax on ethanolâit is the only government in the world to apply a tax on ethanolâit comes out to 78c a litre. Then if you apply the excise regime on petrol it comes out to 114c a litre. I am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, but I have to tell you that it is 78c a litre. That is what we should be able to buy it at. There is a transport and retail margin, but that goes on both fuels: petrol and ethanol. The comparable figures, before the retail and transport margin goes in, are 78c and 114c.</para>
<para>They are not my figures; they are the figures from Brazil that were presented in Cairns. There were members of the government present in Cairns, Townsville and also at the big international seminar that was held in Brisbane. I was quoting the ethanol production figures recently at 600 litres. In fact, in one of the papers that was presented, they were still on 600 litres. That was corrected by the Brazilians, as I was. The Brazilians said: âWe are now getting 700 to 800 litres out of ethanol.â But even without that, I am simply quoting the figures that the Brazilian government has produced.</para>
<para>If the three amigos are not here, then every time we deregulate something everyone in this place will be for it. Everyone in this place is a free marketeer. The government did not invent this; in fact, they were also-rans. There was hardly anything left to privatise by the time they came in; it was all done by the Labor government and the policies have not changed. But the only three people with different policies in this place are the three amigos. We do not believe in the policies of free markets. Labor have already established that they do; they were in government for 12, 13 or 15 yearsâwhatever it wasâand they privatised and deregulated everything that they could lay their hands on.</para>
<para>This government took over what was leftâderegulation of the dairy industry, for example. I do not accuse you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Your position was made very clear to everybody, and there were other people who agreed with you. But that was what the government did. I am ashamed to say that at that time I was part of the government. I made a decision to no longer be part of the problem. Maybe I am not part of the solution, but I am most certainly no longer part of the problem. For those that are in government, I am sorry to tell you that you are part of the problem.</para>
<para>I had a lot to do with fighting corruption in Queensland and the most serious ramifications that occurred in that state. I am very familiar with how these things work. The payouts that were made in the fishing industry bear very close scrutiny. I give warning that I am scrutinising those payouts. I am scrutinising where the money flowed and how it flowed.</para>
<para>The people where the citrus canker outbreak occurred were foreign people. They had special arrangements with the government that have never been denied in the newspapers or in this place. The citrus canker came in and there was a $5,000 donation not to party funds, where it had to be made public, but to a research foundation. That is where all this money is laundered. All parties do that; I am not singling out the National Party. When you have been in politics for 32 years like I have, your antenna goes up when something is done with indecent haste, such as the sale of Telstra. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThank you for the opportunity to speak on this matter of public importance. Mr Deputy Speaker, you know that I am a new member in this place.

<para>The necessity for the Government to treat the Australian people with openness and frankness.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">There is not one person here who could disagree with that statement. I say these words as the member for New England is leaving the room. That statement has been notoriously twisted and turned around. It shows that what underlies the member for New Englandâs actions today is nothing short of hatred. I really mean that. It has been evident. You could see it on his face; you could hear it in his words; you could hear it in the timbre of his voice as he spoke. There were no interruptions from members listening to himâthe chair, members on this side of the House or even those from the opposition side. But as the member for Page was taking the opportunity to rebut some of the statements made by the member for New England there was constant interjection, interruption and sniggering and the member for New England made further spurious claims.</para>
<para>I bear the member for New England no ill will; I hardly know him. As a new member I have met him a few times; he seems okay, but when he strides into this chamber something quite different confronts everybody in this room. It is worth pointing out to people who may be in the gallery or listening on the broadcast that to raise a matter of public importance it is necessary, when given the opportunity, for the Speaker to identify at least eight members of parliament who stand with the person who is raising the MPI to support the fact that we should have the debate. So today, given the opportunity, eight members stood; in fact, all of the opposition were here right after question time and they all stood in their places. They supported the member for New England in raising this MPI. If it is a matter of public importance, you stand and agree that we should debate this for an hour or an hour and a half.

He scattergunned with âchildren overboardâ; he threw in Telstra, Iraq and even climate change for good measure, and we still did not get to the bottom of what he meant. He said that these issues and others were starting to erode public confidence in this important institutionânot just the government but the parliament.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I would have to say that I share some understanding of how people feel, particularly when they watch or listen to question time. I am very aware of this. I hear it in my electorate when I am meeting people. They often mention thisâthat question time is like a bear pit. People are attacking each other, sometimes personally. Today we heard it from the would-be health minister, the member for Lalor, when she was attacking the Acting Prime Minister for taking steps to show some compassion when one of his colleagues was in hospital.</para>
<para>I accept that. I understand that question time can be a pretty angry time. It shows us at our worst; I would admit that. But at least it is democracy in action. At least the chair has the opportunity to shut down people who are acting inappropriately, to kick them out if they do not accept a warning and to require people to withdraw when they make outrageous statementsâsuch as the time when the chair had to send out the member for New England for what have been proven to be outrageous, unfair, unqualified, unsubstantiated claims of bribery against the then Deputy Prime Minister, the member for Gwydir. What a shame that was and what a disgrace.</para>
<para>There is a real arrogance in the member for New England today lecturing people like me on this sideâlecturing this chamberâabout the need to be open, honest and frank. It is shockingly arrogant. It is also very hypocritical. When he was given the opportunity to make the same statements outside the parliament, he would not do it. He was not prepared to make his claims against John Anderson, the member for Gwydir, outside this chamberâwithout the protection of the soft green leather chairs and parliamentary privilege. He would not do it.</para>
<para>Instead of taking personal responsibility for himself, being accountable for his own actions and explaining to his electorate why he is not even here half the timeâand I include question time and voting in divisions in thatâhe lashes out. As I have said, he is a man filled with hatred and anger. That is a great disappointment to me and I know it is a great disappointment to people all over Australia who have been witness to it.</para>
<para>What a shame that instead of taking responsibility for himself he has only one course of actionâto enlist the support of the Labor Party in attacking the government. They leave him for dead. He is on his own. They have just used him today as a puppet. Even the member for Rankin has now gone. I hope he comes back. I would like to hear what he has to say. I will listen to him.</para>
<para>It is very easy to accuse other people of corruption. That is terribly easy. It is very, very easy to attribute an improper motive to another person. None of us is perfect. I know I am not. Like so many other people on both sides of the chamber, I appreciate the value of honesty. None of us meets the test all the time. True integrity is living what you believe, living it outâactually demonstrating it. Honesty is saying the truth.</para>
<para>I would say that, to a degree, everybody has integrity and honesty. All of us have that. For example, we all tell the truth most of the time. A truly honest person is someone who tells the truth even when it hurtsâwhen it is hard to tell the truth, when they know they have done something wrong and they should give account. That is an honest person. A person with integrity is a person who lives their beliefs when it hurts them, when it costs them. I am not seeing it today. I have not seen it in some of the Independentsâ actions in my 11 months as the member for Bass.</para>
<para>Rather than criticising other people and making virtually criminal accusations against them, I suggest that the member for New England should take account of his own actions. He should recognise that the claims he has made in the past are really claims that can be put up against his own test of not being open, not being frank. He was not prepared to make claims against other people outside this chamber. I suggest that some of the other claims he has made today he would not be prepared to make outside the chamber.</para>
<para>When the member for New England says that these actions of the government, which he has virtually made up, are starting to erode trust in government, he is partly right, but he is part of the problem. He is the one who is talking down the positive attributes of, frankly, probably Australiaâs most honest Prime Minister and his government. The member for Rankin looks as though he has just emptied his stomach over there behind his desk. But the reality is that he is filled with hatred against the Liberal Party in the same way the member for New England is filled with hatred against any member of the National Party. We have heard about the disappointments of the member for New England today. We have heard about that fateful day when he missed out on preselection and then wanted to run as an Independent.</para>
<para>Today the member for Kennedy, instead of saying that it is a bribe when somebody negotiates a position with the government and that involves a package of reforms and improvements to infrastructureârather than saying that, as an Independent he is now taking the credit for Networking the Nation. You cannot have it both ways.</para>
<para>This government is an honest government. This government, like me, is not perfect. But do not go lecturing us on being open, frank and accountable to the Australian people when we have demonstrated that we will go to an election with a hard policy and then implement itânot like the Labor Party when it goes to an election with l-a-w law tax cuts and then after the election shuts them down.</para>

<para>âThe continuation of the debate on the <inline ref="R2376">Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005</inline> gives me the opportunity to comment on the governmentâs honesty. I did welcome the just completed debate on the matter of public importance about the necessity for the government to treat the Australian people with openness and frankness. The government has failed to do that in the nine long years in which it has ruled this country. The contribution to the matter of public importance from the previous speaker, the member for Bass, was astonishing, to say the least, when he declared that the Prime Minister must be the most honest Prime Minister this country has ever had. The member for Bass is a new member and he may not be fully aware of the document entitled <inline font-style="italic">Truth overboard: 27 Lies told by John Howard and counting</inline>.

<para>âI do want to confine myself to the Medicare safety net legislation. In order to do that we will need to set some benchmarks in truth and honesty in government. The Medicare safety net legislation is a formalisation of the breaking of an election promise by this governmentâthe breaking of a promise that it knew before the election that it could not keep but it did not have the honesty to take the Australian people into its confidence and tell them before the election that it would not be able to sustain the Medicare safety net because it was too financially expensive and costs were blowing out.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>I mentioned that we need to make these judgments against benchmarks set by leaders. That benchmark was set in respect of this government by the Prime Minister of Australia when he was opposition leader. He said on 25 August 1995:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Truth is absolute, truth is supreme, truth is never disposable in national political life.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The Prime Minister, the Treasurer and most particularly the health minister knew the truth before the last election. The truth was that the Medicare safety net was unsustainable. The department of finance had advised the finance minister of this fact and obviously that fact was shared with other ministers. Nevertheless, the government proceeded to spend $20 million of taxpayersâ money assuring the Australian people that the Medicare safety net would remain intact in full. The Minister for Health and Ageing told the Australian people just before the last election, on 16 September:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I absolutely guarantee that the safety net, as the government has put it into operation, will continueâI absolutely guarantee it.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He said in another interview 10 days before that:</para>
<motion>
<para class="block">That is an absolutely rock solid, iron-clad commitment.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">We have just had a debate about truth and honesty in government. When the minister was making those statements he was aware that the cost of the Medicare safety net was blowing out and yet he continued to say that this was a promise that would be kept after the election. The government knew that it could not keep that promise; nevertheless, it continued to reassure the Australian people that it would be kept.</para>
<para>During question time the same minister unloaded another bucket of vitriol in the Australian parliament, using harsh language but most importantly conveying to the Australian people his hatred and his bitterness. This is not a great day for the Australian Labor Party with the release of the Latham diariesâwe know that. Mr Latham has left this parliament a very bitter and disappointed man. But we have in this parliament still a very bitter and disappointed man, and that man is the minister for health.</para>
<para>The minister for health is a shadow of his former selfâa shell of a man. I remember when I first became a member of parliament in 1998 and the now minister for health had been promoted to a junior portfolio. He used to lumber from the end of the frontbench to the microphone and, to show that he was a really tough guy, he would lay into the Labor Party or anyone else with his vitriol. This man has continued to do that right up to this day, in question time today. He is an embarrassment to the Australian parliament. He is a very bitter and disappointed man.</para>
<para>The minister for health should himself consider his position in the Australian parliament and consider whether he has any further worthwhile contribution to make to public policy formulation in this country. We are debating a piece of legislation that formalises the breaking of a promise by the Howard government, the breaking of a promise by the minister for health and the breaking of an assurance that he would absolutely guarantee this as a rock solid commitment.</para>
<para>But he is completely unabashed. There seems to be no embarrassment on the part of this minister to then get up in question time today as though he were some sort of great orator and great contributor to the parliamentary debates in our great country. He is not. He is a very bitter and disappointed man. His ambitions have been thwarted by none other than himself, because he has proven time and time again that he is a stranger to the truthâas formalised in this Medicare safety net legislation. As I mentioned previously, the word âabsolutelyâ comes out of the mouth of the health minister with monotonous regularity. When the word âabsolutelyâ comes out in response to a question, particularly from the health minister, you need to be suspicious that in fact he is saying exactly the opposite. Where do I get the evidence for that? I get the evidence for that in a <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners</inline> interview of 1998, when he was asked about financial backing for Terry Sharples. The reporterâs question was:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">So there was never any question of any party or other funds from any other source being offered to Terry Sharples?</para>

<para>âMr Deputy Speaker, I am going to the health ministerâs credibility and capacity to tell the truth. The fact is that his incapacity to tell the truth is formalised here, today, in a piece of legislation that this parliament will be voting on. This piece of legislation declares that the ministerâs commitmentsâgiven as an ironclad promise with the use of the word âabsolutelyââhave today been broken. The government announced before the election that it would sustain this Medicare safety net, even though it knew before the election that it would not be able to do so. It put in $20 million of taxpayersâ funds to assure the Australian people that the Medicare safety net would be retained in full.</para>

If the member were to check the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>, she would know that the debate here in the parliament this afternoon is on the Medicare safety net legislation. I trust that, following the closing of my remarks, she will make some sort of a contribution to this debate. The fact is that the government did not tell the truth.

<para class="block">This parliament ought to condemn the health minister for his wilful incapacity to tell the truth. That is what has happened here todayâand, in making some sort of assessment of this health minister, it is not the only time. Members of parliament may well recall a recent interview in relation to health policy that occurred on <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> on 30 September last year. The transcript of that interview reads as follows:</para>

<para class="block">TONY JONES: Tony Abbott on another matter, have you met Archbishop Pell during the election campaign?</para>

<para class="block">TONY JONES: At the presbytery in Sydney.</para>
<para class="block">TONY ABBOTT: Ah, actually now that you do mention it, I did meet with Cardinal Pell. So what? Why shouldnât I meet with Cardinal Pell?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It was only when the health minister realised that Tony Jones of <inline font-style="italic">Lateline</inline> had details not only of the time of the meeting but also the venue of the meeting that the health minister realised that he would have to tell the truth. But if the health minister could have gotten away with not telling the truth, as he had attempted to, he would have. If the details had not been known to the ABC, the health minister yet again would not have told the truth. Here he is in parliament today in question time, unloading his bucket of bile in the Australian parliament because he has nothing to contribute to health policy. This is a man who presides over a health budget in excess of $30,000 million, yet he spends most of his waking hours thinking of language that he can pour out of his mouth in getting stuck into the Labor Party, while displaying to the Australian people that he is not fit to be a member of this parliament.</para>
<para>There is one bitter and disappointed man who has left this parliament; another bitter and disappointed man ought to leave it as quickly as possible. We will do everything that we possibly can to ensure that the minister for health leaves this parliament; it is time.

<para>âI rise to oppose the <inline ref="R2376">Health Insurance Amendment (Medicare Safety-nets) Bill 2005</inline>. It is interesting that we are speaking on this piece of legislation on a day when we have discussed a matter of public importance relating to the necessity for government to treat the Australian people with openness and frankness. This billâs purpose is to reduce the annual thresholds above which benefits under the extended Medicare safety net are payable. From 1 January 2006, the thresholds will increase from $306.90 to $500 for concession card holders and other low-income families, and from $716.10 to $1,000 for all other families and individuals. In debating this legislation, I wish to make three points. One is the fact that this is the legislation of a broken election promise by the Howard government. The second matter I want to discuss is the inequitable nature of the Medicare safety net. The third is that this piece of legislation and the Medicare safety net are other aspects of the governmentâs health care program that lead to this mish-mash we have seen in the development of health policies by this government.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In the short time that I have tonight, I want to go to the point of equity, because it is very interesting to look at where the benefit from this measure is going. From the latest figures available for the federal electorates in Victoria, each of the electorates of Kooyong, Goldstein and Higgins gains over $500,000 because of this policy: $560,000 to Kooyong, $529,000 to Goldstein and $523,000 to Higgins. If we look at Indi, it is $203,000. If we look at the seat of Scullin, it is $185,000. Mr Speaker, if we look at Wannon, it is $108,000. On equity grounds, how could it be said that an electorate like Wannon, in health policy, should gain around half a million dollars less in a quarter than electorates like Kooyong, Goldstein and Higgins? That is one of the problems with this overall piece of policy. The fact that this represents a broken election promise is an issue that also needs to be developed.</para>

<para>âI rise to comment on recent events in my electorate that deserve to be placed on the record in this place. Last weekend Wangaratta Aerodrome played host to a very significant event commemorating our returned service men and women. The Benalla campus of the Goulburn Ovens Institute of TAFE organised a successful Pacific flyers reunion to complement recent commemorations of the 60th anniversary of Victory in the Pacific Day. The day included a flyover of historic aircraft, displays of fighter aircraft, a display of historic military vehicles and a tour of the museum precinct and the aircraft restoration facility.</para>

<para>I want to thank Adrian Vaughan and his organising team from the Benalla TAFE, who spent many months organising this event. It was part of a documentary by the TAFEâs multimedia students called <inline font-style="italic">On a Wing and a Prayer</inline> on the restoration of war planes. Over 1,000 people attended in blustery and wet conditions, including many veterans who came from far-off places. A particular highlight was the flight of a lovingly restored P40 Kittyhawk fighter-bomber which was last in operation in Papua New Guinea 60 years ago. It was back in the air last weekend at Wangaratta Aerodrome and was reunited with its former pilot, Robert Warren, who came from his home town of Tulsa in Oklahoma to be in Wangaratta for this historic event. Mr Warren was delighted at the restoration work carried out on the plane by Wangarattaâs own Precision Aerospace Productions.</para>
<para>But residents heard the loudest roar when they played host to an F18 Hornet flyover. At this point, I want to place on the record my thanks and appreciation to Senator Robert Hill, the Minister for Defence. At the last minute, when it looked like the flyover would not be able to take place owing to an absence of pavement concessions and indemnity insurance, the organisers approached my office and I swiftly took up the matter with the ministerâs office. Once these outstanding issues were addressed, the minister gave his approval on Friday afternoon for this historic flyover. I thank him and his office for doing everything possible to ensure that this very welcome and much anticipated community event went ahead. Former Wangaratta resident Shawn Mathews flew the Hornet from the base in Williamtown.</para>
<para>Another event of note in the north-east last weekend was the annual staging of the Three Choirs Festival. This is a yearly event where the three pre-eminent choirs in the regionâthe Wangaratta Choristers, the Beechworth Singers and the Murray Conservatorium Choirâcollaborate to deliver a series of concerts to audiences in our region. This yearâs feature work was the rarely heard Beethoven Mass in C. Beethoven is not particularly renowned for his sacred music compositions, but the Mass in C is a delight for listeners. Unfortunately, I was unable to attend the concerts last weekend, but I am told that the concerts in Yarrawonga, Wodonga and Wangaratta were a great success.</para>
<para>Another aspect of the concert was the performance of a work by one of my constituents, local Wodonga resident Bohdan Krowicky. His piece âThou and Iâ is a hauntingly evocative composition, with the text taken from a poem by the 13th century mystic Rumi. All credit goes to my constituent Mr Krowicky for having his own composition performed publicly. We can often forget the achievements of our musicians, artists and composers, particularly in rural and regional areas, but it is important to give these home-grown works a performance whenever we can.</para>
<para>I am informed that the crowds were a bit down in Yarrawonga on the Friday night but that the attendances at Wodonga and Wangaratta were excellent and the crowds were definitely treated to quality performances by our local musicians. Thanks go to Ben Wilson, director of the Wangaratta Choristers, Margaret Phillips, director of the Beechworth Singers, and Michael Halsey, director of the Murray Conservatorium Choir, who prepared the respective choirs excellently for this event. Events such as this show that the arts and in particular musical performance are respected and encouraged in rural and regional Australia. We should work towards continuing to develop regional arts practice and the role of the arts in sustaining and unifying our regional communities.</para>

<para>âThis year, 2005, has been an important year for both the state of Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Mahmoud Abbas was elected President of the Palestinian Authority, and Prime Minister Sharon and President Abbas declared a cease-fire between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. In February the Knesset voted 59 to 40 to approve the disengagement implementation law, an act of parliament that would see more than 8,000 Israeli settlers in Gaza evacuated and the resultant vacant land given back to the Palestinian people. It must be said that Israelâs decision to withdraw from Gaza has been controversial. Not many people would dispute that. Many within Israel itself were not happy with Prime Minister Sharonâs decision but Mr Sharon, to his credit, persevered until this week, when the parliament formally recognised Israelâs withdrawal from Gaza.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The conclusion of an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza is a significant step towards an overall peace settlement in the Middle East and should be welcomed by all Australians. As Chief Opposition Whip, I take this opportunity on behalf of the Labor Party to commend Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, the Israeli parliament and the Israeli people for taking this courageous step, which has clearly been a very traumatic and painful process for Israel. Whatever we may think of Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories or of the settlement policies of the previous Israeli governments, the decision to remove more than 8,000 settlers from Gaza and return the territory to Palestinian rule is a major advance towards a peaceful settlement, particularly since it was done unilaterally and without any guarantees of security.</para>
<para>Labor now calls on both sides to follow up the momentum created by this withdrawal by taking further concrete steps to keep the peace process moving. On the Palestinian side, this must include a crackdown on those groups responsible for terrorist attacks on Israel and an end to the incitement and encouragement of violence and hatred. On the Israeli side, there needs to be continuing disengagement from the West Bank and steps taken to allow the Palestinian Authority to assume full responsibility for Gaza, including its air space and coastline, in a manner consistent with Israelâs legitimate security interests.</para>
<para>So why is this relevant to the Australian parliament? Because we on our side of the chamber take a keen interest in the Middle East. Labor wears on its chest with pride its role in the creation of an Israeli state. It was, after all, the Chifley Labor government which, over 50 years ago, was amongst the first in the world to give political support to the idea of a Jewish state. Under Labor, Australia was the first country to vote in favour of the 1947 partition resolution. And, as President of the United Nations General Assembly, former Labor foreign minister Dr Evatt played a key role in the founding of Israel in 1948.</para>
<para>For the past 50 years Labor has never taken a backward step in advocating practical solutions to the long-running Israel-Palestine conflict. In recent years Labor has repeatedly urged both Israel and Palestine to engage on the road map to peace. We believe, despite some setbacks along the way, that the road map offers the strongest possibility of a sustainable and robust peace between Israelis and Palestinians. Our policy is based on the right of the state of Israel to exist within secure boundaries. We do not back away from that. We vest our hope in a two-state solution involving the creation of a separate Palestinian state behind secure boundaries. A lasting settlement between the Palestinian and Israeli peoples is the only way forward.</para>
<para>No-one should pretend that the road map to peace is an easy path. It is not. But progress is being made. The withdrawal from Gaza is another step forward. To ignore that fact is ignorant. Australia should do whatever it can in the coming months to encourage both sides to maintain the momentum created by Israelâs decision to withdraw from Gaza. It is true that the honourable member for Fowler, who is always passionate about the causes she embraces, used some words in a speech which caused offence, but she withdrew them today after question time and I admire the honourable member for Fowler for her courage in doing so.</para>

<para>âI rise today to express on behalf of my constituents and many residents of the Gold Coast our disgust at the betrayal by the Beattie Labor government of residents who live in my electorate and who live within the confines of Gold Coast City. At 11 am this morning the Beattie state Labor government ended the charade they had been carrying on with for a matter of months about what they would be doing with the cruise ship terminal on the Gold Coast. At 11 am this morning, Anna Bligh, the Deputy Premier and state Labor Minister for State Development, announced to the assembled media throng that the Beattie Labor government would be pushing ahead with the proposal to build a cruise ship terminal.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Those on the Gold Coast who have been following this debate closely for some time would know that I have thought for some monthsâand, indeed, I had heard whispers for some monthsâthat the Beattie state Labor government had in fact passed through their cabinet last December the decision to push forward with a cruise ship terminal, despite the fact that it is very clear that many residents of Main Beach, Surfers Paradise and more broadly were opposed to the idea of a cruise ship terminal on the Spit.</para>
<para>Questions need to be asked. Why is the state Labor government undertaking this path? Why is the state Labor government turning up its nose at the residents of Main Beach? Why is the state Labor government turning its back on the residents of Surfers Paradise and imposing this cruise ship terminal in an area where nobody wants it to be built? The reason is that it is a knee-jerk political reaction from a very scared state Labor government to try to save backsides and to ensure the political survival of the state member for Southport, Peter Lawlor, and the state member for Broadwater, Peta-Kaye Croft.</para>
<para>In this particular instance, what is very clear is that a deal has been done by the state Labor government in the context of a cruise ship terminal. In particular, the state Labor government has pushed forward with three key proposals as part of the development of a cruise ship terminal. So for many months now we have seen the state Labor government talking about the fact that it says a cruise ship terminal is good for the Gold Coast. Indeed, I support that notion, as does my colleague the state Liberal member for Surfers Paradise, John-Paul Langbroek. Dr Langbroek and I have been saying that we support a cruise ship terminal, but we reject entirely the notion that a cruise ship terminal should be built on the end of the Spit. We reject entirely that a cruise ship terminal should be built in crown parkland in one of the last remaining vegetation areas on the Gold Coast. We reject entirely that a cruise ship terminal should be built for the political convenience of two state Labor MPs and for the political convenience of the Premier, Peter Beattie.</para>
<para>But I will tell you the reason why the state Labor government is insisting that a cruise ship terminal be built on the Spit. The reason is that it is part of a deal that has been done with the developers to redevelop the western side of the Spit. That has been the key behind this decision from the very outset. The reality is that the state Labor government has made an arrangement that the consortium that will build the cruise ship terminal, a loss-making venture, will do so on the basis that they have the opportunity to redevelop the western side of the Broadwater. Some 7Â½ hectares will be redeveloped into hotels, units and residential and commercial buildings because the state Labor government wants the millions of dollars of leasing rental that will flow to it by redeveloping that 7Â½ hectares.</para>
<para>More importantly, the state Labor government also intends to facilitate this dodgy deal to have the sea scouts, the naval cadets and the water police move from their current location on the western side of the Spit and be incorporated into the development that is going to take place in this green area. The state Liberal member for Surfers Paradise, John-Paul Langbroek, and I object to this because we have seen the federal government invest millions of dollars through Green Corps projects and Work for the Dole projects to revegetate the Spit. We object to it because the Beattie state Labor government has neglected public consultation in order to push this deal through. More importantly, we reject this deal because the Beattie Labor government has done this deal without being honest with the people of the Gold Coast. Today is a very bleak day for the residents of Main Beach and Surfers Paradise. It is a day when the Beattie Labor government has compounded its dishonesty, not only over the state health sector but also on this issue. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI rise to speak on the matter of West Papua. The Australian Labor Party has a long and proud record on human rights, and it is an area of real interest to me as a member of this parliament. That strong stance is set out in considerable detail in the ALP platform, which explicitly states:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">Labor considers the promotion of universal human rights to be a core foreign policy objective that cannot be traded off against other diplomatic and economic goals.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Respect for human rightsâthe dignity and welfare of our fellow humansâis naturally our first and most immediate response to reports of human rights abuses. However, Labor also believes that respect for human rights is an important consideration in international relations. Respect for human rights contributes to domestic peace and stability and economic prosperity. This in turn contributes to the maintenance of international security.</para>
<para>In this regard, I have been greatly concerned, as others have, by reports from church groups and human rights organisations about incidents of police and military brutality in the Indonesian province of West Papua. Most disturbing are the reports of the Indonesian armyâs involvement in the murder of Papuan independence leader Theys Eluay in 2001. In particular, I draw the attention of the House to a report that was submitted to the UN Economic and Social Council on 9 March this year by Franciscans International on behalf of a number of respected and credible church groups, including the Catholic Institute for International Relations, the Protestant Church in Germany, Dominicans for Justice and Peace, and the World Council of Churches. That report noted that human rights abuses, including torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, and displacement, were continuing in Papua.</para>
<para>There is no doubt that during the bad old days of the Suharto government the Papuan people were subjected to gross violations of their human rights. In addition to military brutality and political oppression, the province was neglected by Jakarta, with the Papuans lagging behind the rest of the country by virtually every standard of human developmentâinfant mortality, literacy and life expectancy. The fall of the Suharto government and the subsequent election of President Wahid in 2000 gave rise to real optimism that a new era in Papua would unfold. It is important to acknowledge that there have been some positive developments, including the introduction of a special autonomy law granting Papuans political freedoms and autonomy. But the fact remains that we continue to receive disturbing reports of human rights abuses in Papua. Labor are very concerned about these reports. It is our view that a failure to address ongoing human rights concerns will only serve to undermine Indonesian authority in the province.</para>
<para>Labor are also very disappointed at the failure to fully implement the law, which was passed by the Indonesian parliament in 2002. We have made our concerns clear to the Indonesian government and will continue to do so. The Leader of the Opposition and the shadow foreign minister, Kevin Rudd, took the opportunity provided by the recent visit to Australia by Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to raise their concerns about the human rights situation in West Papua and the failure to implement the special autonomy law. Shadow minister Rudd made it clear when he said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... when it comes to human rights abuses or allegations of human rights abuses in Papua ... we have an expectation that the government in Jakarta will attend to those matters ... at a thorough level.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Still, it is clear from reports recently made public, including <inline font-style="italic">Genocide in West Papua</inline>?âand the question mark following this title raises legitimate questions about whether it is the right term to use here; we do not think that it isâthat the situation is of concern. That particular report, from the Centre for Conflict and Peace Studies, shows that the situation in West Papua continues to deteriorate and is very serious. Health conditions in some areas are very poor. The fact that special autonomy has not reached grassroots levels means there remain continuing infringements of peopleâs rights. This is serious. So it is essential that this parliament provide encouragement to the Indonesian government to speedily advance those arrangements identified as necessary for the implementation of the special autonomy law.</para>
<para>We have welcomed President Yudhoyonoâs success in negotiating a peace agreement in Aceh. His decision to grasp the opportunity provided in the wake of the tsunami to rebuild not just the bricks and mortar of the province but also civil society is acknowledged. It is now time for similar energies and commitment to be brought to bear for the people of West Papua.</para>

</talker>
<para>âI wish to place on record my concern over the comments made by the member for Fowler in this place on 13 September and 8 September this year and 2 December last year. It follows on from comments made earlier in this adjournment debate by the member for Chifley and from a question asked by the member for Casey to the Attorney-General in question time today. As the member for Stirling, I represent in this place a large Jewish community, a community that makes a large contribution to my electorate and to Western Australia as a whole. Indeed, I think the contribution that the community makes is out of proportion to the size of that community, which is not numerically large.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I was reminded just this week that they can feel uniquely vulnerable, and as a community they have legitimate security needs. Alsoâand I think quite rightlyâthey are sensitive to any reference to the Holocaust. To come into this chamber and use terms like âconcentration campâ, âghettoâ and âethnic cleansingâ against Israel is enormously insensitive. No matter what your views on the conflict in the Middle Eastâand I am not disputing the right of the member for Fowler to hold a different view to mine on the conflict thereâit is completely inappropriate for her to come into this chamber and to compare the mass extermination of six million people in concentration camps to events that are occurring in the Middle East at the present time. That is why using the language of the Holocaust against Israel causes such hurt to members of the Jewish community in Australia, some of whom actually survived the events she is now using to push a case about Middle Eastern politics. The member for Fowler needs to recognise these concerns in any future comments on this issue and she must apologise for going down this path in the first place.</para>
<para>I well remember her earlier comments in December last year in this place eulogising Yassar Arafatâsomething I believe was very ill-advised given his well-known record as someone who used violence to achieve his political ends. For the parliament of a country that is one of the worldâs oldest democracies to be used to eulogise as a hero someone who ruled as dictator and used violence to achieve his goals, sometimes against his own people, is a very sad occurrence in the history of this place.</para>
<para>I know that the member for Fowler has a particular view about Middle Eastern politics. As I said before, although I do not share this view I respect her right to hold it. But this tolerance does not extend to using this parliament to eulogise people of violence or to deeply offend Australian Jewry by using the language of the Holocaust in a wholly inappropriate way.</para>
<para>While I am addressing this issue, I want to highlight some other comments made by the member for Fowler on 8 September in relation to Islamic fundamentalism. In my electorate of Stirling there is a large Muslim community. I have spent quite a bit of time at the two mosques in my electorate, and I have taken the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs and the Attorney-General to meet with community leaders at different times. They have always been very clear with me that they reject Islamic extremism and the terrorism that emanates from that ideology. Sadly, though, the member for Fowler rejects this link and has used the parliament to outline her view that these terrorists are killing Westerners because of Western actions in the Muslim world. Last week she said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... terrorists do not hate us for what we are; they hate us for what we are doing in their home countries. When we can appreciate that, we will be a lot closer to solving problems in Iraq and reducing the risk of terrorist attacks against Australians. But this cowardly government wants to hide behind another lieâthe lie that Islamic fundamentalism is the root of terrorism.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This goes well beyond the ALPâs position on this issue, and I believe that this thinking skates very close to justifying the terroristsâ repulsive actions. It also reflects terrorist propaganda. Islamic fundamentalists are killing Westerners because of who we are, not for any other reason. They despise us for our freedoms, and they despise us for our democracy. The Labor Party as a whole need to face up to this issue. Will they tolerate people within their ranks who believe that somehow Western nations have brought this savage terrorism upon themselves, or will the opposition Leader show some ticker and repudiateâ<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI am glad to announce that we are back doing the parliamentary fortnightly wrap. I have already congratulated the minister at the table, the Minister for Small Business and Tourism, for specifically wearing her Hollywood glam this morning. I think she has done very well indeed with the pearls, and it is obviously because she wanted to bring a sense of occasion to this evening!</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In the last parliamentary fortnight and particularly in the last parliamentary week we have seen a week of guillotines. We saw the Telstra debate guillotined in this House on Monday. We saw it guillotined again in this House today. We saw it guillotined in an unprecedented fashion in the Senate. These were guillotines on a debate about the sale of the single biggest asset the Australian government owns and is ever likely to ownâa week of guillotines. It seems to me remarkable that, in a week of guillotines, when debate has been gagged in this parliament, somehow the members opposite and particularly the Treasurer have taken to referring to me as Madame Defarge. I think there is a grand irony about that. Those are the lovers of the guillotine over there. They are the ones that have been cackling and laughing as the guillotine has come down on Telstra.</para>
<para>But for sheer, breathtaking, amazing carry-on, we cannot go past the Minister for Health and Ageing this week in his capacity as Leader of the House, who has of course administered the guillotine twice in this place to prevent members speaking but yesterday wasâremarkablyâraising a point of order with you, Mr Speaker, where he said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... it would be almost an obscenity in a parliament dedicated to free speech if people were able to use personal explanations to gag debate in this place.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The minister for health is the lover of debate on some occasions and the hater of debate on others. His views about free speech have to be seen as grandly inconsistent, because he was happy to guillotine opposition members this week, and guillotine them he did.</para>
<para>The minister for health has certainly won the lack of consistency award, and he has also won the lack of taste and empathy award for the fortnight. In fact, his performance has gone from bad to worse. He started the week with parliamentary scandal about callous and insensitive remarks he made in relation to the matter involving Mr Brogden, and of course he has managed to end the week reinforcing his insensitivity. Nye Bevanâone of my Welsh forebearsâfamously said, as his career progressed: âReal power always seemed to lie just beyond my reach.â I think for the minister for health it is respect that always seems to lie just beyond his reach, and he has certainly fallen very short of that benchmark today.</para>
<para>What have we seen this fortnight? We have seen the once great National Party starting to emit a death rattle. We have seen the National Party at its worstâwith the notable exception of the member for Riverinaâas it sold out its constituency. With respect to the National Party, I think Alan Ramsey got it right a month ago when he interviewed a person he described as âone of the Prime Ministerâs junior colleaguesâ and as âa very jacked-off Liberalâ. That Liberal had the following things to say about the National Party. Mr Speaker, I am sorry about the language, but I am quoting:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Nats are scum. They take everything and give nothing. They get elected on our coat-tails, theyâve got the worst ministers in the Government, they get the perks, the extra staff, the trips, the Prime Ministerâs ear, yet they never contribute. Itâs always about take, about self-interest. Theyâre never part of the team.</para>
<para class="block">â¦Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â¦Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â¦</para>
<para class="block">Did you see Cobbâs performance in question time today? He was hopeless. Just so bad. Is it any wonder Liberals are so resentful?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">And it goes on and on, ending up describing National Party members in the following terms:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">John Anderson was hopeless. Vaile isnât much better. Cobb is an embarrassment. So is Truss, the new deputy leader. An absolute embarrassment. McGauran is a laughing stock. So why is there resentment from the Liberals? I mean, does one need to ask the question?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">You do not need to ask the question, because we have seen the National Party on display this week, famously without a backbone, except for the member for Riverina, and we certainly know that Senator Barnaby Joyce is still looking for his. In the parliamentary fortnight we have also seen, <inline font-style="italic">Sliding Doors</inline> style, a glimpse of what would happen with the alternative government. We have seen the Prime Minister away one week, we have seen the Treasurer away another week, and we would have to say that it has not been a pretty sight.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">David Hopkins did bombardment in the Pacific, from the Battle of the Coral Sea to the Philippines. He lost a lot of mates during the Philippines campaign and said that you do not know the feeling until you lose a mate. He read about a prisoner of war on the Burma railway, about his mate, and that was the poem I just read.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The reason why I read that is that there was a kerfuffle recently about whether the word âmateâ should be used by attendants. Of course it should be. It is part of our lexicon; it is part of our Australian history. It is something we should be proud of. The diggers are the greatest personification of mates. Many mates were lost during the war; people lost their lives protecting their mates. So I thought it was appropriate to read what David Hopkins had to say. It might be a message to those of the politically correct class to leave the word âmateâ alone. It is best used in as many circumstances as it can be. I commend to the House the poem that David Hopkins read out.</para>

<para>âThat was a very good contribution by the member for Banks, Mr Deputy Speaker. It was not long ago that my electorate of Hinkler languished near the bottom of the national bulk-billing rate, but that trend has been reversed in the past year or soânot only have Hinklerâs bulk-billing rates steadily improved but we are now one of the best performing electorates in the nation. The latest bulk-billing figures, covering the 12 months from June 2003-04 to June 2004-05, show a dramatic increase from 52.6 to 66.8âin other words, two-thirds of all people in my electorate can now be bulk-billed. It was the biggest percentage increase of any Queensland electorate and more than double the state average of 6.1. We have beaten many urban seats in lifting our bulk-billing services, and even though we are still slightly behind the state average, we are forging ahead in giving people access to bulk-billing services. This has been a steady trend over time. The electorateâs bulk-billing rates went from 47.7 to 60.5 between the December quarters of 2003 and 2004. It grew again in the next six months to reach a bulk-billing rate of 66.8 in the June quarter of this year.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I have worked hard to make sure that Hinkler gets a fair share of doctors. This has been helped enormously by the coalitionâs bulk-billing incentive payments and my concentration on areas of work force need. The new structure for GPs, which gives doctors an extra $5.10 or $7.65 for servicing concession card holders and children under 16, has been a real incentive. The consequence of this policy has been that people have more choice and opportunity to bulk-bill. In turn it has contributed to Australiaâs bulk-billing rate reaching almost 75 per cent. In fact, in the last quarterly figures two new records were set: firstly, the bulk-billing rate is now 69 per cent in country areas, which our political opponents said would never happen, and, secondly, 81.8 per cent of children are now bulk-billed. That is interesting, isnât it? Five out of every six kids are now bulk-billed.</para>

<para>âThen you need to work on it, because the local member has a lot to do with it. These outstanding results fly in the face of the gloom and doom that was predicted by Labor about bulk-billing. In fact, all Labor and Independent held seats in QueenslandâCapricornia, Brisbane, Rankin, Oxley, Griffith, Lilley and Kennedyâhave experienced increases in their bulk-billing rates. I think it is a very important issue and something we should keep under review, giving Australians a choice of bulk-billing and other services.</para>

<para>âAustralia has a new barbecue stopper. All around Australia people are talking about the rising price of fuel and the impact this is having on their way of life. Everybody has a view as to what should be done about it. People say things like, âCut taxes,â âImprove public transportâ and âPut more investment in alternative fuel sources.â These are just a few of the suggestions doing the rounds at the moment, but the Prime Ministerâs ostrich plan is the most astonishing response to the issue to date. His idea to bury his head in the sand and do absolutely nothing about the price of fuel defies belief. I am sure the so-called battlers who are out there in the suburbs are not making whoopee this morning at the news that the PM plans to do nothing. Astonishing as it sounds, this demonstrates just how out of touch the government have become. It demonstrates that they are more interested in pursuing their radical and extreme ideological agendas than in doing anything meaningful and constructive to improve the lives of those who at the last election placed their trust and confidence in the Prime Minister to lead this nation. Instead, all he has done is lead them down the garden path.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">For the Prime Minister to suggest that he can do nothing to help the lives of ordinary Australians is an insult to the electorateâs intelligence. There is a lot the Prime Minister can do, and the vital first step is to conjure up the courage to confront the problemâto acknowledge it, not to wash your hands of the issue. Labor and Kim Beazley put the Prime Minister on notice over petrol prices in June and put forward a plan to tackle the issue, including such things as applying the competition blowtorch to the industry by strengthening the Trade Practices Act to prevent abuse of market power; having the ACCC investigate petrol prices and report every six months on price movements, particularly in regional Australia; modernising the 25-year-old regulatory regime for the petrol sector to promote competition and protect independent service station operators and franchisees; reducing our reliance on imported oil; growing an Australian fuel industry; and providing a real future for the biofuels industry by providing a government fleet market for ethanol blends to set an example and help grow the industry.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">These are just a few of the positive steps that the government could be taking. The Prime Minister could reduce the pressure on families, could take positive steps forward to do something. It would certainly be better than saying and doing nothing and blaming everybody else. When will the Prime Minister wake up? Australian motorists see the significant price fluctuations week to week and cannot figure out why or how it works. We see wild variations in prices from suburb to suburb that have no reason or commonsense. Everybody understands this. Even the ACCC chairman has acknowledged that something funny is going on. John Howard and the government have had nine long years to come up with a plan to address petrol prices and they have done nothing.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There is also the issue of the condition of our roads and national highways and the impact that has on our vehicles and the use of fuel, and the issue of public transport. There are a whole range of ways that we can address the ongoing crisis of petrol prices in Australiaâsomething that is not going to go away and that sooner or later the government has to take head on. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI am pleased to rise today to celebrate the function that I had in commemoration of Victory in the Pacific Day on 15 August. I was fortunate to have the opportunity to host a function at the newly built Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre. More than 300 people in my electorate attended the two-hour ceremony, during which I had the opportunity to present commemorative medallions to more than 60 World War II veterans, both men and women, to mark the 60th anniversary of Victory in the Pacific Day. That day, 15 August 1945, was a defining moment in history; it was the day that Japan surrendered to allied forces, ending World War II, which had raged for almost six years. Some 60 years later, on 15 August 2005, it was indeed my great honour and pleasure to join Australian service men and women in celebrating this very significant anniversary.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Army, Navy and Air Force cadets ably assisted on the day, and they came from TS Southport, the 222 Squadron and the TSS School Army Cadet Unit, who opened the function with an excellent drill routine and paid their respects to the veterans assembled on the day. This was followed by the Australian national anthem, performed by the Gold Coast brass band. I must pay special tribute to those who fought in World War II and to the acknowledgment of and connection to todayâs military that came from the presence of Lieutenant Colonel Iain Cruickshank, who travelled to the Gold Coast from Brisbane to be the keynote speaker on the day. Lieutenant Colonel Cruickshank, as guest speaker, made an outstanding contribution, assessing then and now the differences between the Army as it had been traditionally and the Army as it is today. Lieutenant Colonel Cruickshank has recently returned from the Middle East, where he was the commanding officer of the 1st Australian Army Training Team in Iraq. He has also seen operational service in South-East Asia, Lebanon and East Timor. He was awarded the Conspicuous Service Cross for the role he played in the SO1 operations during the evacuations of the Solomon Islands in 2000. It was a delight to see the faces of veterans and their families light up during the speech by Lieutenant Colonel Cruickshank as he compared the then and now. It was indeed an excellent moment.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is amazing to consider how far weapons have come over the years and the level of training that is now available to those in the defence forces. It makes what I do worth while just to go that extra mile to say thank you to the ex-service men and women and to have provided this function as a small way to remember the great sacrifices that were made. We can certainly never repay our veterans. I would like to particularly thank all those veterans and their families who came along. I thank the Department of Veteransâ Affairs and I also acknowledge John-Paul Langbroek, the state Liberal member for Surfers Paradise, who was master of ceremonies. The men and women from the generation of World War II paid the ultimate sacrifice in many respects, and to those assembled on the day I think it is important that we say thank you.</para>

<para>âCrime and community safety is a big concern at the local level, and elderly people in particular tell me that they are tired of feeling afraid. We all have the right to feel safe in our homes and to walk through our streets and suburbs without fear. Quality policing is one obvious solution, but more can be done to prevent crime and make communities safer. Some of the most effective strategies can be implemented by local governments. Good urban planning and quick response times to graffiti can make a community feel much safer.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">In the city of Gosnells, in Western Australia, the Safe City Initiative has led to the creation of a series of community safety strategies. The cornerstone of these strategies is the Safe City Urban Design Strategy. Research showed that some perceptions about what were safe areas and what were dangerous areas within a city were not borne out in statistics. People often feel that quiet streets are nice and safe, but areas that are active are safer because of what is called ânatural surveillanceââthat is, the fact that neighbours look out for one another and that, if you go for a walk at night, you know that you will pass other people on the street and you will feel more safe. From these statistics, it has become clear that the challenge is to create an environment in which people feel okay about wandering outside. Level pavements, decent street lighting and open spaces and parks in which people can congregate become more important, not just because these things help to create a better sense of community but also because they help to reduce criminal activity.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As well as fostering significant improvements in urban planning approaches, the initiative has implemented a Safer Seniors program to help elderly residents develop personal safety strategies and to increase their awareness about safety. Likewise, a safety strategy for people with disabilities is being developed. There is a âDob in a Hoonâ campaign to help police apprehend speeding and unsafe drivers, which has also been implemented in South Australia. As well, there is a full-time team of graffiti busters who remove graffiti within 24 hours of being advised it is there. There is research that suggests that such prompt removal is a disincentive to so-called graffiti artists. The main reason for their tagging is so that their peers can see what they have done, so a quick response takes the thrill out of it.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As a result, there have been decreases in recorded crime: residential burglary down by seven per cent, property damage down by 12 per cent and drug offences down by 15 per cent. So the city of Gosnells is a great success story. I can think of several councils in the electorate of Hindmarsh which would be delighted to implement a similar project. Unfortunately, that is where the federal government comes in. Funding to local government in total has dropped substantially as a proportion of Commonwealth taxation revenue. As the city of Gosnells has demonstrated, a huge difference can be made to crime rates by local councils through urban planning, but local government cannot make changes on their own. Support from the federal government is essential if such a program is to be implemented by councils around the country. We need to assist our communities to feel safer, to create better communities where people do not feel afraid to leave their homes. This can only be done with the assistance of local government, state government and federal government. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI rise today to speak in support of people who suffer from diabetes, a serious disease in Australia. Diabetes is a chronic disease, characterised by high blood glucose levels resulting from the body not producing insulin or not using it properly. There are two main types of diabetes. The particular one I want to talk about today, type 1, requires consistent daily treatment. Onset usually occurs in childhood or young adulthood, although it can occur at any stage. The symptoms usually appear abruptly and include excessive thirst and urination, unexplained weight loss, weakness, fatigue and irritability. Diabetes is Australiaâs fastest growing chronic disease and is the seventh highest cause of death in Australia. It has some extreme complicationsâfor example, 3,000 amputations for people with diabetes, most of which were preventable. Some 520,000 Australians have been diagnosed with diabetes but it is estimated that for every person diagnosed there is another person who has it but is unaware. This would mean there are well over one million Australians with diabetes, with some 80,000 South Australians known to have diabetes.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Treatment is needed to prevent some of the bad health outcomes for people who have diabetes. Treatment is a lifelong course of insulin injectionsâevery dayâregular blood glucose level tests, healthy eating and regular physical activity. The injections and tests require a large commitment by sufferers to ensure they access the appropriate kits and the supplies they need. Where those supplies are not commonly available, it takes a large commitment to get them. If we are committed to the health care of people in Australia, we need to make sure that kits are available in appropriately located areas. In the electorate of Wakefield, north of Adelaide, a large number of people suffer from diabetesâfrom Gawler through to the edge of the Barossa Valley, in the Clare Valley, the mid-north in Virginia and Two Wells. Many people use the township of Gawler as a regional services hub. There is sufficient demand there to justify the establishment of an additional diabetes product supply outlet to service people in the outer metropolitan area and the country areas to the north of Adelaide.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I have written to the management of Diabetes SA expressing my support for a subagency in Gawler. I am pleased this week to have tabled in the parliament of Australia a petition in support of a Gawler outlet signed by 2,861 people in the electorate of Wakefield. I call upon Diabetes SA to make a priority locating an outlet in the town of Gawler to serve these people.</para>

<para>âThe Howard governmentâs legislation which seeks to ban the collection of universal student services and amenities fees has galvanised the opposition, which comes from a vast majority of the higher education community and the general public. Students themselves have expressed their strong opposition to this legislation. In their thousands they have demanded that they be permitted to continue to financially support the provision of vital services: counselling, health and welfare, representation and advocacy, sport and recreation, employment, legal assistance, child-care places, clubs and societies, and so the list goes on. Everyone from vice-chancellors, regional communities, business leaders, sporting and arts communities and, of course, members of the coalitionâs backbench want Mr Howard to drop his extreme attack on student services.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Students at the St Patrick campus of the Australian Catholic University decided to test the opinions of their fellow students on this extreme anti student services legislation. A petition was circulated to students and the completed petition was sent to me to table in the House. Unfortunately, the petition does not conform to the required format, so I wanted to take the opportunity to draw attention to it today and to congratulate the students for their efforts. This is a relatively small campus but 900 students signed a petition which contained the request that the government and/or the Senate categorically reject all anti student organisation legislation. The students pointed out:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">... this legislation is not necessary and will significantly detract from the quality of university life. At our own universityâ</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">the Australian Catholic Universityâ</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">we take great pride in providing a caring and supported educational environment.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The petitioners further stressed that these features would âdisappear if you allow this legislation to be ratifiedâ. But the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, and the Howard government have been totally deaf to the determined and united pleas from the higher education sector, and those outside, that this legislation would be extraordinarily damaging to the interests of our universities and our students. The response by the education minister to these pleas has been to remain adamant that he will not budge an inch from the very hardline attitude that he has adopted on this issue. He continues to be uncompromisingly ideological. In the Labor Party we have heard the voices of students and members of the university community. We would make sure that services on our university campuses continue. That is why we will press our amendment in the Senate. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âOn this historic day when the bill for the sale of Telstra has passed from the Senate back to our House, I am very fortunate to have the opportunity to extend the comments I made on that bill. I referred in my speech to a report from Ericsson on the technologies available, and I would like to expand on that, if I can, in the time allotted to me today. The technology option I was speaking about was dial-up on copper. Dial-up on copper allows 56 kilobits per second, at best, if within two to four kilometres of the exchange. But often this is much less in rural areas, so you get something like 2.4 kilobits per second on long lines or lines with pair gains. This type of technology is sensitive to interference from electronic fences et cetera. It is basically used for low-speed internet only.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Satellite technology shares approximately 40 megabits per second across all national users. Satellite technology has capacity problems. It is incredibly expensive. You have to put the pieces in place and get a bandwidthâand you pay for that. The fewer customers you have, the more expensive it is. Also, the more users you have, the more downgrading you get in capacity. It provides up to 800 kilobits per second to the subscriber and up to 128 kilobits per second from the subscriber. It is basically for fast internet use only. Satellite technology has some high latency in telephony because, let us face it, it has to go fair up into the sky and back again. Those latency issues are not going to be removed, and it is expensive even though subsidised for remote and some rural services.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The WiMax 802 or wireless technology shares approximately 50 to 75 megabits across a cell of seven to eight kilometres, which is one to two megabits per second per subscriber. It can be used for fast internet only and not for large-scale telephony. No large-scale video is possible. It is equivalent in cost and price to ADSL. The mobile wireless or 2G networks on the GSM network provide seven megabits per second and use a PC card. They will be coming out next year. They provide high-speed internet connection, and some video applications are available. It is very expensive due to the mobile-centric nature of that technology.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The same applies to the 3G networks. This is scheduled for release in 2015 or after. It has the potential to deliver up 100 megabits per second, which is where I think we want to be, but that will be available after 2015. Sharing is necessary. The prime application is for mobility and it is very expensive for fixed line operations. Regarding ADSL on copper, at three kilometres from the exchange you can get approximately six megabits to the subscriber and 1.3 from the subscriber. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

Surprisingly, in this case I am not referring to the bungled attempt to implement the Welfare to Work program that is more aptly described as the welfare to lower welfare program. I am concerned about the impact that the governmentâs industrial relations agenda may have on pensioners. Some members may wonder why I would be concerned for the future income security of the most vulnerable in our society when considered through the prism of the industrial relations changes. They may wonder what impact slashing wages and working conditions will have on people receiving age, single parent, disability support, war widows and service pensions.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Those among us who are not so out of touch with our constituents will know exactly how the governmentâs industrial relations obsession may well affect pensioners. Many pensions and other social security payments are benchmarked to 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. This means that movements in the wages of working Australians flow on to pensions. This, of course, means that the wage impact of the industrial relations changes will also flow on to pensioners. Government members opposite may scoff at this suggestion and claim that it could not possibly be the case, but they would be wrong on this occasion. Over recent years Australian pension recipients have experienced increases in their pensions at rates higher than the growth of inflation because of real wage growth. Sadly, it is not to the full extent of the much claimed but largely unproven 14 per cent increase that the Prime Minister crows aboutâbut, then again, very few of us have experienced such growth.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Future increases in payments to 40,000 pensioners in the south-west of Sydney are at risk because of the governmentâs extreme industrial relations agenda. More than 22,000 of those live in my electorate. I know this government cares little about the plight of Australian workers and Australian families, but I would have thought it would be willing to leave the poor and the elderly alone. The governmentâs extreme, unnecessary and unfair industrial relations agenda has managed to produce another set of victims. It is not enough that the government has unionists, building and construction workers and university staff in its sights; now, in a nasty side effect of its so-called reforms, those least able to afford it will also face real cuts to their incomes. While elderly and retired Australians are concerned for the working conditions of their children and grandchildren, they should now start worrying about their own financial futures. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI rise today with a hint of sadness and regret. After I left my home the other morning to drive to Wonthaggi to meet the Leongatha pea growers, I proceeded along the South Gippsland Highway to an area where my family have recreated for nearly all of our generations, on the beaches and surrounds of South Gippsland. This is the most pristine area of the state, where it has always been my great pleasure to drive out of the turn at Anderson on the way to Phillip Island and be gobsmacked and breathless at the vista that stretches towards Cape Paterson and Wonthaggi and down into South Gippsland.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">But the other morning my heart was broken and dulled when I went over the rise in the car and there before me was that magnificent vista and smack in the middle of it were seven ugly, criminal wind turbines. They have destroyed that vista of coastline for at least the next 25 years. These seven unproductive wind turbines were put right on the coast by the vandalism of the Bracks government. They have stolen this pristine area of Gippsland, raping the landscape and denying generations of the future the beauty and benefit that I have had. The Bracks government have vandalised the South Gippsland coast, and I will do everything in my power to stop any further wind turbines going into that area of South Gippsland.</para>

<para pgwide="yes">That this bill be now read a second time.</para>
</motion>
<para pgwide="yes">The purpose of the <inline ref="S478">Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005</inline> is to make a number of minor amendments to four pieces of Defence portfolio legislation: the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982, the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991, the Defence Act 1903 and the Naval Defence Act 1910.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Defence Force Discipline Act 1982, the DFDA, is amended to redefine which laws form âterritory offencesâ under that act as a result of changes in the criminal law of the Australian Capital Territory. These amendments are considered essential to ensure that this act continues to reflect the range of offences originally intended for its operation. The scope of these offences has been severely limited in recent times by changes to the laws that are referred to in the act.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The DFDA imports civil criminal offences into that act as service offences in order to extend the ambit of the act to circumstances that might otherwise not be prosecuted and to give greater efficacy to disciplinary law. The mechanism currently used to achieve this is the incorporation of the laws of the Commonwealth, the ACT Crimes Act 1900 and the ACT Police Offences Act 1930 as they apply in the Jervis Bay Territory.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Since the introduction of the territory offence provisions, changes have occurred to the incorporated legislation such that some updating of the DFDA is essential. Most concerning is that the ACT in 2001 and 2002 enacted Criminal Code legislation based on the Commonwealth Model Criminal Code, and since 2002 it has repealed numerous offences from its Crimes Act in favour of the Criminal Code. The net effect of this is that offences such as computer theft, arson and blackmail can no longer be prosecuted by the Australian Defence Force under the DFDA. Furthermore, it is anticipated that offences such as murder, manslaughter and assault will also move to the Criminal Code by the end of 2005. Also of concern is the fact that the Police Offences Act was repealed in 1996, and references to it are therefore ineffective. The proposed bill will remove redundant legislation references and refer instead to the criminal law in force in the Jervis Bay Territory from time to time.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991, known as the benefits act, is to be amended to repeal part 8 so as to remove the retention benefit currently available for certain Australian Defence Force members of the benefits scheme.Â </para>
<para pgwide="yes">Part 8 of the benefits act currently provides a bonus of one yearâs salary to eligible members of the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme who, on reaching 15 years of continuous effective service, agree to complete a further five years service. The Review of Australian Defence Force Remuneration 2001, the Nunn review, considered that issues of attraction to, and retention in, the services would be better suited for determination by the Navy, Army and Air Force service chiefs based on priority needs and linked to capability. An automatic retention bonus rigidly tied up to a number of years of service, at a fixed rate, is no longer regarded as appropriate.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Despite the repeal of part 8 of the benefits act, it is proposed that access to the retention benefit would continue for current members for as long as they remain eligible but would not be available to new members joining the ADF after the date of the commencement of the proposed amendments.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">These amendments are required to ensure that ADF pay arrangements provide an effective, efficient and flexible remuneration framework that is consistent with reforms in the wider public and private sectors.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Thirdly, the Defence Act 1903 is amended to change references from âinvestigating officersâ to âinquiry officersâ to make it clear that these officers are conducting purely administrative rather than criminal investigations. This amendment is an administrative amendment that is required to improve administration of military justice.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The term âinvestigating officerâ appears in both the Defence Act and the DFDA, but has different meanings in each act. The role of an investigating officer as referred to in the Defence Act is to conduct an administrative inquiry into matters affecting the ADF. However, some ADF members believe that officers are conducting criminal investigations because of the use of the words âinvestigating officersâ. To remove this confusion, it is considered appropriate to change references in the Defence Act from âinvestigating officersâ to âinquiry officersâ to make it clear that these officers are conducting purely administrative investigations.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The fourth act to be amended by this bill, the Naval Defence Act 1910, is amended to align the legislation governing eligible ages of Navy cadets with the legislation governing their Army and Air Force counterparts. The alignment of the various laws dealing with ADF cadets to provide more consistency between the respective services is long overdue. The amendment to the Naval Defence Act will provide a uniform maximum entry age of 20 years for acceptance into the ADF cadets and will provide for a person to cease being a cadet at the age of 21 years or such lower age as is prescribed under the regulations.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Finally, this bill also contains provisions amending various Defence administrative legislation resulting from the commencement of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 and the Legislative Instruments (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 2003. These are technical housekeeping amendments to remove redundant references to the Statutory Rules Publication Act 1903 and repealed provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act 1900. These amendments do not in any way affect the operation of the Defence legislation referred to in the bill. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</para>

</talker>
<para>âThe opposition supports the <inline ref="R2419">Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005</inline>. The bill makes a number of amendments to Defence legislation, principally dealing with personnel matters, as outlined by the Minister for Veteransâ Affairs. I will not detail the key amendments, but I will note them for the purpose of argument. First, an amendment is proposed to the Defence Force Discipline Act to update its provisions for the inclusion of amendments to the ACT Criminal Code. Second, an amendment is proposed to bring the age limits of Naval cadets, as set out in the Naval Defence Act, into line with those for the Army and the Air Force. Third, it makes some minor technical changes to the terminology of investigating officers and to references to remove some redundant provisions in respect of legislative instruments legislation. Fourth, it removes the current superannuation retention bonus for those who opt to sign up for another five years after 15 years of service. In large part, these are relatively non-controversial matters, but they have implications for current policy, and that is the issue that I will focus on primarily. The policies most relevant are those concerning military justice, recruitment and retention. Today I want to make some detailed references to those issues.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The first amendment, for all intents and purposes, is simply intended to keep the Defence Force Discipline Act up to date. Because the act imports provisions from the ACT Criminal Code for disciplinary purposes, it obviously must be updated in the light of those changes to that Criminal Code. At present, it is clear that it has fallen behind and has been inadequate in many respects. To the extent that this amendment brings the Defence Force Discipline Act into line and makes it consistent, we support the amendment. However, we believe there is an important point to make. To some extent, the amendment assumes that the status quo, with respect to the Defence Force Discipline Act, will remain unchangedâthat is, that breaches of defence discipline and criminal law will continue to be both investigated and prosecuted by ADF authorities.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">However, the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee, in its report on military justiceâwhich was delivered approximately three months agoâstrongly recommended that this arrangement be changed. The committee recommended that, other than at times during deployment, all responsibility for breaches of civilian and criminal law within Australia be investigated and prosecuted by civilian police, not by defence police. However, we recognise that the incorporation of the Criminal Code of the ACT into the Defence Force Discipline Act for disciplinary purposes overseas is necessary. In those cases, these provisions of the Criminal Code become the main authority for prosecuting offences. If the government accepts the recommendation of the Senate committee, however, there may be implications for the way in which the Defence Force Discipline Act provides for non-defence criminal offences. But, until the government responds to the committeeâs recommendations, we will not know whether those changes will be necessary. In those cases, the incorporation of the provisions of the ACT Criminal Code will, nonetheless, be important. To that extent, we regard this amendment as a housekeeping matter and necessary for the status quo. But it may, as we repeat, require fresh examination after the government announces its response to the Senate committee report.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">While on this subject, we believe it is worth reiterating some of the committeeâs recommendations. The committee recommended that the management of defence disciplinary matters be separated from the investigation and prosecution of criminal matters. Essentially, it is an issue of expertise and efficiency. One of the greatest criticisms made in the committeeâs reportâwhich was a bipartisan reportâwas the poor standard of investigation of criminal offences by defence authorities. This was seen as a matter resulting from low levels of skill and expertise in terms of the qualifications and experience of those people entrusted with the responsibility.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The committee considered that, given the low frequency of such offences, it was difficult to develop and retain the requisite investigatory skills within the Australian Defence Force. In a world of rapidly-increasing specialisation and outsourcing, where appropriate, to centres of excellence, the committee was of the view that a better job could be done by civil police. That, by the way, is not proposed to absolve ADF members from defence discipline in any way. It simply seeks to bring greater expertise and efficiency to the process. It seeks to have defence disciplinary management confined to breaches of defence discipline which are most relevant on a daily basis to the activities of the Defence Force.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">That was the unanimous view of the committee. It is a clear separation of function and in effect is no different to the operation of any other part of civil law affecting ADF personnel as private citizens in terms of any laws they may breach when not on active duty. If eventually the commission of a crime is proven, then of course Defence has a clear prerogative to consider that offence and behaviour in the light of its own standards, as may be reflected in internal defence disciplinary measures, but that is a separate issue to the enforcement of criminal law. We certainly hope that the government gives this recommendation very careful consideration. Should it agree with the committee, then of course we will need to re-examine the relevance of this particular amendment that we are dealing with today.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Turning to the second amendment, consistency of age provisions for cadets across Army, Navy and Air Force is sensible. That is practical housekeeping. I do want to mention a related matter, however, that was also referred to by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee in its report on military justice. It concerns the duty of care owed to cadets, many of whom are minors and are away from their homes in circumstances where cadet instructors and staff, we would expect, have special responsibilities. The particular case highlighted by the committee was the tragic suicide of Air Cadet Eleanore Tibble. But for the failure of proper process, she might still be alive today. The saddest things about this case are the well-worn causes of inadequate guidelines and instruction manuals, lack of familiarity, poor training and inadequate codes of conduct. Too often the response made to those shortcomings is that the procedures have been reviewed and rewritten. Too often the bureaucratic response is to close the file in the hope and, in some cases, expectation that the issue will simply fade away.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We see that response can have tragic consequences. At the heart of these matters there is only one issue: the fulfilment of a duty of care, particularly to those who are younger and less experienced in both life skills and military skills. It is about the duty of care to everyone, not just cadets. If they are minors, the duty of care is even more onerous and hence the committeeâs great concern, as noted in its report. Remedying these concerns cannot simply be achieved by introducing manuals and processes. Real changes come from driving a change in attitude and culture within the Defence Force. I note that there are determined efforts within the Defence Force itself, but again they have to be reflected in appropriate legislative or structural change which fairly and squarely brings the responsibility to the desk of the relevant government ministers entrusted with that responsibility.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In 2004 alarming levels of soldier dissatisfaction were detailed in the Defence attitude survey. These concerns cannot be ignored. This specially prepared study demonstrated that almost one in three military personnel, as surveyed, wanted to quit; more than half of the soldiers asked said that the Army suffers from inadequate resources; and well over two-thirds of ADF personnel felt military values and standards had declined. I therefore urge the government to respond in full to the committeeâs recommendations for the institution of better processes for added resources and to drive a cultural change. Until the special duty of care for minors, in particular, is fully heeded and the culture of care is properly instilled, more tragedies like that involving Eleanore Tibble are inevitable.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Finally, I wish to address other key amendments concerning the retention bonus. This bonus was introduced in 1991. It provided for one yearâs salary to those members of the ADF who switched to the MSBS and who, after 15 years service, opted for a further five years. It was only available to medically fit officers above the rank of major and for other ranks above the rank of sergeant. It was initiated at the time that the DFRDB superannuation scheme was terminated. It was provided only to those who transferred to the new scheme. The point was to encourage longer serving experienced personnel to stay on and resist the temptation to leave for financial reasons. The DFRDB scheme, with its pension and part commutation to a lump sum, was an attractive option in those circumstances. The DFRDB had an immediate pension entitlement after 20 years of service, with an option of commutation of part of that to a lump sum. The bonus then was conditional on transferring to the MSBS. As such, it must be honoured for the small number who remain in service and have not yet exercised their option. To remove it would be unfair, and we agree with the approach taken by the government. That is why this amendment, in effect, grandfathers the bonus for all personnel currently serving, which we recognise is appropriate. It is therefore not to become redundant for some time to come.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The review of Australian Defence Force remuneration in 2001 by the Nunn inquiry considered this bonus in some detail. Nunn noted that there were several problems with the bonus. Firstly, during downsizing exercises retention bonuses encouraging people to stay for five years contradicted offers of redundancy. Some who re-signed got the bonus and were then offered a redundancy package; others were not made an offer because they have been paid the retention bonus. Additionally, retention policy began to focus on keeping particular skills rather than on general application. The bonus contradicted that policy as well. For those who undertook a return of service obligation this was not served concurrently but rather at the end of the five-year retention period. Naturally, all this produced friction, inconsistency and great dissatisfaction. More importantly, it interfered with targeted retention and the flexible management of skillâthe latter varying widely across services. The one-size-fits-all approach in the MSBS retention bonus proved to be quite counterproductive to those measures which I have outlined, though we recognise it did perhaps have a legitimate purpose at its heart.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This brings me to the policy on the issue of retention more generally. The particular provisions, though historical, have proven problematic for the reasons I have outlined but this is not to say that in the future retention bonuses might not be relevant as a tool in retaining skills. Having serving full-time personnel, on leaving the service, enlisting with the reserves is also something that legitimately requires consideration. Perhaps bonuses could be more related to the labour market circumstances of the time and not treated as an ongoing condition of service. Clearly, greater flexibility is required and we therefore support the amendment. But at the same time we encourage continued attention to employment and retention incentives where there are serious shortfalls which affect the effectiveness of the ADF.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This is not a new problemârecruitment and retention really are the sleeping giants of the defence forcesâ âfuture issues to confrontâ, and indeed to our ability to keep our technological and skills advantage as a regional power. This has been acknowledged not only by the opposition but by members of Defence and several independent sources. On 11 March this year the immediate past Chief of the Defence Force, General Peter Cosgrove, acknowledged the extent of the skills crisis in the ADF when he told a parliamentary committee: âI think we share Australiaâs issue with people getting into trades; we have to get them in the door.â General Cosgrove tabled a document at the hearing that listed several key areas where Defence was particularly deficient. These included engineers, surveyors and tradesmen among others.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The skills crisis in Australia is not only an important economic issue under this governmentâs watch; it has becomeâis increasingly becomingâa serious national security issue. Independent experts have also highlighted the extent of the problem. In their cost of defence post budget report for 2005, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute said, âDespite spending $500 million over five years on initiatives to improve the recruitment and retention of military personnel, the process of building up the size of the ADF has stalled.â Defence cannot recruit as many people as they needâless than 85 per cent of their recruitment targets have been reached in the last six years. In a nutshell, the government has to make careers in the ADF more attractive.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I note that the minister, who spoke previously in the Main Committee, has been undertaking some work on this. All we can say is that we have to have an open mind on those measures which will achieve that outcome. Certainly on this side of the chamber we are prepared to support practical measures that support the recruitment and retention of Australians. We believe our Australian Defence Force should be made up of Australians and not foreign soldiers. However, we are sceptical of bandaid fixes and measures which fail to address intrinsic problems. We particularly want the terrible image of the failed military justice system to be fixed. We think that is fundamental to recruitment, not only from the point of view of the desire of competent young people to enter the defence forces but also, quite clearly, to the preparedness of their families to encourage them into what otherwise can be a very satisfying, fulfilling and obviously worthwhile career. Until the government addresses these problems young people will think twice, as will their parents, about a career in the military.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The minister has promised to respond to the committeeâs report by 16 September. We very much look forward to a positive response accepting all the committeeâs recommendations. We believe this is fundamentally a test of leadership at government level. It is also a real test of how serious the government is about having the ADF turn over a new leaf and get serious about its people and the role it can play not only in protecting the nation but as an instrument for developing the young people of Australia. We fully support the bill.</para>

<para>âThe purpose of the <inline ref="R2419">Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005</inline> is to make some minor amendments to four pieces of Defence portfolio legislation. Before speaking about these minor amendments, I would like to take the opportunity to recognise the contribution made to our country by our Defence Force personnelâboth those who have served and those who are still serving. I have the honour of representing many ex-service men and women in my electorate of Fairfax, and I am proud of the way that many of these men and women continue the tradition of service by working for their community not just through the local RSL clubs but also through a multitude of community organisations.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Yes, our defence personnel are there to protect Australia, but they do so much more than that. They have undertaken very dangerous peace-keeping duties in recent years in places like East Timor, the Sudan, Afghanistan, Bougainville and the Solomon Islands. They provide search and rescue missions such as the one a few weeks ago when the RAAF rescued stricken sailors in the Great Australian Bight. They provide emergency relief, within hours, in times of calamity such as the medical evacuations after the Bali bombings and the incredible assistance rendered in Banda Aceh after the tsunami. We currently have around 1,500 Australian Defence Force personnel deployed on operations around the world.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As the Minister for Defence said in his foreword to the booklet <inline font-style="italic">Winning in Peace, Winning in War</inline>, the rise of terrorism and regional stresses in the last few years has meant that our military forces have had to deal with difficult and complex missions in circumstances and locations previously not considered likely. They are able to mount complex operations, in the face of grave risk, with just a few hours notice. In fighting, in humanitarian assistance and in support of our regional neighbours, the ADF have shown themselves to be a force for good, showing the world the enduring character and spirit of the Australian people.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This bill, as I said at the beginning, makes minor amendments to four pieces of Defence portfolio legislation. The first of these is the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982, or DFDA, which is amended to redefine which laws form âterritory offencesâ under the act. These amendments are necessary because of changes to the criminal law of the ACT and the need to ensure that this act continues to reflect the range of offences originally intended for its operation. The Defence Force Discipline Act imports civil criminal offences into that act both to cover circumstances where they might not otherwise be prosecuted and to give greater efficacy to disciplinary law. We are talking here about offences such as computer theft, arson and blackmail. Because of the recent criminal law changes in the Australian Capital Territory, certain legislative references in the DFDA have become inaccurate. The amendments in this bill will remove those redundant legislation references and refer instead to the criminal law in force in the Jervis Bay territory from time to time. In summary, the amendments do not change offences under the act but only amend references to other legislation in the wording of the act.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The second act to be amended is the Defence Act 1903. The term âinvestigating officersâ appears in both the Defence Act and the Defence Force Discipline Act, but it has different meanings in each act. The amendment in this bill is to change references in the Defence Act from âinvestigating officersâ to âinquiry officersâ, to make it clear that these officers are conducting purely administrative investigations, not criminal investigations. Once again, the amendment does not change the focus or meaning of the act in any way. It simply redefines a term to avoid confusion.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The third schedule of the bill amends the Naval Defence Act 1910 to align the eligible ages of Navy cadets with those already existing for their Army and Air Force counterparts. This means there will be a uniform maximum entry age of 20 years for all cadetsâArmy, Navy and Air Forceâas well as a uniform maximum age when a young person must cease being a cadet. That maximum age will be â21 years or such lower age as is prescribedâ. Cadets is a Defence sponsored, community based organisation currently involving some 25,000 young people and 2,500 volunteer adults throughout Australia. Air Vice Marshal David Dunlop describes it as a youth development program delivered in a military context. In my electorate of Fairfax we are fortunate to have Army cadets at Yandina, Air Force cadets at Nambour and Navy cadets at Cooroy.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The fourth schedule of this bill amends the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991, removing the automatic retention benefit currently available for certain Defence Force personnel. Currently the act provides a bonus of one yearâs salary to eligible members of the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme who, after 15 years of service, sign on for a further five years. The review of Australian Defence Force remuneration in 2001âthe Nunn reviewâfound that the issue of retention would be much better dealt with by the service chiefs, allowing them the flexibility to base incentives on priority needs and linking them to capability, rather than an automatic retention bonus for all, tied to a particular number of years of service. I stress that this change will not affect existing membersâonly future members. Access to retention benefits will continue for current members for as long as they remain eligible but will not be available to new members joining the ADF after the commencement date of this amendment.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The last schedule of this bill simply contains a number of minor technical amendments relating to legislative references in Defence legislation. These changes were made necessary by technical amendments to acts, such as the Legislative Instruments Act 2003, and do not in any way affect the operation of the subject Defence legislation. I commend the bill to the House.</para>

However, I think it is important to point out that, while we support the bill, like many sections of the community, including sections of the defence community, we are becoming rather frustrated by the inordinately long period of time being taken by the government before it responds to what is considered to be a very good report of the recent Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee inquiry into the effectiveness of Australiaâs military justice system.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">In saying that, I also point out that this is not the only report that has come down in the time of the current governmentâindeed there have been a number. I think the Senate report, although probably one of the most far-reaching reports, is one of about seven. For instance, we have had the 2002-03 Western Australian Coronerâs investigation of the HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Westralia</inline> fire; the 2001 Burchett QC inquiry into military justice in the Australian Defence Force; the 2001 Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Rough Justice?</inline> <inline font-style="italic">An investigation into allegations of brutality in the Armyâs Parachute Battalion</inline>; the 1999 Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade military justice procedures in the ADF inquiry; the 1998 Commonwealth Ombudsmanâs own motion investigation into how the ADF responds to allegations of serious incidents and offences; and the 1997 Abadee study into the judicial system under the Defence Force Discipline Act, which Justice Abadee began in 1995. All of these inquiries were outlined in that Senate report.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In my view, this is an important report, one that the government should not be delaying its response to. I understand that these are difficult, complex and complicated issues. Nonetheless, they are important issuesâindeed crucial issuesânot just to the wellbeing of members of the ADF. It is also important that they be addressed so that the mums and dads of Australia who are giving consideration, with their sons and daughters, to a career in the ADF are given some comfort, encouragement and certainty that these crucial issues which the ADF and the government must address are indeed being addressed. I have no doubt that mums and dads do consider these issues before they encourage their children into the ADF. I think that, until these issues are dealt with, we will continue to see problems with recruitment and retention.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We know that these are not the only reasons that there are problems confronting the ADF and its recruitment and retention issues, but they are important ones. Some of the issues that this Senate inquiry referred toâand I intend to go through some of themâwere the inordinate delay in investigations of alleged offences, in some cases investigations having gone on for several years; poor quality investigation of alleged offences such as the inappropriate questioning of civilian family members; failure to check easily obtainable exploratory evidence; failure to liaise closely with civilian agencies; a lack of independence in the investigation of alleged offences; failure to obtain and/or act on Australian Federal Police and DPP advice; a lack of independence in the decision to prosecute; poor quality prosecution of alleged offences; inordinate delay in the decision to prosecute; inordinate delay in the trial process; lack of independence in the trial process; lack of impartiality in the trial process; and inordinate delay in the review of trial processes.</para>

We see a bill which just tinkers at the edges of what is, as I have already described, a difficult, complex and complicated issue which the government must deal with.

<para>âMr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. With all respect to the member for Cowan, this is a housekeeping bill which deals with some technical aspects on uniformity of age in relation to naval recruits. It deals with civil and criminal definitions of legal offences and it deals with a particular retention issue on reaching 15 years of service. It has nothing to do with military justice.</para>

<para>âAfter the first point of order I think the member for Cowan came directly to the point of the bill. The parliamentary secretaryâs view is that his speech is too wide in terms of a housekeeping bill. The member for Cowan canvassed issues, given that it does deal with some criminal justice matters. The precedent in the House, and certainly in the Main Committee, is that where there has been a great deal of debateâas there probably has been on this bill, given the shadow minister has had discussions on a range of defence mattersâwe would generally have a broader debate. If the member for Cowan cast too wide a net in regard to that, you could seek to bring him to order. At the moment I adjudge that he is in order. I am sure he will take into account your admonition. I think he has made a case as to why he is driving for a wider discussion in this debate.</para>

<para>âI thank the chair for its reasoned, balanced and wise ruling. I have just about concluded my speech. The points I wanted to raise in relation to Defence Force discipline are dealt with quite clearly in this bill. Before I move off the subject, I refer to paragraph 21, under the heading âDisciplinary actionââthe matter being dealt with in this billâin the executive summary of the report on the inquiry into the effectiveness of Australiaâs military justice system. Paragraph 21 reads:</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">These submissions and others, described extraordinary delays in the investigation of alleged offences, the failure of investigators to pursue exculpatory evidence, the failure of investigators to disclose relevant material to the accused, the failure of investigators and commanders to advise the accused of allegations at the appropriation time, the failure of investigators and prosecutors (legal officers) to obtain and/or act on specialist advice, the failure of prosecutors (legal officers) to adequately weigh and assess witnesses evidence. The committee is satisfied that these problems did in fact plague some investigationsâthis point admitted to by Defence in key instancesâand the problems are so severe as to constitute systemic failures.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The point I am making in relation to this bill is that it does not go far enough. If we have systemic failures in the Defence Force Discipline Act and in its practical application, then we need a response from the government so that this bill can be built on and we can get to the nub, the core, of the issues that need to be dealt with.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The bill also makes some amendment to the proposed age limits of Navy cadets, as set out in the Naval Defence Act, to bring them into line with those for Army and Air Force cadets. I believe that the ADF has a duty of care and, once again, the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee referred to the issue of cadets. I do not intend to go into all of the detail of the particular case that it dealt with, but recommendation 38 of the committeeâs report, which was a bipartisan report, says:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">To ensure that the further development and implementation of measures designed to improve the care and control and rights of minors in the cadets are consistent with the highest standards, the committee suggests that the ADF commission an expert in the human rights of children to monitor and advise the ADF on its training and education programs dealing with cadets.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">It may well be that the amendment in the <inline ref="S478">Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005</inline> is the start of the ADF and the government addressing the recommendations in this report and some of the important issues that need to be addressed. But duty of care goes beyond just cadets. Duty of care is owed to every member of the ADF. Until we get the matter of discipline right within the ADF, I think we will continue to have retention and recruitment problems.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Mr Deputy Speaker Hatton, I know that in your capacity as the Deputy Chair of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade you take a great deal of interest in matters dealing with Defence and that you, like me and other members on this side, are a very strong supporter of our young men and women in the ADF. We want to see these matters addressed. We want to see our members of the ADF given proper support and a proper framework within which they can carry out their very crucial and important day-to-day tasking operations both in Australia and overseas. Until we deal with the real issues confronting military justice, we are not doing them justice or giving them the sort of support that a proper, caring and committed government would be giving to our members of the Australian Defence Force. As I said earlier, the opposition support this bill, but we look forward to the very overdue response from the government which addresses the real matters that this bill should be going to.</para>

<para pgwide="yes">The Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 will be amended to redefine territory offences under the act as a result of the changes in the criminal law of the ACT. These amendments are necessary to ensure that this act continues to reflect a range of offences originally intended for its operation. The scope of these offences has been severely limited in recent times by changes to laws that are cross-referenced in the act. It is essential that the ADF retain the ability to prosecute a full range of criminal offences, and without this amendment to the definition of territory offences this would not be possible.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The ability to prosecute criminal offences acts as both a sword, by ensuring compliance within the minimum standards of behaviour of soldiers when appropriate, and a shield, by ensuring that criminal behaviour is tried in a fair and transparent system when our soldiers are in operations in countries where criminal justice systems may not meet the standards acceptable to the Australian public. The amendments to the definition of âterritory offenceâ are not as a result of or in any way inconsistent with the military justice inquiry reportânor is it an attempt to expand the current circumstances in which the jurisdiction should be exercised.</para>

<para>âI was going to cover that when summing up my speech, but I am happy to give the member for Shortland an answer now. The member for Barton raised the issue, as did the member for Cowan, of the recently tabled report of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee inquiry into the effectiveness of the Australian military justice system. As advised yesterday by the Minister for Defence, the governmentâs response to this inquiry has been considered by cabinet and the minister is looking forward to shortly providing a very considered response. I hope that satisfies the member for Shortland. I was going to cover it in my summation, but I thank her for her question.</para>
</talk.start>

<para pgwide="yes">Going back to the bill, the repeal of part 8 of the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991 to remove the retention benefit currently available to certain ADF members of the benefit scheme is required to ensure that ADF pay arrangements provide an effective, efficient and flexible remuneration framework consistent with reforms in the wider public and private sectors. Over time the value of retention benefit as an aid to retention has declined, and previous speakersâthe shadow minister and the member for Cowanâhave spoken about retention today. This is a very important measure that will make sure that the main exit points from the ADF after four years and eight to 10 years of service are looked at. There are loss rates at each point, and they vary according to the employment group in question. To be really effective, retention initiatives must now target those specific exit and employment group points. They are not always related to military service and condition; they are also related to demographic and skills issues and career path changes.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We must recognise that, in contrast, the retention bonus targets personnel with 15 years service and those who are likely to continue serving. That is what this measure has done. The current retention bonus is insufficiently targeted and does very little to assist in reducing those separations at critical points of service. Only members who join the ADF, and therefore the Military Superannuation Benefits Scheme, after the date of legislative change will be affected by these changes. Currently the eligible members will continue to have access to the bonuses as they reach the required level of service.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There have been a number of speakers today and they have raised a number of issues, particularly on retention. I am happy to say that the Minister for Veteransâ Affairs is currently engaged in an inquiry looking at retention and recruitment issues. It will be a wide-ranging inquiry. In my position as parliamentary secretary, I am looking at an inquiry into the reserves and what we need to do financially and non-financially to make sure we do not have any further decline in our recruitment in both the regular Defence Force and the reserves.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I want to use this opportunity to highlight a number of initiatives taken to make sure we retain our service men and women. We have improved the level of child care. Recently a contract was signed with ABC Learning Centres to ensure that defence men and women have access to child-care centres. The level of living standards and comfort of DHA housing provided to defence men and women has improved enormously. We have also looked at providing employment for spouses in areas such as Puckapunyal and Townsville, through providing business centres or processing centres where spouses are able to access employmentâand that is a very important issue to help us make sure we retain men and women in the Defence Force. I am looking forward to what both of the reviewsâthe review by the Minister for Veteransâ Affairs into recruitment and retention and the review into the reservesâwill uncover.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">But it would be remiss of me to not talk about other issues that affect the defence forces. Not only are there issues relating to financial and non-financial aspects of their service; we also have issues in the private sector that we need to be aware of. We are currently suffering a worldwide skills shortage. Military men and women are highly trained and highly motivated, they possess great loyalty and they are an absolute bonus in anyoneâs workplace. We will always have the civilian sector very keen to encourage and recruit defence personnel to come into the civilian sector.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There are also demographic changes affecting reserves. Continuous training is provided to members of the Reserve. Typically members have taken four or five weeks annual leave and engaged in all of the training. The tourism industry now tells us that people are taking shorter and more frequent breaks rather than taking their annual leave in one hit, and that impacts on training levels and the continuous training that would normally have been undertaken in the past. So there is a whole pile of demographic things that we really need to consider as well. I know that some of these inquiries will look into the changing nature of work and working families and how that impacts on our defence men and women.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I want to touch on one other measure in particular in this bill. This involves minor amendments to Defence portfolio legislation to clarify terminology and eligible ages for ADF cadets. There has been a lack of uniformity, particularly with naval cadets. The bill now clarifies that; it makes the entry point 20 years of age and the exit point 21 years of age. This is in greater uniformity with Army and Air Force cadets. The shadow minister for defence and the member for Cowan both raised issues about cadets. We have improved cadets in a number of areas, including providing greater screening of officers. One of the recommendations they spoke about was providing professional youth councillors for young people in the cadets. We have already engaged a University of Queensland professor. The professor is working particularly with the cadet directorate on youth suicide type issues and other emotional issues that all young people face whether or not they are in the cadets.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I commend this bill. These measures are very important. They will ensure that we have effectiveness with respect to issues concerning cadets. Reference has been made to the Statutory Rules Publication Act 1903 and the repeal provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act which have resulted from the commencement of the new legislative instruments regime. I thank all of the speakers who have spoken to this legislation, and I thank the opposition for their support.</para>

<para>âI commence my remarks by, first of all, thanking the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for allowing me and my colleague Roger Price to join the committee. Both Mr Price and I were originally involved in an inquiry conducted by the former House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs on child custody arrangements. The report, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Every picture tells a story</inline>, was extremely well received by all groups within our community. There was a great strength of unanimity of the parties as regards the report. I believe it was the wish of the parliament to carry that unanimity into the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">It was important to do that because, whilst the outside players and government institutions may all have their views in this vexed and complicated process, it is the role of members of the House to truly present what they believe to be the views of the Australian community and follow through to ensure that government, the executive and the whole mechanism of government observe the wishes of the Australian people. Mr Price and I were able to help in that regard. We were fortunate in that Mrs Hull, the member for Riverinaâthe chair of the former House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairsâwas also a member of the legal and constitutional affairs committee and the three of us were able to provide continuity in terms of the views of that former committee, which prepared what I think was quite a historic document.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The committee was charged with looking at the proposed legislation to change the Family Law Act. As people will be aware, there are several elements to the issue of family relationships. It is very hard and it is vexed. It is vicious at times and it is heartbreaking at other times to see what people do to each other or what they have to put up with. Sometimes that is not of their own making; sometimes it is through an action of the court or the Child Support Agencyâand there are all the other elements that enter into the complexity of the relationship between two people who are separating.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The committee had to consider the Family Law Act. The role of the Child Support Agency is dealt with differently and will be responded to by the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator the Hon. Kay Patterson. Our job was to look at the legal aspects of the Family Law Act. The Attorney-General, Mr Ruddock, provided us with a copy of the draft proposals in response to the previous report. The government has taken some time to respond. I think most people have been quite critical of that, but at the same time they have understood that this is no easy matter. Changes to the Family Law Act are difficult to devise and implement, and it is critical that we as a parliament do not create stress or hardship or unnecessary discrimination to one side or the other in the process. One thing that clearly came through from this report was that the needs of the children be placed paramount in everything that is done, so the best interests of the child are always to the fore in this report and these proposed changes.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Australia has one of the most interventionist family law acts in the world. There is not another area of administration of which I am aware that offers a court a greater opportunity than Australiaâs Family Court has to interfere with and intervene in the affairs of a separating couple. The British system, which is quite similar to ours, does not encourage the court to intervene in these personal affairs to the degree that the Australian system does. So it was the view of the original committee and of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs that the court should be discouraged from unnecessary intervention and that the couple themselvesâno matter how painful, how difficult and how traumatic it may be for a couple freshly separated, given all of the problems that separation may have created; it does not matter how difficult it has beenâought to be focused on the future of their relationship with their children. After their separationâeven after five, 10 or 20 years timeâthey remain parents, and their responsibilities as parents and the links that parents have with their children need to be maintained. For the sake of the childrenâwhich was a fitting title for the previous reportâit is vital that they are considered prime, and, while the court should stand back somewhat, it should still encourage the disengaging couple to think about their kids. It does not matter what they think of each other. They need to think about their children and what is best for their children. That is the theme, the very ethos, of what we are proposing with these legislative changes. I hope the government picks up the provisions that we have put forward in the list of recommendations.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">One of the key recommendations is:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">... section 65DAA be amended to provide that the court shall, in making parenting orders in situations where there is equally shared parental responsibility, consider whether equal time with both parents is in the best interests of the child and reasonably practicable.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The concept is and the requirements are that parenting orders be established over a period of 13 weeks by the separating couples so that decisions about the childrenâs future as to schooling, religious upbringing and all of the things that are of long-term significance to the children are settled and written down. The resultant parenting order is capable of change. It is not a matter of going back to the court and seeking the courtâs approval to change the parenting order. If both parents agree that the parenting order needs to be changed, they can go back and try to change it, because children grow, their needs change, people move and new parenting arrangements are made in families. Families move on, they are never static, so parenting plans and parenting orders can change.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The parenting plan can often underlie the parenting order. The parenting order is something that the court will implement. The parenting order can be participated in only where there is not violence. Violence removes the person who is violent from the parenting order making process and so from the parenting plan. Where there is equally shared parent responsibility, it is a consideration of the committee that the children should spend, if practical and if possible, equal time with the parents. This is going to be more expensive than a family living together. Most separating couples seem to think that, once separated, they are going to be able to manage just as well as when they were together. That is not true. It is more expensive to be separated. That is not often a calculation that both partners understand.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The committee feels that, where practical, where the parents live geographically close to each other and getting the children to school is not a problem, it is very important that the children spend equal time with both parents. In a practical sense, speaking from a male point of view, I think many men will have difficulty in meeting that requirement, because they need to provide maintenance support for their children and former wife. But they must be given the opportunity to share equal time with their children if that is feasible. As a starting point, it is a reasonable thing. Across the nation, non-custodial parents, whether male or female, were saying, âWe havenât got custody, but we want involvement with our children.â It is not a gender thing at all. Everywhere in Australia, non-custodial parents, whether male or female, spoke exactly the same words and had exactly the same emotional reaction. So we must try and ensure that a parent has the opportunity of sewing themselves into the future of their child and establishing a full relationship with them. That is one of the goals we aim at, and I believe it is possible. With care as a starting point, and not a mandated process, there is every opportunity for us to be successful in changing the Family Law Act so that that is a consideration.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There are complexities in the Family Law Act that we seek to consolidate. The goals and objectives, and a whole range of requirements that need to be considered as people separate, need to be drawn togetherâand we have suggested that. We have proposed technical changes. The obvious sticking point is that Nicola Roxon produced a dissenting report. Representing the Australian Labor Party as shadow Attorney-General, she was caught between challenging the Attorney and being a member of the committee. I do not think we should encourage that in future. It is not conducive to the wellbeing of the committee. So her dissenting report is more a political statement than the statement of a committee member. I see that Duncan Kerr, Roger Price and John Murphy have raised some points. They say in their concluding paragraph:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">In particular, without elevating our concerns to the level of a dissent, we join with Ms Roxon in noting that the committeeâs recommendations, if adopted, will provide increased protection, where disputes arise, for the legitimate interests of those parents who want to share care for their children.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">These were their weasel words of dissent, but there was a general consensus for these changes. We had a lengthy period with the Chief Justice of the Family Court and members of that bench. We also had the opportunity of meeting others in the field, many of whom just want the best for Australian families. We have marked out a way ahead that includes a one-stop shop for people to get advice, encouragement and support. They will be able to get advice on what would happen if they decided to contest a decision. They will make the effort to come together for the sole purpose of planning the childrenâs future and, once that is done, go their separate ways. We want them first of all to think of their children and not of their pet hates and their dislike of each other, which can be so violent at times. We want to safeguard the children.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">One interesting aspect of statistics that has come through is that blood-related parents are seldom aggressive or violent towards their own children; other people in relationships can be. The way in which we assess violence needs care and it needs to be a proven factor, somehow or other. It is very hard across jurisdictions when we go from the Commonwealth Family Court to a state policing system to establish with certainty what has gone on. The process of making a claim of unproven violenceâby hearsay, a subjective comment asserting assault or violenceâneeds to be dealt with in a better way than it is at the moment. Both womenâs and menâs groups who have been spoken to say that there is too much uncertainty. Claims can be made, in fake circumstances, that they are real. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThe report of the Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation, titled <inline font-style="italic">Making it work: inquiry into independent contracting and labour hire arrangements</inline>, was tabled in the House on 17 August 2005. The report is a culmination of a great deal of effort by the Employment, Workplace Relations and WorkforceÂ  Participation Committee. The intention of our inquiry into independent contracting and labour hire is outlined in the terms of reference, but I summarise by saying that we were looking at establishing a clear delineation between employees and independent contractors. Unfortunately, there is an increasingly blurred line between what is, in todayâs society, an employee and what is an independent contractor. There are also considerations around the triangular relationship between labour hire employees, host employers and labour hire agencies. For example, where an employee is working with a person who is not directly employing them, who is responsible for the employeeâs occupational health and safety? It may, in the end, affect the employee when employed by another off-site. We were looking at the way in which that more complex relationship should be manifested and at recommending to the government ways to clarify the relationship between those three parties. Given the growth of independent contractors in the last 15 yearsâparticularly in the last 10 yearsâand the growth of labour hire companies used by employers, it is a very important area of public policy. There are some extraordinary deficiencies in Commonwealth law and even in state law.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">As deputy chair of this committee I embarked on the task with great enthusiasm. The committee works very well. There is good sense and good will amongst the members. The committee is chaired ably by Phil Barresi, the member for Deakin. He chairs the committee well and we have done some productive work in the past on participation in the work force. I look forward to the meetings and there is every attempt by all members to come up with genuine recommendations that we can put to the executive government. Alas, on this occasion there were some significant areas of difference between government and opposition members, but I think there were some very significant matters raised in the dissenting report.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Along with three other members of the committee, I played a role in writing the dissenting report in which we distinguished ourselves from the overall recommendations of the committee. I do not want to emphasise areas of disagreement because I think there was an attempt to reconcile differences wherever possible, but at some point I must mention these matters because they are very important to the Australian Labor Party and federal Labor parliamentarians. They are very important matters that affect the way in which employment operates in this country.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I do not want to be accused of carping but there were some recommendations that were consented to. In fact, the majority of the recommendations were consented to. Some of them were very good and, if embraced by the executive government, they will be useful. Hopefully, those recommendations will clear up some of the mess. There were attempts to gather proper information about how many independent contractors we now have in this country as a proportion of the entire work force. We also attempted to reach agreement on a definition. I did not agree with the majority view that we should use common law and other indicators to define âindependent contractorsâ. My view, and that of three other members of the committee, was that we should start from the basis that we must define âan employeeââand then what is not an employee may well be an independent contractor. We should not start from the basis of defining an independent contractor and work backwards to determine who, as a consequence, would be an employee. With respect, I think that that was a fundamental error in the reasoning of the majority members of the committee. The error may well have arisen because of the philosophical differences that we have in relation to these matters and it may also be a result of other matters that have been at play.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I think it is incumbent upon me to mention the behaviour of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations in this particular matter because he treated the committee with some contempt. I do not say that lightly. I think it is a very grave thing to say about a minister who is charged with the responsibility of overseeing a very important area of national public policyâthat he acted in a contemptuous manner towards a parliamentary committee. I will indicate now why I believe he did so. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations referred this matter to us with terms of reference that we were asked to inquire into. We commenced our inquiry by calling for submissions and then embarked upon a whole range of public hearings to allow those who submitted, and others, to give evidence to us so that we could determine the recommendations we could make to the government.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Not long after that referral was made to us, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations set up his own inquiry, with exactly the same terms of reference, asking almost the same parties to respond to a paper he wrote that was entitled <inline font-style="italic">Independent contracting and labour hire arrangements</inline>. We had concurrently a parliamentary committee commencing an open inquiry, calling for submissions from all interested partiesâfrom the public, organisations and individualsâon the one hand, and, on the other hand, at the same time, the minister operating a closed inquiry responding to what I have to say was a loaded paper with loaded assertions and questions, giving indications, if you like, as to the ministerâs view about particular matters.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">That paper, which received some publicityâindeed, all committee members were very well aware of itâand the behaviour of the minister, in my view, tarnished the process for us. It had an adverse effect upon our processes and, in particular, upon government members of the committee. It is very unusual, and also very unfortunate, for a minister to refer a particular matter to a parliamentary committee in good faith and then at the same time start indicating his views before the committee has had an opportunity to make any recommendation on those matters. That behaviour was contemptuous, in my view. I made my views clear on that at the time, and I do so now because, without the intervention of the minister and the contemptuous behaviour, we may have found more areas of agreement. I say with all genuineness that I believe this committee operates openly and that people collaborate genuinely on these matters. I have to say for the record that that was a very disturbing interventionâintrusion, if you likeâby the minister.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">But there were a number of recommendations that we agreed to. They do not have a lot of teeth, but there are recommendations about collating information so that we can clarify exactly what is going on and some recommendations about improving occupational health and safety matters and ensuring that the labour hire agency and the host employer understand their obligations to employees. There are areas where we agreed. They are not very compelling, and they are not particularly strong recommendations, but, nonetheless, the sincerity with which they were put by all members in the areas in which we consented was important. I am hoping that the government will at least pick up the unanimous recommendations that were put to the minister.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As I said earlier, we differed fundamentally because we believe that you have to start by defining an employee. In listening to the evidence, with all the submissions we had and the witnesses who came before us, we found that there is clearly significant misuse of the term âindependent contractorâ. There is an attempt by some employersâand, by the way, it disadvantages employees and other employersâto disguise employment, to dress the employees up as independent contractors, if you like, so that they can defray, so that they can shift what would normally be employer obligations onto those employees. A classic example is this. On Friday, an employee or a group of employees is working for an employer; on Monday they are told they must have an ABN, they must look after their own superannuation and they must insure themselves for workers compensation, because now they are independent contractors.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I think most committee members know what a genuine independent contractor is. It is a person who understands that they are in the marketplace and they are trading their labour freely with all sorts of other parties. The relationship between an independent contractor and a principal who needs that labour is clearly a genuine thing. You see that with a lot of highly skilled tradespeople, for example, who set up a business. They understand the risks. There is a downside to being an independent contractor because you do not necessarily have the surety of work. You have to find your own work in the economy and you are responsible for superannuation, insuring yourself and indeed other matters that would normally be the responsibility of the employer.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Labor Party has no problem with those people who have the wherewithal and the wit to set themselves up as a contractor. We have no problem with those arrangements. What we do not accept is allowing employers to set up an arrangement where they force their employees to be an employee on Friday and a so-called independent contractor on Monday. We have suggested a series of recommendations to the minister to properly delineate genuine independent contractors from the bogus independent contractor. We have recommended specific methods for the government to delineate clearly who is a genuine contractor and who is not. The government members failed to accept the recommendations and I dare say the minister will treat us with the contempt he has already treated the committee. We also made recommendations in relation to labour hire arrangements. We think there should be a clear responsibility between the host employer and the labour hire agency.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I want to finish by saying specifically that we are very concerned about the proposed independent contractors act. It tries to prevent the Transport Workers Union, which has represented contractors for 80 years, from having the right to represent contractors. It is quite extraordinary when the Australian Football Association and other bodies like that can represent contractors but the employee organisations registered would be prevented from representing their members. That clearly is a deliberate attempt to damage collective bargaining in the workplace. We have recommended specifically that that provision be deleted from the bill before the parliament. There is a whole series of things that have been put forward and I think the government should take them very seriously. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThere is no doubt there has been a quiet revolution taking place in the Australian labour market over the last 15 years and, more particularly, that change has been very evident over the past 10 years. It is estimated that there are more than one million Australiansâand, in fact, that figure could be closer to two million Australiansâworking as independent contractors. In other words, these people are working entirely outside the traditional employment paradigm. Advances and developments of in-home office technology, email, mobile phones, voicemail and a raft of other modern technology mean that Australians can set up microbusinesses that can be run from home or indeed from the back of a car. The office of the past has changed. It no longer needs to be a static stand-alone piece of infrastructure. It is flexible and moveable.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The delivery of services to industry has changed. A more modern, flexible work force is evidence of a changing labour force. These are generational changes that were unthinkable 10 years agoâchanges that see people wanting to manage their own affairs and their own work environments. There is no such thing these days as a permanent job for a lifetime. The number of independent contractors will just continue to grow as technology advances. The work force is on the move.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">But, of course, with the growth of independent contractors the challenges of providing protection for the contractors have also grown. The chair of the Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation, the member for Deakin, recently tabled a report in the House entitled <inline font-style="italic">Making it work: inquiry into independent contracting and labour hire arrangements</inline> and I commend the report to the House. The terms of reference for the inquiry were adopted on 9 December 2004 by the committee. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, the Hon. Kevin Andrews, requested the committee inquire into and report on issues including the status and range of independent contracting and labour hire arrangements, the strategies to ensure independent contract arrangements were legitimate and the role of labour hire arrangements in a modern Australian economy.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It was a challenge, particularly in view of the short period of time for the inquiry to undertake the necessary public hearings and for the report consideration. It was also a challenge in view of the increasing debate that was happeningâand is still ongoingâregarding changes to federal workplace relations legislation and the impact any changes may have on independent contractors. However, the committee met the deadlines and members worked together to achieve what I believe to be a credible report with some important recommendations.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The 16 recommendations included in the report covered areas such as: the occupational health and safety of labour hire workers and independent contractors; the improvement of access to skill development and training for labour hire workers; the establishment of a voluntary code of practice for the labour hire industry; the need to create greater consistency across federal, state and territory legislation in differentiating between independent contractors and employees; the improvement of access to information to outline the rights and responsibilities of independent contractors; the need to regulate independent contractors under commercial law; and the improvement of access to different dispute resolution procedures for independent contractors.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">During the course of the inquiry, the committee investigated whether labour hire and contracting arrangements are in some instances being used to evade responsibilities, particularly in the area of occupational health and safety. Significant concerns were reported to the committee regarding the increased risk of injury for labour hire workers and independent contractors. Some evidence to the committee stated that workplace health and safety of labour hire workers is not as good as that of direct employees. Evidence to the inquiry also indicated there was confusion about responsibilities between labour hire agencies and host businesses. This uncertainty at times meant that either party may not acknowledge OH&amp;S responsibilities.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Occupational health and safety issues were of huge concern to me, and I believe that is reflected by recommendations 6, 7, 8 and 9. These four recommendations clearly spell out some guidelines for responsibilities in this area. It is important, in my view, that labour hire companies and host businesses have a clear set of national guidelines to protect the safety of independent contractors in the workplace. These four recommendations cover such areas as training for workers by labour hire agencies and host businesses, monitoring and enforcing compliance with occupational health and safety regulations, improving the collection of data on injury rates for independent contractors so comparisons can be made against direct employees and the development of initiatives to ensure greater understanding among independent contractors and host businesses of respective responsibilities in relation to occupational health and safety.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This inquiry was difficult and challenging in the first instance because of the need for greater clarity and consistency in distinguishing between an employee and an independent contractor. There were conflicting views on what constituted a contractor, as distinct from an employee. I felt that it was important to clarify the difference. The committee noted in the report that different definitions of âemployeeâ, âindependent contractorâ and âemployerâ in Commonwealth and state jurisdictions have been the subject of longstanding concern. The report notes that differentiating between independent contractors and employees has required the common law to provide guidance. It was also noted that the courts need to use factors rather than a definition to determine employment status. The huge volume of evidence in this area provided substantial detail on many of these matters, and the evidence is summarised in the report. Careful consideration was given to all the evidence in determining what an independent contractor is, and government members recommended that the Australian government maintain the common law approach to determining employment status and distinguishing between employees and legitimate independent contractors.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Overall, as a committee, each of us wanted to ensure that government did not in any way hinder the growth of independent contractors. It was well recognised that a balance between protections and freedoms for independent contractors had to be reached. As more and more Australians set up businesses that see them delivering services to a host of industries as independent contractors, we as legislators must be mindful of not dampening the entrepreneurial spirit. We must put safeguards in place, but those safeguards must not hinder the growth of the independent contractor in this country.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We must recognise and embrace the cultural change that is happening in Australiaâs labour market. This cultural change is in response to a changing global market, the competitiveness of business and the rise of franchising in this country, but more importantly it is a response to the individual who is choosing how he works and for whom he works. This individual is now taking on board responsibility for his working life. He wants the freedom of working for himself, with the choices that allow him to meet his demands and the demands of family responsibilities, hours of work and income needs. This person wants to be independent; this person does not want to work for an employer. In other words, these people have chosen to work as independent contractors because it suits their lifestyle or income preferences.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has indicated that in drafting the independent contractors act, which will be introduced into the parliament later this year, he will actively consider the committeeâs report and its recommendations. The minister has further indicated that this government respects the rights of genuine independent contractors to manage their own affairs and to enter into their own agreements with their clients, if that is their preference. The growth of independent contractors certainly warrants the acknowledgement and support of government. Unfortunately for my opposition colleagues, there are now more independent contractors than there are trade union members in the Australian work force. This is a fact that should be acknowledged. It is a stark fact that shows just how much the Australian work force has changed and where it is moving to. As a government we need to protect the rights of independent contractors to work in the way they want, while ensuring the necessary safeguards are put in place so that they are not hindered in delivering the myriad services to industry that are so crucial to the continued economic growth of this country.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">To all my colleagues on the committee, and I note there are some opposition members of the committee here this morning, my thanks to each and every one of you for the spirited debate during the course of the inquiry. As the chairman of the committee noted in his tabling speech, even though there was dissent along party lines on some of the recommendations, overall there was unified support for the majority of the report, and there was certainly a huge commitment by all to ensure that a useful and informative report was finally tabled in the parliament. I commend the report to the House.</para>

<para>âI am pleased to have the opportunity today to make some brief comments in relation to the report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Making it work: inquiry into independent contracting and labour hire arrangements</inline>, which was tabled in the House very recently. In so doing I open my remarks by first of all putting on the record my thanks to, and my respect for, the committee secretariat attached to this inquiry. I thank each one of them most sincerely for the assistance and guidance they offered to all of us as committee members. I also want to thank all colleagues on the committee, both government and my own colleagues, for the spirit in which the inquiry was conducted. I want to endorse all the comments made by my colleague Brendan OâConnor, the Deputy Chair of the Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation Committee, who spoke earlier this morning. I do not wish to go over his comments again, but I want to endorse particularly his comments in relation to why we agreed on our side of the committee to put in our dissent to some aspects of the report. Members are extremely aware, and I am very aware, that most reports in this place are unanimous. It is does not happen every day that there are dissenting comments, and so they need to be observed as a serious contribution. We believe there are very good reasons for us to have those dissenting comments included. Having endorsed those comments by the deputy chair of the committee I want to talk about one particular aspect of the report this morning. It relates specifically to, in loose terms, the sorts of sham arrangements that can occur in the labour hire industry and to one case in particular.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I wish to highlight this one case for a very clear reason, and the previous speaker, the member for McPherson, just mentioned it. While we are talking about this report there is also a debate going on about changes to industrial relations legislation and the Welfare to Work arrangements. There is an interleaving going on between all of these subjects and a connection with this report. The case in point was brought to my attention by my own community in Canberraâa non-government organisation acting on behalf of a client of theirs. I will read some of the very brief submission that was made to the inquiry by this non-government organisation. In part, the submission states:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I am bringing this case to your attention for your consideration as it demonstrates the vulnerability of people on the Disability Support Pension in the workplace, when there are not sufficient safeguards to protect their rights. There must be many similar cases across Australia where people on the DSP are subjected to these sorts of practices.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Then there is a brief outline of the case. This is also referred to in the report at page 125, paragraph 5.142 and onwards. The case in point concerned a client on DSP for four years who has worked part time as a cleaner since October last year. This person was working 20 hours per week. She rang Centrelink each fortnight and informed them of her income and they adjusted her disability support pension accordingly. The client appears to have a mild intellectual disability. The client was worried about not paying any tax as the employer was not deducting any from her pay.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The NGO rang the cleaning agency involved and was informed that the client was a subcontractor with the agency and that she had agreed to all the terms and had signed a contract. The client, however, said that she remembered signing some paperwork but she was not really sure what it meant, as she is not very good with forms. She was clearly very distressed and worried about possibly losing her job. The NGO subsequently sighted the contract that the client had signed but she had obviously no idea what it meant in relation to her employment. The client says she likes her cleaning job and wants to keep it; she does not understand the implications of being a subcontractor, or know what it even is. She receives a weekly pay packet and does not invoice the agency. They ring her and offer her work each week. She has regular customers that she cleans for. Superannuation, workers compensation insurance, holidays et cetera are all issues that obviously need clarification.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The point here is that this person thought she was workingâand she wasâbut she did not know that she was being employed as a subcontractor with all the implications that brings. It reached the point where she was asking Centrelink to take out the tax. She had to apply for an ABN. She did not even know how to begin to do the paperwork for an ABN, let alone understand the implications of what it meant. The client subsequently brought in the ABN application and, when the NGO officer asked her whether she understood the form at all, she became distressed and said it was all too much for her. At that stage in the proceedings the service involved was working with the client to investigate options for any other work and any issues with regard to the possible tax debt that this person now faces. I am not certain at this stage where that tax debt is up to.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The reason for bringing the matter up is evident. My colleagues on the committee were also very interested in this case. It just shows that when we talk about subcontracting arrangements, employment possibilities and influencing people in a positive way to move from welfare to work, there are many considerations that we must have in mind. It is never quite as simple as many of us would wish it to be. This is not an isolated case. There will have been, will be and will continue to be many instances around the country where people are taken advantage of in circumstances such as this. In my view, there has been an avoidance of obligations on the part of the employerâif we can determine that they are the employer under the arrangements to do with identity and clarification in labour hire circumstances. There has been a move by some people to remove themselves from their obligations in terms of their employer status. People like this woman can get very badly caught up in that.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">She ended up, as I have said, an unfortunate client of the Taxation Office, to whom she had a debt. Heaven knows what other circumstances would have flowed from that. I say to the government, in the most genuine and earnest way, that when we are talking about all these issues to do with people on DSP and maybe some who are notâmaybe some who do not have literacy or numeracy skills or have other circumstances to assist themâthere are very vulnerable folk out there who can fall foul through no fault of their own of all these things we are talking about. Nothing would make me happier than to see as many as possible of those people who find themselves in circumstances where they need disability support pension to exist financially have a more fruitful life out in the community participating along with the rest of us, but we cannot just sit back and assume that they all have the wherewithal to do that and we cannot just sit back and assume that all employers will do the right thing by them. The majority of them will, but there will be a hell of a lot of them who will not.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I am really grateful to the committee and to the chair that we were able to put this example prominently in the report and talk about it at some length. If I have any disappointment, it is in the fact that we have some dissent to recommendation 15 in the report. While our dissent is clearly outlined in our dissenting reportâand it has everything to do with industrial relationsâin paragraph 1.23 of our dissenting report, under âOpposition to Recommendation 15â, we say:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">In the event that the Commonwealth successfully implements a national industrial relations system the Australian Government should first clearly define an âemployeeâ by adopting the definition as outlined earlier in this dissenting report. Further more the Australian government should legislate to prevent forms of disguised employment.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">This case, and others like it, come under this banner fairly well. I strongly suggest to the minister and to the government that when they make changes they seriously consider these sorts of implications.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As I said a moment ago, this is only one instance. I am grateful to the agency for making the submission available to the committee. I have to say very honestly that I do not believe one member of the committee disagreed with the notion that we were in general terms putting forward about circumstances such as this. I know all members on the committee would agree with meâand they did at the timeâthat this is far from a satisfactory arrangement. My fear is just how many others like this are occurring. It is relevant to this report. I am concentrating my remarks purely on this because I think it is so important, and I hope that the remarks that are being made by members opposite on the adoption of the report by the government will allow the government to consider the comments we have made in our dissenting report and why they are there. This is one example that I would like to draw to the governmentâs attention.</para>

<para pgwide="yes">The inquiry brought to light not only a number of issues and a number of challenges in independent contracting and labour hire but also a growth of people wanting this level of independence and choice in their working life, which I support. The report highlights the conditions faced by Australiaâs estimated million-plus independent contractors that find themselves under siege by state legislation and union intimidation in many cases and their being poorly served by any federal legal framework under which they can work.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This is of particular concern when you consider that in Australia today a significant proportion of the work force is engaged in independent contracting. Indeed, it is a growing phenomenon. Independent contracting has become a lifestyle choice for what is, according to the figures provided by Independent Contractors of Australia, around 28 per cent of the countryâs labour force. These million or more hardworking men and women are engaged in running home based businesses, providing specialist advice in a range of fields such as marketing consultants, financial consultants, IT professionals, service providers and as subcontractors to the manufacturing, construction and building sectors. They represent a significant sector of our economy. We cannot ignore their needs and the challenges that face them.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Making it work</inline> that is before you contains a summary of the wide range of views on independent contracting and labour hire arrangements that were expressed to the Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation during the eight days of hearings that were held across Australia and which were contained in more than 70 submissions that were received. During those hearings, we heard evidence that made it clear that people want to have the choice to be independent and benefit from the flexibility that life as an independent contractor will allow. They want to be, in effect, in charge of their own destiny in their working life. They do not want to be employees, they do not want to be tied to a single employer; they want choice, although many of them may work for a single organisation, business or entity for a period of two or three yearsâor more or lessâdepending on what they decide at the time.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">With respect to labour hire, where people work as independent contractors for labour hire companies and are placed in such work environments as aged care, health, health care, hospitality or tourism entities and organisationsâor a range of similar service organisationsâwe see that, in cases where they have the option to switch to being a permanent employee, on almost all occasions they choose to remain as a contractor because of the flexibility it affords in their individual circumstances.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">That is not always the case, although I am informed that on all occasions these people are given the option of becoming employees if they are going into a long-term arrangement with a client of a labour hire company. Independent contractors in many ways epitomise the entrepreneurial spirit of Australia and contribute to Australiaâs prosperity and the vibrancy of the communities in which they operate.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In his speech last week to the Independent Contractors of Australia, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, the Hon. Kevin Andrews, described independent contracting as âone of the most important, yet least commented on, shifts in the history of its labour marketâ. I agree with this assessment, and I think there is evidence in the report to support that sentiment as well. From evidence gleaned by the committee at the hearings, and through briefings from such organisations as Independent Contractors and others, it has become apparent that most trade unions are opposed to the rise of independent contractors and are actively engagedâwith the help of some of the Labor controlled state governments that benefit from donations made by unions to the Labor Party coffersâin activities that are designed to force independent contractors back into traditional industrial relations systems. That is not a welcome development and it needs to be addressed. Fundamentally, the Labor Party and the unions seem unable to grasp the concept of independent contractors, because those contractors have little interest in joining the union movement.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In this regard, I am strongly of the view that independent contracting represents a commercial relationship between the parties involved and under no circumstances should they be considered as requiring regulation under state industrial relations or workplace relations regimes. I am totally opposed to state deeming measures which seek to treat independent contractors as employees and which reduce the independence of those contractors through prescriptive legislation. There is a certain hypocrisy involved when these Labor controlled state governmentsâand the unions that support themâtalk about freedom of association when in fact they are actively seeking to reduce the choice and freedom of individuals to operate as independent contractors, putting them back into the industrial relations environment.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In my home state of Western Australia the state government has been seeking to effectively deem independent contractors through its industrial relations legislation by expanding the definition of what constitutes an employee to include, as examples, outworkers, labour hire workers and contract cleaners.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In Queensland, section 275 of the Queensland Industrial Relations Act 1999 gives the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission the power to declare persons who work under a contract for service to be an employee. Evidence from the ACCI suggested that removing deeming of individual contractors or employers from the Australian system of labour laws and precluding the operation of state deeming provisions should be supported. I support these propositions.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The <inline font-style="italic">Making it work</inline> report tabled 16 recommendations that were supported by the majority of committee members; however, only nine of those were supported by all parties. A further seven minority report recommendations were tabled by the Labor Party members. These alternatives are certainly not supported by the majority of committee members.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is refreshing to see that at least on a number of recommendations there has been cross-party support; however, the differences identified are fundamental and occur in a number of what I believe to be crucial areas. There is certainly cross-party support for recommendations made in relation to statistical data collection, improvements in work safety, achieving consistency in terms of workersâ compensation systems and the development of educational resources.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Sadly, but perhaps predictably, the recommendations made in the report which Labor members have declined to support are the very ones that are crucial to ensuring the flexibility of working arrangements enjoyed by independent contractors. Labor, it seems, because of their Tweedledum and Tweedledee relationship with the unions, want to continue to frustrate the use of independent contractors in order to drag them back into the grasp of rigid state controlled workplace relations systems, with many claims of sham arrangements.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As part of the report, the committee strongly recommended that the Australian government maintain the common law approach to determine employment status and to distinguish between employees and legitimate independent contractors. The common law approach is the commonsense approach and has the overwhelming support of the independent contractors of Australia. The Independent Contractors of Australia describe this approach as the bedrock of Independent Contracting. This is not an opinion shared by Labor. The minority report suggests an alternative approach and trots out, in the words of the ICA:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">... an incoherent shambles that would create massive commercial confusion and effectively dump known and stable commercial legal systems and relationships.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Labor alternative amounts to a tacit banning of independent contracting and labour hire. Remarkably, it also flies in the face of the acceptance by the International Labour Organisation of the legitimacy of independent contracting.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The majority recommendations in the <inline font-style="italic">Making it work</inline> report are designed to ensure that independent contractors can be treated on a commercial basis as small businesses and thereby take advantage of a whole raft of commercial law protections and remedies offered to other enterprises. Unions that attack and deride the role of the independent contractor do so for self-serving purposes.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Conservative estimates put the number of independent contractors at around 1.1 million and growing, while the ICA figures suggest that there may be as many as 1.9 million independent contractors. If that is the case, they now outnumber union membership, which has been on the decline for many years while, in contrast, the independent contractorsâ star has been rising. The union movement, in concert with its Labor Party mates, would love to force union membership upon them. Indeed, Labor controlled state governments have introduced legislation to include specific provisions into their industrial relations laws to enable unions to treat independent contractors as though they were employees.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Independent contractors add enormous value to the Australian economy and their growth is very much an unheralded success story. But that success has meant that independent contractors have become the target of what is predatory action by the unions and Labor controlled state governments that seek to legislate in the industrial relations system where no regulation is sought by either the contractors or their clients.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is my belief that a partyâs freedom to contract must be upheld and that independent contractors need greater certainty in commercial relationships. The majority party recommendations of this report, when taken in concert with the proposed independent contractors act, will ensure that these important tenets are upheld and protected. They will, for example, also prevent unions from seeking orders from the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to impose unreasonable constraintsâconstraints that have no place in todayâs economic realityâon the freedom of Australiaâs independent contractors to work in Australian workplaces.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There is no doubt that labour hire and independent contracting arrangements should continue to develop and grow, providing both flexibility and opportunities for workers and business in the growing and increasingly diverse Australian economy. I commend the report to the House.</para>

<para>âI rise to support the recommendations made in the dissenting report of the Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Making it work: inquiry into independent contracting and labour hire arrangements</inline>. Before doing so, I would like to thank the chair for the very constructive role that he played. It was quite obvious from the start of the inquiry that there would never be agreement on a number of the recommendations. This was recognised by previous speakers, including the member for McPherson. I was disappointed by the contribution by the member for Hasluck because he was not cognisant of, did not give consideration to or did not acknowledge the fact that this was the type of inquiry in which, no matter what happens, you are going to have two different views expressed in the report. That probably goes to the heart of the differences between the two sides of parliament when looking at issues like this. It is important to acknowledge that the chair played a very constructive role and was very mindful of the fact that this was the situation. I would like to thank the deputy chair. He played a very important role in drafting the recommendations in the dissenting report. He worked closely with all the members that supported those recommendations.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Finally, I would also like to thank the committee secretariat for the work that they did and the support that they gave the committee. I would like to refer to the final point that the deputy chair made in his recommendation: that he found it âdisappointing that the secretariat was not sufficiently resourced to assistâ the members that wished to make a dissenting report. All up, I think that as a committee, given the very difficult circumstances, we worked very well together. Those members that did make the effort to attend most of the hearings and inquiries probably learnt a lot about this subject and were able to fully understand the issues from all perspectives. Even those members supporting the body of the report could understand the concerns of the people who did not agree with it and would never support the recommendations outlined in the report.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Before I go to the body of the dissenting report, I would like to place on record a couple of concerns that I have. My first concern is that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations released his discussion paper during the inquiry. He actually pre-empted a lot of the findings of the inquiry. I think he sought to influence to some extent the government members that were involved in that inquiry. It really worries me that the discussion paper was released on the day that the committee was conducting hearings in Sydney. We were most concerned by the fact that the minister had released his discussion paper and there was a feeling that, even if it did not influence the members of the committee, it could create the perception that it would.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The second concern I would like to place on the record relates to the final stages of the inquiry when we had representatives from the department attend hearings here in parliament. I think we are served very well by those people who work in most departments. I have found on all the committee hearings I have been involved in that when staff employed by departments attend they try and answer the questions that are put to them by members of the committee. And members of the committee are also mindful that there are certain questions that the department cannot answer. I was absolutely horrified on the last occasion that the department came to meet with the committee, before we went to the final stages of our deliberations, when one staff member blatantly refused to answer any questions put to him. He hedged, he ducked, he weavedâand not only from questions put to him by opposition members of the committee but also from questions put to him by members of the government. I thought that that was a very sad state of affairs, and I found it very disappointing, because it put a lot of pressure on the other staff member that was there. Really, the point of our meeting with departmental officials is to clarify any points that we may have, particularly at the vital stage just before we go into report deliberations. I feel that it is extremely important for me to put that on the record because that was the first time I had encountered it on any committee that I have been involved in in this parliament or, for that matter, in the New South Wales parliament. I was quite disappointed.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There are a number of dissenting recommendations. Firstly, we do agree with recommendations 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13. The recommendations that we disagree with really go to the core differences between the government and the opposition on this issue. The first recommendation that we oppose is recommendation 2, which goes to the definition of what determines employment and what determines independent contracting. The government supports a common law approach whereas we feel, as set out in the dissenting report, the government should provide a new definition of employee and that this definition should clarify the issues and remove the vagaries so as to create certainty for all the parties involved. I thought that that was an eminently sensible approach to take, but unfortunately that was not the majority decision of the committee.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Next I refer to recommendation 3 and, once again, the opposition members did not support that recommendation. We felt that there was a need to define independent contractor. A number of our recommendations went to the fact that we really believed that it was important to have those definitions in place. Recommendation 4 refers back to that vital need for a definition of employee. It is proposed to place the onus on those who seek to be independent contractors to establish that they are genuinely running a business.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We received a lot of evidence during hearings and through submissions to the committee which showed that that was of great concern to all parties involved in independent contracting or employees. Unfortunately, I feel that this report is not going to address those concerns. I think there will continue to be ambiguity in relation to employees and independent contractors. The common law approach means that people will be forced into situations that could be quite costly. I feel we have let all the parties down.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">One thing that became very apparent during the hearings was the impact that the increased casualisation of the work force was having on many workers in Australia. One of the sessions I found most interesting was in Sydney when we received evidence from labour hire companies. I was very surprised to find that it is not unusual for a person to be employed by a labour hire company and work with the same employer for a number of yearsâthree, four or five years. The one that astounded me was the employee, employed by a labour hire company, who had been working for the one company for seven years. To my way of thinking, that cannot be justified. The labour hire company advised the committee that quite often companies seek to employ people through labour hire because it is better for their bottom line and for their reporting requirements. People employed by labour hire companies do not enjoy the same conditions as other employees. That extends to being able to secure loans and mortgages and this pervades all areas of their life. This area needs to be addressed. Employers should not be able to abrogate their responsibility to their workers simply from the point of view of meeting the requirements of their bottom line.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Another area of great concern in relation to labour hire was occupational health and safety. There was considerable confusion in relation to who bore the responsibility for an injured workerâwhether it was the host company, the labour hire agency or a joint responsibility. I believe this issue needs to be addressed. I have come across numerous examples within my own electorate of where this confusion has been evident, where host employers have sought to abrogate their responsibility to injured workers. Probably one of the worst cases I have heard of is a worker who had a steel rod rammed through their leg. The employer arranged for that person to be driven to the hospital because they did not want to involve the WorkCover Authority. They had a very questionable safety record and, by taking the worker to the hospital in private transport, sought to abrogate their responsibility. We really need to have proper legislation in place, not to have a voluntary code of conduct, but mandatory registration of labour hire companies. Labour hire companies recognise that there is a need for registration but we need to make sure that any change fits in with recommendation 23.Â  That will make for a better, safe working environment for all concerned.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The other issue relates to the TWUâprobably one of the best presentations I have seen to any committee in this parliament. Drivers presented to the committee their concerns about proposed changes that will prevent them from being members of the TWU. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI would like to support the recommendations of the dissenting members of the Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation. While the majority of the recommendations of the committee were agreed upon unanimously, I trust that the government will take notice of the seven additional recommendations contained in the dissenting report presented by Labor members of the committee.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Independent contractors and labour hire arrangements are a growing feature of the Australian workplace, and the evidence suggests that there is going to be some growth for some time to come. It is not about to stopâat least according to the evidence presented to the committee. It provides opportunities for employers to shift workers from being employees to being contractors while in effect remaining, to all intents and purposes, an employee.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Probably the most disappointing thing about the report is that this failed to be taken up in any serious way. While it was acknowledged as an issue by the dissenting Labor members, the government members failed to pick up probably the single most important thing facing people who have been shifted from being employees to being contractors.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The government members have missed a fantastic opportunity to address the concerns of these workers, who are becoming a larger and larger part of the Australian work force. I am a little torn about why this might be the case. On the one hand, it might be that people simply do not understand the concerns of these workers. On the other hand, it is perhaps because government members are actually supportive of the inherent unfairness of the arrangements, given their stance on other industrial issues. But it is most likely to be simply that government members do not care.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The government simply does not care about many workers being forced into positions where they have to accept a contracting arrangement for the convenience of their employers. In most circumstances the employees who have quickly become so-called independent contractors are not facing anything different in terms of their work or their relationship with their employer, but they are certainly facing additional uncertaintyâadditional uncertainty borne out of not being on the books in the same way: as opposed to being on wages, they are there simply as independent contractors.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Of course, it does not stop there. The former employee, now a contractor, also faces considerable on-costs that once were borne by the employer. The contractor is expected to now make provision for their own superannuation, their own compensation premiums and any other insurance that may be required by the employer or by state or federal statute. While members opposite may say this is a fair thing, I have to say that from my perspective, and from that of the people in my electorate, it is completely unfair. The employer is getting all the benefits in the same way that they did before, but they are now able to avoid the additional on-costs associated with the direct hire of employees.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The situation, quite frankly, is probably best described as all care with very little responsibility. In my opinion, this is a key thing that government members missed during this inquiry. Government members had the opportunity to recommend to the minister that, after weighing up all the evidence that was presented to them, there was a case for change. There was the opportunity to adjust what I consider to be these unfair arrangements. There was an opportunity to correct the record in that respect. They had the opportunity to support Laborâs bid to have an unfair situation corrected by recommending changes to the definition of an employee, moving away from a common-law definition and imposing an adjustment to the Workplace Relations Act. Instead, the government members stood firm with the decision to continue the situation in which an employer can get away with removing entitlements, exposing workers to unnecessary and unfair levels of risk, simply by redefining their classification. With the stroke of a pen, everything is removed and nothing is replaced when it comes to many cases of so-called independent contractors.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As the member for Gorton noted in his earlier speech on the report, there are myriad sham arrangements that have been entered into and taken advantage of by making employees contractors. These sham arrangements create a situation of disguising employment and they are simply unfair to workers who are forced to accept them, forced to take all of the risk and most of the costâsometimes for very little or no additional return, I might add. These situations are simply wrong and should be stopped. It is not nearly good enough that they be allowed to continue and that people be allowed to take advantage of them, or at least of the results. The government had the chance to change this, or at least put on the record that it is wrong, by supporting a relatively simple amendment to the definition of âemployeeâ. This could have been easily achieved through an amendment to the definition of employee contained in the Workplace Relations Act, as outlined in recommendation 2 of the dissenting report.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The evidence to the committee was clear. When labour hire and independent contracting arrangements are entered into, the lines become extremely blurred. The lines are blurred not only for the purpose of assigning responsibility but also for the purposes of legal obligations that are created by these arrangements. The blurred lines and changed obligations mean that, at times, workers in these arrangements are far worse off than they ever were when they were direct hire employees. Their protections have been removed, their entitlements have been removed and they have additional on-costs foisted upon them. In most circumstances, when added up, this is all to their detriment.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I note that the evidence to the committee showed that there are also concerns about permanency of arrangements, unreasonableness of working hours and the general treatment of the so-called independent contractor being worse than would have been the case had they remained as direct employees. These are serious issues and they reflect a legitimate concern for those who are being taken advantage of under often unfair arrangements that they had no option other than to accept. I wonder if this is some sort of sign for the future of all other working Australians.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The matters that this report deals with have a direct impact on many of my constituents. I know many of those in Werriwa are certainly concerned about the matters that came before this committee. Recently I had the opportunity to hear from and speak with a number of people who are deeply concerned about the governmentâs approach to independent contractors. These people were not just fearful for their own livelihoods but concerned about the future of their families. During the last sitting fortnight of this parliament, a delegation of independent contractors in the transport industry travelled to Canberra to defend their rights. This group rallied at the front of Parliament House in an effort to bring their plight and their fight to the members of this place. I attended that rally to show my support. Sadly, I have to say, I did not see many members from the opposite side there and that is probably why they are not so willing to participate in this debate.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The transport workers also conducted a forum to which all members and senators were invited. The forum gave all of us here the opportunity to hear directly about their concerns. It also gave us the opportunity to hear from a number of experts, including academics in the field and wives and families of these contracted transport workers. While generally productive, the forum was interrupted by the member for OâConnor, who, it would seem, could not help himself when presented with an opportunity to put himself in front of a TV camera.</para>

<para>The use of Dapsone as an anti-malarial was restricted to Vietnam. In Vietnam, Dapsone was first used in September 1967 when it became a drug used to treat active malaria.

The largest of these was a cancer incidence study, which was released by the then Minister for Veteransâ Affairs in 1992. All studies were based on record searches, not testing of individuals. Two smaller record searches were also made, one of which was concerned with the side effects of Dapsone.
