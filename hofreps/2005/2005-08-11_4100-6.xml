<para class="block">The Australian Safety and Compensation Council is a new body to be established by the government to replace the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission.</para>
<para>The council is an advisory body which, through a partnership of governments, employers and employees, will lead and coordinate national efforts to prevent workplace death, injury and disease and improve workers compensation arrangements and the rehabilitation and return to work of injured employees.</para>
<para>The council will establish a national approach to workplace safety and workers compensation which currently does not exist in Australia.Â  Most importantly the council will provide the perfect setting for the promotion of greater consistency and uniformity amongst the various jurisdictions.</para>
<para>Although the council is to be established administratively, however, as a result of representations from stakeholders, and in particular from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the ACTU, the government has agreed to provide the power to declare national standards or codes of practice in legislation.</para>
<para>This <inline ref="R2415">bill</inline>, therefore, enables the new council to continue this important task previously undertaken by the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission.</para>
<para>Declaration of national standards and codes of practice is essential to ensuring workplace safety in Australia. Standards and codes declared by the council provide nationally consistent frameworks in which safety can be managed by employers and employees in certain industries or in relation to certain hazards. It also means that jurisdictions can adopt the standards in their legislation, thereby ensuring that there are appropriate sanctions and penalties for failing to comply with certain workplace safety obligations.</para>
<para>The process of declaring standards which are suitable for adoption in legislation by jurisdictions assists in improving uniformity of occupational health and safety regulation in Australia. We are often told by employers that they have to operate within a myriad of different regulatory frameworks in Australia. Accordingly, the declaration of occupational health and safety standards and codes, which can be adopted in state and territory legislation, is an important step in reducing duplication and inconsistent regulation.</para>
<para>The Australian government is committed to ensuring that Australian workplaces are as safe as possible and that injured workers are assisted with their rehabilitation and return to work. This bill will allow the new council to continue to work in partnership with state and territory governments, employer groups and employee organisations to promote national consistency in occupational health and safety for workers in Australia.</para>

<para class="block">This <inline ref="R2414">bill</inline> implements the Australian governmentâs decision to abolish the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission.</para>
<para>In its response to the Productivity Commissionâs report on national workers compensation and occupational health and safety frameworks, the government announced its intention to pursue the goal of greater national consistency in these areas through the establishment of a new body.</para>
<para>The National Occupational Health and Safety Commission will be replaced by the Australian Safety and Compensation Council. The councilâs functions will include the declaration of national standards and/or codes of practice relating to occupational health and safety.</para>
<para>The bill provides for the transfer of the commissionâs assets to the Commonwealth and contains provisions that will ensure continuity between the two standard-setting bodies.</para>
<para>This bill provides for national standards and codes of practice that have been issued by the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission to be read as if issued by the new Australian Safety and Compensation Council. It also preserves the effect of any public consultations that are under way and allows for these to be treated as if they had been undertaken by the new council.</para>

</talker>
<para>âFollowing the conclusion of my remarks yesterday, I am still very interested to draw the attention of the House and you, Mr Speaker, to the many issues that will be addressed in the <inline ref="R2292">Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005</inline> and the <inline ref="R2293">Building and Construction Industry Improvement (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2005</inline>: the right to gain employment in any industry without having to buy a ticket to get through the front door and the right of Australian taxpayers, who are the biggest employer group in Australia, to get value for a dollar when governments, on their behalf, move into major infrastructure commitments.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We had a classic example that I highlighted yesterdayâthe Mandurah-Perth railway line, a state government initiative in Western Australia, where the CFMEU have delayed the projectâs completion time and again. The issues are very hard to understand. There are good wages available for everybody in WA at the moment. What is more, it appears that the CFMEUâs idea of a fair and reasonable wage is grossly unfair to other taxpayers on more moderate salaries who must pay their taxes to support this project.</para>
<para>I remind the House that in Western Australia a typical home owner is paying $30 to $50 a week in stamp duty on their home. Many of them are not even aware of it, because at the time of purchase that stamp duty was paid out by the bank and is now incorporated in their mortgage payments. It is an example of how state governments, confronted with the costs of infrastructure, load up their constituencies.</para>
<para>It is worth reiterating that, in criticising these remarks recently, the CFMEU said that they were going to call strikes of their members because some other people working for alternative employers on the job were not getting the same wages, when the other workers were apparently quite satisfied with their wages. It came out that the CFMEU workers were getting $300 extra a week for their particular type of work. I speculated on what that might mean. Is it the difference between $500 and $800 a week? Is it the difference between $800 and $1,100 a week? We now find that it is something like the difference between $2,000 and $3,000 a week. As has been published in the media, a lollypop manâan obviously totally unskilled personâis getting $90,000 a year on that job. That is not fair to the people who have to pay the taxes.</para>
<para>More importantly, there has been a culture of bullying, there has been a culture of bribery, and it has all been reported in the royal commission. Quite clearly, special legislation is needed. I point out again in that regard that, whilst you can address many of these corrupt issues by the tariff method, which the Hawke and Whitlam governments didâyou just ship the jobs overseas and those jobs come back as menâs, womenâs and childrenâs clothing et ceteraâa building is a bit more difficult. But, of course, the option has been taken in many parts of the world where people locate their head offices where building costs are the most reasonable. That, again, has been detrimental to many Australian workers.</para>
<para>Western Australia has some of the cheapest personal residential housing in Australia and, in a relative sense, in the world. There has been a good reason for that. A fellow called Len Buckeridge entered the home-building market under the brand name of BGC and took those union bullies on. History records that on one occasion he ran his car over a couple of picketers. He gave them the sort of treatment, unfortunately, that they had meted out themselves. He then vertically integrated his business. He makes just about everything he puts into a house. When I had the job of shadow minister for service personnel and I had meetings with the wives of servicemen, many of them said, âIf we can only get to Perth, if we can only get to one of the postings over there, we can afford a house.â That is because of a businessman who took these thugs on and won. He has managed to put the industry into a profitable shape, where housing costs $100,000 to $200,000 less than elsewhere. Surely that is a benefit to the community. It is still the case that housing of a very high standard is readily available.</para>
<para>One aspect of Mr Buckeridgeâs business was that he did not make clay bricks, so he went to Germany two or three years ago and bought a brick-making plant. At that timeâwhen the brickworks arrived in Western Australiaâbecause Perth is a double-brick house culture, we were starting to ship bricks in from the Eastern Statesâ</para>

<para>âYes, and from Malaysia! And as we stand here, Len is still struggling to get a site to erect his brickworks on. The state government preferred Western Australians to import bricks from Malaysia, to pay all the additional costs, rather than to let Len Buckeridge, the successful home builder for the people, make his own clay bricks. At this stage, the Commonwealth government is, through the Airports Association, giving him some assistance. That situation was absolutely ridiculous. What is more, he was helping the government out by being the cheapest builder for their public homesâfor low-income earnersâ homesâ</para>

<para>âYes. Here he was winning tenders, and the then minister tried to stop him putting in the lower price. It was a scandal and the minister, Tom Stephens, eventually lost in the courts. Fancy a government, spending taxpayersâ money, deciding it was better to pay more for houses than to let the hated antiunion builder get the job and build the houses cheaperâand the brickworks he proposed are apparently highly efficient and will reduce the cost of bricks for all Western Australians. And yet another mate of the WA government was given a block of land in Midland for a fraction of its value to build brickworks, but you can bet that is a totally union site. These are the issues. The big losers are the people of Australia, and that is why this legislation is well worth the support I give it.</para>

<para>âIn recent times the Prime Minister has alluded to the need to strengthen antiterrorist laws in Australia. He need look no further than the amendments to the <inline ref="R2292">Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005</inline>. I speak advisedly of the amendments because no government member in this parliament has referred to the amendments at all. There are only two possible explanations for that: they are unaware of the content of these amendments or indeed their very existence or, alternatively, government members are aware of the amendments and are hoping, as the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations no doubt hopes, that no-one on the opposition side will have read them.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The second reading speech referring to the main bill was delivered on 9 March 2005. In the speech, the minister says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The government will move amendments to this bill to implement remaining elements of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003, including amendments to set up the Australian Building and Construction Commission.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The minister knew exactly what he was doing on 9 March 2005 and yet it is only in the last two or three days that these amendments have appeared.</para>
<para>Let us understand the gravity of these amendments. All members who were here in the previous parliament will well recall the Senate sitting until 2.20 on a Saturday morningâa very unusual situation. The Senate was sitting because, as shadow industrial relations minister, I was objecting to the coercive powers that were contained in a piece of legislation at that time. Through the objections and the arguments that I made on behalf of the Australian Labor Party the Democrats came to accept a number of the major points that we were making, and we had said to the government that we would sit indefinitely unless the government buckled and modified those coercive powers. The government did in fact buckle under pressure and modified those coercive powers. Not the bill of 9 March but the amendments that were circulated in the last few days overturned the measures that were passed by the Senate to modify the worst aspects of those coercive powers.</para>
<para>I will go through them one by one. For a start, when I was in discussions with the minister I pointed out that the penalties for a person involved in the building and construction industry not complying with a request from an investigator were only in the form of a jail sentence. If the matter were relatively minorâthat is, the noncompliance by a participant in the building and construction industryâthen surely provision should be made for a financial penalty so that we did not have a situation of the courts having to rule that even for minor breaches people would go to jail for up to six months.</para>
<para>The minister said to me that that seemed a reasonable point and, as a consequence of the arguments that we made, the amendments passed at 2.20 am on 24 June did provide for financial penalties. Well, surprise, surprise! The amendments to this bill remove the provision for financial penalties such thatâand let us understand thisâif there is any noncompliance on the part of any participant in the building and construction industry to a request by an investigator for information, then the penalty is jail. The Australian people need to understand what this government has done through amendments to legislation which have not yet been debated in this chamber. The minister will perhaps refer to these amendments in summing up later on in the debate on this bill, but he has allowed this debate to continue without anyone knowing that the penalty for someone in the industry not complying with the requests of an investigator from the Building Industry Taskforce to produce documents or answer questions is jail. If anyone in Australia has any interest in civil liberties they need to understand what this government has done.</para>
<para>Secondly, the government on 24 June at 2.20 am also agreed that there needed to be some fetters on the conduct of the powers of the Building Industry Taskforce. The Democrats had said to them, on a suggestion from Senator Marshall from the ALP, that a set of guidelines would need to be prepared so that this task force could not just run rampant across the industry. Provision was made for them in the amendments that were passed at 2.20 am on 24 June. The guidelines were subsequently prepared and they were a disallowable instrument. But againâsurprise, surpriseâthat provision has disappeared.</para>
<para>I refer to the ministerâs speech made in the daylight hours of 24 June in this place after we received the message back from the Senate. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The powersâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">that is, of the task forceâ</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">are similar to those which the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission have at the present time. Indeed, after agreement with the Democrats last night, we will model guidelines on the ACCC guidelines that apply to the exercise of powers under section 155 of the Trade Practices Act.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is gone. Those guidelines have gone because this minister wants the Building Industry Taskforce to have unfettered powers consistent with the ministerâs ambitions for this task force. We had inserted in the same amendments late at night in the Senate that there should be a provision such that minor and petty matters could not be investigated by the task force. We did not want a situation where the task force simply intimidates people because they are a member of a trade union. The governmentâs intentions are completely clear because in the amendments to this legislation which have not been debated the government has removed that constraint on the task force so that now it can investigate minor and petty matters.</para>
<para>The impact of these three changes in the amendments to the legislation here today is that an investigator can go up to a building industry worker and ask such questions as: âAre you or have you ever been a member of a trade union? Are you or have you ever been a member of the Australian Labor Party?â That person may have done nothing wrong and there may be no suspicion of that person having done anything wrong, but if that person does not answer that question then this legislation can send that person to jail for not answering a McCarthyist question as to whether that person is or has ever been a member of the trade union movement.</para>
<para>Let us understand in this parliament today what these amendments do. They deprive building industry workers of civil liberties that suspects in terrorist cases in Australia have. I will say that again: building industry workers will have fewer civil liberties upon the passage of this legislationâwhich has not been debated properly in this parliamentâthan people who may have knowledge about terrorism activities in this country. That is why I said at the outset that if the Prime Minister wants a model for stiffening up the terrorist laws in this country he need look no further than the amendments to the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005 that were circulated only in the last couple of days and have not yet been debated in this chamber.</para>
<para>Let us understand further what an investigator can do to anyone who is in the building industry. An investigator can approach someone in the building industry and demand the production of telephone records, of any documents relating to whether that person is a member of a trade union movement, of any information whatsoever that the inspector considers might be relevant to an investigation. Where else do we have in the law the capacity of an investigator to go up to someone who is not necessarily suspected of having done anything wrong and demand the production of that personâs telephone records and the production of that personâs bank statements? And if that person does not cooperate there is no financial penalty, only jail. That is what this legislation does today.</para>
<para>It is not an accident. The government tried to get away with this last time and, thanks to some moderation on the part of the Democrats, we were able to remove those outrageous provisions from this legislation. And this minister sneaks them back in and just calls them innocently the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005 amendments, with a date of 5 August 2005. This is a disgrace and it is an indication of how this government intends to run the parliament. They intend to put in one bill, have people come along and debate that bill, slip in a set of amendments that are far more wide-reaching than the bill itself and hope that no-one will notice what is in the amendments to the bill. They intend to slip it through the House of Representatives without even telling government ministers and members what is in the bill in case they might let it slip that the true force of the bill is in the amendments, so that we have no debate on the amendments. Then it goes to the Senate, where the government enjoys a majority, and it sails through. We have today compelling evidence of how this government intends to conduct itself in this parliament now that it has a majority in the Senateâby making massive amendments to legislation, amendments that are then not debated.</para>
<para>Let us be frank. When this debate finishes, people will come in from the government side and, apart from those who are watching now on the monitor, they will not know they are voting for extreme coercive powers that deny civil liberties to people engaged in the building and construction industry. Not only will they not know, they will not care. This government is treating the Australian parliament with contempt and it is time that we understood the true colours of this government. It is supposed to be a free enterprise government. It is supposed to be a government that is for the individual and yet it has extreme coercive powers here in this legislation. Not only that; in this building and construction industry amendment bill there is reference to a code. Let us understand what the code is. It is a code of conduct. At chapter 3, section 26, it states:</para>
<quote>
<para>The Minister may issue one or more documents that together constitute a code of practice (the Building Code) that is to be complied with by persons in respect of building work.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">What this means is that the minister at his whim can choose which company gets a government project by deciding whether the agreement with the workers who build that project suits the minister or not. This is going to put building industry companies very much in the governmentâs debt, because the minister can say: âI donât really like this company. Theyâve said something about us that we donât like.â The minister could say: âWe havenât received a political donation from this particular company. Isnât it time that that company made a political donation?â The minister can ensure that that particular company does not get work, because the minister can write anything he wants in the code of conduct.</para>
<para>We now have a government that has put itself in a position where it can intimidate not only the workers in the building and construction industry but the companies themselves into doing exactly what the government wants, including providing political donations and rewriting agreements with trade unions, all at the whim of the minister. There is no accountability whatsoever to the parliament. More than a year ago, the former chief executive of the Australian Industry Group, Bob Herbert, said it was very bad practice that the minister at his whim could determine which companies got government projectsâand here it is enshrined in legislation. So we have not only the liberties of individuals compromised severely with this legislation but the rights of building industry companies to conduct their business in an honest and decent way.</para>
<para>With reference to the civil liberties of workers in this industry, one of the rights that most Australians would believe they enjoy is the right not to incriminate themselves. Surely it is one of the central tenets of our legal system that, in being required to answer questions, you cannot incriminate yourself. Under the amendments to this bill, section 231 states:</para>
<para>231Â  Certain excuses not available in relation to sectionÂ 230 requirements</para>
<para>Excuses that are not available</para>
<amendments>
<amendment>
<para class="subsection">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (1)Â Â Â  A person is not excused from giving information, producing a document, or answering a question, under sectionÂ 230 on the ground that to do so:</para>
<para class="indenta">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (a)Â Â Â  would contravene any other law; or</para>
<para class="indenta">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (b)Â Â Â  might tend to incriminate the person or otherwise expose the person to a penalty or other liability; or</para>
<para class="indenta">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  (c)Â Â Â  would be otherwise contrary to the public interest.</para>
</amendment>
</amendments>
<para class="block">So the government can compel people to incriminate themselves. Where are the civil libertarians? They should be exposing what the government is doing in this legislation. Where are the civil libertarians on the government side? They walk around Australia saying that they are all for the individual and civil liberties yet they are about to pass a piece of legislation that denies workers in the building and construction industry fundamental civil liberties, irrespective of whether the particular worker is suspected of having done anything wrong or not. This means that this Building Industry Taskforce can go around identifying people in the building and construction industry who are members of a trade union and intimidate them and demand the production of their financial and telephone records, and the penalty is jail even if they are not suspected of having done anything wrong.</para>
<para>That is what goes to the heart of this governmentâs union-busting agenda. It wants the task force to be able to intimidate innocent people simply because they are members of a trade union. Let us understand where we are: here, on 11 August 2005, this government is going to pass legislation that has not been properly debated to achieve its goals and to deny civil liberties to people who are seeking to earn an honest living in the building and construction industry. Of course there are problems in parts of the building and construction industry. We on this side of parliament believe that collaborative solutions, tripartite solutions, are the best way. We certainly strongly oppose this denial of basic civil liberties.</para>
<para>In the remaining minutes I have I will speak on the primary bill, which is also important in that it is retrospective in its application and it is essentially designed to make it very difficult for unions to renegotiate certified agreements. The truth is that, certainly in Victoria, the horse appears to have bolted because a large numberâhundreds, if not thousandsâof agreements have been renegotiated. I put this to you: if the building and construction industry is in such shocking shape in Australia, if it is so inefficient, why have large companies agreed to renegotiate the certified agreements? The government says that they have agreed because the unions might go on strike. Gee, it is possible. I accept that it is possible that the union might, at some point, have said that they might go on strike. What does the government do? It brings in a massive bill with retrospective application.</para>
<para>There you goâthe government is pretty keen on retrospective legislation and on the denial of civil liberties to innocent people working in the building and construction industry. It has only one agenda and it is not the efficiency of the building and construction industry; it is the destruction of the trade union movement in this country. It knows that if it can destroy the trade union movement it can attack quite effectively the Australian Labor Party. We will stand shoulder to shoulder with the trade union movement of this country.</para>

</talker>
<para>âSome of the grave apprehensions that many of us have about the governmentâs industrial relations program have been more than vindicated by the comments of the last speaker, the member for Rankin, Dr Emerson. I am assuming he has got them all right. There is no doubt that if those things are correct all of us should hold some grave apprehensions with respect to the <inline ref="R2292">Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005</inline>. Unfortunately for the people of Australia, the government does not seem to have anyone in it that has worked in the sense of getting dirt under their fingernails or having a boss over them and having to turn up early in the morning and go home late at night, except in a suit, a shirt and a tie.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In the real world in which the vast bulk of the Australian people live, there is danger in the work that they do. In the construction industry, there is intrinsic danger because you are dealing with heights of two metres or more. A good friend of mine recently lost his leg after falling off a ladder from a height of two metres. There are great dangers once you get above a single floor. Even on a house, putting a roof on becomes a dangerous occupation. The element of danger is intrinsically in this legislation. The worker must have a right to withdraw his labour where there is an issue of danger or workplace safety. You say that there is a process by which this can be gone about. There are not a limitless number of industrial inspectors. Most certainly in country areas of Australia it is very hard to find them at all. I am not criticising governments for that; it is very expensive to have industrial inspectors all over the place. But if you have a situation that is dangerous then men must be able to withdraw their labour. If they are not allowed to withdraw their labour then we have a situation which is extremely dangerous indeed.</para>
<para>The reality of the world is that people do not like to lose their jobs. Contrary to the belief of the government, the average worker these days is terrified of losing his job. He has huge commitments to meet. According to their own figures we are in negative savings in Australia. People have massive individual debt. They are paying off their houses, which are at ridiculous prices for the average couple to pay off, they are paying off a car and oftentimes they are paying off a computer, which is hard to get along without these days. There are numerous things they will put on the charge account. They have huge debts. They are most certainly not inclined to be running out on strike every four seconds. The figures would indicate that there is a vast diminution in industrial action in Australia.</para>
<para>We are inventing solutions for which there are no problems. If there were no strikes at all then I believe you would have a very unhealthy country. The communist countries were characterised by the fact that they never had any strikes. And some of the dangerous right-wing countries in the world were similarly characterised by a no-strikes regime. So if you have a no-strikes regime just remember you are putting yourself in a category of countries that I most certainly would not like my country put in. Yet it seems that the government is absolutely determined that there will be no strike action in this country. Just remember, when that is achieved history will pass a judgment upon the government, and it will be a very harsh judgment indeed.</para>
<para>I want to talk about an intrinsic right and freedom. The previous speaker made issue on a personâs right to silence, which is one of the foundation stones of the rule of law. It would appear that under this bill if you are not at work on a day when there is a strike or if it is alleged that you are out on account of a strike action of some description then the onus of proof shifts to you to prove why you should not be fined $20,000 or $30,000. If you do not pay the fine, the courts have the right to distrain. The courts also have the right to issue an injunction: they can direct you to go back to work. If you do not go back to work, you are in breach of the courtâs direction, which is a jailable offence. We have really draconian legislation being debated here. The people who are drafting these acts simply do not understand the basic premise that you are innocent until proven guilty. Habeas corpusâyou cannot be taken without due process of law. The reverse onus of proof is inherent in this bill.</para>
<para>There is another pernicious aspect of the bill, which I picked up and was amazed about. This government prides itself on trying to do the right thingâmost certainly the Prime Minister does, and I applaud him for itâbut the briefing notes say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The retrospective character of this Bill will ensure that unions that take unlawful industrial action prior to the nominal expiry date of these and other existing agreements in the coming months, will be subject to the sanctions and greater penalties provided by the BCII Bill. Likewise parties who are affected will be able to seek damages to recover any losses they suffer.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">A previous Liberal government got themselves into dreadful trouble over retrospective legislation. Everyone shudders in fear when people start talking about retrospective legislation. I have no reason to believe that the briefing paper is wrong. In fact, if anything the briefing paper is very slanted towards the government in every respect. I do not think that statement would be in the briefing paper if it was not a true description of the bill.</para>
<para>One of the basic premises of a country that has a rule of law is that you have the law and you act in accordance with it because that is the law. But then you find that the law that was is now deemed not to be the law that was, and your actions are retrospectively illegal, even though you acted in a legal manner at the time. That is another pernicious aspect of this bill.</para>
<para>The government have gone completely overboard, unfettered by the restraints provided by the Senate for the last 25 years. We can only hope and pray that some people, such as the rather courageous Barnaby Joyce, will stand up and bring the government to their senses. If they do, then they will belong to a government that can walk with pride as not having trammelled the basic tenets of justice upon which our economy has been built.</para>
<para>If I believeâand I doâthat the employer has the right to sack, then I must also believe that the worker, in order to get a better pay deal, has the right not to turn up to work. The employer should be able to say, âYouâre not working efficiently and I want an operation that is working efficiently so that I can make more money. If youâre not going to do that, Iâm going to sack you.â I am referring to unfair dismissal laws. If I, as a reasonable person, have taken the position that the employer should have the right to sack then surely every dictate of logic should say that the worker should be able to say, âYou havenât paid me enough money. I want to make a bit more money so Iâm not going to turn up for work tomorrow.â What is good for the goose is surely good for the gander. But if you are going to take a partisan view such as the government is taking that the worker is wrong and the employer is right, then you are going to construct a society which is unfair.</para>
<para>Maybe I was not watching for it before, but I have never seen on the media such a massive projection of a country that is going so marvellously well. Unemployment rates are going to be released today. I have not done my homework on this for a couple of years but I most certainly did my homework a few years ago when Mr Costello got up and said that he had reduced unemployment by 400,000 people. It was trueâthe unemployment figures produced by ABS showed a reduction of 400,000. Over the same period of time the number of people on the disability pension had increased, over its normal increase, by 396,000. The Treasurer claims to be a reputable person and to have integrity, but he stood up in a public place and made that statement. In fairness to the Treasurer he seems to have gone a bit light on this lately, but he cannot have it both ways. He cannot complain about all of the unreasonable people who are on the disability pension and at the same time skite about the unemployment figures. I use that as one example.</para>
<para>An interview by Maxine McKew in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> magazine had a wonderful heading which said, in part, thatÂ  Australia was âfloating on an artificial boom created by property speculation financed by overseas borrowingsâ. That really hit the nail on the head. Its concluding remark was âoverseas borrowings that have to be repaidâ. We are watching the collapse of families throughout Australia because mothers and fathers have to work enormously long hours. Whilst the government says Australians are on higher incomes, if you work it out per hour they are on anything but high incomes; they are among the more low-paid. Sydney journalist Ross Gittins brought out a book comparing Australiaâs vital statistics with those of other countries. The book shows that Australians are being paid, per hour, much less than people in other countries. So the government can put up all these propositions in the mediaâwe see them continually.</para>
<para>That brings to mind a wonderful quoteâwhich one of the newspapers got onto, and I must give them their due for that: âThe economy is plateauing and we can look forward to the same prosperity we enjoy today out into the distant future. The rises and spectacular increases we have seen in the past will not take place. However, the wonderful prosperity we are now enjoying will continue.â That claim was made by a university professor in June 1929, some four or five months before the Great Depression hit America. Almost every one of the indicators that the United States government was touting in 1929 was positive. But anyone who was doing in-depth assessment of the performance of the United States economy in 1929 would have realised that the entire economy was being fuelled by âbillows of bulldustâ.</para>
<para>In a chapter of his book <inline font-style="italic">The great crash 1929</inline> entitled âIn Goldman Sachs we trustâ, John Kenneth Galbraith described how Goldman Sachs had set up a company that owned another company, that owned another company, that owned another company and so on. You had to go through some 13 companies before you got to a company that actually owned any assets. That was magnificent leverage upwards in a rising stock market, but, if the stock market for one moment faltered, it was magnificent leverage downwards. If you knew that there was always a cycle, then you knew that all the elements of disaster were being built into that economy. It was a false economy built on speculation.</para>
<para>If there is a classic description of the Australian economy in the year of our Lord 2005âand we are dealing with the building industryâit is that it is floating on property speculation fuelled by overseas borrowings that will have to be repaid. If there is great prosperity in property speculation and the building industry then the workers should be entitled to participate in it. If they are being left behind, how do they catch up? Anyone on the government side of the House who says the âdrip-down effectâ will catch them simply does not know how the real world worksâparticularly where workers have to go through the process of individual contracts. As I have said in this place on many occasions, it is obvious that the people on the government side do not live in the real world. In the real world, if you go to your boss and start making waves and asking for better pay and conditions, he will show you the door. That is the real world. I worked in those situations for the best part of five yearsânot all of my life but a significant portion of itâand I can tell you it is absolutely true. The number of complaints put by employees to their bosses would be absolutely negligible. When I ask people about this they say: âYouâre not going to do that. Youâll get thrown out the window. You wonât have a job. How will you keep up your house payments or car payments? Youâll be thrown out on the street.â</para>
<para>People are put out on the grass in any healthy society, but this bill talks about distraining their assets! Are we going to kick doors in, throw families out on the street and take their furniture or their cars? That is what distraining their assets means. And we talk about people going on strike. That is something Australians have done since the dawn of time. I remind this Houseâas it should be remindedâthat the reason we enjoy decent pay scales today is that our forefathers stood on picket lines. Geoffrey Blainey, the great doyen of conservatives in this parliamentâI think he is a magnificent historian; I do not hesitate to say he is one of the greatest Australian historiansâsays in his book <inline font-style="italic">The Rush That Never Ended</inline> that the only way Australians can rise is through collective actionâthrough a trade union.</para>
<para>If you want any verification of that, Bob Menziesâ grandfather was the leader of the trade union movement at Ballarat around 20 years after Eureka Stockade. So the forebears of this place were the men who stood on the ramparts, who, were they here now, would be thrown in jail under the legislation that is coming forward. The grandaddy of the Treasurer, Mr Costello, actually did go to jail in those days for his trade union activities. So the people who now enjoy huge money, huge status and huge power in this country are the inheritors of a wonderful society that was created, to quote Geoffrey Blainey, by a collective action of the trade union movement. Unlike the people on the other side of the House, I was in a government which took on the unions head on. I do not resile from that; I was one of the people who made that decision. I am not saying that I went along with the party or anything like that. I made a conscious decision that the time had come to stand up because the trade union movement had taken power which was excessive and needed to be restrained. But there is no case out there now to restrain that union power in the way that it is being done here today. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI join my colleagues on this side of the House in rising to speak against the <inline ref="R2292">Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005</inline> and the <inline ref="R2293">Building and Construction Industry Improvement (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2005</inline>. The main bill seeks to enact legislation that would make some forms of industrial action illegal. It would provide for additional sanctions against these actions in the form of injunctions, financial penalties and compensation. The bill before the House of Representatives is very similar to the <inline ref="R1922">Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003</inline>, which was passed by this House and then lapsed last year due to the election but not before it was rejected by a Senate committee. However, only part of the 2003 bill is being reintroduced at this moment. The remaining parts of the previous bill, including the creation of the Australian Building and Construction Commission, are to be introduced by the government at a later date. We will continue to debate and we will continue to oppose further bills which continue in a vein similar to this.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations said that this bill is designed to send a message to employers and unions. It will increase the penalties in the Workplace Relations Act and will establish a task force to prosecute illegal activity. The message that it is sending to employers is, âWe are giving you greater power,â and the message to unions and employees is, âWe are stripping away your rights at work.â This bill has been brought on in part by the findings of the Cole royal commission. Although the commission believed that there were so-called âcriminal problemsâ in the building industry, only one criminal prosecution followed that commission. The Cole royal commission found that change was needed in some areas, and the government has pounced on this like dogs pouncing on a bone to pursue an ideological attack on the construction union. The Cole royal commissionâs recommendations included, among other things, the introduction of an industry specific act, the establishment of a regulatory body and improvements to occupational health and safetyâa joke, which I will go into further on.</para>
<para>In November 2002, in response to these recommendations, the Interim Building Industry Task Force, which has since had its powers extended, was set up. This task force is a forerunner of the proposed Australian Building and Construction Commission and its role is to investigate and take legal action in relation to freedom of association breaches and breaches of conditions surrounding workplace agreements. The new extended powers of the task force are set out in the Workplace Relations Amendment (Codifying Contempt) Offences Act 2004. These new powers include new investigative powers, protection for whistleblowers, fines, and imprisonment for up to six months for failing to cooperate. Protection for whistleblowers, which as I just mentioned is one of these extended powers, is designed to pit worker against worker and to pit mate against mate, and it is a disgraceful power to give to the government and employers. These powers are extreme and they should be rejected by a democratic society which is supposed to respect human rights and workersâ rights. Under present legislation, workers that are in a bargaining period can be protected from civil action, in accordance with section 170 of the Workplace Relations Act. The legislation before us strips away that protection for workers in the construction industry.</para>
<para>This is a nasty and dangerous piece of legislation, an antiunion bill. It is the first in a long list of the legislation we will be debating in this place now that the government has control of the Senate and can abuse its unfettered power to push through the Prime Ministerâs ideology of returning to an 1800s master-servant relationship between employers and employees. The governmentâs industrial relations proposals will radically alter the basic rights and protections that Australian workers and their families rely on. If the current proposals are implemented, job security and regular working hours will become luxuries that few will enjoy. Family and community life will suffer accordingly. Also, Australia will be even more out of step with internationally recognised core labour standards, such as the right to collective bargaining.</para>
<para>The governmentâs plans are not about true choice for employees; they are squarely about giving employers greater power over employeesâ working conditions. Further legislation which the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and the Prime Minister have foreshadowed will also include protection from unfair dismissal being abolished for those who work in companies with fewer than 100 staff, individual contracts which will cut take-home pay and reduce employment conditions to only five minimum standards, lower minimum wages, the award safety net being replaced with just five conditions, employees having less access to unions at their workplaces and having their capacity to bargain collectively reduced, and the gutting of the independent Industrial Relations Commission. As we heard in this place yesterday, when the Prime Minister was asked some years ago whether he would take a knife to the Industrial Relations Commission, he stated at that time that he would stab it in the stomach. The further legislation will also include the reduction or the abolition of statesâ rights in industrial relations.</para>
<para>This legislation and further legislation, as I have outlined, has its basis in the Cole royal commission, set up by this government as the attack dog to sic the construction union in the same way that the former minister, Peter Reith, tried to take on the Maritime Union. In that case Reith failed, and in this case it will be the same. Australian workers, who are well organised and well represented, will not sit back and allow these attacks to occur. The Cole royal commission was a union witch-hunt set up by this government at a cost of $66 million. What was the result of this royal commission? One single prosecutionâat $66 million the most expensive prosecution brought by a government in Australiaâs history.</para>
<para>As a result of the Cole royal commission the government set up the building industry task force, adding more dogs to the pack. Let us look further at the cost of maintaining this pack of attack dogs. The government originally allocated $6.5 million to carry the building industry task force through from October 2002 to July 2003. In June 2003 a Senate committee was told during the estimates process that the 2003-04 budget for the task force was $6.9 million. In February 2004, the committee heard that the budget was $8.9 million. Assuming the latter figure is correct, the building industry task force had cost taxpayers almost $750,000 per month in the period October 2002 to June 2004. In almost 2Â½ years, at a cost of more than $15 million, they finalised nine court cases, six of which resulted in fines totalling $15,200. So $15 million was the cost; the fines that were imposed amounted to $15,000.</para>
<para>The 2004-05 budget allocation for implementing the recommendations of the royal commission was $136.3 million, including $9 million to extend the life of the building industry task force to 30 June 2005 and a massive $96.1 million to set up the new Australian Building and Construction Commission to take over from the task force when the governmentâs further legislation is passed.</para>
<para>I am sure that all workers in this country, who are under increasing attack by the government, would be astounded and outraged to know that their taxes have been funding this ideological attack by the government on construction workers to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. The government should be using its current $20 million public relations campaign on industrial relations to alert Australian workers to these facts. The changes contained in this legislation will restrict the rights of building workers to bargain for wages and conditions, drastically strip back building awards and place severe restrictions on unionsâ right of entry to work sites. These changes were included in a bill introduced by Tony Abbott in 2003 that was rejected by a Senate committee before the last election.</para>
<para>The effect of these laws is that building workers will be second-class citizens with weaker awards, less access to unions and a reduced ability to protect their rights through industrial action. It is a further attack on safety in the construction industry, which is appalling in an industry where more than 50 workers lose their lives in any year. On the safety issues in the construction industry, the CFMEU has always been the instigator of improved work practices. I refer to a court case brought by the building industry task force. Just last month, Justice Merkel of the Federal Court dismissed a case against a CFMEU organiser, Fergal Doyle. When responding to the decision, the CFMEU Victorian State Secretary, Martin Kingham, said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">This kind of secret taping and attempted entrapment has no place in Australian industrial relations. And all this happened before the Taskforce got their new powers to compel workers and union officials to be interviewed in secret with no right of silence.</para>
<para class="block">The organiser was on site to deal with serious concerns that the workers had over safety. The court found these concerns were real. More than 50 workers die every year in our industry, yet when this union organiser went to site to ensure that they are safe, Mr Howardâs industrial police take them to court. They have their priorities wrong.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He went on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Instead of spending hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars on prosecuting union officials, the Taskforce should support safety in the building industry and allow unionists to get on with their jobâprotecting wages, conditions and safety.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The organiser whom the government tried to prosecute, Fergal Doyle, said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">If the Taskforce thinks attending a site for a safety inspection makes me a criminal then perhaps there is something wrong with the laws of this country.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I could not agree more.</para>
<para>This is also happening in the shadow of the death of 16-year-old Joel Exner nearly two years ago. Joel was killed as a result of his boss cutting corners to maximise profits. A young worker was unnecessarily killed. I have a 15-year-old son who wants to go into a trade and I want his safety at work to be protected when he does. I want to know that, when he goes to work of a morning, he is going to come home of an eveningâthat is every motherâs right. To try and prosecute union organisers for trying to protect the safety of our sons and daughters in workplaces is an absolute disgrace and a blight on this governmentâs term in office. Union organisers are prosecuted by this government for trying to prevent further tragedies occurring. This governmentâs legislation allows it to happen and ensures that it does happen.</para>
<para>I turn now to more examples of the building industry task force being criticised by the courts in the cases they have taken against the CFMEU and individual workers or companies. In the case of Alfred v CFMEU New South Wales branch, in referring to the building industry task force Justice Hughes said:</para>
<quote>

<para class="block">Sorry, the taskforce ...</para>

<para class="block">In this particular case, the task force spent $287,000âover a quarter of a million dollarsâin legal costs during the failed prosecution.

In the case of Pine v Seelite Windows, with regard to strike pay Justice Finkelstein said:</para>

<para>I want to conclude this speech with the words of John Robertson, the Secretary of Unions NSW, when he made a presentation on Sky Channel during the mass meetings of workers which were held around New South Wales on 1 July. I attended a meeting at the Cardiff Workers Club. It was packed. It has been a long time since I have seen unionised workers and concerned citizens, pensioners, young people, people in paid work, people in unpaid work and unemployed people gathered together to protest against what they see and know will take away their rights at work for all Australians. That will continue to happen. There will continue to be protests right around the country. John Robertson, in his presentation, said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... the government passed laws that allow a secret police force to use anti-terror style powers against building workers.</para>

</quote>
<para class="block">This is a disgraceful, nasty and dangerous piece of legislation. It should be opposed.

<para>âThis bill is called the <inline ref="R2292">Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005</inline>; nothing could be further from the truth. This does not improve activities in the building and construction industry. It is ideologically driven, and if we go into the detail of what is contained in this bill and the amendments, which have subsequently been introduced but which have not been spoken to by any member on the government side, we can get a window into the industrial relations environment that this government will bring forward when we finally get to see its new wave of industrial legislation coming before the parliament.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The legislation is driven by ideology. It strips away the basic rights to collective bargaining and the right to strike. It runs against the international conventions. It reintroduces amendments that were unable to get up in the previous Senateâthe coercive powers being extended to the task force that has been established in the construction industry. What it does is to make them much harsher. Initiatives that were considered by the Senate and mellowed have all been stripped away and snuck in without even being introduced as part of the original proposition. That is what this government is up to: underhandedness, ideology, never being upfront with the Australian electorate and always trying to run on the basis of division, fear and blame of the other side.</para>
<para>The only way to create a sound industrial relations climate in this countryâand I have been involved in it for many yearsâis to find the common ground. You have to have a spirit of cooperation. You have to have both sides of the equationâemployers and workers and their representative bodiesâworking together. Go to any international body now and, with all the complexity of issues, the constant theme you get is that you have to involve the stakeholders. This legislation excludes the stakeholders, strips away their rights and strips away basic entitlements.</para>
<para>This in part is a reintroduction of a previous bill which lapsed because the parliament went to an election last year. That broader legislation was the governmentâs biased response to a politically inspired agenda to single out for special attention one sector in our economy, the building and construction industry, and in particular the unions involved in it.</para>
<para>As the previous speaker, the member for Charlton, indicated, the Cole royal commission cost this country $66 million. It did find significant problems within the building industry. But, if you read the detail, you will see that it also identified that a number of these problems had emerged from collusive practices that the industry, the employers themselves, had entered intoâthat is, success money, failure money and little agreements on the side when contracts were missed. I agree that if there are inefficiencies in an industry a government has a responsibility to deal with them and, if that requires legislation, do it. But do not just sheet the blame home to one side, because that is the consequence of the governmentâs response to the Cole royal commission. There was one prosecution, as the previous member indicated. We know that there are many examples of bad safety practices on the job. But where are the recommendations? Where is the legislation before the parliament? Where is the urging by the government to the states to improve workplace safety and those sorts of things? You get the flavour of it: this is a singling out, an ideologically driven approach.</para>
<para>What the bill does is prohibit industrial action in the building and construction industry by unions seeking an enterprise agreement. This is an industry in which enterprise agreements have been entered into since the beginning of time. But this legislation prohibits industrial action in support of those agreements. It prohibits them and imposes very heavy fines, and in the case of the coercive powers that have been slipped in under the amendments it does not impose fines in certain circumstancesâit is straight to jail.</para>
<para>Where is the understanding and the commonsense associated with that? It is blame, it is fear, it is division and it is bad industrial practice. This is a government that we know is intent on trying to establish AWAs, and good luck to it. If people think that AWAs serve their interests, they should be entitled to enter into individual workplace agreements. But understand that most industries in this country do not operate through individual activities. They have a flow of people. Think about it: in transport and in production there are a whole lot of individuals working in common. If you are going to negotiate fairness in the workplace, does it not make sense to ensure that that takes place as an agreement for the enterprise as a whole, not a collection of individuals? It is one thing to argue an AWA for a journalist, but it is not the same to argue one for a worker in a process line or a logistics chain or an assembly plant. It just does not make sense.</para>
<para>Whilst the Labor Party recognises that there can be circumstances in which people might have to argue individuallyâwe have real problems with the AWA stream, but there are common law activities et ceteraâwe think it is absolutely stupid to deny the opportunity to negotiate collectively. That is what this bill does: it denies collectivism and it tilts the industrial relations framework in this sector massively in the direction of the employer, giving sweeping powers to the new task force. It is part of the governmentâs strategy to enforce AWAs.</para>
<para>We saw them try it in relation to the waterfront when we had the dogs and the balaclavas at midnight and the special legislation passed by cabinet to enable a company to strip its work force, take away all its entitlements and employ a new one. That is what they did with the waterfront, and we saw mass demonstrations against that. This is another ideological approach, and this time it is in the building and construction industry. It singles out building and construction industry workers and their unions. It excludes them from the right to collective bargaining. This collective bargaining right is embodied in ILO convention 98, which this country has ratified. It has been ratified since 1973 and was ratified by a previous Labor government. In effect, this bill is tearing up the principles inherent in that internationally ratified convention.</para>
<para>The legislation takes away the right to collectively bargain and the right to strike. It effectively ensures that industrial action in the building and construction industry is unlawful, and it effectively outlaws the right to strike. I see the advisers in the box smiling about this. This is true: that is what the legislation does. It is a foretaste of what we can expect from the new industrial legislation. I see that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has come to the table. I welcome him into this place because I think there has to be some honest talking about the agenda that the government is pursuing.</para>
<para>I have mentioned before this question of the AWAs and the governmentâs fetish, its obsession, with establishing AWAs. Only two days ago there was an interesting case in South Australia dealing with the question of Australian workplace agreements. Remember, when Australian workplace agreements were introduced the Prime Minister made a fundamental promise, which was referred to in this chamber yesterday. His promise at that time was to guarantee that people would not be worse off. It was an explicit, rock solid, ironclad guarantee. That is what the Prime Minister said when he told us what would be the framework, the context, in which Australian workplace agreements would come into effect. We know he is no longer making that commitment. We have asked him time and time again; we asked him again yesterday in theÂ  parliament, but he refuses to give that undertaking. So workers know that they are going to get dudded under the new legislation.</para>
<para>Let us just have a look at the record of what has happened to AWAs with the guarantee. This is very instructive. Two days ago a judgment came down in the Industrial Relations Court of South Australia. It was Yurong Holdings Pty Ltd v Deanna Renella. Yurong happens to run the Bakers Delight franchise in South Australia and Deanna Renella is a year 10 student who was employed by the Bakers Delight franchise under an AWA. This year 10 student was someone who the Howard government would have us believe is free to enter into an AWA and will not be worse off. In fact, what happened to Deanna is that she was presented with a standard issue AWA pro forma and told to sign itâeffectively, âIf you want the job, sign it.â That is negotiation John Howard styleâand the government have the gall to criticise the ACTU for its advertising campaign on television that depicts that very thing. This is what happened in this case; this has been to court.</para>
<para>She was presented with a two-page pattern Australian workplace agreement. Can you just imagine a year 10 student negotiating with the boss of the Bakers Delight franchise on her own with no support? She is supposed to, in the Prime Ministerâs eyes, be there negotiating as an equal. It gave her a flat rate of $8.35 an hour, which is half of the adult rate of $16.70. The AWA provided for no annual leave, no annual leave loading and no sick leave. And John Howard is saying that this person will not be worse off. She was not alone. There were more than 50 AWAs approved in the same terms as this AWA. Isnât it strange that more than 50 employees negotiating as equals with their employer all came to exactly the same position?</para>
<para>I also find it somewhat ironic that this is a government that will not allow pattern bargaining, as it calls it, in a collective sense in the industrial framework but is condoning and encouraging pattern bargaining in an AWA sense. It will not allow pattern bargaining, it will not allow collectivism for protection, but it will allow pattern AWAs to undermine, strip away, deny and disadvantage lots of Australians in this countryâand vulnerable, young Australians. That is what this case shows. I believe, and I have always believed, that it is important to have an industrial relations framework, a legislative framework, by which the government encourages the holding of the ring. But it is always going to be a rotten system where the government takes sides, where it gets in and tilts the playing field and where it weights it in favour of one of the opponents in the contest rather than trying to get consultation and agreement.</para>
<para>But it is very interesting that, despite this terrible set of circumstances that this young girl faced, she did get justice in the court. The court ordered that Bakers Delight should pay the employee the deficiency and make up for the underpayment. They ordered something close to a $1,500 payment. I think it is very interesting to hear what a judge in our systemâin the South Australian Industrial Relations Courtâhad to say about this practice. I ask the minister to keep this in mind when he talks so kindly about the advantage of Australian workplace agreements. This is what the judge had to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">In considering this submission I leave aside for the moment the manifest disadvantage of the respective bargaining positions of a 15-year-old Year 10 student negotiating her terms with an experienced businessman.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This is the point I made before, that here is a judge who has to look at the facts and consider the circumstance that comes before him and he says it is unfair, that it is not an equal footing, because the employer is going to have it all over the individual. That is why unions formed. They formed to give a more effective countervailing balance to the circumstance. This government wants to strip away that collective support and that collective protection. The judge also accepted the employer had the right to make the acceptance of an AWA a precondition to employment. He accepts that that is the circumstance but goes on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Irrespective of the fact ... this is hardly a matter of real choice from the employeeâs point of view.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So there you have it. The government has created a circumstance where it talks the talk of choice but this judge says choice does not really exist. The report goes on:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">But the âplain factâ ... was that the employee âwas paid grossly less than she was entitled to as a minimumâ under the State award.</para>
<para class="block">The employerâs contention that the OEA had approved other AWAs in the same terms âdoes nothing to improve [the employerâs] argumentâ, Judge McCusker said.</para>
<para class="block">The employer also argued the employee was part-time rather than casual, but the judge found that the award defined a part-timer as having a 12-hour weekly engagement, while the employee worked between 10 and 15 hours a week.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This is a stark example of this brave new world that this government wants our industrial relations system to embark upon. It talks the words of choice; it talks the words of freedom and the rights and flexibility. Flexibility downwards, that is what it is, and it is also reweighting the system so that the advantage that the employer has over vulnerable employees can be exploited to the hilt. I think that that is a very chilling tale of the circumstances.</para>
<para>The fact is that the only reason this young lady was able to get her money paid was that the employer had technically failed to lodge the AWA. That technical failing meant, according to the judge, that she was protected by the existing state law and therefore entitled to the back pay. But there are 50 other employees, and he expressed concern about the fact that, despite his being able to order restitution for this person because of the technical failing on the part of the employer, that would seem not to be redress for the other 50 who are being forced into this same insidious set of circumstances.</para>
<para>Little wonder the Prime Minister refuses to restate his guarantee of a no disadvantage test in this parliament. He gave that guarantee back in 1996 and it is worthless. We know the word of the Prime Minister has increasingly been shown to be worthless. But we are dealing here with peopleâs livesâtheir entitlements, their standard of living, their dignity and their ability to get a start in life and work their way up. What they are being taught here is that there is a society, a norm, an opportunity and a framework that enables those people to be exploited.</para>
<para>I think increasingly, as these examples come to the fore, and particularly when we see the unveiling of the governmentâs new industrial relations legislation, people will understand their vulnerability and the threat that they are under. That is why you are seeing masses in the streets protesting against what they understand to be the governmentâs law. Do not let John Howard ever say he is the best friend a worker has ever had. Ask Deanna whether she thinks the Prime Minister is her best friend. That so-called best friend introduced a system that enabled her to be paid half of what she was entitled to, and he calls that no disadvantage. Now that we have not even got a no disadvantage test, expect more of the same. This bill should be opposed because it reflects the very worst of where we should be heading in an industrial relations sense. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para class="block">I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the bill. In my second reading speech on 9 March 2005 for the <inline ref="R2292">Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005</inline>, I indicated that further amendments would be introduced. The amendments that I am moving today are being introduced to include in the bill key measures originally contained in the <inline ref="R1922">Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003</inline>. These amendments will further enhance the governmentâs legislative response to the Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry. Other elements of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2003 will be considered in the context of the governmentâs broader workplace relation reformsâfor example, provisions relating to right of entry and freedom of association. The amendments will, firstly, establish an Australian Building and Construction Commissioner; secondly, provide for the Federal Safety Commissioner; thirdly, improve the bargaining framework by prohibiting certain coercive and discriminatory conduct; and, fourthly, improve the compliance regime by increasing penalties and enhancing access to damages for unlawful conduct.</para>
<para>Amendments to chapter 1 will insert the main object of the act, which is to provide an improved workplace relations framework for building work so that it is carried out fairly, efficiently and productively for the benefit of all building industry participants and the Australian economy as a whole. The amendments will also insert additional definitions. A new chapter 2 will deliver the governmentâs commitment to establish the Office of the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner as a regulatory body for the building and construction industry. The body is to be headed by the ABC Commissioner and will have wide-ranging powers to monitor, investigate and enforce federal workplace relations law and the building code and to refer other matters to the appropriate federal, state or territory agency.</para>
<para>A new chapter 3 will allow the minister to issue a building code, if necessary and appropriate. Amendments to insert chapter 4 are the governmentâs response to the royal commissionâs recommendations concerning occupational health and safety. The chapter establishes the Federal Safety Commissioner and provides for the establishment of an Occupational Health and Safety Accreditation Scheme to be administered by the Federal Safety Commissioner. The accreditation scheme will ensure that any person contracting with the Australian government for building work must meet certain occupational health and safety standards.</para>
<para>Importantly, amendments to chapter 6 provide improved access to sanctions against unlawful industrial action in the form of injunctions and expand the exceptions to protected industrial action. A new chapter 8 will deliver on the recommendations of the royal commission designed to eliminate the coercion and discrimination that has plagued workplace relations in this industry. The amendments prohibit the coercion of persons in relation to the engagement of subcontractors and employees and coercion or undue pressure in relation to certified agreements or choice of superannuation fund. Discrimination on the basis of the type of or parties to an industrial instrument covering a personâs employees is also prohibited.</para>
<para>The proposed amendments to chapter 12 will enhance the requirement that building industry participants comply with relevant laws, including by providing an appropriate investigatory and enforcement regime. Part 1 of this chapter sets out penalties for contravention of civil penalty provisions, orders that a court may make and who may apply for these orders. The measures in part 1 also include giving the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner and the Australian building construction inspectors standing to bring proceedings for contraventions of civil penalty provisions and introducing a two-tier civil penalty regime. The first tier, which deals with more serious contraventions, provides for a maximum penalty of 1,000 penalty units for a body corporate and 200 penalty units in other cases. The second tier, which deals with less serious contraventions, provides for a maximum penalty of 100 penalty units for a body corporate and 20 penalty units in other cases. By operation of section 4AA of the Crimes Act 1914, the value of a penalty unit is currently $110. Part 2 sets out the compliance powers of the ABC Commissioner, ABC inspectors and federal safety officers.</para>
<para>Amendments to chapter 13 will deal with miscellaneous matters, including the following matters identified by the royal commission: rendering project agreements not certified under the Workplace Relations Act unenforceable; making organisations responsible for the conduct of their officials, employees and members unless they take reasonable steps to prevent such conduct; the protection and dissemination to other agencies of confidential information; and empowering the ABC Commissioner to intervene in court and commission proceedings.</para>
<para>I am also introducing amendments to the <inline ref="R2293">Building and Construction Industry Improvement (Consequential and Transitional) Bill 2005</inline>. These amendments will establish the Office of the ABC Commissioner as a prescribed agency under the Financial Management and Accountability Act and provide the ABC Commissioner with access to records of the Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry. I commend the amendments to the House. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talker>
<para>âLike the governmentâs proposed industrial relations changes, these amendments are extreme, divisive and unfair. They reflect the fact that, now that the government has all power in the Senate, it has all power under the sun and it is getting too close to the sun and it is certainly going to its head. I have two simple points. The minister did not even bother rising to his feet to respond to the second reading debate and the concerns expressed by members of the House and, secondly, in his contribution on the amendments, which go to some 30-odd pagesâa substantial effective bill in its own rightâhe has not bothered to explain how the government has deleted safeguards inserted in previous legislation at the insistence of the Labor Party and the Democrats in the Senate. So there was no effort to respond to the concerns and no effort to explain to the House why legitimate safeguards previously inserted have been removed.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Because these amendments are so substantial, I will place a number of things formally on the record, effectively by way of a de facto second reading debate speech. These amendments create the Australian Building and Construction Commission, or the ABCC, and provide that body with coercive powers to gather information and prosecute people associated with the very broadly defined building industry. The role of the ABCC is currently undertaken by the Building Industry Taskforce with powers provided under the Workplace Relations Amendment (Codifying Contempt Offences) Act 2004. Once this bill is passed, the Building Industry Taskforce will convert into the ABCC. The provisions of the codifying contempt act referring to the BIT will thus become effectively a dead letter and remove the safeguards previously inserted by the Senate. As I have indicated, Labor in conjunction with the Democrats in the Senate amended the codifying contempt act to mitigate the worst elements of the coercive powers to be provided to the Building Industry Taskforce and none of these protections have been included in respect of the ABCC by the government. None of those amendments have been included in these amendments. This will have the effect of providing to the ABCC all the coercive powers proposed and not previously passed under the codifying contempt bill without any of the associated checks and balances.</para>
<para>The bill and the governmentâs amendments empower the ABCC to demand answers to such questions as: are you or have you at any time been a member of a trade union or any political party? To be subject to such questioning, a building industry employee need have done nothing wrong nor have been suspected of doing anything wrong. Further, the investigator can demand the production of phone records, bank account records and any other document. An employee who fails to cooperate fully will have committed a criminal offence and the punishment will be an automatic and mandatory prison term. Laborâs amendments to the codifying contempt act had meant that there was an alternative financial penalty available to the courts rather than a mandatory prison sentence. The ABCC will have much stronger powers than any police force in the country.</para>
<para>Labor deplore criminal behaviour, whether it is in the building industry or anywhere else, and during the last parliament Labor offered to facilitate the passage of coercive powers if they were limited to investigating suspected criminality. The government declined Laborâs offers, insisting that the coercive powers must extend to non-criminal breaches of the Workplace Relations Act. In the same debate Labor supported separate amendments that would prevent anyone sentenced to jail for violence from being a union official, whether the sentence is served or suspended. Labor will not tolerate union violence or criminal behaviour, but nor do we support the denial of civil liabilities to innocent Australians working in the building industry.</para>
<para>Let me detail some of the provisions of the codifying contempt act that have been removed by the government in the amendments presented to the House. First is the provision limiting the criteria that allowed the Building Industry Taskforce to invoke its coercive powers to investigations of criminal offences. These amendments mean that the ABCC can use coercive powers in investigating any breach of the Workplace Relations Act, award or agreement, including investigating ordinary industrial activities of unions such as meetings with members. If the government claims that these new powers are needed to address alleged criminal activity in the building industry, the amended powers enabled them to do so under the codifying contempt act. Labor is committed to removing any criminality that may exist in any workplace, including in the building industry, but Labor does not believe that the task force or the ABCC is the right body to investigate such matters. Criminal matters should be investigated by the police forces. Labor is also concerned about giving the ABCC coercive powers in respect of an almost unlimited range of industrial relations matters.</para>
<para>The second area was Laborâs amendment that required the approval of a Federal Court judge for the use of coercive powers. This inserted a truly independent element to the process. Federal Court judges routinely deal with industrial relations and other matters. They are well placed to determine whether coercive powers are appropriate or necessary in any particular case. Requiring a warrant from the Federal Court also went a long way to ensuring that building workers do not have lesser civil liberties than those being questioned by ASIO about terrorism. <inline font-style="italic">(Extension of time granted)</inline> The involvement of the Federal Court was appropriate given the gravity and serious potential consequences of the use and potential abuse of these coercive powers. The powers to enter and inspect records proposed in the amendments are akin to a police search warrant. The government amendments do not propose to provide a safeguard of requiring a judicial officer to approve the use of these powers.</para>
<para>Third, Labor amended the codifying contempt bill mandatory jail term by giving the court the capacity to either fine or imprison an individual who does not comply with a warrant. It is simply commonsense to give the court a capacity to impose a monetary penalty instead of a mandatory jail sentence if the court thinks that is appropriate in the circumstances. Imprisonment has the potential to make a martyr of the person who defies a warrant. In any event, it may be that in some cases a high financial penalty may be more of a burden on an individual than a short-term imprisonment, but to deprive a court of this sensible exercise of discretion is ludicrous in the extreme.</para>
<para>Finally, Laborâs amendment to the contempt bill deleted the requirement that a person provide information when this might be contrary to another law or might incriminate that person. This of course provides protection against self-incrimination, a fundamental principle of natural justice, highlighted by Mr Justice Murphy in the High Court case of Pyneboard Pty Ltd v Trade Practices Commission in 1983 where he said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The privilege against compulsory self-incrimination is part of the common law of human rights. It is based on the desire to protect personal freedom and human dignity. These social values justify the impediment the privilege presents to judicial or other investigation. It protects the innocent as well as the guilty from the indignity and invasion of privacy which occurs in compulsory self-incrimination; it is societyâs acceptance of the inviolability of the human personality.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It is also worth noting that in the Senate on the codifying contempt legislation the Democrats also successfully pursued amendments to place a limit on investigations not being âminor or pettyâ. This provision has also not been retained in these amendments, thus enabling these extreme coercive powers to be used to investigate trivial, minor or petty offences.</para>
<para>Even had those amendments to the contempt act been contained, Labor would still be extremely concerned about giving the ABCC the coercive powers to gather information. The ABCCâs predecessor, the Building Industry Taskforce, has had an entirely antiunion focus since it was established in 2002. The task force has shown little or no interest in important issues in the industry such as the nonpayment of employee entitlements, sham corporate structures and occupational health and safety concerns. In the light of this highly unbalanced and ideological track record, Labor does not believe that the task forceâs successor, the ABCC, should receive these additional coercive powers. Laborâs amendments to the codifying contempt act restricted the scope of these coercive powers to criminal offences and inserted some semblance to fair process by requiring the approval of Federal Court judges before the coercive powers could be used. As I have indicated, these protections have now been removed. As part of the amendments to the codifying contempt act, guidelines were enacted about the use of the Building Industry Taskforceâs coercive powers. These guidelines are in the form of a disallowable instrument, and the amendments proposed by the government to the House in respect of the ABCC contain no comparable facilities to constrain these uses.</para>
<para>There are some additional criticisms of these amendments. They provide the ABCC with the unlimited right to intervene in court and Industrial Relations Commission hearings and to seek injunctions. Proposed section 253 of the amendments explicitly does not require the ABCC to make any undertakings as to damages, so the ABCC can seek an injunction and the parties suffering any loss as consequence of this injunction cannot seek damages. These are unusual and extraordinary powers. The amendments proposed reinstate the provisions from the 2003 bill that provide an exemption from the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 for decisions made under the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005, removing a remaining avenue for redress for action taken by the ABCCâin other words, removing the capacity for judicial review of the administrative decision-making processes.</para>
<para>Finally, the amendments provide some legislative basis for the Building Code but provide no detail. Thus, the current Building Code, which requires employees to comply else they fail to win Commonwealth construction contracts, can continue to operate without proper processes attached. It effectively provides the minister with a blank cheque to impose conditions on construction employers without requiring an appropriate level of certainty or transparency. There exists a high level of uncertainty among many employers about the compliance with the Commonwealthâs Building Code and this creates uncertainty in this very important industry. It is quite clear that the lack of detail is to effectively give the minister a blank cheque and to force members of the construction industry to utilise individual contracts when they would otherwise use collective bargaining. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThis is a day of outrage in the Australian parliament, when the minister has brought in amendments to a bill which are much more wide-ranging and far-reaching than the provisions in the original bill. I have now obtained a copy of the introductory speech by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations on these amendments and nowhere in the speech does it refer to the true intent of this legislation. The true intent of this legislation is to remove all of those constraints on the exercise of power by the Australian Building and Construction Commission that were applied as a result of negotiations between the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats in June 2004. Those restraints were as follows. Firstly, we had successfully included in that legislation, in the amendments in the Senate, a provision which meant that this commission would not be able to investigate minor or petty matters. These amendments remove that constraint on the commission, so it is now empowered to investigate minor and petty matters. Let us understand that. This commission and this minister want the power to investigate minor and petty matters as a result of the clear exclusion of that provision by this amending legislation in front of us.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The legislation also removes any requirement for the preparation of guidelines as a disallowable instrument so that we would in fact have some limitations on the powers of the commission. In speaking on those guidelines on 24 June 2004 the minister said:</para>
<quote>
<para>The powers are similar to those which the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission have at the present time. Indeed, after agreement with the Democrats last night, we will model the guidelines on the ACCC guidelines that apply to the exercise of powers under section 155 of the Trade Practices Act.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">There are no guidelines as a result of this legislation. Why? Because the minister, the Prime Minister and this government do not want any fetters or constraints. They do not want any restraints whatsoever on the operation of the Building and Construction Industry Commission.</para>
<para>A further restraint that we applied as a result of those negotiations that ran into the wee small hours of 24 June 2004 was that it would not be possible for people to incriminate themselvesâpeople would have protection against self-incrimination. That has gone. As a result of this legislation that has not properly been debated in the parliament you can be obliged to incriminate yourself. You can be approached by an inspector from the Building and Construction Industry Commission demanding that you produce your phone records. There are no effective constraints on the powers of the commission. You can be required to respond to a question: âAre you or have you ever been a member of a trade union?â This is McCarthyism. This is a witch-hunt. This is a denial of fundamental civil liberties that are available to people who may have information about terrorist activities. Those civil liberties are available to people who may have information about terrorist activities and they are now being denied through this legislation to people who work in the building and construction industry whether or not they are suspected of having done anything wrong.</para>
<para>If I could rate these amongst the most odious provisions then surely the most odious is that there is now no financial penalty. When I spoke to the minister and we had discussions about this, I pointed out that there was no provision for a financial penalty for noncompliance with an inspectorâs request. The minister said, âThatâs reasonable; we will put one in.â Now that this government has unfettered power it has taken that out, so the penalty is six months jail. Something that the minister said was reasonable on 24 June in negotiationsâthat is, that we should put in a financial penaltyâhas been removed and nowhere in the ministerâs speech does he refer to the removal of that financial penalty. He wants people to be able to be put into jail, even if they have done nothing wrong, simply for refusing to produce records such as telephone accounts and bank accounts to an inspector. This is a fundamental breach of liberties in this country. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI rise to oppose these amendments. Let me say at the outset, before we go to the outrageous implications of these amendments that the member for Perth and the member for Rankin have referred to, that the government is treating the parliament with contempt. This was a bill that came to us, and we had some notification of a watered down versionâwe spoke about it earlierâbut these amendments were introduced into the House only yesterday. They include far-reaching powers which have been debated in the parliament and watered down. But this government, in the arrogance of its newfound authority and power in the Senate, has ignored all of the advice, all of the compromise and all of the positive suggestions that can make this a fairer piece of legislation and has deceitfully brought the legislation back in without any notice, without any discussion and now without any explanation as to why that which was previously negotiated to be put forward now no longer goes forward. Do you know what it reminds me of? It reminds me of the midnight cabinet meeting that authorised a change of legislation to the corporations power to justify what Patrickâs was doing in sacking their whole work force on the waterfront. This is now the midnight slip in terms of a range of new initiatives aimed at unionists and attacking peopleâs civil liberties.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>There are two fundamental problems with this batch of initiatives. The investigator can question unionists and can demand the production of information even when there is no suspicion of wrongdoing by that person. If there is refusal to comply, the penalty is not a fine; it is jail. Then there is the amendment to clause 231 which just strips away peopleâs fundamental civil liberties. Listen to this:</para>

</quote>
<para class="block">That is a huge hit at a fundamental civil liberty in our societyâthe right to refuse to respond in circumstances when you think it might incriminate you. Where is this government going in terms of the police state, the penalties, the jailing, the fear and the intimidation? That is what this legislation represents and it is the forerunner of what we can expect in the new industrial relations code that is coming forward. This is a government not interested in openly having these debates; it is a government whose minister comes in and spends five minutes explaining these changes when there have been debates time and time again not just in this chamber but in another chamber. We know how this government is going to run things from now on. It has the numbers so it does not care. It does not care about peopleâs civil liberties and it does not care what sorts of penalties it is giving people to impose on those that they can stalk, question and make demands of. This is creating a fear state, and that is an outrage.</para>
<para>The minister is walking away from the table. I do not know whether he is ashamed about this; I assume, deep down, he might be. I think he did represent some civil libertarian views at some stage in his life. How could a minister such as he come before this parliament with a piece of legislation drafted in this way? Do not just think of it in terms of an attack on unions. It is that in spades. We have talked about that before. It is an attack, in particular, on the building and construction unions but it smacks at the very heart of every individualâs civil liberties. I have not heard the minister respond to that poor girl in South Australia who was dudded under an Australian workplace agreement. This government is not accountable; it does not have to explain or defend its position. Why? Because it has the numbers. It is an outrage and these amendments should be defeated. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThe <inline ref="R2292">Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill 2005</inline> truly represents one of the worst aspects of what this government is all about and what it represents. This bill is a fundamental attack on workers and on peopleâs civil liberties, their rights and their capacity to carry out their lives and their work as required. In no sense can anyone look at this and say that it is fair, just or necessary in achieving anything that the government wants to achieve in relation to the building and construction industries.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>If the government and the minister were actually committed to cleaning up any criminal activity within that industry or anywhere else, then that should be supported. The Labor Party does not support criminal activity and believes that there are mechanisms and ways that we can work to make sure that those matters of criminality are not an issue. But that is not what this bill is about. This bill is a fundamental attack on unions and workers. You only need to go to parts of the billâand particularly to some of the amendments that Labor is moving and what we have done to codify contemptâto understand how pernicious and bad this bill is. As an example, you can look at the powers that are needed by the commission to address criminal activity. There is no way in the world that it warrants the investigator having the power only to hand out jail sentencesârather than leaving it up to a judge to decide whether the more appropriate penalty would be a fine or jail time. It would be more appropriate for that decision to be made by a court or a judge, not the federal government. I believe imprisonment is not the solution to some of the problems that exist in the industry, and does not help the government in what it is trying to achieve in this legislation.</para>
<para>There is no doubt that if you go through parts of the bill you will see that it is about giving unfettered power to a body controlled by the government. The bill is about the government using the sort of power it has now in the Senate and in the House. It is about the government losing sight of the key issues in terms of workersâ rights and the rights and civil liberties of ordinary people. This bill is all about fear and intimidation. You will hear the minister talking about fear and intimidation in the industry. I see the minister shaking his head but he is doing exactly the thing that he is trying to prevent. He is putting in place a regime of intimidation and fear which will force people to do things which are not, in the normal course, regarded as fair or as providing natural justice. People should be given opportunities to defend themselves, to seek legal representation and not be treated as a criminal by the commission or the investigator, which is what the government is trying to do.</para>
<para>This is just another step in the governmentâs agenda to attack workersâ rights. The bill is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt by this government and the minister to continue with their program of breaking the backs of unions. The bill will certainly not do that. All this will do is create an environment of fear and intimidation. It will turn those workplaces which the government are supposedly trying to make more cooperative and productive workplaces into less productive and cooperative workplaces. As the member for Hotham mentioned earlier, this follows on from those days when the former Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Peter Reith, made his shameless attack on the wharfies and harbour workers, as the government was doing at that time.</para>
<para>It is necessary for Labor and the minor parties in the Senate to take the edge off some of the worst aspects of the governmentâs legislation. We need to make sure that the courts have the power to decide whether there should be fines or imprisonment. We need to make sure that this government does not create a regime of fear and intimidation by trying to make people provide information, which is contrary to other laws. It is a basic right for people not to be forced to give that information, particularly if they have not been accused of anything and have not done anything wrong. We are seeing the government abusing its power. It is drunk with power in both houses. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThis consideration in detail stage is meant to be an opportunity for members of parliament to question the minister. If this is to be a genuine opportunity, I want Minister Andrews to listen to what I am saying. I am going to ask him four questions and I would expect that he would have the capacity and the willingness to give four answers to those questions. The first question is: Minister, why did you remove from the legislation the provision for financial penalties for noncompliance with an inspectorâs request to produce documents, such that now the only penalty available to a court is six months jail? Why did you remove that provision when we discussed the reasonableness of having a financial penalty?</para>
</talk.start>
<para>My second question is: Minister, why did you remove the provision that prevented the Australian Building and Construction Commission from investigating minor or petty matters? To me, the answer would seem to be that you want the commission to be able to investigate minor and petty matters as part of the intimidation of people whom you suspect of being members of trade unions, so that you can sic Building and Construction Commission investigators onto people simply because they are members of the trade union movement.</para>
<para>The third question is: Minister, having agreed with the Democrats and Labor to the application of the guidelines as a disallowable instrument to provide limitations on the investigative powers and conduct of the Australian Building and Construction Commission, why did you remove those guidelines in this legislation? The fourth question is: why did you remove from the legislation the protection against self-incrimination such that this legislation now means a person can be required to incriminate themselves, as expressed in section 231?</para>
<para>Mr Deputy Speaker Somlyay, I earnestly seek your assistance in ensuring that the minister answers these questions. If the minister is unprepared and unwilling to answer these four basic questions he is surely treating this parliament and the Australian people with contemptâand the irony is that we have been debating amendments to a bill that codifies contempt. This legislation is an outrage. The minister has snuck into the parliament amendments that are far-reaching and deny civil liberties to ordinary people simply on the basis that they may be members of the trade union movement. Let us understand the full gravity of what is going on here today. The minister does not want to be accountable to the Australian people and the Australian parliament. It is incumbent upon him to answer these four specific questions. Why did you remove the financial penalties? Why did you remove the provision preventing the investigation of minor or petty offences? Why did you remove the guidelines that were a disallowable instrument to constrain the operations of the commission? Why did he insert in the bill a power to require people to incriminate themselves?</para>

<para>âI am waiting patiently for the minister to get to his feet and respond to the various questions asked of him by the member for Rankin. I hope that at some stage he does, but, if he does not, it would not surprise me. These amendments reflect how extreme, divisive and unfair the government is proposing to be now that it has all power under the sun. Having gained all power under the sun, what does the minister do? The 34 pages of amendments effectively came in yesterday. They remove the safeguard provisions inserted by the Senate to previous comparable legislation. In the course of the ministerâs contribution today he could not even be bothered getting to his feet to respond to concerns raised by members during the second reading debate on the bill itself as introduced. When he presented in five minutes the governmentâs reasons for the introduction of these amendments, he gave no explanation, no rationale and no justification for the removal of the significant safeguards inserted by the Senate on a previous occasion.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is quite clear that the government, now having all power under the sun, wants the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner also to have all power under the sun, without limitation. We see the government investing unlimited coercive power in the commissioner. We see the requirement for Federal Court approval of subpoenas removed. We see the capacity for judicial review of administrative action by the commissioner removed. We see mandatory jail sentences imposed on the judiciary. We see the longstanding principle of self-incrimination removed. And for all of these things we see the removal of the provision previously inserted that these matters should not relate to minor or trivial offences.</para>
<para>Having gained all power under the sun, the government gets the Senate out of the way and now wants to get some basic fundamentals out of the way and give the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner all power under the sun. The government has done all this by way of amendment and with no justification for the extreme approach it has decided to take. It has given no rationale for walking away from the safeguards previously inserted by the Senate. As has been said by my colleagues the member for Rankin, the member for Oxley and the member for Hotham, this is a portent of what is to come now that the government has complete control of the parliament. Drunk with arrogance and power, the government is removing sensible and basic safeguards in its ideological zealotry and pursuit of anything it regards as associated with a trade union or the trade union movement.</para>

<para>âListening to the members opposite, you would think this was the first time these matters had ever been raised or debated. The reality is that these are matters which the government has been pursuing since 2003. They were set out extensively in a bill brought to the parliament in 2003. They were extensively debated not only in this place but also in the Senate. They were the subject of a Senate inquiry which was taken around the country for some nine or 10 months, by Labor members in particular, at which all of this detail was looked at. The government has never resiled from its view that the propositions put in the 2003 bill were necessary to clean up what is quite clearly a unique industry in terms of illegal and improper activities and, indeed, criminal activity.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I remind honourable members that this legislation arises from the extensive findings of the Cole Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry, in which Justice Cole found that there was a widespread culture of thuggery, intimidation and criminal activity. In his report, Justice Cole said:</para>
<quote>
<para>At the heart of the findings is lawlessness. It is exhibited in many ways. There are breaches of the criminal law. There are breaches of laws of general application to all Australians where the sanction is a penalty rather than possible imprisonment. There are breaches of many provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He also said:</para>
<quote>
<para>These findings demonstrate an industry which departs from the standards of commercial and industrial conduct exhibited in the rest of the Australian economy. They mark the industry as singular. They indicate an urgent need for structural and cultural reform.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is what this government has been pursuing. This industry stands out in terms of the unlawful, corrupt and criminal activities which occur in it. On top of that, this industry has the worst record of industrial disputation in the entire country. It has the worst record in terms of occupational safety and health in this country. It is unique. The Labor Party come in here and say, âWe donât want criminal activity in the building and construction industry. We donât want the sort of thuggery that occurs there,â but when it comes to actually doing something about cleaning it up they run a mile away from it. They conduct a Senate inquiry that drags on for month after month, rather than being prepared to stand up and do something in relation to this industry.</para>
<para>The answer to the questions of the honourable members opposite is quite simply that these are things which the government have been pursuing since 2003. We have not resiled from pursuing these matters and we will press to put in place legislation which will deal with the criminal activities in this particular industry. The report of the building industry task force which was tabled in this parliament last year clearly set out some of the activities that occur in this industry. In 2005 the task force received reports including union demands for $110 payments per employee from contractors for people who were not union members, pressure being applied to contractors with threats that work would stop because of alleged unsatisfactory amenities and pressure being applied to contractors to sign union agreements with threats that failure to sign would force the union to revoke concessions of being able to work on the lock-down weekend or the rostered day off. There are records after records of unlawful and criminal activities carried on in this industry. I say to the honourable members opposite who make the charge that this is something against unions: these provisions apply to all people; they apply to builders, to construction officials and to unions alike. This is not singling out unions. It is just doing what everybody knows is overdue and needs to be done: to clean up once and for all an industry which has been characterised by criminal activity for far too long. The Labor Party accept that this activity occurs but they have not got the guts to do something about it.</para>

<para>âThe government will be pleased to know that Labor will be supporting the <inline ref="R2382">Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2005</inline>, although I am not sure how much it will matter to them, because I suspect none of their members understand it. I have just spent some time trying to get my head across it. It is not my billâit is Senator Ludwigâsâand I am acting on his behalf in this place. It is a rather complex bill, and I suspect that the minister who will be winding up is struggling to understand the implications of these changes as well. Indeed, I challenge him to, without notes, explain the proposition to me.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The bill contains a number of essentially housekeeping changes to customs and excise regimes and one significant reduction in tariff protection. In item 1 the bill amends additional note 3(a) to chapter 22 of the tariff to insert 22 per cent as the upper limit of alcohol content in grape wine. The financial impact of the proposed amendment to additional note 3(a) to chapter 22 is difficult to quantify, but it is expected that it may result in a small increase in government revenueâin other words, it is yet another increase in tax.</para>
<para>The A New Tax System (Wine Equalisation Tax) Act specifies that wine subject to WET is not subject to an excise, but high alcohol wine with more than 22 per cent of ethyl alcohol does not fall within this provision and therefore is subject to an excise. But the rate of excise differs from the current customs duty on high alcohol imported wine. The bill corrects this anomaly and ensures imported wine of fresh grapes will attract customs duty at the same rate as the locally produced product. This is a rather belated clean-up of a significant anomaly. Given that the wine equalisation tax bill was considered in 1999 and came in in 2000, the minister needs to explain why it is that it took four years to address the suggested anomaly.</para>
<para>The bill also defines grape wine products. Items 2 and 3 relate to the definition of mock Irish Cream and wine based cream beverages. While the financial impact of these measures relating to the insertion of references to the additional note 4 into tariff subheadings is negligible, it is important to clarify a point in the Attorney-Generalâs speech, because readers seeking to understand the effect of this bill through that speech or those who go to the explanatory memorandum could find themselves in some confusion as to the treatment of products collectively known as âIrish Creamâ.</para>
<para>Real Irish Cream is made from whisky and there is a higher alcohol contentâaround 16 per cent or 17 per cent. Baileys Irish Cream and Feeneys Irish Cream are examples of such products. The imported spirit based Irish Cream is subject to the excise equivalent of $60.92 per litre of alcohol, plus a five per cent customs duty. No wonder it is out of reach of modest income earners. Similar locally manufactured product was subject to the excise rate of $60.92 per litre of alcohol. These whisky based products are not affected by the changes.</para>

<para>âThe product referred to by the minister is an imitation product with a substitute grape wine base and has an alcohol content of between 11 per cent and 12 per cent. OâMaras Irish Cream is an example of such a product. Imported wine based Irish Cream was subject to the excise regime and paid the excise equivalent rate of $60.92 per litre of alcohol, plus five per cent customs duties. Similar locally manufactured product attracted the wine equalisation tax, plus the GST. Post July 2005 wine based product is now subject to the wine equalisation tax at a rate of 29 per cent of the value of the taxable importation that is based on customs value, plus customs duty in this instance, which is free, plus international transport insurance, plus GST.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>That basically means we are aligning the wine equalisation tax legislation with the legislation that gives effect to the customs duty. That misalignment is causing different treatment for the domestic product from that which is applied to the imported product. In other words, we are whacking up the customs tariff in some circumstances on some imported product. Again, I invite the minister, in summaryâand other membersâto clarify that and attempt to give his own expression to that effect and to point out to me if I am wrong in any regard.</para>
<para>What this does highlight is the mess this government has found itself in with respect to both the implementation of the GST and the administration of wine tax in this country. When the GST was introduced, the government proposed that it was not, if you like, socially responsible for tax on wine to fall significantlyâI think it was in the high 30s, prior to the introduction of the GST, right down to 10 per centâso the government proposed a wine equalisation tax which was intended to hold it at the current level of taxation. The government promised, of course, that that application of the wine equalisation tax would be revenue neutral, but there was a sleight of hand because, at 29 per cent and with the compounding effect of the GST, the total application of tax on wine increased. From memory, the projection on additional revenue was in the order of $180 million annually, and the wine industry was not happy about that proposition. It lobbied to have the wine equalisation tax reduced to 24 per cent, a figure which, it argued on its economic modelling, would produce a revenue neutral effect to government.</para>
<para>Labor took a different view. We decided that this was an opportunity to boost wine tourism in regional areas. In this place I moved an amendment which would have given effect to a wine equalisation tax rebate for cellar door sales in regional areas, giving them a significant competitive advantage at a time when they are struggling to meet the market power of the major supermarket chains now involved in liquor sales, who are able to sell wines at a much cheaper rate than wine producers can at the cellar door. This would have been a significant competitive advantage for regional cellar door sales and, therefore, a significant boost to regional development, tourism and employment.</para>
<para>It is history now that the Treasurer, who I am pleased to see is with us today, rejected Laborâs very sensible amendment. But under community pressure, and pressure from the Wine Federation of Australia in particular, the government introduced in the Senate its own version of Laborâs initiative. However, rather than go for a rebate at the cellar door, the government decided to institute a highly complex rebate which involved the participation of the states and which added a significant compliance cost burden.</para>

<para class="block">As I was saying before I was rudely interrupted, the government proposed not to embrace Laborâs rebate and instead introduced a highly complex rebate for cellar door operators, leading to significant additional compliance costs. Alas, it passed through the Senate and was approved on the numbers in this place. That is the system that the industry has been living with since the introduction of the GST in 2000.</para>
<para>Under more recent pressure from the industry, the government decided to extend its rebate to all sales of wine, not just cellar door sales in regional areas, up to the first one million litres. I acknowledge that this did take a number of players out of the wine equalisation tax system, but again it has created all sorts of anomalies. We saw one of those yesterday in this place when we had to extend the wine equalisation tax rebate to New Zealand producers of wine. In other words, in future the Australian Taxation Office will be sending cheques to producers of New Zealand wine as a rebate for the wine equalisation tax paid. So instead of fixing the problem by reconsidering the rate of the WET, which would have been the sensible thing to do, and going to a rebate giving effect to a reduction in the WET, the government put in place a botched system that has created other problems and resulted in this extraordinary circumstance in which we will be sending tax cheques to producers of New Zealand wine.</para>
<para>I made the point yesterday that it raises the question of whether this will have knock-on implications for our other trading partners. I know that the CER is a somewhat different document from the USFTA, for exampleâand any FTA we might sign with the government of the Peoples Republic of Chinaâin that the US document tends to be prescriptive but the CER tends to be open slather on all goods. So there is a difference. But this must surely put Australia under pressure when negotiating future FTAs to extend the same treatment under the WET rebate to other trading partners.</para>
<para>This is the situation you can find yourself in when you botch the tax system in the first place. The governmentâs treatment of the wine industry under the GST banner has been nothing short of hopeless, and again today we are seeing the consequences, with anomalies being driven out of the system some five years after the introduction of the GST. Yet the government on a regular basis still likes to tell us what a wonderful tax it is and how it has been great for small businessesâsmall businesses that are now 40 per cent more likely to be indebted to the tax office as a result of the GST. Among those small businesses will of course be many small wine producers who run cellar door outlets.</para>
<para>Items 4 and 6 of the bill make significant changes to the tariff concessions system. Tariff concessions provide concessional rates for imported goods when there are no substitutable domestically produced goods available. Goods that are known as business inputs, and which are subject to a tariff concession order, currently attract a general duty of three per cent. This is basically a specified form of tariff protection for Australian industries that produce inputs or finished products where there are no domestic industries or substitutes for internationally produced products.</para>
<para>This tariff works like other tariffs hampering the efficiency of Australian industry. The greatest benefits of tariff reform accrue to those who liberalise their own regimes. Consequently, this tariff will improve our efficiency and eliminate business input costs. It is estimated that the amendments related to the removal of the three per cent customs duty that applies to goods which are subject to a TCR will result in forgone duty of some $200 million in 2005-06, $320 million in 2007-08 and some $340 million in 2008-09. Labor supports this measure. As a trading nation, ongoing trade liberalisation is important to our local economy, and this will add to the efficiency of the local economy and of course to our international competitiveness in an increasingly competitive world. But the government will need to do much more than this.</para>
<para>In the Australian economy at the moment, many things need to be done to improve our productivity and international competitiveness. The most obvious problem, of course, is the skills crisis in this country. The skills crisis has been identified by the OECD, the Reserve Bank and just about every economic think tank in Australia and overseas, but the government is in denial in this issue. It continues to refuse to concede that there is a problem. I want to give the government an example of how extensive this problem is. Muswellbrook Shire Council in my electorate has done a very good thing. It has taken the time and invested the money to do a survey of the shireâs skills shortage. I want to share with the House some of the results. In Muswellbrook, we are short of 49 boilermakers, 11 electricians, 17 fitters and turners, seven motor mechanics, five miners, one mining engineer, four motor vehicle parts and accessories fitters and five plumbers.</para>
<para>This is in one relatively small community in my electorate. Of course, these significant skills shortages are affecting the capacity of that local economy to grow and therefore hampering the local economyâs ability to improve living standards for local people. So we support this measure, but I send a very clear message to the government that much more needs to be done. The government has been resting for almost 10 years on the very good structural changes Labor made when last in office. The reform process has come to a halt; it has stalled and it is about time we kick-started it again.</para>

<para>âI rise in support of the <inline ref="R2382">Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2005</inline>. This bill contains amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 that have previously been introduced into the parliament as customs tariff proposals. The bill proposes to amend additional note 3(a) to chapter 22 of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 by inserting a 22 per cent upper limit on alcohol content in respect of grape wine as defined by the note. This note was inserted into the Customs Tariff Act 1995 on 1 July 2000. Under the Excise Tariff Act 1921, wine, as defined in subdivision 31-A of the A New Tax System (Wine Equalisation Tax) Act 1999, is not excisable. Any locally manufactured wine that does not fall into that definition is excisable.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Currently, additional note 3(a) states no upper limit and describes grape wine as a beverage that has an alcoholic strength by volume exceeding 1.15 per centâother than clause 2208.20, which relates to spirits obtained by distilling grape wine or grape marc. In July 2000, regulation 31-2.01 was inserted into the WET regulations so that wine for the purposes of subdivision 31-A of the WET act must contain less than 22 per cent by volume of ethyl alcohol. Hence, wine with more than 22 per cent by volume of ethyl alcohol that is manufactured in Australia is excisable. However, due to the note in the Customs Tariff Act 1995, imported wine with more than 22 per cent by volume of ethyl alcohol is not subject to the same rate of customs duty as the excise rate for locally manufactured wine. This amendment will ensure that imported wine of fresh grapes that does not comply with the revised additional note will attract customs duty at the same rate as excise duty on similar, locally manufactured product.</para>
<para>The alteration relating to additional note 3 to chapter 22 was included in Customs Tariff Proposal No. 3 (2005), to take effect on 1 July 2005. The customs tariff proposal mechanism is used for effecting alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1995, particularly when such alterations are required to take effect in a short time frame that cannot be achieved through a customs tariff amendment bill. Customs tariff proposals are used most commonly for introducing new items, for changing rates of duty and for restructuring items in the schedules to the tariff. The financial implication of the proposed amendment to additional note 3(a) to chapter 22 is difficult to quantify, but it is expected that it may result in a small increase in government revenue.</para>
<para>Items 2 and 3 of the bill propose to insert references to additional note 4 to chapter 22 in the Customs Tariff Act 1995, subheadings 2206.00.30 and 2206.00.4. This additional note 4 defines grape wine product, which includes certain wine based cream beverages generically described as Irish cream. When imported into Australia, these goods are subject to excise equivalent rates of customs duty, while similar goods manufactured in Australia are subject to the wine equalisation tax. The new references to additional note 4 in the above tariff subheadings will correct this anomaly and allow Irish cream to be classified in either subheading. This will mean that these products will be subject to the WET and applicable rates of customs duty.</para>
<para>The alterations relating to additional note 4 to chapter 22 were included in Customs Tariff Proposal No. 3 (2005) and came into effect on 1 July 2005. The financial impact of the measures relating to the insertion of the references to additional note 4 into tariff subheadings 2206.00.30 and 2206.00.4 is negligible.</para>
<para>Items 4 to 7 of the bill propose to remove the three per cent customs duty that applies to business inputs that are subject to a tariff concession order. A tariff concession order provides concessional tariff rates for imported goods where there are no substitutes available from domestically produced goods. Goods which are known as business inputs and which are subject to a tariff concession order attract a general rate of customs duty of three per cent. The governmentâs removal of the tariff on business inputs provides duty-free entry of all goods imported under a tariff concession order. One exception to this is goods classified under heading 3819.00.00, which include hydraulic brake fluids and other prepared liquids for hydraulic transmission or oils obtained from bituminous minerals.</para>
<para>It is estimated that the amendment relating to the removal of the three per cent customs duty that applies to goods the subject of a tariff concession order will result in forgone duty of some $290 million in 2005-06, $320 million in 2007-08 and $340 million in 2008-09. The removal of the three per cent tariff to a customs duty rate of free will reduce business input costs, increase the international competitiveness of Australian business and encourage investment in efficient and sustainable industries.</para>
<para>Item 19 in schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 applies to goods subject to a tariff concession order that are repaired overseas. Item 7 reduces the rate of customs duty on the cost of materials, labour and other charges involved in the repair from three per cent to free. Item 4 repeals and substitutes item 50 in schedule 4 to the tariff. Item 50 provides concessional rates of duty for goods that are subject to the tariff concession order and are business inputs.</para>
<para>New item 50(1) reduces the rate of duty for goods subject to a tariff concession order from three per cent to free, except those goods classified in heading 3819.00.00 of schedule 3 to the tariff, as previously mentioned. New item 50(2) applies to those goods under the heading of 3819.00.00, subject to a tariff concession order and that are exempt from the product stewardship oil levy. Paragraph 50(2)(a) reduces the rate of duty from three per cent to free for these goods. Paragraph 50(2)(b) applies to goods of heading 3819.00.00 covered by the tariff concession order that have not been exempted from the product stewardship oil levy. Paragraph 50(2)(b) removes the three per cent customs duty but will retain the waste oil levy of 5.449c per litre.</para>
<para>Item 6 is necessary to repeal item 50A. Item 50A applies to goods subject to the tariff concession order that are defined as consumption goods in the United Nations statistical papers. The rate of duty for these goods is currently free. As item 5 reduces the duty rate to free for all goods subject to the tariff concession order except those goods classified to heading 3819.00.00, consumption goods will now be covered by item 50. Item 50A is therefore no longer necessary and is being repealed by item 6. Item 7 is a transitional item to ensure that any tariff concession order that was in effect before the amendments to item 50 contained in this bill continues to have effect after those amendments come into effect. Naturally, I support the amendments proposed in this bill to reduce business input costs, increase the international competitiveness of Australian business and encourage investment in efficient and sustainable industries. I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para>âThe purpose of the <inline ref="R2382">Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2005</inline> is to amend the Customs Tariff Act 1995 with respect to grape wine products and also to remove the three per cent customs duty that applies to business inputs that are subject to a tariff concessional order. It is the latter in particularâthat is, the removal of the customs duty applying to business inputsâthat is of specific relevance to the current economic and trade debate, a debate that centres on the decline in Australiaâs level of productivity and therefore international competitiveness under the current government.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>A key factor in determining the competitiveness of Australian industry is the cost of production across the board, including capital equipment, input materials and other factors which may be produced domestically or imported and overheads such as the cost of running plants and machinery and, of course, work force costs. One of the major reasons Labor opened up the economy through significant cuts to tariffs in 1973, 1988 and 1991 was to expose Australian industry to international competition. Most importantly, those tariff cuts allowed industry to benefit from cheaper inputs, including those that may not have been produced in Australia. Cheaper input costs in turn enhance the price competitiveness of our final products, benefiting Australian consumers, who could buy cheaper goods. Of course, cheaper costs of production meant that there was also an immediate pay-off of dramatic increases in the growth rate of manufactured exports from Australia to the rest of the world, including elaborately and simply transformed manufactures.</para>
<para>With this in mind, and given our record, we the opposition support this amendment. The removal of the three per cent customs duty is a change in the right direction and, we argue, will assist in enhancing the price competitiveness of Australian industry. However, it is also our view that the government should be doing moreâin fact, much, much moreâto arrest the decline in Australiaâs international competitiveness and to restore it to earlier levels achieved. It is a well-known fact that in recent years Australiaâs export performance under the current government has been less than positive. Indeed, it is the worst trade performance we have experienced since the end of the Second World War.</para>
<para>Notwithstanding this trade performance as demonstrated on the facts, the Minister for Trade would like us to believe otherwise. In fact, in question time in this place earlier this week the Minister for Trade used a dorothy dixer to make a number of quite extraordinary claims. When asked in the dorothy to outline Australiaâs export performance over the past 12 months, the trade minister sought to claim a new export record, suggesting that last year there were â$162.3 billion worth of exports going out of Australiaâ.</para>
<para>For the sake of ensuring that there is an accurate record on this question, and one that relates to the overall status of Australiaâs trade performance, let us put some additional facts to the Australian people as well. While Australia did export $162.3 billion worth of goods and services last year, we also imported a record level of goods and services: $187.8 billion worth of imports. That record level of imports has ensured that Australia has now recorded its 44th monthly trade deficit in a rowâthe longest run of consecutive monthly trade deficits by any Australian government.</para>
<para>Australia has recorded significant annual trade deficits for seven of the past eight years, including our largest ever trade deficit last financial year of $25.5 billion. For the last two years, we have recorded trade deficits of more than $20 billion for the first time ever. These massive trade deficits have contributed to our record current account deficits, including our largest ever current account deficit of $54 billion last year. In addition, we have a record level of foreign debtâ$425 billion at last count and climbing every day. For the last four years, export volumes have been flat right across the boardâcommodities, agriculture, manufactures and services. Net exports have now made a negative contribution to economic growth for four years in a rowâanother concerning record. At a time of strong global economic growth, our exports should be contributing to our economic performance, but over the past four years they have actually detracted from it. As Access Economics said recently, the best global growth in a generation is passing us by. It is passing us by so much that Australiaâs share of world exports is now at a historically low level, falling each year under the current government from a peak of 1.18 per cent of global exports in 1996 to just 0.99 per cent today.</para>
<para>The current governmentâs trade performance stands in some considerable contrast to that of the previous government. Annual export growth under the Howard government of 5.3 per cent is less than a half that achieved under the previous Labor government of 10.8 per cent. The performance of all manufactured exports is even worseâ13.7 per cent annual average growth under Labor compared with 3.7 per cent under the Howard government. If exports had continued to grow at the rate achieved by Labor, Australia would have recorded a trade surplus last year of $20.5 billion rather than a deficit of $25.5 billion. That is in the order of a $45.5 billion turnaround. That, indeed, is a lost opportunity for Australiaâlost exports, lost income and lost jobs.</para>
<para>When given the opportunity in question time this week to give a full and frank assessment, rather than just a rhetorical assessment, of the true state of Australiaâs trade performance the minister sought to claim some sort of record. The figures I have just outlined show the pictureâand it is a record but a sorry record indeed. Unfortunately, the minister has been in a state of denial on this question. This is a minister under pressure, given all the indications that he is having difficulty in his new job as Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party.</para>
<para>If his denial of Australiaâs woeful trade performance is not enough, the minister was also humiliated by the PM this week over the question of industrial relations reform. In question time, the minister was asked whether he stood by his comments at the recent Queensland National Party state conference:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We will protect as minimum conditions of employment: four weeks annual leave; personal and carers leave; parental leave including maternity leave; maximum ordinary working hours of 38 hours per week; public holidays; meal breaks; and smokos.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">They are pretty fundamental conditions, I would have thought. The ministerâs answer to that question in this parliament was simply yes, that he stood by that guarantee; he stood by those comments made to the July conference of the National Party. But there is a problem here. On his first day in parliament as the new Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party, the minister was way out of line. He did not know that his governmentâs own policy on industrial relations was in fact inconsistent with this and he was slapped down by the Prime Minister here in this chamber. Humiliated in his first question time by the Prime Minister, he has refused to give a guarantee about smokos, public holidays and meal breaks. Not only does the minister fail to comprehend the extreme nature of the governmentâs industrial relations reforms, his party is all over the shop on Telstra. He has the new Queensland senator Barnaby Joyce demanding a slush fund more than twice as big as the ministerâs preferred slush fund. If The Nationals vote to sell Telstra, their future in Queensland will beâ</para>

<para>âAll these factors draw our attention back to the manner in which the Deputy Prime Minister, Leader of the National Party and Minister for Trade has been discharging his portfolio responsibilities across the boardânot just in the trade portfolio but also more broadly. Under pressure on the export front, we have had a trade minister who has delivered our worst trade performance ever. On the other fronts, for which he has also suffered some pressure and criticism, we would argue that he is not performing up to scratch as well. When it comes to Australiaâs international competitiveness, we think the key questions which must be asked are as follows: why has Australiaâs trade performance been so woeful after nine long years of this government; why have exports continually failed to contribute to economic growth; and why has export growth failed to keep up with the rate of import growth into Australia? These are key questions we must address and key questions we must answer if we are to restore Australiaâs position as a strong trading nation, if we are to rebalance economic growth away from debt driven domestic consumption and government expenditure to a more sustainable growth pattern with a strong contribution from exports.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The government, of course, has put forward every excuse under the sun concerning Australiaâs failure to keep up with import growth. One is that there have been adverse climatic conditions, but when it comes to the drought it is difficult to argue how that affects directly our performance on services exports and manufactured exports. Another excuse put forward by the government is that the dollar was too high. But exports were already underperforming well before it hit its long-time average of 70c to the US dollar in October 2003. Another excuse provided by the government is the impact of the East Asian economic crisis. While there was definitely some impact, particularly in our trade with Korea and Indonesia, overall exports during this period held up not too badly, no doubt reflecting the significant fall in our own dollar at that time. A further reason which is advanced for Australiaâs relatively poor performance on the trade account is the impact of SARS and terrorism. While they may have impacted on services exports, surely they do not explain why manufactured exports or commodities have been flat. So all the excuses under the sun have been put forward, but they do not provide an adequate explanation as to why in fact we have had such a poor trade performance; nor do they provide an insight into how you get Australia onto a more sustainable and balanced growth path.</para>
<para>The answers to these questions, I think, are reasonably straightforward. We must overcome what Professor Garnaut has described as the âgreat complacencyâ of the 21st centuryâthe great complacency of the government, one which has dropped the ball on economic reform, on improving productivity and on enhancing Australiaâs international competitiveness. Over the past year productivity growth in Australia has declined by 0.6 per cent, calculated in terms of GDP per hour worked. We are now experiencing our worst productivity growth in 19 years. According to the OECD, productivity measures consistently show that output per person in Australia is well below that in other OECD countries, including the US and even the EU. It is for those reasons that Australiaâs exports have been so woeful and it is this combination of factors that is threatening Australiaâs future growth and prosperity.</para>
<para>We understand, as a responsible opposition, that productivity growth drives exports and exports create new, higher paid and higher skilled jobs. That is why the previous Labor government took on the productivity challenge in 1983 and opened up the economy. As I have stated previously, the economy was in deep recession in 1983 following a period of sustained policy complacency compounded by a combination of rising inflation, international recession, high domestic and overseas interest rates and drought. The response of Labor at the time to this great challenge facing the future of our economy was to reform the economyâclearing the blockages, removing the inefficiencies and attracting the capital to rebuild and modernise our industries. Those reforms were not easy by any means but they were necessary to create a new, dynamic and flexible economy capable of absorbing internal and external shocks and contributing to what is now the 15th consecutive year of economic expansion.</para>
<para>Those reforms included: floating the Australian dollar; deregulating interest rates; cutting tariffs; transforming Australia from a highly protected, inwardly focused economy to an internationally competitive economy; major tax reform, cutting the very high marginal tax rates and corporate taxes we inherited from Treasurer Howard; the deregulation of the financial services, communications and aviation industries; the introduction of competition policy in 1995 and an industrial relations reform that contributed so much to productivity growth in Australia. These were no small matters. Each reform contributed to the overall policy framework. Their implementation required the expenditure of considerable political capital, political capital the Hawke and Keating governments were prepared to spend, in the long-term interests of our economy, to enhance our international competitiveness and prosperity.</para>
<para>In contrast, the Howard government has failed to build on the economic reform legacy that it inherited from its predecessor. Reform fatigue has reached such a point that the Reserve Bank is now warning us that we need to get used to growth rates of two per cent plus instead of three per cent plus. Labour productivity growth has actually been negative over the last year. Inflationary pressures are emerging because of skill shortages, infrastructure bottlenecks and other capacity constraints.</para>
<para>It is not only the Labor opposition that is concerned about declining levels of productivity and the great complacency that has come over our country on the reform front. The OECD has said productivity measures consistently show that output per person hour in Australia is well below that in leading countries. The IMF has warned that in Australia supply side constraints, especially on exports, have also contributed to slowing growth. The ACCC has said that the benefits from productivity gains over the last decade may be in danger of being exhausted. The Reserve Bank of Australia has warned on at least 11 occasions since 2001 that capacity constraints are having a negative impact on our economy, noting in particular that capacity constraints on production growth continue to be reported.</para>
<para>The Business Council of Australia says in a new report that the recent productivity slowdown has been particularly dramatic and suggests that the productivity gains from past reforms are already starting to wane. The BCA goes on to say that key areas requiring further reform include taxation, federal-state relations and infrastructure, while there is also a critical need to address skill shortages. These are all key areas identified by Labor as requiring urgent attention. Even the Secretary of the Treasury, Ken Henry, has commented that without further internal structural reforms and a further deepening of cross-border commerce and people movement, we risk missing out on historical opportunities and failing to deal effectively with new challenges.</para>
<para>If these outcomes are not bad enough in themselves, they are also undermining Australiaâs international standing as a good place to do business. The <inline font-style="italic">World Competitiveness Yearbook</inline>, which, as the BCA notes, is used by governments around the world to promote their countries as places to invest, showed that Australia fell from a ranking of fourth in the year 2004 to ninth in the year 2005. The World Economic Forumâs <inline font-style="italic">Global competitiveness report</inline> showed that Australia fell from a ranking of 10th in the year 2003 to 14th in 2004 in the Growth Competitiveness Index, which measures macro-economic competitiveness.</para>
<para>Unlike the government, our party, the opposition, the alternative government of Australia, are not daunted by the economic challenges confronting the country. We have responded before with a comprehensive package of economic reform, investment in education, skills, R&amp;D and infrastructure, complemented by industry policies that increase the competitiveness of Australian industry. Labor have done it before and we will do it again. To put Australia back on the path of productivity growth, Labor have an agenda addressing the key challenges that we are now confronting. Labor have a plan to address our infrastructure crisis through the establishment of Infrastructure Australia. Infrastructure Australia will be charged with responsibility for developing a strategic blueprint for our nationâs infrastructure needs over coming years and facilitating its implementation in partnership with the states, territories, local government and the private sector.</para>
<para>Labor have a plan to address our skill shortages via our $2,000 trade completion bonus to encourage Australians to complete training and skills which are in demand. Under Laborâs proposal, traditional apprentices would receive a $1,000 payment halfway through their training and a further $1,000 payment at the completion of their apprenticeship. We have also proposed the creation of 4,000 extra trade training places in our schools each year. Labor will re-examine the reasons for the significant declines in our innovation and R&amp;D and look at mechanisms for restoring R&amp;D to the levels previously achieved by the Labor governments of the past.</para>
<para>Labor will examine carefully the governmentâs role in export promotion in this country. In its first budget the Howard government either abolished or substantially cut back many of the export promotion programs put in place by the Hawke and Keating governments. We need to review the impact of those cuts along with the contribution of the programs currently in place. Finally, we will need to restore our export performance to where it used to be by once again restoring an export culture right across the Australian business community to get our export growth back to where it should beâdouble-digit growth of the type achieved under Labor.</para>
<para>There is another matter which goes to the very heart of Australiaâs international competitiveness and was highlighted in the recent BCA report. That is the potential to improve Australiaâs productivity performance through the reform of federal-state relationsâat least, the type of federal structure that the Howard government is currently imposing on Australia. The dysfunctionality of the Federation is the last remaining frontier of micro-economic reform. Our view is that this, in turn, is creating inefficiencies for business which make it harder and harder for businesses to compete in the international environment. If we are to truly embrace a reform agenda in bringing about heightened productivity performance in the Australian economy and a restoration of Australiaâs international economic competitiveness, a broad based reform agenda is necessaryâone that goes to the core of what we do in education, skills, training and R&amp;D, that goes to the core of the infrastructure needs of the economy, but which also goes to the core of how we deal with the dysfunctionalities of the Federation as experienced by the Australian business community. It is in this context that we will be advancing an alternative approach to Australiaâs future export needs and it is why Australia, in our argument, needs a new export strategyâ<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âin replyâThe <inline ref="R2382">Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2005</inline> contains amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to ensure that imported grape wine and grape wine product is treated consistently with similar locally produced products that are subject to the WET and excise regimes. Most importantly, the bill implements this governmentâs initiative announced in the 2005-06 budget to remove the three per cent customs duty applicable to business inputs that are subject to a tariff concession order, thus providing free duty entry to those goods. This initiative will significantly reduce the costs of business inputs, thus increasing the international competitiveness of Australian products and encouraging investment in efficient and sustainable industries. For that reason I commend the bill to the House.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In doing so, I thank the member for Hunter, the member for Forrest and the member for Griffith for their comments. In relation to the concern about the delay in the implementation of the customs tariff for grape wine, there are two separate pieces of legislation and a misalignment did occur. However, as soon as the positive matters there were identified, steps were taken to remedy the problem. While I do not have the dates of effect of the alignment of the 22 per cent upper limits that was achieved by a tariff proposal as soon as the anomaly was identified, the customs tariff reflects this change and has done so for some time.</para>
<para>I want to comment on the most remarkable speech, well outside the ambit of the bill that we are discussing. I thought, Mr Deputy Speaker, your patience was commendable. I think the only element of the bill that the member for Griffith was addressing was the need for increased international competitiveness of Australian products, which this bill achieves. I must say I thought the speech was really a job application. It was a remarkable piece of extending the debate to outline an alternative economic agenda.</para>

<para>âIt was much broader than trade. You were not here for the speech, but as deputy leader you might note that he has a very lean and hungry look. Members ought to read closely the job application. I am sure he will arrange for wide distribution, and people will be reading all sorts of things into it. The part of the speech that impressed me most was the reference to reform fatigue. I was surprised he would relate it to the governmentâs performance, because this government gave credit to some of the initial reforms adopted by previous Labor governments and built on them in office. The fact of the matter is that it was the Labor Party that was unwilling to address issues relating to containing government expenditure. I can see that the member for Griffith has not learnt from thatâhe came with a very extensive shopping list for additional government expenditure in the speech that he has just given. The Labor Party certainly had no appetite for tax reform and I think that was quite clear in relation to the GST. Some Labor members recognised that that was important when they were in office. I think former Prime Minister Keating pushed for it from time to time, but when confronted with the trade union movement objections those important reforms could not proceed under Labor.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>It is quite clear even from the speech of the honourable member for Griffith today that he has not recognised that labour market reform is very important. In fact, if he wanted to draw upon some of the comments of people like the Business Council chair, Hugh Morgan, he would note the very significant interest in those areas that he quite conveniently ignored. I think his speech demonstrated the very considerable reform fatigue that has always been evident in the approach that the Labor Party has taken in relation to issues that this government has been prepared to address. I think it was a useful debate to hear the member for Griffithâs job application for the role of Leader of the Opposition but, as I say, I think it was well outside the ambit of the bill. I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para>âThe <inline ref="R2390">Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Budget Measures) Bill 2005</inline> has three main components. The first is a very welcome allocation of $14 million over four years to James Cook University to support an extra 100 undergraduate places, 50 of which are earmarked for veterinary science and the remainder for tropical agriculture. The opposition certainly supports this measure. The additional places for veterinary science will establish a new undergraduate degree program from 2006 and this will be very welcome in this area of Queensland. These places are for a new veterinary science school at James Cook Universityâs Townsville campus but it will also be linked to the Cairns campus. Aside from operating as a normal veterinary school it will also incorporate an innovative focus on tropical animal husbandry and diseases and it aims to develop preventative measures together with the early detection of diseases in livestock.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is very important that there be extra opportunities for students in rural and regional Australia to become veterinarians. We know how short we are of vets, particularly in rural and regional Australia, so these extra places will be very welcome. It is also important that in the vast region of Far North Queensland we do have veterinarians with expertise in tropical animal diseases. I am sure that the students who get these places will be doing very important work.</para>
<para>The new places for tropical agriculture are for the establishment of a new undergraduate degree which will provide expertise in tropical plants and the capacity to undertake research in sugarcane production, once again an industry vital to our country. Research into the development of plants capable of withstanding tropical climates is absolutely essential to enhance crop production and yields and is necessary to safeguard the income and job security of all those people who depend on this industry, particularly in Queensland. It is very appropriate that this work is going to be done at James Cook University and will help to lift its already impressive profile and research performance in these areas.</para>
<para>The second main component of the bill is the provision of $25 million over three years for the University of Western Sydney to support a number of infrastructure projects. These are for teaching facilities at the Parramatta and Hawkesbury campuses, a new library at the Penrith campus and a medical training facility at the Campbelltown campus. The University of Western Sydney is a very important university serving an enormous area of the state of New South Wales, concentrating particularly on those vast outer western suburbs of Sydney. It has an extremely important mission as that region is home to well in excess of one million Australians. I am sure that Deputy Speaker Hatton knows that only too well and would strongly endorse the measures in this billâif I can say that on his behalf.</para>
<para>The allocation in this bill of $7 million in support of the new medical school at the Campbelltown campus of the University of Western Sydney is very significant. The university has earmarked 80 places for the medical school, which will commence in 2007. It already has a curriculum partnership with the University of Melbourne, which will make sure that the new school can operate backed by the experience of a medical faculty from a long-established university. The development of the new facility is an important achievementâI want to emphasise thisâfor one of Australiaâs newer universities. It has only been made possible because of a cooperative arrangement between the federal government and the New South Wales Labor government. Under this partnership agreement both governments have said that they will contribute $18 million. The $7 million allocated in this bill is separate from these amounts.</para>
<para>The $18 million that is being contributed by the Iemma government includes provision for the use of facilities at Liverpool, including buildings and facilities on the TAFE site and at the Liverpool hospital; support for the planning team in the first 12 months; funding of a planned consultancy and feasibility study; support for clinical teaching; funding for a professor of mental health and associated staffing support and costs; and access to funded teaching positions through negotiations with the area health service. All of these measures will make sure that this is a very strong development at the University of Western Sydney. The university has developed a growth strategy in response to the rising student population of greater Western Sydney and this medical school is a very important part of those plans. It will consolidate the University of Western Sydney as one of Australiaâs newest and most vigorous higher education institutions.</para>
<para>The allocation of $9 million towards the establishment of a new teaching facility at the Parramatta campus will enable the university to reinforce and expand its exceptional record in preparing the next generation of health and human service professionals. The $2 million provided for the Hawkesbury campus of the university will permit an upgrade of research and teaching facilities at that site. These resources will contribute towards the acquisition of a cutting-edge environmental electron microscope, which is designed for higher order biological analysis. The grant will also help with the upgrading of teaching facilities for horticulture, food science and agricultural science. Provision of $7 million for the construction of a new library at the Penrith campus of the university will not only expand the quantity and quality of library services for the students and staff of the university but, most importantly, will afford wider access for local communities to such services. This certainly is a terrific example of the synergies that can be leveraged from the strong relationships and active engagement that exist between this university and its very, very large surrounding population centres.</para>
<para>Even though these infrastructure developments are very importantâand they have strong support from the Labor Partyâthe proper time and process to announce these things is not during the heat of an election campaign. We would like to see these sorts of infrastructure projects come out of a proper sector-wide and open process. Unfortunately, that sort of process was not followed by the Howard government, and we are not surprised. We are used to seeing this government avoid the rigorous processes of public administration. We certainly hope that we see such processes followed in future capital developments in our universities. Other universities have very significant demands and I hope that we see a proper process so that the competing needs and priorities of universities around the country can be looked at and that the projects of greatest need and those that will contribute to universities are the ones that are funded.</para>
<para>While I am talking about the government and its reporting arrangementsâand the things it does and does not say publiclyâI draw the ministerâs attention to the fact that we have not seen the last triennial report on university funding. It was due for release last December but has as yet failed to appear. Maybe when the minister is summing up at the end of this debate he could inform the parliament where this triennial report will be released, why it has not been released and why we are still waiting for this very important aspect of accountability by the government to the public.</para>
<para>The third major element of this bill can only be described as very inadequate indexation for universities. This bill alters the maximum funding amounts under the Higher Education Support Act 2003 and maximum amounts for transition funding under the Higher Education Funding Act 1998. These are annual increases that are supposed to compensateâand this is importantâfor cost increases. The government had the opportunity to devise a much more realistic indexation method that truly reflected the costs that universities face. The Minister for Education, Science and Training made a commitment to our universities and to the Senate to review university indexation arrangements, when he was arm-twisting particularly Independent senators trying to get a 25 per cent HECS increase agreed to. He made this promise to the senators: âIf you agree to the 25 per cent HECS increase I will have a proper review of the indexation arrangements so that universities are able to keep up with the cost increases that they face.â</para>
<para>Unfortunately, the senators have been completely done over. They agreed to the 25 per cent HECS increases which are now unfortunately confronting almost all of Australiaâs university students right around the country. The minister had a review. It was entirely in-house. Even the universities were not able to make a contribution to this review. Having had this review, which was a complete sham, the minister is now refusing to provide adequate indexation that meets the real cost increases that universities face. Is it any wonder that our universities are under enormous financial pressure? The No. 1 reason for that is this governmentâs and this ministerâs refusal to properly index the grants that universities get from Canberra. The universities cannot keep up with the costs of running a university. They were promised a proper review of this issue by the minister when the legislation was going through the Senate. So all senators, especially the new senators who are flexing their muscles at the moment, should beware when this education minister makes empty promises. He has made them before and he certainly has not delivered on them. He has not delivered on the promises he made in relation to a very important sectorâour universities.</para>
<para>Unfortunately, the government seems determined to stick to its wholly inadequate formula for calculating how much indexation universities should receive. In considering the basis on which the future indexation of grants should occur, the Department of Finance and Administration recommended against a more realistic formula and claimed that this was justified because of âthe strong financial health of the sectorâ. I know we are used to hearing some extraordinarily Orwellian language from the Howard government, but this phrase is right up there. There are no independent organisations or experts who could come close to agreeing with this statement. It certainly reflects the extraordinary unreality that seizes this government.</para>
<para>In a report in May 2005âjust a few months agoâfrom the New South Wales Auditor-General to the New South Wales parliament it was revealed that the Howard government had driven half of the universities in that state into deficit. I do not know how on earth the department of finance in Canberra could say that the university sector is in strong financial health when we have the Auditor-General in New South Wales demonstrating, through their own independent analysis, that half of the universities in that state are in deficit.</para>
<para>The Auditor-Generalâs report disclosed that five out of the 10 universities in New South Wales are officially in the red. I am sure you would be sorry to hear, Mr Deputy Speaker Hatton, that one of those is the University of Western Sydney. It has a very significant deficit of almost $27 million. The University of Newcastle has a deficit of a similar amount. The University of Technology, Sydney is $12.2 million in the red, the University of New South Wales is $9.9 million in deficit, and Southern Cross University in Lismore is $5.9 million in deficit. That is the financial state of our universities. They face these very significant deficits because this government refuses to properly index their grants.</para>
<para>There has been a massive jump in the number of universities in financial difficulty since 2003, when only three universities ran small deficits totalling $6.2 million. In 2004, the University of Technology, Sydney and the University of New South Wales joined the list of those reporting deficits. The total is now a whopping $81.8 million in deficit just for those universities, and that is just in New South Wales. We could go around the country if we had more time.</para>
<para>This government has allowed this reality to occur because it refused to provide fair and reasonable indexation. That lack of indexation has gone on for nine very long years; nine very long years of hardship that our universities have faced. The hardship of the universities has been passed on by this government to both Australian and overseas students to fill the gap that universities face in vital revenue. We have a minister for education who continues to categorically rule out fixing the indexation problem, despite the universities saying that it is their top priority. If you were to ask the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee what their top priority is for university funding, they would say it is addressing the indexation issue.</para>
<para>Because the government refuses to address the indexation problem, we are going to see the universities come back to this government and say, âIf you wonât fix the mess that has been created by the lack of indexation, we are going to have to ask for a further increase in HECS fees.â We know the government has already introduced a huge blow-out in the cost of HECS for our university students. In fact, since this government was elected, there has been, on average, about a 100 per cent increase in HECS. That is before you take into account the latest increases. We do know that this is all guaranteeing that Australian families and their students continue to face steeper and steeper HECS fees, and it is leaving families in greater and greater debt. These HECS fee rises have been driven not only by the lack of indexation but also by the very significant cuts that were imposed on universities by this government.</para>
<para>The assessment of the increase in debtâthe increased amount that the government is intending to take from our university students and their families over the next four years; and these are government figuresâis an extra $839 million. That is a huge increase in the clawing away of money from the pockets of students and their families. That is just through the 25 per cent increase in HECS that started this year. We know this figure will go higher because this government refuses to properly index our university grants.</para>
<para>When the minister introduced the latest 25 per cent HECS increase into the parliament, he made an extraordinary promise when he was introducing the bill in 2003. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">What that means in real terms is that the HECS charge for most courses in most universities will not change at all.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">What an extraordinary statement and how wrong he was! Some 32 out of 38 universities have now decided to increase their HECS fees, most of them by the full 25 per cent. I think we can expect that those universities that still have not put their fees up are, in the end, going to have to face that very unwelcome reality.</para>
<para>Recently, the Australian Catholic University announced âwith regretâ that they too have been forced to increase HECS fees from next year. They could not have been plainer about the reason why. In a media statement, the National Vice-Chancellor of the Australian Catholic University, Professor Peter Sheehan, said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">With the absence of full indexation of the Government Grant we have been faced with no other choice but to increase HECS in line with the majority of Australian public universities.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is the reason that each and every university has given for increasing HECS fees. The government has basically decided that it will palm off the cost of running our universities to students and put students into higher and higher levels of debt. It has also been a very lazy course for the government; the sort of policy that we should not be surprised to see from a government which has now been in for a long time. It is taking a very lazy approach to policy development in the university area and is continuing to slug students, but it is not thinking about some of the major issues that need to be addressed in our universities.</para>
<para>We know that the other way in which this government has decided to provide more money to our universities via students is the massive increase in the number of full-fee degrees. We have seen recently the publication of the latest <inline font-style="italic">Good Universities Guide</inline>. There are now 60 degrees offered by Australian universities which cost $100,000 or more. According to the guide, a combined medical and law degree at Monash University will cost a staggering $256,000.</para>
<para>These are fees for Australian students at Australiaâs public universities. Who introduced this outrageous scheme that leaves Australian students with $256,000 worth of debt? That is the legacy John Howard is leaving these students. Dental science at the University of Melbourne costs $150,000. Again, these fees are for Australian students at Australian universities. Veterinary science at the University of Sydney costs $147,600. Physiotherapy at the University of Queensland costs $112,000âand the list goes on with huge, absolutely monstrous fees that this Prime Minister has imposed on our students.</para>
<para>The Howard government has sold out Australian students and their families, because of course no student could pay these sorts of fees on their own. The government has created a United States style system where massive amounts of money can open the doors to university. Money is speaking so much louder than results. No ordinary Australian family could pay anything like these amounts of money for a degree.</para>
<para>I am sure many people remember that the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, promised Australians in 1999 that there would be no $100,000 degrees. He made it plain when he stated:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The government will not be introducing an American style higher education system.</para>
<para class="block">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â¦Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â¦Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  â¦</para>
<para class="block">There will be no $100,000 university fees under this government.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">No-one on this side of the parliament is the slightest bit surprised that the Prime Minister has broken yet another promise. He is so out of touch with the reality of family life that he thinks people can pay $100,000, or even $200,000, for a university degree. These extreme fees can only be said to be the result of a government that is completely out of touch with the reality of Australian family life.</para>
<para>The smart approach for any government that really cared about the future of this nation would be to invest in more affordable HECS places, funded at reasonable rates, and to make sure that we kept up with the cost of running universities through proper indexation. But of course that is not what we are getting from this government. Instead we have a massive increase in fees, leaving students and their families with outrageous levels of debt.</para>
<para>The result of all this is that, for only the second time in 50 years, the number of Australian students attending universities has actually fallen. That is an extraordinary achievement by the Howard government. The Hawke and Keating governments put in place the opportunity for a record number of higher education places and record growth in participation in our universities. That has now been reversed by this government. That is an extraordinary indication of how our country has slipped badly under this government and has slipped badly in relation to other major developed countries.</para>
<para>Under the previous Labor governments we were at or near the top of OECD countries in our performance in educational participation and the attainment of educational qualifications. But this government has taken us backwards and we now languish towards the bottom of the rankings on the same measures. What an achievement that, over the nine long years of the Howard government, we have dropped our capacity to have more and more Australians getting higher education qualifications! It is very bad for the future of this country.</para>
<para>It is very clear that when it comes to higher education this government has put us in reverse gear. An OECD report released earlier this year found that Australia had one of the largest declines in public investment in tertiary education and training of any OECD country. Our expenditure crashed by 8.7 per cent. The majority of our competitorsâand this is the important thingâare out there investing in higher education while we go backwards. Australia was one of only seven OECD nations to actually reduce government per capita funding for tertiary education and training between 1995 and 2001âanother shocking indictment on this governmentâs ineptitude.</para>
<para>It seems the government is content just to fiddle with indexation in the face of continuing deterioration in university finances. That is having a very serious impact on the quality of education that is being delivered in our universities. We are seeing a deterioration in staff-to-student ratios, and that can only threaten the quality and standard of educational provision at our universities.</para>
<para>We know that this is not the end of it. The government has some other very radical changes in mind for the university sector. One which has been receiving a lot of public attention this week is what can only be described as a vindictive piece of legislation on student services. As I understand it, the government has plenty of members who think this is the sort of legislation that should be dropped. It really is mean spirited and petty, and it is high time the minister got over it and looked at the Labor Partyâs sensible amendment, which would make sure the services that university students rely on are able to continue.</para>
<para>We also know that the government intends imposing very extreme industrial relations changes on our universities. Basically, the universities are going to have to offer all staff individual workplace agreements, individual contracts. Of course, the objective of the government is to force universities to drive down wages and other conditions of employment, and that will have a very serious impact on not only the university staff and their standard of living but also the capacity of universities to attract the best and brightest into our higher education institutions.</para>
<para>We will have plenty of time to talk about these issues in the weeks to come. I want to finish by saying that Labor will support this bill because of the very positive measures for James Cook University and the University of Western Sydney. I have absolutely no doubt that the debate over indexation will continue. It is a very hot political issue that we are determined to pursue.</para>

</talker>
<para>âThe member for Jagajaga just demonstrated her very clear narrowness of understanding of, for instance, small business and other activities. She has just cried crocodile tears that a scheme called HECSâthat her party invented on the advice, I think, of Neville Wranâis going to cost a dental science student $160,000. I suggest she go down and try to buy a set of taxi plates in her electorate for $160,000. How would you get into a taxi business for $160,000? Who would lend you the money and give you possibly 20 years to pay off the debt? What is so special about going to university? I wonder when she last had a filling, and how much she paid for what was probably 20 minutes of work. My recollection is that it is $200 or $300 today. So according to her it is okay for an immigrant or someone else to go and borrow money, maybe from a finance company at 10 or 15 per cent, pay $300,000 or $400,000 for a set of taxi plates and pay it back with no government help, but it is not all right for someone to have the means mentally and physically to be a dentist and charge the community $500 or $600 an hour. On her reckoning, on her philosophy, because that has got something to do with university education, that person should pay no ingoing whatsoever.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The papers the other day were discussing just how much a pharmacy is worth today and what they change hands forâover $1 million. But it is the member for Jagajagaâs view that getting that pharmacy degree, which makes you a monopolist in that area, should be freeâor not actually free but at a huge cost to other taxpayers who, for instance, might send their children to TAFE where those skills are charged for in cash and up front.</para>
<para>This government does not take the attitude that in fact a student should pay for 100 per cent of the training that the taxpayer provides or the university provides to give them opportunities to get into those lines of business. I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker Hatton, who she talked about. She did not talk about someone doing an arts degree and hoping to get a job as a librarian. She complained about dentists, doctors, lawyers and one other in that category. All of them have a guarantee of having a business income five times what any taxi driver might get. She thinks it is okay for the taxi driver to buy a set of plates for $300,000 or $400,000 to get a job, or for someone else to pay a couple of hundred grand to get into a TAB agency or a post office agency. That is quite okay. But, if you are going to go to university, the Australian taxpayer has got to set you up for an income four or five times what those other people could obtain using their own money or by borrowing it at very high interest rates.</para>
<para>I was also surprised to see her crying crocodile tears over universities like Newcastle being in debt. We have heard from the incumbent Vice-Chancellor of the University of Newcastle. He makes it very clear that it is the fault of the past administration. They have continued to fund programs and staff them with no students, but they have never tried to rationalise their assets, as other universities are doing, and they have vacant land of high value that clearly is not going to be used in the future.</para>
<para>She happened to have a bit of a swing at voluntary student unionism. For goodness sake. It is a fee to go to university, and what are you paying for? For nothing, probably. More particularly, the people I representâand I am rather interested in the remarks of another person recentlyâwho want their kids to go to university are frequently suffering the effect of drought. They have difficulty in finding the money, and that is after having to hire or buy accommodation to put the kids in.</para>
<para>Then of course there are external or extension students who go through the whole process. A journalist yesterday reportedâI think it might have been in the <inline font-style="italic">Telegraph</inline> or one of the other tabloids; he writes for one of those Murdoch papersâthat he lives in Sydney or another capital city and he got into an extension course with a university in Queensland. I bet that person has got an opportunity to be on the guild executive. I bet that person has got an opportunity to access the library. That person says, âI bought all my own books. Why should I have to pay the fee?â I was astounded when the vice-chancellors wrote to us and said, âWe would be quite happy to shrink the amenities, but we would like to retain dental care, child care and the library.â Where does this $7.9 billion go in a university institution if it does not include a library? Then they mention photocopiers. There is a simple way to deal with that, and that is to put a credit card facility on them so the people who want to photocopy books or whatever do so and pay for the service. But why does the bloke in Sydney who is doing an extension course, who cannot get to the photocopier, have to pay the same amount of money? It is ridiculous.</para>
<para>There are so many of these facilities. I got a letter from someone saying that they were a member of a choral society of 130 members at Monash University. How many students are there at Monash Universityâ40,000? I do not know, but it is one of the biggest intakes in Australia. Here we have 130 people believing they have a right that the other 39,000 pay for their social activity. I also see someone having a shot at the fact that, if you are in the right place at the right time, you get half-price drinks at the expense of someone who gets nothing. Go down to RMIT in Melbourne and see where all the sporting grounds are for those students, who still pay the feeâit is just brick wall straight up to the footpath. It is silly.</para>
<para>Any university claiming that the governmentâs contribution is not enough and is not properly indexed had better ring up the Vice-Chancellor of Newcastle, because he has made it very clear publicly that they ran a lousy business. Why should the taxpayer subsidise incompetence? Of course they should not. There are many people, as our minister points outâ70 per cent, I thinkâwho do not go to university and whose kids do not go to university. Why should they be paying, on the claims of the member for Jagajaga, so that someone does not have to pay half the price of buying a taxi plate to get into dentistry?</para>
<para>These are the issues. I came in here simply to congratulate the government for putting a veterinary science course into James Cook University. What an excellent place. I have visited that area many times. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, who is at the table and who represents that area, drew it to my attention when I was minister to the region. âThereâs Thursday Island,â he said, âand thereâs a couple of other islands. Thereâs Papua New Guinea.â There are 19 million pigs being husbanded by the Beattie government in the Cape York National Park. That is what we have national parks forâto accommodate feral animals! If ever you needed high expertise when it comes to the exotic diseases that are on our doorstepâif those diseases are going to get to our country, they are more likely to come down that routeâthen it is up in that country. It was an initiative that was no doubt promoted strongly by the members for Herbert and Leichardt, who no doubt put very strongly to the minister the need to have that sort of training and expertise in that region. They can only be congratulated.</para>
<para>Again that is spending government money where the remuneration ainât that special. Veterinary science is one of the hardest courses to get into. I have a daughter who is a veterinarian. I might add that in this day and age probably 90 per cent of undergraduates in that course are female. It has become a wonderful opportunity for women and more particularly because they have those high entry marks necessary. The reality is that we are investing in a sensitive area and making those opportunities available. I congratulate the minister consequently.</para>
<para>Of course there are other measures, such as the medical training facility at the Campbelltown campus of the University of Western Sydney. Here is the government again remedying the sins of the Hawke Labor government. It is totally forgotten by most that the shortage of Australian-trained doctors today is the direct result of cutbacks to the undergraduate intake in medicine by 4,000 by the Hawke-Keating government. Why did they do that? A bit like free university education, they brought in Medicare, discovered they had a tiger by the tailâthey were terribly worried about bulk-billing abuse and everybody hanging out their shingle in high-population areasâso they cut back university undergraduate entry in medicine by 4,000. Surprise, surprise, 10 or 12 years later you discover the effects of thatâthat is the time it takes to get a GP out into private practice.</para>
<para>We are remedying that in many ways but, in particular, as a result of this legislation by adding very substantially to the facilities at the Campbelltown campus, with $7 million for a medical training facility. In fact, teaching, research and student facilities at the University of Western Sydney will be enhanced through an additional $25 million over the next three years. The facility at Campbelltown will complement the universityâs proposed new medical school to which the government committed $18 million in the 2004-05 budget. This brings the governmentâs total contribution to the medical school to $25 million.</para>
<para>The University of Western Sydney will get additional assistance to upgrade research and training facilities at the Hawkesbury campus. One of the things of great interest to me there was the fact that we are putting into Hawkesbury campusâwhich is a national leader in plant, agricultural and food systems research and the teaching of courses related to these activitiesâa state-of-the-art environmental electron microscope. Again, we want every bit of plant research we can get. I thinkâand I think there is a strong view held to the contrary in this House and probably on both sidesâthat there is a great irony in the government and the parliament supporting that expenditure for plant research while all the state Labor governments of this nation forbid anybody to plant genetically modified plant products. They are still living the way of the Luddites.</para>
<para>It is a stupid notion that this new technology should not be applied in Australia. We should always be ahead of the game. It is only research. If Farrer had not come up with Federation wheat, I would not be standing here as the representative of a group of wheat growers. If it were not for all the research in plant agronomy that has been carried on since, you would not see the sort of productivity that has arisen from what is virtually desert country. It is about time the silly attitude of the state governments changed.</para>
<para>This parliament has put in the appropriate controls through the GMO regulator, who declares certain GM items safe for human consumption. Then we get the Luddites saying that the end of the world is tomorrow. Yet one of those Frankenstein foods, I understand, is a rice product that contains vitamin A, so necessary to sustain the eyesight of people whose diet is heavily dependent on rice. At least this government is putting forward the financial resources to enhance the Hawkesbury campus of Western Sydney University and improve its capacity to provide better plants and so on. Many campuses would benefit from such a state-of-the-art environmental electron microscope which could contribute to genetic modification and yet the state governments say, âYou can invent these foods, but you will have to sell them to some country overseas who will use them because we in Australia are not going to have them.â</para>
<para>This bill makes a substantial contribution to higher education. I draw the attention of honourable members to the total of $7.8 billion that this budget provides for university education. The bill deals with specific matters which are of great benefit to the community. I reject entirely the remark of the member for Jagajaga that it is unreasonable to ask someone who can earn $1,000 or $2,000 a day to pay $160,000 over 20 years for access to his chosen industry or profession. It would cost more than that to buy a corner delicatessen. The taxi plate example I gave is so simple. People buy themselves employment through these sorts of opportunities. Whether or not they have a degree, they pay a lot more. The taxpayer does not lend them the money and wait to be repaid.</para>

<para>âThe House has again had the pleasure of hearing the member for OâConnor just as we had the pleasure, in the last day or two, of hearing him rough up the new Senator Barnaby Joyce. I heard the member for Maranoa talking this morning about the old bull and the young bull. Old bull, young bullâit is all bull. Selling Telstra is a bad idea, periodânot just for country Australians, but for all Australians. Banning university fees to provide student services will damage universities. It is bad for regional universities and it is bad for all universities. The government should realise that it is out of touch on this matter and support Laborâs amendments in relation to student services.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The <inline ref="R2390">Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Budget Measures) Bill 2005</inline> provides for 100 new places in veterinary science and tropical agriculture at James Cook University, commencing in 2006. It provides $25 million in capital infrastructure funding over three years, from 2006, to expand the facilities for students at the University of Western Sydney at several campuses and improve its teaching and research capacity. These measures are supported by the opposition. Our deputy leader, the member for Jagajaga, explained why in some detail.</para>
<para>The bill also amends the Higher Education Support Act to revise funding under various ongoing Commonwealth grants and scholarship schemes and reflects partial indexation increases for 2006-08 and the new funding year for 2009. Partial indexation increases for transition funding for 2006-07 are included in this bill as well. It is to those issues, and some fundamental questions about the funding of higher education, that I wish to address my remarks. Recently I was speaking with the chief executive officer at the Moreland Community Health Service. He was talking about the need for more GPs and dentists and how not enough dentists and GPs are being trained. The conversation went on to the broader area that, following the privatisation of utilities, certainly in Victoria, work force training levels have been inadequate. The government has adopted a laissez-faire approach to work force training, leading to competition for workers and skill shortages across a whole range of areas in the work force.</para>
<para>This kind of anecdotal concern has been backed up by more detailed research carried out by Monash Universityâs Centre for Urban and Population Research. In particular, I draw the attention of the House to the abstract of an article by Bob Birrell, Daniel Edwards, Ian Dobson and T Fred Smith entitled, âThe myth of too many university studentsâ. I draw on the research they have outlined in their article, published in <inline font-style="italic">People and Place</inline>. The article commences by observing:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The Coalition Government has recently asserted that too many young Australians are training to become professionals and not enough as traditional tradespersons. By implication, there is a surfeit of young professionals.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The abstract of the article claims that what has occurred, since the coalition came to power in 1996, is:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... the number of domestic students in Australian universities at the undergraduate level has hardly increased at all. All of the increase in professional training at the undergraduate level in Australian universities has been directed at overseas students. Partly as a consequence, there has been a rapid increase in the intake of professional migrants to satisfy employer needs.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The article concludes that there is a need for more training of domestic undergraduate students, not less. To spell out these points in a bit more detail, domestic undergraduate commencements have increased by 3,000 from 132,000 to 135,000, which is a bare two per cent increase during the period since the Howard government came into power in 1996. They are essentially flat-lining. That we had 132,000 domestic undergraduates starting back then and we have 135,000 now shows a miniscule increase; they are essentially flat-lining.</para>
<para>During that same period, undergraduate commencements by overseas students in Australian universities have increased by 20,000 from 16,000 equivalent full-time students in 1996 to 36,000 by 2003. That is a 125 per cent increase. That is a dramatic increase, whereas for the domestic undergraduates the increase is only two per cent. To underscore the difference in the pattern of undergraduate commencements, what has occurred is that the proportion of the total student population reflected by overseas students has doubled during this period. Back in 1996, it was 10.8 per cent of the student population; by 2003 it was 21.1 per centâa massive increase during that period of time.</para>
<para>The first point that needs to be made in understanding what is happening with university funding and higher education in this country is that all the growth has been in overseas student placesâthere has been nothing for domestic students. The second point that needs to be made is that there is a demand for university trained people in the Australian work force. There is a hunger for university places. The modern economy has an insatiable appetite for professionally trained people. The unemployment rate in 2003 in Australia for people with higher education qualifications was significantly lower than for those without such qualifications across all age groups.</para>
<para>In particular, the difference in unemployment rates between those with and those without higher education qualifications was greatest amongst those who have recently graduated from universityâthat is, the 25- to 34-year age group. Only three per cent of people with qualifications are unemployed, compared to seven per cent who are without. In that context, it is perfectly understandable that parents wish their children to have access to university training, with the likelihood of a well-paid job to follow. The ABS figures show that the median gross weekly wage in 2001 for higher education graduates working in Australia was $1,036 a week, compared to $727 a week for workers without higher education qualificationsâa difference of 42.5 per cent. Despite comprising only 22 per cent of all employed persons in Australia, professionals made up 70 per cent of those in the highest income bracketâthat is, those earning $1,500 or more per week.</para>
<para>Naturally, the capping of the number of university places in the face of high demand for entry has led to increasing competition for university places. There was a six per cent increase in the number of 15- to 19-year-olds in Australia between 1996 and 2001. That growth in population has been compounded as parents and their children realise that university training is the key to valued professional employment. Competition to secure a government subsidised HECS place has increased. This is a major reason why an increasing number of parents are sending their secondary school-age children to independent and Catholic fee-paying schools. Between 1997 and 2004, enrolments in Australian independent secondary schools rose by nearly 50,000 students, or 27 per cent, and enrolments in Catholic schools rose by 28,000, or 10 per cent. In comparison, the secondary schools in the government sector gained slightly more than 8,000 studentsâan increase of less than one per cent. Those are Victorian figures which illustrate the sorts of dilemmas that parents face.</para>
<para>Essentially what has gone on is that the government has used overseas students as a battering ram for its full-fees agenda. It has also been prepared to use different religious convictions in Australia as a battering ram for an assault on the public school systemâthe system of government schoolsâwhich it hates. It has indeed had inadequate checks and balances in some of the new schools that it has allowed to be established, and there have recently been questions raised about the kinds of things being taught at some of these new schools. Both of these approaches are against the Australian national interest. Prime Minister Howard likes to wrap himself in the flag and parade himself as an Australian patriot, but his higher education and education policies attack the Australian national interest. They undermine the options for Australian young people and they undermine Australiaâs common cultural values.</para>
<para>As the concern about skills shortages has mounted, employers have expressed alarm about what this means for their enterprises. Their concerns have prompted the government to increase the skilled migration program and, in particular, to encourage overseas students to stay on in Australia as immigrants after the completion of their courses. Over the last couple of years, the pressure to further increase skilled migration has escalated, such that by 2003-04 the skilled migration program reached a 15-year high. Professionals dominated the skilled program, with some 25,600 entering as settlers in 2003-04. In addition, in 2003-04 some 11,000 visas were issued to former overseas students on completion of their courses in Australia. Indeed, there has been such alarm about the issue of skills shortages that there is talk of proposals to boost the migration program next year by a further 20,000. Again, if that is where it goes, it will weight the source of new professionals even further away from domestic aspirants than is already the case.</para>
<para>Given these facts, it seems pretty obvious that there ought to be an increase in university training for domestic students. Immigration may be a short-term way of dealing with this, but it comes at the expense of the opportunity for many Australians to improve their economic situation through the acquisition of a university degree. There are plenty of Australian young people who wish to achieve this. Unfortunately, the places are simply not available for them. The truth is that there is too little domestic training at university level, not too much. The number of government subsidised HECS places should be rising in line with demand and the professional employment pattern. This is sensible both from the point of view of employers and from the point of view of increasing opportunity for Australiaâs young people.</para>
<para>But, instead of this, the Howard governmentâs approach has been to try to mask its failure to provide places for Australian young people, to provide the higher education funding resources necessary for that. Instead, the government has been running a line on inverse snobbery, expressing the view that there has been too much emphasis on university training. The Prime Minister recently said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... 30 years ago, we started getting this foolish bind that everybody had to go to university.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Since it came to power in March 1996, the government has enforced a cap on government funding for domestic university students. As a consequence, there has been relatively little growth in the number of domestic undergraduate students commencing university courses, which has had an adverse impact on the training of professionals. The coalitionâs university training policies have contributed to serious shortages of university trained professionals in this country. As I have indicated, the coalitionâs response has been to expand migration. Furthermore, it has recently acted to constrain the practice of overenrolling at universities. As a consequence, the number of commencing undergraduates has begun to fall, following a peak in 2001. As part of this plan, by 2008 the Commonwealth proposes to penalise universities in which overenrolment exceeds five per cent, with specific restrictions on enrolments by discipline. This is likely to reduce the number of commencing undergraduates still further.</para>
<para>I want to raise my voice against what I believe to be an unhealthy trend in this area. We are locked into an addictive cycle and we need to break out of it. We need to train our own young people. We need to provide opportunities for our own young people, and access to higher education is being denied to them. There is a lack of places that are available and affordable. The government is prepared to offer full fee paying places to students, but for many young people they are unaffordable. We are now seeing the sinister logic of the previous education minister, Dr Kemp, carried on by his successor. That sinister logic is, first: âLetâs have the overseas students in here. That amounts to income for Australia. Thatâll be good for the Australian economy.â Then the next part of the equation is to say: âWell, if overseas students are paying full fees, why should we deny Australian students these same rights?â I use the expression ârightsâ advisedly, because we end up with a situation where your access to education is based on the wealth of your parents, when your access to higher education ought to be based on merit and your capacity to complete a degree and to use the knowledge you have acquired.</para>
<para>I appeal to the Howard government not to outsource our skills needs but to invest in training our own people, in training Australians first, and to stop selling out our young people. It is unfortunate that the government has chosen to put a cap, effectively, on domestic university places and to deny Australian young people the opportunities that they want, that they deserve and that are in this countryâs interests. Until the government is prepared to move away from the ideology of full fee paying places and to accept the need to train young Australians, we are going to continue to have these skills shortages and continue to become ever more addicted to skilled migration, which is not the best solution to this problem. The best solution to this problem is to train our own and to put proper government investment into doing that.</para>

<para>âI would not have missed the opportunity to speak on the <inline ref="R2390">Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Budget Measures) Bill 2005</inline>. I believe that the member for Leichhardt will be 100 per cent behind what I say about our leading tropical university in Australia, James Cook University, in Townsville and Cairns. This bill is very important to James Cook University because it provides $128 million this year to JCUâthat is $5 million more than the government provided last yearâand over the next three years it provides 766 new Commonwealth supported places at Australiaâs leading tropical university. For the first time, it provides two new undergraduate degrees, with 50 places in each undergraduate degree. Those degrees will be delivered through both the Townsville and Cairns campuses of James Cook University. I will say more on the importance of that later on.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I would like to take this opportunity to inform the House about JCU, our world-class enterprise. James Cook University is Australiaâs leading tropical research university. Perhaps many in the gallery have not been to North Queensland. It is 2,000 kilometres from here.

<para>âI have a Victorian saying that it is not paradise. I should speak slower! James Cook University takes its name from the 18th century British navigator and explorer Captain James Cook. The university was proclaimed in Townsville on 20 April 1970, 200 years after Cook charted the eastern seaboard of Australia. It is a multicampus university, with the main sites located in vibrant tropical Queensland in Townsville and Cairns. There are smaller sites, as the member for Leichhardt knows, in Mount Isa and Mackay and on Thursday Island. JCU courses are delivered in partnership with education providers in Sydney and Melbourne, and now Singapore.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>JCU offers courses in a broad range of study areas, and as a result of this bill it will be able to broaden those courses quite significantly. JCU particularly focuses on life in the tropics. In a ranking of the worldâs top 500 universities, JCU was one of only 13 Australian universities listed. That is a pretty good achievement for a regional university.</para>
<para>JCUâs main sites are located in tropical North Queensland, which is a remarkable region with over one million visitors each year who come to experience two World Heritage listed natural wondersâthat is, the Great Barrier Reef and the rainforests in the wet tropics. The region is also the gateway to the scenic Atherton Tableland, Cape York and the historic Queensland outback. Townsville and Cairns are thriving coastal cities, each with populations of around 130,000 people.</para>
<para>JCU is renowned for its friendliness, good staff-student ratios, highly qualified teaching staff and effective support services. More and more students from other parts of Australia and abroad are discovering the natural advantages of tropical North Queensland. There are over 170 undergraduate and 140 postgraduate courses offered at JCU, spanning the arts, business, creative arts, education, engineering, law, medicine, health sciences, science, information technology and social sciences. JCU provides its graduates with the qualifications and skills for entry into the global work force. All degree programs emphasise the skills of critical thinking and problem solving, effective communication and familiarity with information technologies.</para>
<para>JCUâs mission is high-quality research of international standing, focused on areas of research strength and aligned to the needs of regional industries and communities in North Queensland and on addressing the issues of global importance to tropical communities and industries. Indeed, within the next 10 years we will see JCU become the most significant tropical research university in the world. That is where this university is heading. That is why the provisions in this bill before the parliament this afternoon are so important to our North Queensland university. In addition, JCUâs research mission is guided by strong collaborative linkages with industry, recognition of the benefits of the regional community of scholarship and the humanities, creative arts and social sciences, a supportive research training environment closely aligned with areas of strength and a planning process based on quality assurance, accountability and review.</para>
<para>The way that JCU has blossomed over the last nine years is quite significant, particularly in areas of the School of Medicine. The School of Medicine, I am very proud to say, graduates its first doctors on 15 December this year. That will be a really proud moment. When doctors are trained in regional areas we find that they stay in regional areas and work in regional areas, and that helps the work force in our area.</para>
<para>JCU is famous for its marine research through linkages with the Australian Institute of Marine Science, the Commonwealth environmental research facility. I pay tribute to the member for Leichhardt for the way that he worked with me and the government to make sure that, when the reef and rainforest CRCs come to the end of their CRC life, they will continue on seamlessly but with a much better and bigger operation in the Commonwealth environmental research facility. I also pay tribute to the CEO, Dr Russell Reichelt, who has been a tireless advocate for the need for tropical research in both reef and rainforest areas.</para>
<para>Last week I was privileged to officially open two new information technology laboratories at James Cook University. James Cook University is connected to the world through one gigabit per second links that enable supercomputing operations and collaboration with universities anywhere on this planet. They enable James Cook University to work collaboratively with the most significant scientists in the world today. The particular e-research that was going on at James Cook University allowed it to use its supercomputing facilities to do work in medicine, particularly to predict what diseases a person might have in areas of the body before they even knew they had a disease. This is leading-edge stuff. James Cook University is leading the world in relation to this kind of technology.</para>
<para>I pay tribute this afternoon to Dr Brendan Nelson, the federal Minister for Education, Science and Training. I thank him for the support that he has shown to James Cook University. I thank him for having such an interest in our university. I finish by observing that the Howard government is the best friend that James Cook University has ever had.</para>

We recall in particular the bombing of Darwin, the bombing of Townsville and the midget submarines in Sydney Harbour.

<para class="block">Australian troops had at Milne Bay inflicted on the Japanese their first undoubted defeat on land. Some of us may forget that. Of all the allies, it was the Australians who first broke the invincibility of the Japanese Army.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This is a fact in the military history of this country about which all Australians should not only have a permanent recollection but should also be immensely proud. Above all things, as we mark this day, as we in this parliament recall those events of 60 years ago, we pay massive tribute to the bravery, skill and commitment of the men of the Australian Defence Force who performed so valiantly, gave so much and halted the Japanese advance at Milne Bay.</para>
<para>In the process of paying tribute to those who gave so much and did so much to guarantee the freedom we now have, let us also record our immense gratitude to the people of the United States of America. It was the Battle of the Coral Sea that saw America stand protectively between Australia and a potential Japanese invasion. As a result of the timely intervention and the strength of the contribution of the United States, the people of Australia owe to the people of the United States of America a debt that can never be fully repaid.</para>
<para>There were many losses and many tragedies. At a political level, two men who had contributed, through the leadership of their own countries, to the ultimate defeat of the Japanese were not to live to see the Japanese surrender. I refer to the President of the United States, Franklin Roosevelt, who died on 12 April 1945, in advance of both the German and Japanese surrender, and, of course, to our own Prime Minister at the time, John Curtin, who died on 5 July 1945 and was thus denied the opportunity to see the victory to which his leadership had made a very significant contribution. I pay unconditional tribute to the contribution that he made in the time he was Prime Minister during World War II.</para>
<para>In recalling the events of World War II, we particularly recall the fact that so many Australians, after the fall of Singapore, went into Japanese captivity. Perhaps the hardest recollections of war held by Australians relate to the treatment of prisoners of war of the Japanese not only on the Burma-Thailand railway but also in Changi prison camp. There was a time when this House had on both sides many men who had not only fought in World War II but also been prisoners of war of the Japanese. There are a few of those former members still alive. I saw one of them this morning by coincidenceâmy dear friend and political mentor Sir John Carrick, the former Leader of the Government in the Senate. I think of Tom Uren, the former Deputy Leader of the Australian Labor Partyâstill vigorous, still contributing. I think of Reg Schwartz, the former Leader of the House, who I think holds the record for the longest answer ever given at question time. I think also of the late father of my friend and colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alec Downer, who had been, along with so many of his parliamentary colleagues, a prisoner of war of the Japanese.</para>
<para>World War II was finally brought to an end through the dropping of the first atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and those deeds have been the subject of constant debate and discussion ever since. It is beyond argument that the dropping of those bombs inflicted enormous death and terrible suffering on many of the people of Japan. The scale of that destruction and suffering is something that I know appals us all, but it can nonetheless be asserted with confidence that the balance of morality was strongly in favour of the decision taken by President Harry Truman. His decision to use the bombs undoubtedly shortened the war and saved many hundreds of thousands of allied lives. Although we remain, I suppose, in awe and trepidation of the terrible power of nuclear weaponsâand properly soâit should not be recorded as a moral black mark against the then American President that the atomic bombs were dropped because they undoubtedly shortened the war and undoubtedly saved many hundreds of thousands of allied lives.</para>
<para>As we look back, I think we should also look at the years that followed the end of the war. Without in any way, as the motion suggests, forgetting or ignoring for a moment the suffering, particularly of those who suffered directly at the hands of the Japanese Imperial Army, we should not lose sight of the fact that the relationship which has been forged between Australia and Japan in the 60 years following the war is one of the most important relationships this country has anywhere in the world. I pay tribute to the many people who have made a contribution to that relationship, not only on the Australian side but also on the Japanese side. I want to especially pay tribute to the work of John McEwen, the then Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, who, in the face of ferocious opposition from many quarters, forged the Australia-Japan Commerce Agreement of 1957. Barely 12 years after the end of World War II, he saw that the future lay in a close collaboration between Australia and Japan, not a perpetuation of the bitterness and the conflict that had characterised the years between 1941 and 1945. As the years have gone by, our relationship has become closer. Now, as the House would know, the military forces of Japan and the military forces of Australia are working together to build a free and democratic Iraq. I think all of that can be said without for a moment forgetting, as we must never forget, the suffering of those who were so badly treated at the hands of the Japanese Imperial Army.</para>
<para>Finally, as we look back on 60 years of relative peace, this is an occasion to resolveâwhatever our political views may be on all sorts of issues and whatever our position may beâto bend all of our efforts to ensure that a war of that magnitude never again occurs. As we gather in the towns, cities and suburbs of Australia on Monday to mark the 60th anniversary of the end of that terrible conflict, we will give thanks to God for the victory of the allied cause, for the cause of righteousness and truth, because we did fight that war in an unconditionally just cause: we were fighting for the freedom and liberty of our country and for the way of life we now enjoy. We will also give thanks to those who sacrificed so much for our future and we will dedicate ourselves to do everything we can to ensure that a conflict of that magnitude never again occurs.</para>

<para>âThe opposition supports this proposed resolution. We think that the proposed resolution properly reflects the tribute that we in this chamber ought to pay to a superb generation of Australians and that it also properly reflects a contemporary relationship with our profound enemy of those days, and does so in a good and sensitive manner. This weekend, right across this nation Australians will celebrate and commemorate our toughest generation. It is a generation which includes, for many members of this House, our parents and, for some of us, our grandparents. It is a generation forged in the Depression in the worst of all possible economic circumstances, following on from a terrible crippling in many ways of the young of our only just established nation during the course of World War I. It is a generation which came through those handicaps and found itself confronted, to a very large extent on its own, by the issues of national survival. It is a generation that came through that test of the refinerâs fire such as this nation has never known. The words that the Prime Minister used to describe it were entirely appropriate, and I thank him too for the statements he made about our very tough and effective political leadership of that generation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Those who analyse the history of the period talk a great deal about the role that we played in a totally allied operation. There is much focus on the relationship forged then with the United Statesâa very critical one. There is a lot spoken about the difficulties that the British found themselves in, simultaneously to the efforts that we were making in the Pacific, and about the profound contribution to allied efforts in Europe, both in the Middle East at the battle of El Alameinâa turning point in that conflictâand in the United Kingdom, where thousands of young Australians served with the British armed forces. That is often the focus of our analysis. In fact, for the first couple of years of the Pacific war we were profoundly on our own. We took the fact that the Americans had dispatched to Australia certainly their most famous and probably their best general as an earnest of their good faith in our defence. Psychologically, that was tremendously important in the community at the time. When I was defence minister of this country I never tired of pointing out to my American counterpart in those days, Cap Weinberger, the fact that it was not until the early part of 1944 that General Douglas MacArthur had more American troops under his command than Australian. Pulling the irons of the allies out of the fire in the fight in New Guinea was largely an Australian effortâan effort begun with profoundly undertrained Australian soldiers who had only their courage to rely on.</para>
<para>Nowadays some American military historians and others are beginning to take account of these facts and develop an understanding of them. Many of them are now looking at the various battlefields across the globe that came about in that heinous conflict and they are coming to the conclusion that it was Australian forces who fought in the most difficult of circumstances in that warâharder than the Russians had to fight in Stalingrad; more difficult than the allies experienced as they charged up the beaches of Normandy; even tougher than what our Kiwi brethren and others went through in assaulting Montecasino in Italy. It was the Australians along the Kokoda Trail with a five-man front, knee-deep in mud, rain pouring down on them and an unseen enemy five metres away who fought in the toughest conditions and with a spirit of which we can all be proud. Let me read a description of Australians by one American historianâand I recommend his book, <inline font-style="italic">Touched with Fire</inline>, to every single Australian school. He says this of us:</para>
<quote>
<para>The ingenuity required on the frontier, which Australians call the âconvict mentalityâ, was very real. There was also a genuine ruggedness to the national character. Physical courage was highly prized. A broken nose was easy enough to come by in pre-war Australia ... It is, I think, safe to say that somewhere along the line the âProtestant work ethicâ lost some of its intensity in Australia. An Australian infantry man who served at Milne Bay told me they were glad to hear of the Japanese attack because that freed them from an ugly road building detail in the mud. Soldiers who would rather fight crack Japanese assault troops than build roads win wars.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is an interesting tribute from a very good historian. Let me read you something else that this historian who arrived at some of the judgments I referred to earlier had to say:</para>
<quote>
<para>Australia shouldered a very large portion of the land war against Japan in 1942-43 and Australiaâs war in this period was fought largely by the AIF, the best infantry in the Pacific.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">And that was so. That is the generation we are talking about, and when we commemorate the conclusion of the Pacific war on Sunday and Monday we should remember those things with a great deal of intensity.</para>
<para>But there is something else that should be said about the people of those days. Those who look at the way societies were mobilised during World War II have also arrived at certain conclusions. They have looked at the mobilisation of the societies under the Nazis in Germany and Eastern Europe, under the communists in the Soviet Union and under both forces, effectively, in China. They have looked at the Churchillian efforts in the United Kingdom, when the UK felt enormously under threat, and at Rooseveltâs extraordinary activities in the arsenal of democracy in the United States. They have concluded that there was no nation whose people were more mobilised than the Australian nationâthis country, where every man and woman was turned to by the government and those responsible for organising the war effort. We had the most mobilised people on earth to defend ourselves, and, not surprisingly, there were only a few million of us in those days.</para>
<para>It is an enormously moving thing to go to St Kilda Road and see Curtinâs World War II headquarters. There is nothing thereâjust a map, a table and a telephone. When I was defence minister I went to the US Space Command at Cheyenne Mountain during the Cold War, the locus from which the United States would have fought the Cold War were a âhotâ war to have broken out. The technology at Cheyenne Mountain was extraordinary. Later I was taken to the British headquarters of NATO North Sea, which was the one non-American command in the NATO structure, and saw the enormous sophistication of that. Then there is St Kilda Road: a table, a map and a telephone. That was the infrastructure of Australian command as we confronted the struggle. Poverty stricken as we were, being one of the nations worst affected by the Depression, we rose out of that and essentially saved ourselves, essentially defended ourselves and emerged from that war a different nation. As we celebrate that generation, we celebrate the beginnings of a genuine Australian foreign policy and a genuine Australian defence policyâthe casting off of imperial defence and domination of our national policy by, essentially, the British Foreign Office.</para>
<para>We commemorate the fact that we industrialised massively during that period. We produced our own equipment. We not only fought that war, we fed the people who fought it. We not only fed the people who fought it, we equipped the people who fought it. Australian industry mobilised to fight that war. Australian women ran Australian industry mobilised to fight that war. Australian women were all engaged. They were working in the munitions factories. They were bringing in the harvestsâevery one of them. There was no âkinder, kuche, kircheâ stuff for Australian women such as Hitler maintained in Germany for as long as possible during that conflict. From the moment we decided on national mobilisation, everybody was in itâthe lot. That included the older generation who had fought the previous war. So we ought to commemorate it and we ought to commemorate it proudlyâand we will in the course of this weekend.</para>
<para>I will conclude with the words of Ben Chifley, the then Prime Ministerâa month in after Curtin had diedâwho, on 15 August, said:</para>
<quote>
<para>Fellow citizens, the war is over. ... Let us remember those whose lives were given that we may enjoy this glorious moment and may look forward to a peace which they have won for us. ... Let us remember those whose thoughts, with proud sorrow, turn towards gallant loved ones who will not come back.</para>
<para>Nothing can fully repay the debt we owe them, nor can history record in adequate terms their deeds from the black days that followed September 1939, and December 1941, until this moment.</para>

<para>âI can inform the honourable member for Goldstein that, for the second month in a row, the unemployment rate of Australia has reached a 29-year low. Unemployment in Australia is now at five per cent, and it can go even lower if we have further workplace relations reform. The reason we want workplace relations reform is that we know that the good results of today are the products of yesterdayâs reforms and that, if we are to have even better figures tomorrow, we must continue the process of reform. Those on this side of the House do not believe for a moment that the job of reforming the Australian economy has been completed. We are not willing on this side of the House to settle for a growth rate of one or two per cent; we want a growth rate of three, four or even five per cent in the years ahead, and we can only have that if we have the courage to embrace further reform.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Just as the predictions made by the Chicken Littles on the other side of the House 10 years ago that labour market reform in 1996 would drive wages down, destroy working conditions, increase unemployment and slash living conditions were proved to be wrong, so it is that those who seek to denigrate our reform agenda now will be proved wrong in the years ahead if this parliament embraces the governmentâs reform package. The figures released this morning show that a further 12,700 new jobs were created in Australia in July. Full-time employment went down but part-time employment rose by 27,200. More than 350,000 new jobs have been created in the past year alone. The labour force participation rate remainedâand this is very significantâat a record high of 64.7 per cent. Of the 350,000 new jobs created over the past year, more than 320,000 of them have been filled by new workers entering the labour marketâa further piece of field evidence that the Howard government is the best friend that the workers of Australia have ever had.</para>

I also refer the minister to the fact that the member for Goldstein, Mr Robb, a former Liberal Party campaign director, is a member of the committee overseeing the governmentâs industrial relations advertising campaign. Minister, isnât it now the case that the advertising agency, Dewey Horton, co-owned by long-time Liberal Party advertising campaigner Ted Horton, has been awarded the contract for the governmentâs industrial relations advertising campaign?

<para>âI thank the member for Perth for his question. The government will provide information to Australians in accordance with the conventions used by other governments of different political persuasions over time. We will do that because the Australian people are faced with a misleading and deceptive campaign by the Australian Council of Trade Unions. We will continue to reassure the Australian people that these changes will lead to even more jobs for Australians and higher wages, something that todayâs employment figures justify in terms of past reforms.

<para>âI slept very well last night. I pulled out Tonyâs speech and I was out like a light. I think I even got to the second paragraph. I told him that this morning. I was asked by the member for Bonner about labour market participation. I inform the House that the participation rate, which measures the proportion of Australians over 15 years of age who are looking for work, whether they are in work or out of work, in todayâs labour force figures is an all-time recordâthat is, more Australians than ever before seek to participate in the labour market. Why would that be the case? It is because the chances of getting a job in Australia today are better than they have been for the last 30 years. Unemployment is at five per cent. Over the course of this governmentâs term of nine years, 1.7 million new jobs were created; in the course of the last year 350,000 new jobs were created, 64 per cent of which were full-time.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It was not always thus that Australia had a five per cent unemployment rate. Many of us in this House can remember back to 1993. In 1993 the Leader of the Opposition was at that time the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Does the House know what the unemployment rate in Australia was in 1993? The unemployment rate in 1993 was 10.7 per cent, more than double what it is today on a lower participation rate. In 1993 the Leader of the Opposition, as minister for employmentâget a load of thisâwent to the National Press Club to deliver a speech on unemployment. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We draw perverse comfort from the European Commissionâs latest prediction that unemployment in the EC will average 12 per cent in 1994 compared with our current level of 10.7 per cent.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The justification was: 10.7 per centâbut donât worry about it if you are unemployed, because the Europeans have unemployment at 12 per cent. Can you imagine where Australia would be now if it had not had to cope with an unemployment rate of 10.7 per cent.</para>

<para>âAs I said, not only is the unemployment rate less than half the 10.7 per cent rate under the member for Brand but also it has been done with an increase in the participation rate which is at an all-time record. Of course if the participation rates in 1993 had been at the level they are now, the unemployment rate would have been far higher than 10.7 per cent, as it was under the member for Brand. Nevertheless, notwithstanding the fact that participation rates are the highest we have ever had, on participation tables Australia is still only 12th in the OECD. That indicates that we should be aiming to increase the participation rate in Australia, even though that could have the effect in the short term of increasing the unemployment rate.</para>

<para>This is why the government has announced reforms to the welfare system to encourage more people off DSP and into the work force and more people off income support and into the work force, because Australia has to lift its participation rate if we are going to get growth over the years to come. This is real economic reform. It is necessary with the ageing of the population. The government is focused on it. We have announced a program to do it, and it is an important part of building Australiaâs opportunities in future.</para>

<para>âIs the Prime Minister aware of an Industrial Relations Court judgment in favour of a young South Australian woman who was employed on an AWA and paid 25 per cent less than her award entitlement, including the cashing out of her annual leave and sick leave? Isnât it the case that under the governmentâs industrial relations changes AWAs will not have to meet todayâs no disadvantage test against the relevant award, leaving employees such as this young woman much worse off? Was the member for Goldstein, Mr Robb, correct when he said today that the reason you will not give a guarantee to this young woman, or to any other Australian, that they will not be worse off under this governmentâs industrial relations policy is, âWell, we just simply donât knowâ?</para>

<para>âMy advice in relation to the 15-year-old worker was that she was not covered by a valid AWA; that the basis of the South Australian Industrial Relations Court finding was that the worker was a casual worker and not a part-time worker and was therefore found to have been underpaid according to the provisions of the South Australian award in relation to casual workers. The government supports a system where a worker has recourse for underpayment of wages, and according to the implication of the Leader of the Opposition this has no reference to the veracity of AWAs.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Page for his question and, as a former Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in New South Wales, he understands the great challenges that face the Australian farming community in terms of the markets both here and overseas. Can I also take the opportunity of acknowledging the hard-working group of fruit and vegetable growers and farmers that have come to Canberra to express some concerns nationally this week. I had the opportunity of meeting with a delegation of those yesterday led by Richard Bovill. We had a very frank and good discussion about issues that we as a nation confront and, of course, the government is doing its absolute best to address those issues, particularly regarding unfairness in the international marketplace.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We confront that in a very energetic way with our strong advocacy to remove the high tariffs and heavy export subsidies that are being utilised and deployed by a lot of our competitors internationally. We are currently at the inner circle, if you like, of the negotiations in the Doha Round that are trying to get at these export subsidies and the limited access to markets. There is also a need for the high level of domestic support to be stripped away from a lot of our major competing countries to make a much fairer and leveller trading system across the world. We know it is unfair, we know it exists and we are doing an enormous amount to try and get rid of that. We are at that crucial stage in the multilateral negotiations to address those issues and they certainly will be of significant importance and support for Australian farmers.</para>
<para>But we should also recognise what the government has been doing about negotiating FTAs with bilateral trading partners to try and improve access into some of our major markets whilst we are working on the Doha Round, whilst we are working on the multilateral system. We should also recognise that the Labor Party has opposed the governmentâs moves on the bilateral front every inch of the way, instead wanting us to put all our energies into the multilateral negotiations. We agree on that point, we agree that we have got to keep on fighting the fight in removing export subsidies and domestic support in the markets of a lot of our competing countries, but we need to get results sooner than they are being delivered in the WTO, and that is why we embarked on our agenda of free trade agreement negotiations.</para>
<para>The other things that we can do domestically this government has been doing extremely well, such as managing the economy, providing a stable economic environmentâwhich is just as important to the farm sector as it is for every other sector of the economyâand we have been doing that since our time in office through good, sound economic management that has maintained downward pressure and stable, low interest rates in Australia. We have pushed unemployment down to the levels that have been announced today, the lowest levels in about 30 years. We are not sitting on our laurels on that front. We want to push that even further with the reforms that we are proposing. When we went through the whole process of taxation reform it was unambiguously aimed at making our exports more competitive. Almost $3 billion annually has been removed from the back of Australiaâs exports. And guess who collectively opposed that? The Australian Labor Party. We had to fight every inch of the way to deliver a benefit for Australian exporters.</para>

So we aim to continue our hard fight in improving those elements of the international marketplace that militate against our farms in Australia; we aim to continue to eliminate and remove those export subsidies and those heavy levels of domestic support.

Does the minister recall telling the farmers, unionists and consumers at the Fair Dinkum Food rally in Ballarat that country of origin labelling will be fixed? Can the minister explain why Australian fruit and vegetable growers must come to Canberra in their tractors to persuade the minister to do what was promised nine long years ago by the Howard government? When will consumers be able to go into a supermarket confident that the labels on fresh, packaged and processed food items will enable them to choose Aussie products for their familyâs dinner table?</para>

<para>âI thank the honourable member for his question and his character assessment of Mr Richard Marles. The government is committed to strengthening the country of origin labelling and making it mandatory to list the country from which the product originates. The honourable member will know that, as set out in the Constitution, the states and territories have responsibility for the food standards codes. As a result, the Commonwealth has one seat out of 10 at the table of FSANZ, which sets the country of origin requirements and labelling. Each of the six states and two territories as well as New Zealand hold the other seats and have equal say in the decisions of the council. So, if the Labor Party were truly supportive of accurate, distinctive and fair country of origin labelling, it would be urging its Labor health minister counterparts who make up eight out of the 10 votes to support the Commonwealth government. They should be supporting the Commonwealth governmentâs proposed changes.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>But let us be clear not just about who largely has responsibility for determining country of origin labelling but about who has responsibility for enforcing it. This is a national disgrace. The Labor governments have sat on their collective hands and allowed obvious and identifiable breaches of the country of origin labelling to occur day in, day out, year in, year out. Quite frankly, they should be enforcing the country of origin labelling where it is in breach. There are many examples on our shelves where the products do not meet country of origin requirements. That is being ignored by the states and territories. So the Commonwealth is taking strong country of origin labelling requirements to the next ministerial council meeting. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing today issued a statement outlining the Commonwealthâs position. We look forward to the honourable member for Corio, for so long as he occupies that position, supporting the government, especially in our attempts to enlist the support of the Labor health ministers and Labor governments in enforcing the labelling.</para>

We have already made an initial investment of $200,000 to map out a way forward to support the growers beyond country of origin labelling reform and to go into what will make them more competitive against the threat of cheap importation. Consequently, today the coalition government announced an additional $3 million to support the future of the Australianâ</para>

The government is pulling together all strands of the sector to go forward, because when the euphoria dies down and the farmers are required to return to their properties to earn a living there are still going to be the issues of competitiveness, and that is where the government is going to work with the industry, in all of its complexities and diversity, to make our growers more price competitive.</para>

I have seen reports this morning of comments by the new CEO of Telstra, Mr Sol Trujillo, regarding the expansion of services to regional Australia. One thing I would commend him on is that at least he is prepared to talk about options in improving services to regional Australia, because the Australian Labor Party has no ideas on it and is putting no policy proposals forward at all. The question indicates that there is a requirement for that level of investment in regional services and we are obviously keen to talk to Telstra about the proposal that has been put forward.</para>

<para>âObviously the member for Hunter, as a semiregional and rural representative has not been following this debate. He certainly has not followed the recommendations of the Estens inquiry, because Estens spoke about services today, services in the future and the concept of future proofing. The concept of future proofing is being underpinned by a capital based fund. Providing a dividend stream to invest where the market fails in the future with future technology is a totally different and separate issue to what Telstra is talking about with a roll out of access to broadband to regional Australia today. They are two separate issues. The member for Hunter would be well advised to get some better advice on the issues that are confronting regional Australia today and into the future. The $2 billion Future Fund is about ensuring that market gaps do not appear because of market failure into the future. That is what the difference is. If the member for Hunter was right across this issue properly, he would well and truly understand that.</para>

Any Australian who goes overseas and joins a terrorist organisationâfor example, al-Qaedaâand fights with that organisation against Australia or our allies faces very serious consequences indeed. Groups like al-Qaeda are trained and prepared to kill and they are preparing to kill innocent civilians, including Australians. They constitute an enemy of Australia and they are the enemies of Australiaâs interests and our allies.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>If any Australian fighting for a terrorist organisation like al-Qaeda is captured in a war bearing arms on a battlefield, they face a tough legal situation. Such terrorists are not civilians within the meaning of the fourth Geneva convention; they are combatants. Nor are they prisoners of war under the third Geneva convention, because terrorist organisations, like al-Qaeda and others, are not legitimate international actors that obey the laws of war. As unlawful combatants, they lack the legal protection that prisoners of war would have. Under the Geneva convention, prisoners of war should be released at the end of a conflict. It is also, under the Geneva conventions, generally unlawful to put prisoners of war on trial. If people in these situations are captured, they face very severe difficulties. As we know, if they were captured by the United States, it is possibleâit is not certainâthat they could face the military commission process. But, if they were captured by other countries, there is no guaranteeâand there is no requirement under international law either that they should face a process like thatâthe consequences could be significantly more severe in those circumstances.</para>
<para>There is a simple principle here, and that is that these types of terrorists should not be able to return to the field of battle where they could once again take up arms against Australia or our allies. I make that point to emphasise that Australians who join terrorist organisations and wage war put themselves quite voluntarily beyond many of the protections that others would have under international law.</para>

<para>âI thank the member for Pearce for her question. Indeed there is a recent report released by the Business Council of Australia undertaken for them by Access Economics, one of the most well-known economic firms in this country, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Locking in or losing prosperity</inline>. Under the section headed âHow can we cement Australiaâs prosperityâ it makes a number of recommendations including this one:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">... workplace relations reform (such as less heavy-handed employment regulation that allows employers to offer more flexible employment contracts).</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The report identified the benefits for the Australian economy over the next 20 years if further policies of economic reform are adopted. For example, Access Economics found that the economy will grow by four per cent rather than by 2.4 per cent, that Australiaâs economy would therefore be nearly 40 per cent bigger by 2025 than would have been the case without the reform and that the wealthâand this is importantâof average Australians would be 25 per cent higher. In other words, average Australians would be $74,000 better off in todayâs dollars if further economic reform is undertaken in Australia, including reform to workplace relations. So this report clearly sets out the benefits of further economic reform to ordinary Australians. Yet on Tuesday we had in here the Leader of the Opposition arguing that there is no economic rationale for reform. Here are reams of reasons why there is economic rationale for this reform.</para>
<para>We have seen the Leader of the Opposition basically roll over to the unions on workplace relations. This will mean lower living standards in the future for Australian families. For example, his policy to strangle Australian workplace agreements will leave hundreds of thousands of employees worse off in this country. The average wage for workers on Australian workplace agreements, if it were reduced to the average wage of those on collective agreements, would be $5,883 a year lower. They would be $5,883 a year worse off. The policy of the Leader of the Opposition to strangle Australian workplace agreements would rip off $113 a week from those workers who are on Australian workplace agreements. That is what the Leader of the Oppositionâs policy would do. We have the Leader of the Opposition asking us day after day and question after question to give some guarantees. Can I ask for a guarantee from the Leader of the Opposition? Can he give a guaranteeâ</para>

<para>âwho are on Australian workplace agreements that he is not going to rip off $113 a week? No, of course he cannot. Can the shadow opposition spokesman on industrial relations give a guarantee to the 7,000 workers in the electorate of Perth who are on AWAs that they are not going to be ripped off by $113 a week?

<para>âI thank the honourable member for Fisher for his question. I want to say to start with that Australia is deeply disappointed that Iran has defied the International Atomic Energy Agency. It has broken the IAEA seals and restarted its uranium conversion facility at Isfahan. Iran had made commitments to suspend sensitive nuclear activities, including conversion, while negotiations on a long-term agreement continued with what are called the EU3âthe three European Union countries, Britain, France and Germany. With the EU3 proposal on the table, I believe those negotiations should continue. But the suspension must first be fully re-established.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Australia does not believe Iran has any compelling need, operational or otherwise, to resume conversion or any other sensitive nuclear activity. Indeed, given its nuclear safeguards breaches and the fact that the IAEA is not in a position to conclude Iran has no undeclared nuclear activities, Iran needs to do more to build international community confidence that its nuclear activities are exclusively for peaceful purposes. It is not too late for Iran to turn back. My department has already told the Iranian ambassador, on 4 August, that we strongly encourage Iran to maintain the suspension, to examine the EU3 proposal carefully and to continue to negotiate with the EU3 in good faith. We reiterated that position at this weekâs special meeting of the IAEA board, of which we are a permanent member. We urged the international community to respond though, firmly and credibly, should Iran not reinstate its complete suspension. We anticipate the IAEA board will meet again this evening. Consideration and action by the IAEA board is the first of a possible range of options for the international community to deal with this serious issue, including a referral to the United Nations Security Council. Iran has a choice. It should not think that isolation from the international community and irresponsible behaviour is a path to national success. We hope it chooses wisely.</para>

<para>âI thank the honourable member for Paterson for his question, because obviously the London bombings have served as a stark reminder to us all of the terror and damage that can be wreaked on our society when terrorists target critical infrastructure. In this instance, we know that land transport infrastructure was targeted, but for some time the government has been aware and very much focused on protection of critical infrastructure generallyâour energy, transport, food supply, finance and manufacturing sectors and our national icons and other essential utilities. That was reflected in the budget when an additional $50.2 million over four years was committed to programs designed to protect critical infrastructure.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>But it cannot be done alone. And I am pleased to say there is a willingness in business to work together with government in a genuine partnership on these issues. This will be demonstrated again tomorrow when business leaders will join with a number of ministers and me for the second Business-Government Advisory Group meeting in Canberra. This is a mechanism for the government to discuss proposed new security initiatives and developments and, as well, learn lessons from what has tragically happened in London. I obviously look forward to that meeting with CEOs and industry leaders and we will continue to work together to keep not only our economy strong but our people safe and secure from the threat of terrorism.</para>
<para>There is another matter, Mr Speaker, that I know you and honourable members are very much aware of, and that is that I asked ASIO for advice on whether there were currently grounds in Australia for listing the organisation Hizb ut-Tahrir. ASIO has advised me that at present there is no basis under current legislation for specifying Hizb ut-Tahrir as a terrorist organisation under the Criminal Code. As I understand it, Hizb ut-Tahrir members overseas have called for attacks in the Middle East and Central Asia, but here in Australia it is not known to haveâand I use these words deliberatelyâplanned, assisted in or fostered any violent acts, which are the current legislative tests under the Criminal Code for proscription. At this stage the government is not aware of any information that Hizb ut-Tahrir is connected to the London bombings, as has been suggested elsewhere.</para>
<para>The Criminal Code required that for a group to be specified as a terrorist organisation it must directly or indirectly engage in preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act. Under this act, in addition, there are separate offences for inciting a terrorist act. However, it remains of concern that some Hizb ut-Tahrir elements have called for attacks against coalition forces in Afghanistan, Iraq and the United States and Israeli interests elsewhere. More generally, Hizb ut-Tahrir espouse a very extreme and radical agenda. I can confirm that my department is reviewing the proscription provisions contained in the Criminal Code and looking at some possible ways to strengthen those provisions. Until I receive that advice and have considered it, I am not prepared to comment on whether this group or any other may be listed in the future.</para>

Of those, there are a small number who for various reasons are no longer eligible for benefitsâperhaps their assets have increased and hence they no longer receive a service pension. But they remain on our database because they are a veteran or a war widow and it may well be that their assets will fall in value and they will again become eligible for an entitlement.

<para>âI certainly do agree with the member for Deakin that the government has made a good system even better. Since 1996 health spending has increased from under 15 per cent to over 20 per cent of the federal budget. Since 1996 federal health spending has increased from 3.7 per cent to 4.3 per cent of gross domestic product. This year the federal portfolio of Health and Ageing will spend $44 billion. But it is not the quantity of the spending, it is the quality of the outcomes that counts, and that is attested to by the fact that all the state Labor premiers and chief ministers have unanimously agreed that Australia has one of the best health systems in the world.</para>

The member for Lalor has been talking for months about the need for sustainability in the PBS. Earlier this week it was revealed that the rate of growth of PBS spending had declined sharply. What did she do? She did not come out and say, âThatâs great.â She said, âThe government has to investigate whether its policy of increasing copayments has put too big a burden on people needing medicine.â The increase in the copayment only happened because the opposition voted for it. Increasing the copayment was notâ</para>

<para>Let me remind the member for Lalor that constant calls for reform are not a health policy. Accusing people of being liars is not a health policy. Continuing to support Medicare Gold is not a health policy, given that the President of the ALP calls it a âturkeyâ. What we have in the opposition is a Leader of the Opposition who never even mentions health and the member for Lalor and spokesman for health who is not allowed to ask questions about it in this parliament. Is it any wonder that the people of Australia have concluded that the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had?</para>

<para>âYesterday, the member for Chifley and Chief Opposition Whip directed a question to you, which you invited me to follow up. During the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee consideration of amendments to the Family Law Act 1975, the committee requested a copy of the act showing additions and deletions proposed by the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Bill 2005. As the Chief Opposition Whip has noted, such mark-ups are not ordinarily prepared in the course of preparation of legislative amendments. On this occasion the Family Court was able to assist, having prepared an indicative mark-up for its own purposes over an extended period, and was able to pass this on to the committee to assist in their consideration of the exposure draft bill.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I am pleased that the member for Chifley and other members found it helpful in considering the exposure draft. I have to say that preparation of accurate mark-ups of acts proposed to be amended would be a very resource intensive task. It requires people with specialised training and skills. Some of those skills exist in my departmentâs Office of Legislative Drafting and Publishing but the engagement of staff to prepare mark-ups of every act proposed to be amended, on a regular basis, would divert the officers from work on their customary tasks, which includes the compilation of Commonwealth statutes to ensure the accuracy and currency of our statute books.</para>
<para>Given the remarks of the honourable member for Chifley and his appreciation of the assistance provided by the family law indicative mark-up, I have asked my office to consider preparation of mark-ups for legislation that is complex. They will do so on a case by case basis. I will consult with ministerial colleagues on the matter as to whether or not they are prepared to assist in identifying suitable personnel to do it in the case of other legislation as well.</para>

<para>âMr Speaker, I have a question to you. I am mindful of the time, and that there is some further work for the House to get through. Could I ask you to reflect over the coming few days on a series of rulings you have made yesterday and today? Yesterday I asked a question of the Treasurer. I asked him to comment on a speech made by the Minister for Health and Ageing. You allowed that question without comment. Yesterday, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked the Minister for Education, Science and Training a question which included a quote from Senator Barnaby Joyce. You commented that questions should not contain references to other members, and you made a similar comment today when the Leader of the Opposition had a question which also referred to Senator Barnaby Joyce.</para>

<para>Can I indicate, with the greatest of respect, that on the surface there appears to be some inconsistency in these rulings. Whilst I accept that <inline font-style="italic">House of Representatives Practice</inline> directs members not to make inflammatory or critical remarks of other members in questions, it does not go to the point of examining by way of question, difference in government opinion or the opinions of government members and we must, as a an opposition, be able in question time to ask ministers about apparent divisions within the government on critical policy questions.</para>

</talker>
<para>âby leaveâI am pleased to advise that on 28 July the government, along with our counterparts from the United States, Japan, China, India and South Korea, announced the formation of the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate. The partnership brings together for the first time key developing and developed countries in the region to address the challenges of climate change, energy security and air pollution in a way that is designed to promote economic development and reduce poverty. The partnership represents a significant achievement for Australian diplomacy. Australia played an instrumental role in attracting regional countries to the concept and in drafting the partnership vision statement.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The partnership also represents a new way of approaching global environmental challenges. It is reflective of a mindset that appreciates that such issues cannot be looked at in isolation. It recognises that economic development and energy security are legitimate national goals and that actions to address climate change should complement rather than frustrate the pursuit of these goals. It is an approach that values results and eschews ideology.</para>
<para>This partnership is a regional grouping of great significance. The six founding partner countries, taken together, constitute 45 per cent of the worldâs population. They account for 49 per cent of the worldâs energy consumption and are responsible for 48 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Working together, this group can have a significant impact on global approaches towards climate change.</para>
<para>By every measure, this group is a larger and more significant collection of countries than those countries that have binding emissions targets under the Kyoto protocolâthe so-called annex I countries. These annex I countriesâworthy as they areâtogether account for only 13 per cent of the worldâs population, 36 per cent of the worldâs energy consumption and 32 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.</para>
<para>Importantly, the partnership is intended to complement, not replace, the Kyoto protocol. Indeed, most of the partnership countries are signatories to the Kyoto protocol, and Japan is an annex I country. All of the partnership countries are signatories to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Four of the partnership countriesâJapan, India, China and South Koreaâhave ratified the Kyoto protocol, and Japan has binding emissions targets under Kyoto.</para>
<para>Other Kyoto countries have welcomed our initiative. The British environment minister, Elliot Morley, describes the partnership as âa welcome step forwardâ. The British Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir David King, says, âIt is very much in line with what we have been trying to do.â The Canadian foreign minister, Pierre Pettigrew, says, âThis is progress.â The head of the Swiss environment agency describes it as âa complement to Kyoto and perhaps a good preparation for the time after Kyotoâ. The German environment minister states that the partnership will âsupport international cooperation on climate changeâ.</para>
<para>I note, by the way, that the Labor Partyâthe federal opposition in this countryâis not so enthusiastic. When asked about the partnership by a journalist, the Leader of the Opposition said, âIt is nothing.â The opposition spokesman on the environment, the member for Grayndler, put out two press releases in response. One of them was titled âSecret climate pact more spin than substanceâ and the other was titled âClimate pact spin and hypocrisyâ. His reaction to the announcement was to say the âregional climate change pact is little more than government spinâ. Of course that is a reflection on Japan, China, India and the United States. Bearing in mind that the member for Grayndler would not know very much about those countries, this simply rebounds and reflects the vacuousness of the press releases and the fact that it is just a party political point-scoring operation.</para>
<para>We disagree with those so-called commentsâas, of course, would the other governments that have signed up to the partnership. How could a regional climate change partnership that accounts for 50 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, has been welcomed by Kyoto signatories and is committed to finding growth-friendly solutions to climate change be dismissed as simply âspinâ? I hope the Labor Party change their mind. I hope they do not let their ideological fixation with the Kyoto protocol blind them to practical, cooperative initiatives designed by a range of countries to address climate change.</para>
<para>Australia, despite having decided against ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, is one of the few countries actually on track to meet its Kyoto emission target. Our emissions in 2003 were only 1.1 per cent higher than in 1990. Over the same period, the Australian economy has grown by 50 per cent. Per dollar of real GDP, we have reduced emissions by 33.4 per cent. Although we are on track to meet our targetâsomething that very few Kyoto annex I countries can claimâwe have never been afraid to state plainly that Kyoto does not and will not work. Even if emission targets are metâand this does look highly unlikely on current projectionsâKyoto will see global emissions in 2010 increase by 40 per cent from what they were in 1990, when without Kyoto they would have increased by 41 per cent. One per cent is better than nought per cent but one per cent is not a solution to the problem. Developing countriesâthose expected to account for over half of all greenhouse gas emissions by 2020âhave no Kyoto targets and are, quite understandably, not willing to sacrifice economic growth to negotiate them. Kyoto is not driving the technology response needed to properly address climate change. In fact, its existence encourages the relocation of emissions from one country to another with no overall net greenhouse benefit.</para>
<para>The importance of developing country participation can be illustrated quite starkly. Australia accounts for only 1.4 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Even if Australia took the alarming step of closing every power station tonight, Chinaâs industrial growth is so rapid that the greenhouse gas savings made by this hypothetical gesture would be replicated by China in just one year. A long-term, effective response to climate change needs to be one that includes all major emitters. It needs to recognise and acknowledge the fundamental importance of economic development for global security and stability. It needs to address properly the worldâs energy needs. It needs to recognise that a realistic climate change policy cannot be anti growth. And it needs to have technological development, cooperation and deployment as its centrepiece.</para>
<para>The Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate does all of this. It is a technology focused, pro-growth approach to climate change. It is about substance rather than symbols and results rather than rhetoric. Policy integration will lie at the heart of the partnership. It will not seek to address issues in isolation from one another. Through the partnership we will find ways to meet our energy, climate change and air pollution challenges in practical ways that promote economic development. The partnership takes account of differing national circumstances. Each country has national strategies and goals to address climate change, energy needs, air pollution and economic development. The partnership provides a framework for international cooperation to support these goals for mutual benefit. It will not be seeking to impose arbitrary targets, mandatory policies or artificial time frames, which in any case probably would never be met.</para>
<para>The partnership will sensibly put technology cooperation front and centre. International consensus appreciates the pivotal role of technology to any solution on climate change and energy security. The role of technology has been recognised at the recent UK Energy and Environment Ministerial Roundtable in March, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change seminar in May, the International Energy Agency ministerial in May and the recent G8 Leaders Summit in July. Through the partnershipâs visionstatement, we have identified many areas for potential technology cooperation, including clean coal, agriculture, carbon capture and storage, renewables and civilian nuclear power. We will also use the partnership as a forum for policy dialogue, canvassing policy issues such as best practice climate and energy policies, barriers to technology deployments, standards and performance measures. We will also be discussing financing mechanisms.</para>
<para>I am pleased to inform the House that Australia will host the inaugural ministerial meeting of the partnership in November. Foreign, environment and energy ministers from the founding partners will be invited to build on the vision statement by articulating a charter program and a work program. The formation of the partnership represents a new model for addressing climate change. The ministerial meeting will be a start. There will be no claims of a quick fixâand no setting of phoney arbitrary goals or time lines that probably would not be met anywayâand no-one with a serious understanding of climate change could honestly pretend there is any such thing. But we do anticipate that the Australian meeting will begin a long-term, practical collaboration that will promote low-carbon technologies, reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of our economies and put us on low-emission growth trajectories. I urge the House to support the partnership. I present a copy of my ministerial statement.</para>

<para>âThere is no doubt that avoiding dangerous climate change is the most significant environmental challenge facing the global community. Unfortunately, the ministerâs statement highlights once again the failure of the government to take serious action to address climate change. Today we have seen more spin and half-statements but no objective, no target, no funding and no mechanism of achieving it. The Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate is a positive move from where the government has been. I thought that finally the climate sceptics within the government had been isolated as the flat-earthers of the 21st century. It was only on 16 February that the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources said:</para>

<quote>
<para class="block">We thought that with some of these issues there was no scientific debate these days.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It appears that there is. The statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs is welcome in that it at least recognises that some of the time a majority of the government recognise that climate change is happening.</para>
<para>This partnership is similar to agreements being formed around the world. Indeed, the partnership agreement itself acknowledges this when it states that it aims to âbuild on the foundation of existing bilateral and multilateral initiativesâ. That is one of the disagreements that we have with the government. In our foreign policy Labor believe in multilateralism. We believe we must be a part of international action and engage with the world in a cooperative manner. Of course, the exchange of research and cooperation, particularly in new technology, is positive. This is occurring between all countries involved in the UN framework. It was acknowledged at the G8 summit in Gleneagles. It is occurring in meetings between China and the EU and between India and the EU.</para>
<para>The governmentâs failings were reinforced by the Minister for Foreign Affairsâwe can accept thatâbut today the minister again attacked the Kyoto protocol. He stated, âWe have never been afraid to state plainly that Kyoto does not, and will not, work.â This completely ignores the fact that it was the Howard government that signed the protocol in 1997and that the Prime Minister said then that the protocol was âa win for the environment and a win for Australian jobsâ. The ministerâs statement skates over the fact that four of the six partners have ratified the Kyoto protocol. It ignores the fact that 140 countries have ratified the Kyoto protocol. The rhetoric contradicts the conclusion of the partnership vision statement:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The partnership will be consistent with and contribute to our efforts under the UNFCCC and will complement, but not replace, the Kyoto Protocol.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He quoted the Canadian foreign minister without looking at what he really said. The Canadian foreign minister, Pierre Pettigrew, said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">When you want to complement something, you recognise that the real substance is somewhere else.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He got it exactly right, because, if the six countries in the partnership are a sixpack, then Kyoto is the whole slab. It is the main game. This is a minor part of real international action. A total of 140 countries, including Japan, Korea, China and India, have all signed up.</para>
<para>In his statement the minister selected numbers. He spoke about category 1 countries as if they are all that is involved in the protocol. What occurred, of course, was that developing countries, led by Australia in 1992 at Rio and in 1997 at Kyoto, said that the industrialised countries had to take the lead and get the targets in the first period from 2008 to 2012. The fact is that the Kyoto protocol has signatories who emit three-quarters of the worldâs greenhouse gases. Only the US and Australia are on the outside looking in, and there is huge criticism from Europe and within the US of the Bush administrationâs position. Senior Republican Senator John McCain stated:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The pact amounts to nothing more than a nice little public-relations ploy. It has almost no meaning. They arenât even committing money to the effort, much less enacting rules to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">David Sandalow, a former US State Department official who is now at the Brookings Institution, said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Itâs a great line-up of countries; I just wish they were doing something serious. Basically these kind of technology-cooperation partnerships have been around for years. This seems to be nothing but a repackaging of existing technology partnerships tied up in a bow.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Readers of the ministerâs statement might believe that developing countries are not engaged. They are. China was the first country to register a project under the Kyoto protocolâs clean development mechanism. Under the clean development mechanism both China and India have developed car emission standards far superior to those in the US. Make no mistake, they are engaged in the Kyoto protocol. Australia, however, cannot participate in the CDM process and gain carbon credits for investing in developing countries because we have not ratified the Kyoto protocol.</para>
<para>The essential difference between the Kyoto protocol and the Asia-Pacific pact, now that the climate sceptics have been isolated, is the attitude towards the market. How do you drive the development of new technology? Kyoto recognises that emissions trading is the most efficient market based mechanism to drive that change. That is why targets and performance indicators are so important, not just in the business of climate change but in every businessâotherwise you are just fluffing around at the edges. BP saved $US650 million by implementing an internal emissions trading system.</para>
<para>The market sceptics argue for a voluntary approach without targets and without any mechanism to drive changeâand we heard the rhetoric here again today. There has not been so much scepticism about markets since Marxist summer schools stopped meeting in the sixties and seventies. It is extraordinary that from a conservative government comes this absolute fear of a market based mechanism to drive this change. The Asia-Pacific pact places a huge reliance on technological development; the ministerâs statement makes no bones about that.</para>
<para>Relying solely on technology to deal with greenhouse emissions is like trying to empty a puddle while the tap is still runningâyou simply cannot do it. But do not take my word for it. On the <inline font-style="italic">Insiders</inline> on Sunday, 31 July, the Minister for Foreign Affairs forgot his notes. He acknowledged that price signals were important, totally in contradiction to todayâs rhetoric. He said that to achieve cuts to greenhouse gas emissions âweâll have to investigate price signals coming from energyâ. That is what Kyoto does, and you can only have two forms of price signal: market based emissions trading or a carbon tax. Perhaps that is what the minister was talking about.</para>
<para>The foreign minister talked about the International Energy Agency as though it endorsed the governmentâs position. But, two days ago, the International Energy Agency released a report condemning Australiaâs spiralling greenhouse gas emissions and calling upon Australia to introduce a domestic emissions trading system. The governmentâs own report, <inline font-style="italic">Climate change: risk and vulnerability</inline>, released just days before the announcement of the Asia-Pacific pact, showed a frightening picture of Australia in 30 years: 20 per cent less rainfall; 20 per cent less run-off into the Murray-Darling; an increase in extreme weather conditions, including cyclones, floods and prolonged droughts; risks to our coastal areas, where most Australians live; and the risk of the Great Barrier Reef and the wet tropics of North Queensland and Kakadu disappearing.</para>
<para>But the government argued that there was no cause for alarmâwe could be relaxed and comfortable. Labor believe this is a call to action. We will not leave the responsibility for this to our children and grandchildren. That is why we will ratify the Kyoto protocol, increase our mandatory renewable energy target, introduce a climate change trigger under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and, most importantly, have a national emissions trading system to drive that technological change, which we all agree is important; it is a matter of how you get there. The government does not have a path to get there. What it has is a smokescreen to pretend it is doing something while it is ignoring this critical challenge. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThis matter of public importance today deals with a spectacular failure of policy by the Howard government. Today a tractor convoy of Tasmanian farmers reached Parliament House after many weeks on the road in Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales. Those farmers undertook their long journey throughout rural and regional Australia to pursue a very simple objective: to secure accurate and comprehensive country of origin labelling of fresh, packaged and processed fruit and vegetables. It is not a big ask, you might say, from an Australian government that has consistently walked away from delivering key promises to farmers and their families. Country of origin labelling is simply one of those promises. I congratulate Matthew Ryan, Richard Bovill and all the farmers and businesses in rural Australia on playing their part in elevating this issue in the minds of the Australian people.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I addressed the rally that was held in Shepparton and, of course, there was a large turnout there of farmers, workers and business people concerned about this issue. My colleague the member for Ballarat addressed a big rally in her electorate, because, as we know, this issue is very important to workers and farmers in Ballarat. Today the Leader of the Opposition addressed the rally outside Parliament House. With the Leader of the Opposition I met with farmers, unionists, businesspeople and community leaders in Devonport last week, where they made no bones about their disappointment with the coalition and its members to get some action on this issue. I say to Richard Bovill and Matthew Ryan: yours is a unique struggle, one which goes to the very heart of what Australia is today and what it wants to retain in the way of its economic independence tomorrow.</para>
<para>With farmers in this struggle are over 60,000 people employed in the food industry in this country. As we heard today at the rally outside Parliament House, unionists and rural businesspersons, along with representatives from state governments and local communities, have joined with farmers on a very simple questâto get truth in labelling in this country. This is a matter of great public importance to farmers, to process workers, to small business in rural areas and to rural and regional communities generally. It is also of critical importance to Australian consumers.</para>
<para>There is a very simple economic principle in this piece of public policy. Farmers who gathered today are not about protection for their businesses. There is a very simple economic proposition, and you can read it in any year 11 textbook. It is simply this: the consumer in the marketplace is sovereign, and to exercise that sovereignty they need full knowledge and information when they spend their dollars. Their simple request to the federal governmentâwhich neglected them for nine long years while they sat on their hands and failed to deliver one simple propositionâis that, when consumers go to buy their fresh fruit and vegetables or their processed food, they want, at the point of purchase, correct information as to the country of origin of that food.</para>
<para>We on this side of the House do not intend to let this minister backslide again out of the commitment that the National Party made in 1995 for truth in country of origin labelling. It was a clear commitment. You do not have to be some new dummy in the Senate to not understand what the commitment was. On 31 January 1995, the coalition shadow minister for consumer affairs, the former minister for agriculture, said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The coalition enthusiastically supports the concept of truthful country of origin labelling.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He went on to say that the coalition believed in country of origin labelling and stated:</para>
<quote>
<para>Consumers want to buy Australian, and they have a right to know that the products that they buy are indeed Australian. Therefore, country of origin labelling ... has its genesis in a worthwhile objective.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">You cannot get it any clearer than that. But the simple fact is that for the nine long years of the Howard government we have seen virtually nothing happen in this area. If I can regurgitate the simple plea of farmers out there today to the minister; it is a plea, a simple statementâI guess I am an Aussie Rules man so I will use the words of the great John Kennedy: do something! After nine long years, Minister, do something. You have had your chance. We all know the reason why there has been inaction on this: the National Party in this parliament are really just a bunch of backsliders.</para>

<para>âThe National Party has had nine years to get this one right. Policy cave-ins are what we have come to expect from the merchant bankers, the stockbrokers, the engineers and the lawyers who now represent the National Party in this parliament, with the exclusion of you, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley. We know that if you had been in the chair you would have had this wrapped up nine years ago. But we know of the backsliding that has been done by these National Party ministers in government over a long period of time.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>Farmers in this country want the National Party to muscle up on this issue. We want you to muscle up on it, spine up on it, and we want you to introduce mandatory country of origin labelling. We want you to resist the big end of town when you do it. But we know that the National Party and this minister probably will not do that, because we know that the minister is about as firm on this issue as a ripe tomato that has been out in 100-degree heat for about three days. We know you will not deliver, Minister, and we are watching with interest what is happening in the Senate.</para>
<para>There are gaping holes in the labelling laws that you could drive a tractor through, and after nine long years you say you are going to do something about them. Farmers have waited and waited, and you have talked and talked while you have done nothing, but this is one issue we do not intend letting you backslide out of, Minister. The government might have backslid on the commitment of the government and the National Party to the sugar industry when it was dropped off the FTA. The National Party may be backsliding on the sale of Telstra. We know already that the National Party has backslid on the mandatory retail grocery code of conduct. But this is one issue that farmers, unionists and others will not let you backslide on.</para>
<para>Minister, you have a big chance here because there was a collective sigh of relief when the former Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the member for Wide Bay, was ceremoniously dumped from this portfolio. We saw under the previous minister the live exports fiasco, the collapse of Australiaâs quarantine arrangements and the absolute confusion in drought administration. Farmers were glad to see the back of him. When the current minister got the job, Australian farmers were hanging out for the fact that they might get a <inline font-style="italic">Braveheart</inline>. But with the ministerâs performance already in this House, and his performance today, we know they did not get a <inline font-style="italic">Braveheartâ</inline>they got a blowhard. You will have to muscle up on this one, Minister. No amount of weasel words are going to get you out of the fact that you now have to muscle up on country of origin labelling.</para>
<para>We know there is a bit of muscling up being done over in the Senate by the National Party, by Senator Joyce. We on this side of House really do not know Senator Joyce from a bar of soap. We can only take it that he is an honest and dedicated member of the National Party. There is some confusion in the government ranks about Senator Joyce. I have been reading what they have been saying about him. The member for OâConnor called him âa dopey so-and-soâ, but as Paul Keating, former Labor Prime Minister, would say, âThatâs like getting mauled by a dead sheep.â There again, the member for OâConnor said he is âa dopey so-and-soâ. The member for Leichhardt said, âHe must have been on another planet 10 years ago.â So he is saying that he is an extraterrestrial.

<para>âOn the other side, with a photo opportunity. For goodness sake, let us take a step back. This is about two issues: country of origin labelling and the multinational companies. On the issue of country of origin labelling, it has astounded me that the members on the other side of the House obviously cannot do their research very accurately. For a start, the majority of the Australia and New Zealand Food Standards Ministerial Council is made up of Labor state health ministers. Have we heard one Labor state government coming out in support of changing country of origin labelling? No, they have been very silent.</para>

<para>We have had the federal government actioning. In the space of three weeks with the Fair Dinkum Food campaign we have met with seven Coles executives in Melbourne, we have met with the CEO of McDonalds and we have met with the processors. In the next few weeks there will be a roundtable conference with the growers, the processors and the women in agriculture. Coles executives have committed to moving forward. McDonalds, in a somewhat subdued way, have acknowledged that they made a mistake by signing a contract to buy New Zealand potatoes for the sake of 5c per packet of french fries.</para>
<para>But what is of even greater concern is the knowledge of the Leader of the Opposition on this subject. We call him the alternative Prime Minister! In Devonport only a few days ago with the Fair Dinkum Food campaignâand I am sure the member for Corio will back this upâas people asked the Leader of the Opposition questions, he sat there with a glaze in his eyes and did not answer one question. Again and again he said, âOver to you, Gavan.â He showed a lack of interest, a lack of understanding, a lack of compassion and a lack of wanting to do something. An example, which we have just received, is the interview with the Leader of the Opposition on the Leon Byner program on 5AA today, which reveals a disturbing lack of knowledge about food labelling in Australia.</para>

So those responsible for the labelling should enforce it. Itâs not that hard. I mean, there are only a couple of supermarket chains around here and they could do the job effectively.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It is very clear from the transcript that Mr Beazleyâand he is the Leader of the Opposition, the alternative Prime Ministerâhas no idea about this issue. The farmers acknowledge that there is only one group of politicians that is prepared to do something, and that is this side of the House. Mr Beazley: go back to school and do your research. It is appalling. We had thousands of farmers outside expecting to see some bipartisan action. Instead, what do we have? We have the Leader of the Opposition throwing an orange around in the air and behaving like a circus act.</para>
<para>It is just so disappointing. What message did he deliver to the growers, to the processors, to the families or to the truck drivers? Let me remind the House that there were something like three kilometres of tractors there this morning. And what did the Leader of the Opposition deliver? Absolutely nothingâjust a lot of rhetoric. Doug Cameron. It is just so disappointing when we have an issue of such national significance and all they can drive out is the same old rhetoric, the same old union drivel from 50 years ago. It is about time the other side of the House got with it and got in the 21st century. âWhat has this government done?â the other side might ask. We have spent half a million dollars in soil nutrition studies with Serve-Ag, who do world-leading cutting-edge research and development. We spent $1.3 million just in Tasmania on an agriculture college. This is what we call real deliverance of opportunities for farmers. We are talking about Northern Tasmania.</para>

<para>âOther commitments. We have got a commitment. This side of the House has got a commitment from Coles and McDonalds, the processors and the growers to get around the table and move forward. We will ensure that this industry moves forward. We cannot speak for the other side of the House because there is just political rhetoric. The practical people on this side of the House come from approximately 48 different occupations, and those on that side come from fewer than 10. We understand how business works. We have been out there, we have picked up rocks and we have picked up potatoes. We have had to be accountable for the money that went in our pockets.</para>

<para>âYes, their side. After a meeting in recent times a definition was expounded to me when the Leader of the Opposition was trying to explain policy. He performed the same out here today on the country of origin labelling, which obviously he knows nothing about. This person said, âHe needs to spend some time on a farm because he reminds me of a sheepdog in the back of the flat-tray truck: whenever there are some people on this side he will go woof, woof, woof and then move over to this side and go woof, woof, woof.â We have heard the analogy of the double side of the plank. This is a classic today and it was a classic on 20 July. What is it todayâ11 August? So that was some 22 days ago and he is no further advanced.</para>

<para>People are sick and tired of these serious issues developing into political humdrum. It should not be the Left against the Right or the Right against the Left; it should not be the Greens against Liberal or Labor against Liberal on these issues. It just would be amazing if you had the mental capacity to put the issues above politics for once. Is that too much to ask? I absolutely think it is. You need to sit down and talk to the Richard Bovills of the world, the Matt Ryans of the world and the wives and women in agriculture and understand that they want solutions. That is what this side of the House is about. This side of the House is about finding solutions and delivering on election promises as in agriculture colleges, as in developing rural markets and as in from Tasmaniaâs perspectiveâmay I be a little bit territorialâthe freight equalisation scheme. But what is the other side of the House continually coming up with? Rhetoric.</para>
<para>Mr Beazley is well informed by inspection. By whom? Enforced by which department, which government? He does not even know how FSANZ, Food Standards Australia New Zealand, operates or that people from his own partyâs state governments are on that ministerial council. What an embarrassment. There is no wonder that people become so disillusioned out there in private industry. When it comes to it, whom do they trust? Whom do they believe? It has to be this side of the House.</para>

<para>âYou had nine years too. It is unbelievable, Minister. They just do not seem to get it. They have no policies whatsoever. Whether we are talking about food labelling, interest rates, unemployment or whatever, it is a no-brainer. You just do not seem to get it. Productivity in the last nine years has gone through the roof, whether it is on the waterfront or whether it is in agriculture. But what will happen when the dollar turns? We will be there. We will make sure that this industry survives. What would you do? You would put them all on the dole queue. Then what would happen to our account deficit? It would blow out and industries would be absolutely lost.

<para>âPartnerships, as my good colleague behind me says. But you only seem to be interested in the cheap political shot. That is all that Mr Beazley delivered today. That is all that has come from that side of the House. There have been no productive ideas, no innovation and no direction of any kindâjust standing up there and continually blaming the federal government for everything. Mr Beazley, what about the shadow minister for agriculture, the member for Corio? He continues to lay the line that food labelling is the federal governmentâs responsibility. There is joint responsibility; the states and territories are also involved. It is about time those opposite understood that B comes after A and C comes after B. Just get on with it. Start lobbying the state governments and moving on.</para>

<para>âMr Deputy Speaker Causley, I am pleased to see you in the chair. The member for Braddon has taken some time to try to denigrate my leader for his words today. I find it really silly of him to go down that track. He makes statements like âno state government has given support to this campaignâ. The Premier of Tasmania attended and spoke at todayâs rally. His government has contributed money. He has helped lead the campaign. He and his ministers have visited these tractors all over the east coast; they have actually funded the campaign.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The member for Braddon does not quite understand this campaign of which he is part. When the farmers do sit down with Coles and Woolworths, I certainly hope that they have someone better than you to negotiate for them. They will not get anything out of Coles and Woolworths if they have someone of your capacity to negotiate, because you would fail them greatly. They will need someone who can negotiate with a multinational company. They will need someone with some idea of what they are talking aboutâand you do not have any ideas.</para>
<para>As my good friend Sid Sidebottom says, if you cut your toenail and throw a bit of it down in the red soil of the north-west coast of Tasmania, a foot will grow. That is what Sid says and it is quite true. It is great country and it grows great vegetables. It has great people, some of whom are great Tasmanian farmers. This has been a Tasmanian uprising. Tasmanians, when they get riled, do something about it. Tasmanian farmers have mustered their forces and set off on tractors to gain support from other farmers all over Australia to capture the nationâs attention and to demonstrate a clear case for action on tighter, clearer national food labelling laws.</para>
<para>I grew up on a dairy farm. I spent my early life on farms in rural Australia. I know what picking up spuds is about. I do not think the member for Braddon has ever picked up a spud in his life. He probably would not know what one looks like. He would not know the front end of a potato from its back end. These Tasmanian farmers are fair dinkum about getting clear national food labelling laws. They have spent the last couple of weeks touring through country towns on their way to Canberra. You do not have to look far to see that they have collected farmers on the way and these farmers are angry.</para>
<para>I read in the <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline> recently that McCains Foods dumped $2.3 million worth of local product in favour of imported chips. Sixty McCain farmer-growers from Smithton to Longford, my home town, have had their contracts reduced by 10 per cent. That loss follows a 3c cut that occurred earlier in the yearâand this is not the end of the story. McCain potato growers chairman was quoted as saying that, in two years, frozen chip imports have increased from 8,000 tonnes to 33,000 tonnes. And this guy, who has come into the parliament only a short time ago, has not said anything before about this.</para>
<para>Then there is the story of the brassica grower on the north-west coast whose 100,000 top cauliflowers were ploughed in as worm food. It was in the paper this week accompanied by a photograph. The Premier of Tasmania was standing with that grower. I did not see you in the photograph, Member for Braddon. I saw the Premier of Tasmania standing there, taking up the challenge. That is four months work, just a 10-minute drive from the processing factory, that has gone down the drain.</para>
<para>These are the points that these farmers are trying to make. The idiotic thing about all this is that Simplot paid the brassica growers an estimated $311,000 compensation as well as importing cauliflowers from overseas. How dumb is that? It is as dumb as the member for Braddon. These stories have been all over our papers and politicians from every side and at every level have got involved, yet it has taken the farmers themselves to highlight this absurdity and to seek some action by getting on their tractors and driving to Canberra. The member for Braddon ought to get behind them, instead of coming into this House and talking a lot of hooey and rubbish and trying to denigrate people, like the opposition member.</para>
<para>This is really silly stuff. You have to learn to make the points that will help the farmers of the north-west coastâand you have failed to do so. I certainly hope they do not have you there when they are trying to negotiate with Coles, Woolworths or McDonalds. I agree with Doug Cameron when he pointed out today at the rally that the food industry supports over 600,000 Australian jobs and some of these industries produce a trade surplus. He said that last year the Australian food industry exported $15.3 billion worth of product and imported $5.8 billion worth. The problem is that the $15.3 billion is dropping and the $5.8 is growing.</para>

<para>âOn this weekend Australians commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War and I want to use this occasion to pay tribute to a man who describes the early part of his life in these terms:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">I was born at Leichhardt, a Sydney suburb, on 9th November 1915 of the most wonderful mother in this whole wide world, a clever beautiful woman, always neat and clean who showed me all the love she could with her eyes for she was deaf and dumb and highly emotional.</para>
<para class="block">We understood each other perfectly, which is probably why I learned to read and write at a very early age. At five years of age I could converse by talking on my fingers. My reading of the sign language was very slow but my lovely mother taught me to smile and to think and to be cheerful and to wander.</para>
<para class="block">She sheltered me and protected me because she needed me so much.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That man was Ernest Victor Emerson, my father, who, later in 1939, joined the war effort, fighting in Europe. He was one of the first members of the armed forces to go to Europe and while fighting in Larissa in Greece in 1941 he was shot through the leg. That certainly slowed him down and he was captured by the Italians. After several months of what I would have to say was torture and starvation behind iron bars in a Greek prison, my father, Private Ernest Victor Emerson, was shipped to a concentration camp in Italy. Following the capitulation of Italy in the Second World War, he then thought that they would be released and would perhaps return to Australia or continue to fight. But he was wrong about that because they were put on trains and taken to a prisoner of war camp in Germany.</para>
<para>During that time my father kept a diary, which my brother still has, and I have a copy of the diary here. I want to mention a couple of points that he made. He talks about the deprivation and the very harsh treatment, not so much of the Australians but of the Russians in particular, and the brutality that was displayed towards those in German prisoner of war camps. He then goes forward through the diary to 23 August 1944 and he reflects on three years of captivity in a prisoner of war camp. He says:</para>

<para class="block">Three years of unforgettable torment and torture, worry and indecision, broken only by some bright intervals, such as receiving of letters from home.</para>

<para class="block">My dad died in 1978 of a heart attack and it was pretty clear that at the rate at which others, his mates, were dying they too had suffered life-shortening trauma through the Second World War. Many of them died very young. I do know, though, that dad would be amazed and very proud of the fact that his son is a member of parliament. He would not have been able to imagine that I could stand here on the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War and pay him this tribute. He was my great dad.</para>

<para>âI would like to call the Houseâs attention to yet another disastrous impact on the property values in Western Sydney and on the people I represent by the disastrous Labor government in the state of New South Wales. The Department of Infrastructure Planning and National Resources or DIPNR has turned areas of Llandilo and Berkshire Park in my electorate of Lindsay into a new zone called Landscape and Rural Lifestyle Zoning, which restricts the use of the land to green corridors, absolutely annihilating any value for the landholders of that land. If the state Labor government wants to be such a controller of developments then it should be acquiring the land equally from all landholders then drawing their lines for green corridors on it so that everyone in every suburb gets fair value and the current market value for their houses, rather than having this hidden environmental greenie-grabbing plan basically drawing a line arbitrarily all over the residential land in my electorate, substantially affecting property values.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This comes on the heels of a land tax introduced by the state Labor government that has been chaotic to understand, to collect and to pay. Every year we have seen changes in the way it is applied. At one stage we saw it applied right across every single landowner, regardless of the fact that some of them were battling families in my area struggling to pay for just a single investment property so that they could put away something for their superannuation and retirement. We saw the vendorâs tax absolutely annihilate investment in New South Wales and we saw last year that the New South Wales employment growth was only 1.7 per cent, compared with 5.6 per cent in Queensland and 5.3 per cent in WA. The Labor government in New South Wales tries to say: âItâs the federal government. Itâs the federal government!â If it is the federal government, how come Queensland and WA are storming ahead, and development, investment and jobs growth in New South Wales is lagging so far behind? It is because the New South Wales government does not know how to manage property. It does not know how to manage the financial sector and it certainly has no clue when it comes to stock investments and infrastructure spending.</para>
<para>We have seen yet again the total failure by this New South Wales government to respect the property values of all landholders in New South Wales, particularly the battlers in Western Sydney. It is no wonder at all that the people in Western Sydney are voting for the likes of Alan Cadman, who spoke on this issue on Tuesday night, and Louise Markus, who spoke in the House last night, and I know I will also be joined by my colleagues Kerry Bartlett, the member for Macquarie, and Pat Farmer, the member for Macarthur, on this issue of a huge strategy affecting housing prices in our area.</para>
<para>The councils involved are Baulkham Hills, Blacktown and Hawkesbury but, most importantly, the Labor dominated council of the Penrith city area has been totally silent on this issue. People affected in my area have had to find out and join with other councils and other protests that are occurring in this area on this very issue. The Penrith City Council are carrying out an extreme sleight of hand with their ratepayers; they are really abusing the privilege that Labor councillors have in terms of driving the direction of Penrith City Council. I urge the Penrith City Council to start taking action against the Labor state government and driving some change in the metropolitan strategy so that we see the land values of ratepayers in the Penrith City Council area protected and their future investments properly maintained in a rational and coherent investment policy along the lines of the economic responsibility that the federal government has shown.</para>

<para>âI want to finish off the speech I was making in the matter of public importance debate about the actions of Tasmanian and other Australian farmers in visiting Canberra today and rallying to bring to the notice of Australians and their politicians the needs of their industry. We were talking about the decline of the export vegetable and food industry and the rise of imports in that area. The food industry has huge potential for growth in Australia. If we do not get it right on labelling and endeavour to reverse the trend, we will not get that growth. Having a local, successful and viable industry will support many rural and regional farming communities and the many workers in that industry.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We need to keep people in their communities and provide jobs and a decent lifestyle so that they can continue to feed Australians with the best fresh and frozen food available. It all comes down to giving people a choiceâand if the labels, logos and promotion clearly indicate that it is grown and processed here, then consumers, us, can make the choice to buy the food and keep the jobs in Australia. So I agree with Doug Cameron and my leader, Kim Beazley, who said that at the rally today. I also agree that labelling should tell us where a product was made and not have the very small print that I found onceâI think I had been tipped offâwhen looking at tin of Edgellâs tomatoes. It read: âWhen adverse weather conditions affect supply of our Australian crop, we seek the worldâs best tomatoes, harvested when sun ripened to perfection, rich red and full of flavour.â The contents were almost totally from the USA, but you really had to search to find out where they were from. I do not think that sort of labelling is what the Australian consumer wants and we should be getting rid of it.</para>
<para>I do not agree with the Australian Food and Grocery Council which says that it is unworkable to require the identification of the source of all the ingredients. Manufacturers have to buy these ingredients from somewhere, so they should have all their orders marked and identified. All they have to do is sort out the labelling. Most of their print is set ready to go, so I cannot see that it would make much difference to the processes they use, but it would make a huge difference to the customers and consumers who are looking to buy their local produce. These are points that have to be taken up by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, who talked a lot of rhetoric at question time today, and this is the job that he has to do with these groups. It is up to the federal government to come up with a method of sorting out this labelling issue and to stop blaming the states or laying it on the states. The federal government should come up with ideas and this minister really does have to perform.</para>
<para>I like the Australian Manufacturing Workers Unionâs idea of having the supermarketsâ own brands meet home-grown quotas and putting some funds into promoting the industry, as well as seeking to have a fair allocation of shelf space for Australian made products in supermarkets. Why canât we do that? It is so hard to tell where food comes from? Many peopleâs eyesight is not so great at reading the very small print that they have on products today. A product of Australia should mean 100 per cent Aussie product. Anything else is a con.</para>

<para>âLast night in this House the member for Port Adelaide, Mr Sawford, raised the issue of the Parliamentary Prayer Network. In his speech, he said:</para>

<quote>
<para class="block">I collected a brochure from the Great Hall yesterday, and having asked your office, Mr Speaker, on Tuesday evening who had sponsored the use of the Great Hall for this event they promised to get back to me ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In his speech he also said that the members and senators who attended the Parliamentary Prayer Network conference conveniently omitted their names. I would like to record my name as one who attended that conference when my parliamentary duties allowed me to. I had a completely different out-take on the conference. This was a marvellous conference for anybody who did attend. It was held by the Parliamentary Prayer Network. The network is a group of churches and schools across Australia that prays for individual parliamentarians. They team up with a parliamentarian and a school. It is headed up by Pastor Peter and Lynne Klomp and their guest at the conference was the Reverend Cindy Jacobs from the USA.</para>
<para>It was great to have Cindy there. It was an honour and privilege for me to be in the same room as Cindy Jacobs and people like John and Wendy McNamara, who are from the local New Creation Church. In fact, as I sat down next to John he said to me, âYou wouldnât be Gaye Broadbentâs brother, would you?â He knew my sister some 40 years ago, but she has been Gaye Ford for 40 years. It is a small world. It showed me that our familyâPeter, Joy, Gaye and meâhave been standing with these people for nearly 40 years. I proudly stand with these people at that conference tonight. If the member for Port Adelaide wants to put me in a box with Cindy Jacobs, John and Wendy and the convenors of the Prayer Network, Peter and Lynne Klomp, I would be very proud to be standing in that box.</para>
<para>Part of the conference was a presentation from the Canberra Grammar School Junior Boys Choir and Chorale. Cindy Jacobs, being a classical pianist herself and having trained choirs, was impressed with our local talent. The boys were sensational. Their ages were eight and nine. It was a very proud presentation in the Parliament House.</para>
<para>I was also there when Margaret Court, former Wimbledon winner and great tennis player, thanked the Lord for the wonderful ministries that have come out of the USA to this nation. I thank the Lord too and stand with her on that. It was an honour to be in the room with her. This was a great conference and when the young band that was playing for the conference played <inline font-style="italic">How Great Thou Art</inline> it nearly made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.</para>
<para>The members of this House who have accepted Partnerships in Prayer with one of their local Christian schools were listed on the overhead screen throughout part of the conference. They were members from all over Australia. Sadly, the partnership that I have with the Chairo Christian College at Drouin was not listed and I will have to remedy that if they decide to come back to this House next year. Many members from both sides of the House of Representatives and the Senate were listed.</para>
<para>The prophecies from Cindy Jacobs were a credit to her and to the presentation. They were positive about this nationâgreat positives. They used the words âthe great south land of the holy spiritâ. I say about what she prophesied over this nation: I will take that. This was a marvellous conference. It was worthy of the capital and the people that gathered there. It is a proud moment for me to stand here this evening and stand with those people. If they are the people I am being judged against then I am very proud to be judged with Cindy Jacobs. I hope her ministry tour in Australia goes well.</para>

<para>âI rise in the House today to express the concern of many of my electors in the seat of Corio about the proposal by Terminals Ltd to enlarge its capacity to store butadiene at its facility in Corio. This is a proposal that has received conditional approval by the EPA but is vigorously opposed by the City of Greater Geelong and residents in the northern suburbs of my electorate, as well as receiving widespread opposition throughout the Geelong community. The matter is now scheduled for a hearing before the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal, which will meet on 18 August. That will be a seven-day hearing where over 97 objections to this facility will be heard. Those objections come from the City of Greater Geelong, community groups and individuals in the Geelong community.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Community groups include the Geelong Community Forum, the Geelong Community for Good Life, the Geelong Environment Council and the City of Greater Geelong. All of these organisations vigorously oppose this proposal and there are many individuals who have laboured long and hard to voice their opposition and that of their fellow residents to this proposal. If I name some I know I will be leaving many out but I do commend Sue McLean, Peter Linaker, Jack Moor, Margaret Lewis and other individuals on the north side and particularly Councillor Tony Ansett for his leadership in taking this matter before the City of Greater Geelong and before the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal.</para>
<para>During the Kennett era there was substantial community opposition to the relocation of the Coode Island facility to the Corio Bay area. At the time I vigorously opposed that proposal by the Kennett government and I very strongly oppose this current proposal by Terminals Ltd to expand its facility in Geelong. At the time of the Kennett government there was a clear statement by the Geelong community of its opposition to that proposal to relocate Coode Island to my electorate. The community of Geelong is emphatic that it does not want the creation of a toxic dump on its doorstep. This community certainly does not want Corio Bay turned into Coode Island by stealth.</para>
<para>This is a totally inappropriate development that ought to be rejected outright. This proposed development is just 1.8 kilometres away from homes in the north side suburbs of Corio, North Shore, Norlane and now Lovely Banks and it is about one kilometre from Geelong Grammar, which many students, right across the academic years, attend. It is time to respect the rights of citizens in Geelong to the quiet enjoyment of their residences and to raise their children in a safe environment free from the threat of a potential toxic poisoning of the air they breathe. These rights of citizens ought to be respected.</para>
<para>There is already significant disquiet in Geelong about the performance of the Environmental Protection Authority in other matters. I have had alarming evidence presented to me of the accumulation of toxic materials causing widespread health problems to individuals in the Geelong area. I intend to have much more to say about these matters in this House at a later date.</para>
<para>Put quite simply, Geelong residents, particularly workers and their families, ought not to have their rights in this matter put aside for the sake of high-income residents who have now moved into the Coode Island area in the Docklands precinct. The citizens of Geelong have a right to clean air. They are very concerned about the long-term safety of this facility and they are concerned that this may well be the thin edge of the wedge, in the relocation by stealth of the Coode Island facility, which was attempted during the Kennett era, to the Geelong area. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>.</para>

</talker>
<para>âThis has been a historic week in Australian politics. The coalition government, which was substantially and very confidently re-elected last October by the people of Australia, gained a majority in the Senate and therefore presented to the government with a majority in both houses of the parliament. It is also a very important week for the people of Ryan, for two reasons.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I remind the people of Ryan about changes that will affect them. The tax cuts that were formally passed in the Senate this week will be of significant advantage to them. They were entitled to these cuts as of 1 July because the Commissioner of Taxation had published schedules which were passed by the Senate this week and I commend and compliment the Senate very warmly on that. It should be noted for the record that the Labor opposition had defeated these tax cuts twice in the Senate. It was an indictment on their policy position not to understand the importance of tax cuts to the people of Australia.</para>
<para>The other thing that happened in the Senate this week, and which was important to the people of Ryan, was the abolition of the superannuation surcharge. This is very important to the people of Ryan and it is something which, in the years ahead, will go down in the history of national politics as a very significant initiative.</para>
<para>The government has been seeking to reduce the surcharge for quite some time. We wanted to reduce it to 7.5 per cent and the Labor opposition would permit the government to reduce it to a rate of only 10 per cent in the 2005-06 financial year. However, with the government having a majority in the Senate the surcharge legislation was able to be passed and now I can make the significant announcement to the people of Ryan that the rate is zero. The benefits will be enormous to the people of this country. There will be enormous benefits to the people of Ryan. Savings rates will be the key beneficiary in this country.</para>
<para>I point out that the surcharge was introduced very reluctantly by this government because when we came to office in 1996 we faced a budget deficit of almost $100 billion, which meant interest payments alone were some $9 billion or $10 billion. Today $90 billion of that budget deficit has been repaid by the Howard government and there have been interest rate savings of $5.7 billion as a result of those payments. That affects every day people very muchânot only people in my community, but people throughout this great country.</para>
<para>Interestingly enough, the Leader of the Opposition was finance minister at the time of the economic mismanagement of this country. But I can assure my constituents, who very generously re-elected me last October with a substantial majority, that there is no shortage of ideas on this side of the House. There is no reform fatigue in the government ranks. Unlike in the opposition, where they are absolutely bereft of ideas, this side of politics is full of initiative and full of ideas.</para>
<para>In the time allotted to me in the parliament today, I want to just touch very briefly on the importance of this surcharge being removed. The rate of national savings in this country is absolutely critical and removal of the surcharge will stimulate national savings. Also, the levels of individual superannuation savings will increase, we hope, substantially. The administrative complexity associated with the surcharge will disappear with its abolition. The extent of this advantage will be measured in the fullness of time but superannuation funds will hopefully increase at a faster rate as a consequence of this move, and that will be of enormous importance.</para>
<para>Over the long term, increased superannuation benefits are expected to lead to less reliance on the aged pension as Australians save for their future. I want to encourage Australians to take heed of that because it is something that is going to be very important for generations of Australians to come. The abolition of the surcharge will simplify the operation of the superannuation system. It will boost superannuation savings and, as I pointed out, it will provide enormous incentives to Australians to increase and develop their voluntary superannuation savings. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI rise in the few minutes remaining in the adjournment debate to raise another matter relating to my electorate that is of concern to the Geelong community. Recently an automotive components manufacturing company, Pilkington (Australia) Ltd, announced that it had lost a General Motors contract and that over the long term some 60 to 70 jobs could be lost in the Geelong manufacturing facility. It was only in 2000 that Pilkington invested some $55 million in state-of-the-art equipment in the plant. They received the cooperation of the work force in restructuring the operations of the plant and we were hopeful that over the long term employment levels in the company could be stabilised.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The company has come under intense competition from overseas, as have other automotive component manufacturers throughout Australia. They have had to suffer the high value of the dollar and high shipping costs from Australia for their products. It was with concern that we received the news that these workers could lose their jobs. I received a representation from workers in the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union at Pilkington and we resolved on a course of action to try to encourage the state and federal governments to support them.</para>

<para>âI rise today to congratulate Laurie Hampton of Green Valley for his efforts in my electorate. Laurie is the President of the Green Valley Cricket Club and this week he celebrates his 40th year of service. That is a remarkable achievement by any member of a sporting club, but one that is of particular significance given that Laurie was the very person who started the club in the first place. As a 19-year-old Green Valley local, Laurie was looking for a sport that could cater for the growing number of young residents in the area. Being a keen cricket lover, and not having much success in finding a suitable sporting outlet, Laurie set up the Green Valley Cricket Club with the assistance of a number of close friends. From its humble beginnings back in 1965, the club has grown from struggling to field a team in its inaugural year to boasting eight junior sides and four senior teams last season, a number of which took out their respective premierships.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Laurieâs dedication to the club has not come at the expense of other parts of his life. During his time with the Department of Navy in Sydney, Laurie oversaw the largest peacetime transfer of naval equipment, personnel and logistics undertaken at that time. Of course, Laurieâs attention to detail made sure that the operation was a success and, as a fitting tribute to his oversight of that project, he was awarded a naval commendation. I understand that this award now takes pride of place in Laurieâs lounge room. While his working life may have made way for retirement, Laurieâs cricket continues. He is in his 40th season with the Green Valley Cricket Club and, at the age of 59, he will be lining up to take the field this year and will be looking to score runs and take wickets.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Laurie Hamptons of this world are the people who should receive our praise for their efforts early and often. Laurie is the sort of person who is best described as a quiet achiever. He has put in the hard yards at grassroots level to keep the cricket club going over many years. This club has provided an outlet for many young people in the Green Valley area. I congratulate Laurie on his contribution to the community of south-western Sydney and I look forward to hearing many reports of huge scores and large wicket hauls as the season progresses. Laurie Hampton truly is a man who has given a great deal to the youth of the area and he typifies the very notion of a community builder.</para>

<para>âI bring to the Houseâs attention today something of great concern to the small and medium businesses in my electorate of Stirling and in Western Australia at largeâthat is, double dipping by the Gallop Labor government on stamp duty on motor vehicles. This double dipping is damaging to the motor trades industry in Stirling and to the motor trades industry in WA. Whilst getting record levels of GST, record levels of stamp duty and running a $1 billion surplus, the Gallop Labor government is whacking car dealers for stamp duty if a car is loaned out to a staff member for as little as a day.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Further revenue raising through charging stamp duty on vehicles being used in a private loan capacity by the car yard is, quite frankly, daylight robbery. It is totally unfair on the hardworking members of the motor trade industry, who deserve a break from this unfair impost. Just to put into perspective, for the benefit of the House, what this double dipping means: when a vehicle is used on leave for a day by a member of staff it becomes dutiable, and that stamp duty must be paid by the dealer. If it is sold the following day, it is again dutiable. In that case, the stamp duty is paid by the customer. To simplify this situation even further: the Gallop government is charging excessively high levels of stamp duty on the vehicle in question, not once but twice.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This is quite clearly an unashamed and classic case of double dipping by the WA Labor government, although I am not really surprised by this shameful practice. With the government persevering with its damaging and counterproductive policy, many small businesses in Stirling have been burnt by this poor decision making and by the lack of public policy direction. When small businesses like motor traders suffer, the state suffers and the larger national economy suffers. However, we could alleviate this problem tomorrow by recognising and altering this policy of double dipping.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is time for Premier Gallop to jump off the economic wave of success created by the Howard government through much-needed economic reform and responsible management and do something about unfair tax double dipping, to get off the backs of the small and medium businesses in Western Australia. This can be done tomorrow by recognising that the GST payments have made Western Australia far richer than it would have been under the old taxation arrangements. Geoff Gallop can scrap not only all of the taxes he agreed to under the intergovernmental agreement but also inefficient and damaging stamp duty surcharges. Furthermore, Premier Gallop must recognise that a state budget surplus of over $1 million should be spent not on workers attending pointless rallies but on scrapping and cutting the highest levels of stamp duty in the country. So I say to Premier Gallop and the Western Australian state Labor government: give motor traders in Stirling and Western Australia a break and do not put your hands in their pockets unfairly twice.</para>

<para>âI want to say a few words this morning on behalf of my constituents who currently contribute to private health insurance. The government should really be using its powers to ensure that these people, who spend considerable sums of money on private health insurance, in fact receive value for the high costs of their coverage. In a local survey of constituents on a range of medical issues, I asked them questions to do with gap payments, and 74 per cent reported that their gap payments had increased, which is not surprising. When I asked whether they received value for money from their fund, almost 62 per cent said no. I am not surprised by that response either.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Recent figures released by the Minister for Health and Ageing based on a survey of more than 4,000 private hospital insurance claimants showed that 44 per cent of patients were left facing extra bills on top of their coverage, the money that they outlayâan average of $720 per hospital stay. So, after paying somewhere in the order of $1,000 to $2,500 in premiums, according to this survey some patients were paying up to an extra $1,250 for their treatment. Is it any wonder that people feel they are not getting value for money from their coverage?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I find that in my electorate a lot of low-income earners and pensioners in particular go to the extent of sacrificing other things in life to pay for their private health coverage because they are anxious and worried that, in the event of an emergency, they might not be able to get the treatment they are after in the public hospital system. So a lot of them already take out private health insurance as a mechanism to cover against those contingencies.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The government, as you know, promised that their policies would lead to downward pressure on premiums. That is another broken promise. Private health insurance now is in fact 33 per cent more expensive than in 2001, and last year gap fees across the board rose by 19.2 per cent. This year, as you know, premiums rose by an average of eight per cent across the nation, but a number of my constituents were telling me that in the case of one fund, the NIB, premium increases ranged from 11.5 to 19.7 per centâin fact, an average of 17.3 per cent, double the so-called national average.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is clear to me that Australians are paying more and getting less for their private health insurance. How is it that this industry, which is subsidised to the tune of almost $3 billion a year by Australian taxpayers, cannot come up with a product that covers all the costs when patients use a private hospital? The minister has the power to force insurers to get this problem fixed. He has the power to approve or veto increases in premiums, and he should insistâ<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âI want to bring to the attention of the House today two road safety matters within my electorate of Flinders, one within the town of Baxter and the other within the town of Mount Martha. In Baxter is one of Victoriaâs most dangerous black spotsâthat is, the intersection of the Baxter-Tooradin Road, Fultons Road and Hawkins Road. That intersection, at critical times of the day, has a large number of people travelling across the Mornington Peninsula, travelling on the north-south route, travelling to and from work and also travelling to local schools, which include Baxter Primary School and Mount Erin Secondary College and will soon also include Somerville Secondary College, not to mention the two primary schools in Somerville. All of those people are at risk because of the congestion, the misalignment and the situation in relation to that corner.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I recently held a community meeting in Baxter, and the No. 1 issue for the town was the intersection of the Baxter-Tooradin Road, Hawkins Road and Fultons Road. There must be a significant upgrade of the intersection, a clarification of the rights of way, a widening of the road, and preferably either lights or a roundabout. There must be an upgrade of this dangerous and unsafe corner.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In addition, very close to that corner is a bridge across the railway line. At that point there is no extra pedestrian passageway, and many families take their small children, whether in prams or by foot, across that bridge. They do it knowing that there are large trucks rushing by. Provision must be made for pedestrian access across that part of the railway line. That is extremely important.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In addition to the urgent need for the state to upgrade the Baxter intersection, there is a problem with intersections in Mount Martha. At both ends of Bentons Road in Mount Marthaâat the Moorooduc Highway end and at the Nepean Highway endâare dangerous intersections which have long been in need of upgrades. In each case there should preferably be a roundabout, but if there are other means to address the issue then I am happy to accept them. Both intersections are important; both are high-volume traffic points. There have been fatal accidents on the Moorooduc Highway end. There have been many accidents on the Nepean Highway end. Both intersections must be upgraded. I urge the Victorian government to act immediately and not to wait for additional tragedy before upgrading in Mount Martha the Nepean Highway and the Moorooduc Highway intersections of Bentons road.

<para>âPerhaps obviously, the sea is a major resource for creating economic development opportunities in Pacific island countries. The sea is the key to tourism development in the region. Some of the best scuba diving sites in the world are in the Pacific, and already this is a major part of their attraction to tourists. Scuba diving is a great recreation, but it has its dangersâmost importantly, the possibility of a diver needing treatment for the bends. Divers need access to hyperbaric medicine to avoid death or permanent disability in these situations, and medical evacuations are hugely expensive.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">A key health issue for many Pacific countries is the high incidence of diabetes. Diabetic patients often need hyperbaric medicine to avoid wounds that do not heal or that perhaps can lead to amputations.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Australiaâs aid program needs to be committed to advancing economic opportunities in the region as well as addressing health problems such as diabetes. A Melbourne company based in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, Hyperbaric Health, already provides services in a significant number of Pacific countries. However, there is a need for such treatments, and an absence of suitable facilities, in Tonga, the Marshall Islands, Samoa, Kiribati and the Cook Islands. I request that AusAid have discussions with Australian companies such as Hyperbaric Health as quickly as possible with a view to assisting economic development in the region and providing services to tourists, including many Australian tourists, as well as to local divers who otherwise face potentially serious health consequences as a result of what is a fantastic recreational pursuitâdiving. Services should be provided to meet the health needs of local people whose incidence of diabetes is exceptionally high. Diabetes can be debilitating if it is not treated properly.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">A relatively cheap set of technical possibilities is offered by Australian companies, which can provide the appropriate systems, management structures and financial structures to significantly advance tourism opportunitiesâparticularly sea based pursuits such as scuba divingâin a number of Pacific countries. Over recent years this particular company in Melbourneâand, I am sure, othersâhave advanced such opportunities, but they need cooperation from the Australian government, as the major aid donor in the Pacific, to further advance these opportunities to underpin economic development opportunities in the Pacific countries I have mentioned and provide them with an important health service in areas such as diabetes.</para>

<para>âTransport is one of those issues for the people of Western Sydney that are always at the front of their mind. For many, that commute into the city for work is long, arduous and highly frustrating. Today I want to commend work being done by the federal government to help combat inferior transport corridors in Western Sydney. The Westlink M7 is an innovative project that promises to give relief to long-suffering commuters. The Australian government recognised the need to ease congestion and has invested $356 million into this critical infrastructure. At 40 kilometres long, this is the biggest urban road project in Australia. Given its size, the project has managed to pay close attention to the very real needs of residents near construction areas and to people who will make use of this road.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I want to commend the provision of public transport corridors on the M7. Public transport is a key element to any sustainable transport strategy. I am extremely pleased that the people of Blacktown will have in the future more public transport options for easy travel around the greater Sydney area. In addition, I am pleased to note that consideration has been given to residents, with the construction of noise barriers to minimise disruption to those who live close to the corridor.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">One of the benefits of construction of this size is the flow-on improvement to local infrastructure. For my community this means upgraded road infrastructure for Sunnyholt Road and Seven Hills Road. For too long residents have dealt with poorly maintained roads which are hazardous and prone to causing accidents.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The economic impact of the M7 cannot be overlooked either. More than 1,500 jobs have already been created through this process. This is an investment in the skills and ability of the people of Western Sydney. More than this, opening up Western Sydney to improve transportation can only act as a catalyst for the economic development of Western Sydney. My colleagues and I have long argued that the key to economic growth in our communities is improved access to the varied and diverse areas of Western Sydney. I am confident that the M7 will assist greatly in achieving this goal. Estimated forecasts predict that an extra 24,000 jobs will be created as a result of this improved accessibility within three short years of the motorway being opened. This is expected to generate more than $260 million for the Australian economy, demonstrating Western Sydneyâs importance on a national level. I commend everyone involved with the project and look forward to seeing the positive results yielded for the people of Greenway and for the people of Western Sydney.</para>

<para>âI have here in front of me a seemingly innocuous press release put out by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission yesterday. If you study the implications of this press release, however seemingly innocuous it is, you will see it kills choice for millions of comprehensive car insurance policyholders in this country. The statement was put out by the ACCC yesterday under the authorship of Graeme Samuel, the chair of the ACCC. The headline says âACCC allows IAG choice of repairer policyâ. The statement says:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will not overturn notified arrangements* for motor vehicle insurance policies offered by the Insurance Australia Group (IAG)**.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">What this statement and this decision mean in reality is that a person that takes out a comprehensive motor vehicle insurance policy, if they insure themselves with the Insurance Australia Group and if they want to have choice of their smash repairer after an accident, has to pay a premium of roughly at this point in time $69.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This is a very new concept. It is interesting that when this was raised by IAG in November 2004 I was approached by a gentleman called Gerry Raleigh, who owns a premium smash repair business. He told me what the actual consequence of this particular policy is. Basically, consumers think, when they take out car insurance, that they will not have an accidentâbecause people basically hope that they will not. So they believe that they do not have to pay the premium because it is not going to be a problemâthey are not going to have to worry about the accident. But in reality when they have an accident they will be forced to take, as a consequence of this decision, their car to the preferred smash repairer nominated by the IAG.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I have detailed in this House before the problems with this particular decision. What this is going to do in reality is take away choice. People will not pay this premium; they will not believe that they need to pay this premium. Therefore, if they have an accident, they will be forced to go to the preferred smash repairer nominated by the IAG. This is a policy that is about removing freedom of choice for consumers.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The ACCC is there to protect the rights of consumers and small business. This decision backs a big business practice which is almost extortionate in its practice. This is a terrible decision by the ACCC. It is a decision that affects small business owners like smash repairers and millions of consumers. This decision should be revisited, because it is an absolute disgrace.</para>

<para>âI rise to speak on those unwelcome, unsolicited phone calls at night which we have all had to suffer that urge you to buy a product you do not really want. Lately I have noticed the rise in calls to my office from constituents, as well as letters, complaining about telephone marketing calls, particularly those from overseas from call centres in either India or Egypt. I have had a few of these calls myself, and I can only say that I sympathise with the frustration my constituents are expressing. One constituent described the experience as being besieged from overseas via satellite.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I understand that in terms of local marketers, there exists a code of conduct to which most adhere. In fact, most members would be aware that there is an ability to register yourself on the âdo not callâ register of the Australian Direct Marketing Association. Australian companies generally respect such registrations. Unfortunately there are a few unscrupulous operators who ignore the code and persist in badgering customers.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Aside from pure sales pitches, there are scams about which the vulnerable need to be aware. I have found that the most vulnerable in our society are the elderly. It is a shame that unscrupulous telemarketers prey on their naivety and trust. At least with Australian companies we can do something about it through consumer protection legislation that we have in place.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is the telephone calls from overseas that create the most angst. These people seem untouchable. They are persistent and intrusive. They ring at times when they know people will be home, usually around dinner time. And it is not just a single phone call. Often the calls occur in multiples in a short space of time. But the thing that seems to irritate people the most is the personâs accent and an inability to comprehend what is being said in reply. This just adds to the level of irritation. I suppose that in marketing terms you are hardly going to be in a frame of mind to purchase from them. In the end, it gets down to whether an individual can overcome their ingrained conditioning to be courteous, and just hang up on them.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I know there are difficulties in regulating this sort of intrusion. A couple of years ago we went through the problem of email scams, which are similar in context. It seems that everybody all over the Western world shares this problem, with the result that some governments have set up âdo not callâ registration schemes. But, as I have said, they are of no benefit if the call comes from overseas. It is something I would like the government to look into. Perhaps we can undertake a program of consumer awareness, but I suspect that will only open the government to accusations of wasting taxpayersâ money.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There are some devices on the market which consumers can connect to their phones; at the touch of a button, they can then tell the telemarketer to remove the number from their list, and hang up. The same can be achieved by the simple method of hanging up. After several attempts, the telemarketer will take you off the call list. It is just a matter of people having the courage to be able to do that. By the way, a whistle by the phone works wonders.</para>

<para>âThis morning I have been visited by TAFE teachers who are very concerned about the <inline ref="R2340">Skilling Australiaâs Workforce Bill 2005</inline>, which is in the Senate this week. The legislation has already passed the House. At the time of that debate, I raised my concerns. The legislation has the potential to threaten up to 25 per cent of TAFE funding. Australia currently has a massive skill shortage. This skill shortage needs to be addressed by more TAFE places and better training for our young people. Unfortunately, I see this bill as having the potential to impact on this enormously.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">This legislation is also looking at including industrial relations issues in a bill that is about funding education. It wants teachers to sign individual contracts. Funding cuts could mean that up to 450,000 students miss out on TAFE places. The teachers are most concerned, of course. They believe that this bill will lead to cuts to courses and course hours, which I tend to agree with, which means that there will be fewer courses offered at fewer locations. That will have an enormous impact in my area at Belmont TAFE. I raised the concerns of the Belmont TAFE teachers in my original contribution on the bill.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The legislation will mean a loss of courses in regional Australia and increased costs for TAFE courses when students are already struggling to pay the costs of their TAFE courses. It will mean increased class sizes because of a lack of funding. We all know that the larger the class sizes, the harder it is for students to actually learn and ask questions and get the information that they need. There are also a number of equity issues, and that is an area that is close to my heart. There will be less funding for programs helping students with disabilities. TAFE has a wonderful system of giving support to students with specific disabilities. It will also lead to a loss of staff and a lack of funding for professional development and updating industry skills. Funding for new equipment and technical support will suffer and there will be increased costs to industry and the community. TAFE teachers across Australia are most concerned about this, and so am I. People throughout New South Wales can express their concern about this issue by visiting www.nswtf.org.au/savetafe. I encourage everybody to visit that web site, have their say and let the government know their feelings on this matter.</para>

</talker>
<para>âI rise today to talk about something that is of particular interest and concern to my communityâand it is an interesting topic to raise the day after there has been snow in Canberra. You might well be aware of my long campaign to have the Dunkley community recognised as the âSouthern Solar Cityâ. The Howard government in its wisdom and its foresight has provided a considerable amount of fundingâ$75 millionâto support the development of Solar Cities trials throughout Australia. Many people when they heard about that initiative thought, âHereâs a great idea. Letâs take it to the bright days of Adelaide or to some of the warmer climates along the eastern coast.â I thought to myself, âReally, that is going to be a bit of a no-brainer in terms of an exercise,â because we know those climates are very well suited to photovoltaic technology. The efficacy and the business case for solar electricity in those communities are not really up for question. What is more interesting and what I think the government should be supporting is proposals to see whether the utility and the efficacy of photovoltaic cell technology stand up and can be supported in a more temperate environmentâa more Mediterranean environment like the wonderful Mornington Peninsula.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I have been arguing for a âSouthern Solar Cityâ to be part of the federal governmentâs Solar Cities program. Adelaide and Sydney, I know, have shown particular interest and some consortia have come together in Western Australia, but I am pleased that three groupings have come together in Victoria to put forward the proposition of investing some of that money in the more temperate climate of Victoria. What is particularly encouraging and pleasing for me is that one of those consortia actually involves the municipalities and the community that I represent in the greater Frankston-Mornington Peninsula region. Naturally, the proposition, the business case, the competitiveness of the proposal from our region needs to be tested against other regions. I urge the stakeholders in that local consortia to put their very best foot forward.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">But I am urging also that the government consider that what we are trying to gain out of the Solar Cities program is not only support and momentum for the use of photovoltaic technologies but a business case. We need to road-test the technologies in a range of climates so that the Australian community, the business community and local and state governments around Australia can see that this is a credible alternativeâa renewable energy source that, when deployed in a residential, industrial, municipal or civic environment, secures benefits whether you are in the bright sunlight of the middle of Western Australia or a temperate climate such as the Mornington Peninsula. Our communityâmy friend the member for Flinders is here with meâhas the appetite for this technology. Our cities and our shires are well advanced in the Cities for Climate Protection program. We should get behind this proposal. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âThe opposition supports the <inline ref="R2379">National Residue Survey (Excise) Levy Amendment Bill 2005</inline> and the <inline ref="R2378">National Residue Survey (Customs) Levy Amendment Bill 2005</inline>. The proposed amendments in the legislation insert a new operative levy of 0.075c per kilogram for fresh apples and pears produced in Australia and also increase the present maximum rate of 0.060c per kilogram for apples and pears produced in Australia to 0.10c per kilogram. The new maximum levy rate has been put in place to allow the apple and pear industries scope to increase the operative levy rate should further funds be needed for a residue-monitoring program. The amendments have the support of our important apple and pear industries in this country. As I have indicated, the opposition is happy to support the bills and facilitate their passage through the House.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The monitoring of chemical residues in fruit and vegetables is an extremely important task that provides consumers in Australia and in our export markets with guarantees as to the safety of the products they are buying. In the context of this debate, I want to raise a matter which is of considerable concern to Australiaâs fruit and vegetable growers, especially to the growers who are in Canberra today as part of the Fair Dinkum Food Campaign. On 20 June this year, a former agriculture minister, Warren Truss, told the parliament:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">... imported foods are required to meet exactly the same food safety standards as foods produced in Australia.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">That was reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>. It is not an accurate statement of the facts at all. Imported fruit and vegetables are tested for only 25 pesticide residues, while our local producers are required to meet quality assurance standards for up to 65 chemicals.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The requirements that government places on Australian producers with respect to chemicals are significantly more onerous and costly than the requirements that are placed on our international competitors. The government requires beans from Belgium, tinned tomatoes from Italy and sweet corn from Thailand to be tested for only 25 chemical residues, but it demands that Australian farmers competing in the same marketplace meet standards for 65 chemical residues. Australian producers do not mind meeting international competition on equal terms, but this is currently not the case. It is time that we looked closely at the requirements we place on imported product in respect of chemical residues, to ensure that they meet the same rigorous standards that we demand of Australian growers.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is the Australian consumer who has an eye not only for price and quality but also to their own health status and the health status of their families. I have been suggesting to the agricultural sector in this country that it needs to be more proactive in the health debates here, because preventative measures are at the heart of that health debate, and one of the keys to disease prevention is nutritious food.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is very important that consumers are able to clearly identify the foods that they want to consume. This is an emerging debate and, of course, the Fair Dinkum Food campaign that reaches Canberra today is an expression among not only producers but consumers of those sentiments and of the concerns for accurate labelling so that Australian consumers can clearly identify that the foods they consume are safe.</para>

<para>âI understand that; I will conclude my remarks. I merely wanted to make the point that the level of chemical residues in food is a very important consideration not only for producers but also for consumers of food in this country. It is very important that governments at all levels ensure that, through the regulations that they put in place, the Australian consumer is able to clearly identify the foods that they want to consume and that those foods are clean. The opposition will be supporting the passage of the bills through the House.</para>

<para>âIn summing up the governmentâs perspective on the <inline ref="R2378">National Residue Survey (Customs) Levy Amendment Bill 2005</inline> and the <inline ref="R2379">National Residue Survey (Excise) Levy Amendment Bill 2005</inline> I wish to make three brief points. The first is to note that, as was acknowledged by our friend in the opposition, the member for Corio, this legislation is about enhancing, improving and supporting the clean and green image of the Australian fruit and vegetable sector. It is fundamentally about ensuring that raw food products bound for export and domestic consumption are free from major chemical contamination. It is an obligation to consumers, it is an obligation to the receivers in other countries and it is the best single way of protecting and preserving not just the industry as a whole but individual players by ensuring that we have high standardsâthe highest in the world. We have to ensure that we protect, preserve and promote the clean and green brand which embodies Australiaâs fruit and vegetable industry and in particular, in this case, the apple and pear sector.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">That leads me to the second point. I, and on behalf of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Colbeck, want to pay tribute to members of the apple and pear sector. I have within my own electorate of Flinders on the Mornington Peninsula a vibrant sector. They do it tough from time to time, but they are highly efficient farmers, they are well organised and they are very effective in the way in which they participate in an international economy. I wish to pay tribute to the apple and pear sector.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The third thing I wish to do is to acknowledge the work of not only the parliamentary secretary, Senator Richard Colbeck, but also departmental officials in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and the National Residue Survey organisation. All of these activities and the actors play a fine role in working with and supporting the fruit and vegetable growers, in particular the apple and pear growers.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This legislation, as has been noted, seeks to raise the maximum level for the levy to approximately $1 per tonne, or 0.1c per kilogram, and it seeks to raise the operative levy rateâthe current implemented levy rate for fresh apples and pears exported from Australiaâfrom the present rate of 0.06c per kilogram, or 60c per tonne, to 0.075c per kilogram, or 75c per tonne, to assist in the process of testing and monitoring. It has been done in cooperation with industry. For those reasons I am delighted to commend both bills to the House.</para>

</talker>
<para>âToday I would like to congratulate the Geelong and District Vietnam Veterans Association on their 30th anniversary. From humble beginnings as the Geelong Vietnam Association back in 1975, the association has grown over those three decades to where it has become an important focal point for the delivery of services not only to Geelongâs Vietnam veterans but to the wider veterans community in the region.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">As the association celebrates its three decades of active service for war veterans, it can well and truly take pride in the fact that it has discharged the sombre responsibility enunciated in its motto: âHonour the dead but fight like hell for the livingâ. With this anniversary, the Geelong and District Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia cements itself as a critical player in the welfare of Geelongâs veterans community generally.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The story has humble beginnings, from a meeting of young men in 1974 seeking to keep alive the camaraderie they had experienced in Vietnam. They formed the Geelong Vietnam Association in 1975 and marched under the banner in the Anzac Day march in that year. In 1979, following concerns about the health effects on Vietnam veterans of exposure to toxic chemicals in that war, a Vietnam Veterans Action Association was formed in Melbourne, and a sub-branch was formed in Geelong under the presidency of Dick Brady, with Alan Bone as secretary. Alan was later to become president of the Geelong RSL. In 1990, with Graham Brown as president and Alan Hughes as secretary, a new association, the Geelong and District Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia, was formed from an amalgamation of the two groups, and the great tradition of service to Vietnam veterans and others intensified and expanded over the next 15 years.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I became acquainted with the Geelong Vietnam veterans soon after my election as the member for Corio in 1993 when I was asked to attend the associationâs get together in the Drill Hall in Myers Street following the Anzac Day march. Since then, I have enjoyed a close association with Geelong Vietnam veterans and have admired the way they have confronted and overcome many difficulties and obstacles in their quest to care for their own and to care for others. It has been an interesting journey for Vietnam veterans, to the point where they occupy a special place in Geelongâs veteransâ community and an esteemed and respected place in the wider Geelong community.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Currently, the association operates the Geelong Veterans Welfare Centre out of St John of God Hospital and Geelong Private Hospital and conducts outposts at Colac RSL, Torquay RSL and Port Arlington RSL with the assistance in all of these centres of over 40 volunteers trained by the Department of Veteransâ Affairs. The associationâs services now embrace veterans from all other conflicts, and currently it has 4,500 operative files. A considerable majority of the 1,000 veterans issues the association handles a month relate to World War II veterans, and it is often when veterans from all conflicts call in for a chat that they come to apply for and receive their full DVA entitlements. The association is extremely proud of the Geelong Vietnam memorial and avenue of honour established at Osborne Park in 1995. It will be an important focal point of the celebrations this weekend.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">To single out any past official or members of the association would do an injustice to those not so identified. So on behalf of the wider Geelong community I extend my thanks on the floor of this House to all members and officials over three decades who have made such a magnificent and dedicated contribution to the welfare of all veterans in the Geelong community. You have lived out your motto with dedication and integrity, and you have kept faith with your comrades, both living and dead, in the true Anzac spirit.</para>

<para>âI rise for the second time today to talk about an issue of great concern to the people in my electorate. It relates to the deferred payment plan offered by ABC Learning Centres. A single mother contacted my office this week about her concerns regarding the increase in fees for her child care and about the deferred payment plan. She said that the only child care that she can obtain does not meet her needs. This particular individual, who we will call Joanne, recently received a letter from ABC Learning Centres, whose centre her child attends. The letter informed her that on Monday, 4 July her child-care fees would be rising. Her out-of-pocket child-care fees rose by 29 per cent and the child-care rebate has been soaked up in one hit by the higher fees. In the same letter, ABC announced that it had developed something called an ABC deferred payment plan, which says that it will allow families to reduce their family weekly child-care expenses immediately. It says this:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">From 4 July, all ABC families can elect to defer 30 per cent of their weekly out-of-pocket expenses, up to a maximum of $4,000 per child, per financial year.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The repayment of the deferred amount will not be due until the end of September the following year.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">About two days after receiving the letter, Joanne received the deferred payment plan credit terms and conditions, dated 16 June 2005, from DPPA Pty Ltd. These were the terms and conditions of the ABC Learning Centres deferred payment plan. The terms and conditions in this document make it clear that the deferred payment plan is a credit contract, a debt facility to pay your child-care fees. There is even a recommendation that a person taking up this offer obtain independent legal and financial advice before doing so. The deferred payment plan makes no bones about it:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">This is a loan to fund 30 per cent of the weekly child-care fees, up to $4,000 per attending child, in any financial year.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">As with other loans, borrowers must pay an interest rate, but in order to lure people into their scheme the operators do not call it an interest rate; they refer to it asâand this is a very interesting termââa charge for liquidated damagesâ. Under the heading âFees and chargesâ in the terms and conditions, it says:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">If you do not pay an amount when due and payable, under this credit contractâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">which is to September the following yearâ</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">you will be in breach of this credit contract and we may charge you liquidated damagesâ</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">not interest rates; liquidated damagesâ</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">of eight per cent of the overdue amount or any part thereof that remains unpaid on that date.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I think that is called an eight per cent interest rate. There are even more nefarious provisions in this agreement, such as charging the amount of liquidated damages without consent. It may lock parents into the contract for a period of three years, and there are provisions relating to the cost of enforcement action taken to recoup unclaimed money from parents. Without pushing this point too far, it looks as though ABC Learning Centres in my region are becoming loan sharks by offering this particular facility to parentsâand there are a lot of parents in this area.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">When schemes such as these are offered to parents, it is a clear signal that the child-care system has failed. It is proof that child care is so unaffordable that parents need lines of credit and loans to keep up. The promoters of this scheme even boast that it allows families to reduce their weekly child-care expenses immediatelyâbut, as I have outlined, that is not the case. The unequivocal impetus for this schemeâa scheme wanting parents to take on debt in order to meet their child-care costsâis the governmentâs broken promise on and mismanagement of the 30 per cent child-care rebate.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We know that the government made a promise during the 2004 election that all Australian parents could claim 30 per cent of their child-care expenses on or after 1 July 2005. After the election, the government broke that promise and announced it was pushing back the rebate by 12 months. Now the government has admitted that parents will not get 30 per cent of their out-of-pocket child-care rebate until the end of the financial year subsequent to the year in which the child-care fees were paid. So in some cases parents will have to wait two years to get this rebate paid. If parents like Joanne are struggling financially to pay their child-care fees and as a consequence get lured into this scheme, they are going to lose money, particularly if they cannot pay the entire amount back. I have run out of time. Therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to table the rest of my speech.</para>

<para>âI rise today to speak on the issue of flow-through share schemes. This week Kalgoorlie has been hosting the Australian mining industryâs biggest event, Diggers and Dealers, with some 1,400 delegates. The hot topic of debate at the conference and at the dinner tables outside is the need for a flow-through share scheme in this country. The mining industry has again called on the Australian government to consider introducing these exploration funding incentives in order to show support for a vital sector of the economy. Flow-through share schemes allow investors to purchase a style of share which allows a 100 per cent tax write-off by the investor, whereas the company operating the costs can only write off costs to profit. On many occasions for greenfield explorers there are no profits.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I have been a vocal supporter of flow-through share schemes and believe there is a need to sustain the mining industry in the long term. On two occasions I have arranged for a direct briefing of the Prime Minister by industry leaders. As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry and Resources, I have arranged for leading industry figure David Reed to provide a detailed brief to all members. As a member of the committee I argued strongly and successfully during the inquiry into impediments to resource development for the Goldfields to be included in our visits for the collection of evidence and for a field trip to inspect exploration leases. A recommendation contained in the resulting report <inline font-style="italic">Exploring: Australiaâs Future</inline> was that taxation incentives be introduced to promote investment. This formal recommendation awaits positive government response. They have created a group of some 50 members and senators, âFriends of Mining and Resourcesâ, which meets each two weeks to hear from the mining industry about key issues. Flow-through share schemes have been raised on numerous occasions.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Australia was once a world leader in minerals exploration but we are now lagging behind Latin America, Canada and Africa. So many of our drilling rigs and professional teams are now operating offshoreâto the advancement of those countriesâ future in the mining industry. The biggest argument against the introduction of a flow-through share scheme right now is that the Australian mining industry is experiencing a boom. However, that boom will live only until the current resources known to the industry today are mined out. Those resources are not self-sustaining; they all have a finite life. Unless we are involved in greenfield exploration, and until such time as we make these all-important investments, there will be no major resources, and no development of those major resources, coming online. The only operators that are making great profits from existing operationsâby definitionâare those operating miners and operating mines and they, in the main, are certainly not involved in the exploration for greenfield. It is the smaller mining companies and explorers that undertake the lionâs share of greenfield exploration workâsomething that is vital for the future of this sector and, consequently, for the economic vitality of the nation as a whole.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The minerals industry represents 8.5 per cent of the Australian economy and produces one-third of Australiaâs exports. To protect and encourage our smaller mining companies and to support this industry in the long term we must adopt a flow-through share scheme policy in this country. I note that in the last 18 months the South Australian government, to their credit, have realised the net benefits of greenfield investment and have now made a 50 per cent contribution to the cost of a number of drilling projects. Pending a positive outcome from the federal government, I would strongly recommend that the West Australian government consider doing a similar thing.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Western Australian countryside is covered in regolith. It makes traditional prospecting and mineral exploration extremely difficult. High technology is required and therefore high cost is required to analyse the prospective greenfields in Western Australia. It takes a lot of money. It takes a lot of time. Unless we have a flow-through share scheme that will encourage investors to make investment into the greenfield exploration industry, we will see a time in the future when the existing resources have been mined out and we will have no bonus revenue coming from the mining industry. At that point in time I suspect that governments may cast about looking for who to blame for the shortfall in revenue.</para>

<para>âSeveral factors come into alignment at this time. I would like to speak about three. The first is the coalition having control of the Senate. A gem from history makes a pertinent point. In 1936, Democrat Speaker, Sam Rayburn, said after Franklin D Rooseveltâs landslide win in 1936:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">When you get too big a majority youâre immediately in trouble.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">That point is demonstrably evident already, just three days into the spring sittings.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The second factor goes to what sort of country Australia is becoming. Is Australia becoming a country where the line between religion and state is inviolate? Is Australia becoming a country in which religion will trump science? Is Australia becoming a country in which leaders mobilise deep moral energies that divide us from each other and the world? Is Australia becoming a country in which women will not be allowed control of their own bodies? Is Australia becoming a country that intrudes into peopleâs sexual preferences? Is Australia becoming a country where religious energy is used in politics to promote division and intolerance? If it is happening, who decided it was on Godâs agenda? Is Australia becoming a country in which sectors of the community will be excluded from the political process?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The third factor is whether Australia is changing from a representative democracy to a manipulative one. As far as control of the Senate is concerned, Tuesday was day one. All the prophetic words of the 1936 Democrat Speaker in the United States ring true for the coalition government from 2005 to the probable election in 2007. It is a fair bet that Sam Rayburnâs prediction will come true, albeit in a different context and in a different country. We have the National Party, Family First, Barnaby Joyceâfancy putting forward arguments about representative democracy; naughty boy! We have Petro Georgiou, small âlâ liberals and Senator Eggleston. I suspect that, as the spring sitting proceeds, that list will become longer and longer.</para>

<para>âWhat sort of country is Australia becoming? Examples of the thinking on the governmentâs side became evident immediately after the last election. Of course, I refer to deliberately raising the issues of abortion and voluntary voting. It has always been a given that, if you want to divide the Australian community, you should introduce the topic of abortion. More responsible and more ethical people would introduce the topic of prevention of unwanted pregnancies. It is a gross irony to observe that the very people who strongly oppose abortion are often exactly the same people who oppose sex education and family planning to prevent unwanted pregnancies. The introduction of voluntary voting would dramatically reduce the participation of Australians in elections. A more responsible and unifying approach would be to introduce strategies to increase voter participation, not reduce it.</para>

<para pgwide="yes">That brings me to the third factor: the changing face of Australian democracy from a representative one to a manipulative one. More and more political comment in this country can be sourced back to fewer and fewer people. What passes as analysis is no more than opinion. What passes as current affairs often is no more than entertainmentâand gross at that. What passes as political comment is nothing more than spear throwing for selective power bases and individuals who are adept at manipulation of the truth and resistant to representative democracy.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There is a dilemma in political commentary: there is an ever decreasing number of powerful politicians and powerful people on all sides of politics who spend an inordinately large amount of time with fewer and fewer senior journalists ripe for political seduction, spinning information devoid of any analysis or national interest whatsoever. But it is not just the media. We all have to admit that there is a growing number of Australians who are now tired of political parties with their propensity to spin, their refusal to offend, their bland presentations and the relentless concentration on focus groups.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Political parties are becoming more and more controlled, constrained and conforming. As that fact becomes more and more evident, more and more people refuse to join. Branch stacking increases but participation reducesâit is quite an irony. Watching Australians deal with control of the Senate, citizensâ rights and an increasingly manipulative democracy, I think leading up to the next election may hopefully not be as straightforward as some in this place think it will be.</para>

<para>âI wish to raise before the House today an act of carelessness and potentially of deception which has threatened the status, the future and the standing of the Phillip Island Grand Prix. The actor in question is the relevant Victorian minister for tourism, Mr Pandazopoulos. I wish to raise a series of activities. On 7 September last year Mr Pandazopoulos was recorded in the <inline font-style="italic">Sentinel Times</inline> as having said:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">... the state government will not renew contracts for the Australian motorcycle and formula one grand prixes unless Canberra offsets the events huge financial losses.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">This was the beginning of a campaign against the local grand prix by the relevant state minister in the lead-up to the federal election to try and use and blackmail the federal government into providing additional funds. Let me start by saying that there are 19 major motorsport events in Australia. The federal government funds none of them, because the states compete aggressively to win the right to each of those. Of those 19 not one is funded by the Commonwealth. I note, just in case the issue is raised in response, that the Commonwealth has once given assistance to the Mount Panorama circuit at Bathurst for capital upgrades. But the operating costs are met for none of these 19 because each state and territory believes that there are extraordinary benefitsâas we know from when Victoria won the Grand Prix from Adelaide.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This matter was so important to the Victorian minister that by 1 December 2004, when he spoke in the Victorian parliament and said that he had sought funding from the federal government, he did not disclose the fact that there had been not one letter! By 1 December, three months after his initial statement, there had been not one letter. By 21 April there had still been no letter. He told the Victorian parliament, however, that he had written. Yet nothing had been received either by the minister for tourism or by the minister for sport at federal level. But he told the Victorian parliament that he had written.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">After nine months, on 28 May, I received a letter from his chief of staff, and I am happy to table that letter. It said that the minister, Mr Pandazopoulos, who is also the Minister for Tourism, had written to the Commonwealth ministers for sport and for tourism. However, no letter had been received. On 21 July Mr Pandazopoulos again informed the parliament that he had written. Not only did he do that but he produced undated letters. Very interesting. This had been a live issue for 10Â½ monthsâhe had been under question about when the letters had been sent for 10Â½ monthsâyet he still maintained that, despite the fact that nobody at federal level had received the letters, that letters had been sent by him.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We produced in the Victorian parliament letters from both Commonwealth ministers saying that nothing had been received. So this minister had been under pressure and had either not done as he had said or, despite this clear public pressure, had failed to inquire as to why nobody had received them. Either you have an outright deception or monumental, continued carelessness. That is unacceptable, because it puts pressure on the people of Phillip Island.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Strangely, having accused not just me but also members of the Victorian opposition of an aggressive campaign against him on three occasions in parliament, on 9 August 2005 he confessed that the letters were never sent. He claims that he signed them, but he confessed to the parliament that a minor functionary in the department had never sent the letters. Yet for 9Â½, 10 and 11 months he had been under pressure as to the reality of these letters.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This was a clear misleading of the House. At the very least it was an act of monumental incompetence or, probably, deception of the highest orderâan elaborate distortion, an elaborate deception. This minister has not only failed the people of Phillip Island; he has repeatedly misled the Victorian parliament in order to cover up an initial deception. It is unacceptable conduct. It has been shown to be false, not just once but repeatedly. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âFollowing on from my colleague the member for Port Adelaide, I am starting to wonder where this country of ours is heading. There are not only terrorist alerts raising paranoia against individuals who look different and dress differently from we Anglo-Saxons; now we have the situation where attorneys-general want to further curb our basic human rights.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I mention a recent hearing into overseas adoptions held by the Standing Committee on Health and Human Services. I notice that the chair and the secretary of that wonderful committee are here. Our committee heard evidence stating that photos of adopted children in a newsletter were prohibited by a Queensland government act. That absolutely amazed me. âHow bloody ridiculousâ, I thought. Here was a group of familiesâfamilies who wished to highlight the success of their adoptions and encourage and support other families through this difficult processâbeing made to feel like criminals. That was locked away in my mind.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Then, blow me down, yesterday in the <inline font-style="italic">Telegraph</inline> there was a report headed âInternet ban on children photosâ. At first glance, this seems okayâcommonsense. But what happens when you read a bit further? The report states:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Posting photos of children on websites could become a crimeâeven if they appear to be wholesome family snaps.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Just because we have a bunch of twisted perverts using the net for their own twisted sexual gratification, why do the rest of us have to suffer? With the advent of computer technology, many families who possess scanning facilities and their own digital cameras delight in emailing photos to other family members when special occasions occur.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">My eldest daughter has lived in England. She and I possessed a web site. She delighted in sending me via email photos of family happenings in the UK that I was unaware of and that I wished to be made aware of. It gave me some satisfaction to see what my daughter and my extended family were doing in the UK.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Under the proposal by the A-Gs, sports teams, schools, community youth groups such as Scouts, the Red Cross, St John Ambulance and surf lifesaving clubsâgroups who regularly post achievements by members on their web sites to congratulate them and inform othersâare now potentially going to commit a crime. Attorneys-general, led by the federal Attorney-General, Philip Ruddock, have stated in a report that if such groups placed photos on web sites and they were then linked to pornographic web sites it would become a crime. Who is the onus on?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This all stems from three incidents. One concerned a man who was caught with 7,000 images of children, mainly in their swimsuits, taken in public places in Cairns. This person maintained that the images were innocent depictions of happy children despite them being posted on the internet. The second incident concerned a gay web site containing pictures of Melbourne schoolboys rowing and playing football. The pictures were taken without their consent. The third concerned pictures of a 16-year-old surf lifesaver posted on a gay web site.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Why are we not tackling these web sites and the people who are putting the photos up on them, rather than putting forward another set of laws that are going to punish innocent people who delight in extended family, relatives and others, and perhaps also people in community groupsâScouts, Red Cross, St John Ambulance and local schoolsâand who are doing the right thing? As do other members, I put out newsletters four times a year and I delight in extolling the wonderful virtues and achievements at school or in scouting groups and the like of young children in my electorate. Am I going to be committing a crime by putting them on my webpage, which people can access rather than reading my newsletters?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Attorney-Generalâs Department has said that there is a consultation period until October. I urge the public to really look at this. We are taking a detrimental step. Let us get after the perverts who are setting up the web sites and taking these photos, rather than punishing families, community groups and the like, including politicians, who use such things sensibly and wisely. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âLast week I had the pleasure of launching an important Green Corps program in Warrien Reserve in Croydon North in the Casey electorate. The project is an initiative funded by the federal government. I want to take the opportunity this morning to place on the record my congratulations to the hardworking committee of reserve management there, and particularly to the young people who, in the next six months, are going to be performing that work in Croydon North. The Maroondah City Council is also involved. The combined hard work of the local Warrien Reserve Committee of Management, council officers and the people completing the Green Corps project will provide a major environmental boost to Warrien Reserve, which has a wonderful history of environment and environmental works in Croydon.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Last year in this House I spoke about the Warrien Reserve Committee of Managementâs concern about the destruction of some habitat which occurred with illegal clear-felling by a developer in Bonnie View Road. The residents were naturally outraged by what happened. They have now put that behind them and they have continued to work to improve the reserve for the benefit of everybody in Croydon North and, indeed, throughout the electorate of Casey.

<para>âBefore the suspension, I was talking about the Warrien Reserve. In 2001 a project to create a frog habitat in the reserve received a Keep Australia Beautiful award under the category of City Pride in land care. In 2002 it was nominated for a federal Banksia award. This newest preservation project, the Green Corps project at Warrien Reserve, will take six months to complete and has a number of core objectives. Its primary aim is to restore bushland habitat for the protection of two main species of endangered frogsâthe Victorian smooth froglet and the southern toadlet. An integral part of the project is the preservation of the native bushland in the reserve and the adjacent Everard Wildflower Sanctuary. The works will also create an alternative pond and frog-breeding site, reduce environmental weeds, provide general maintenance, plant suitable habitat, and develop an interpretive trail and an information board for members of the public. There will also be comprehensive surveying and monitoring of the frog population.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para pgwide="yes">This Green Corps project is another important project in the Casey electorate. It is providing practical environmental assistance to communities and is also providing practical and thorough training for young people in and around the Casey electorate in the importance of the environment and in the importance of working. This federally funded program, which began in 1996, is providing wonderful opportunities for young people in Casey and right across Australia. It allows 17- to 20-year-olds to develop important work force skills and experience in the area of practical environmentalism. As I said, the program is delivered nationally by the government through Job Futures and Greening Australia.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In the brief time I have left, I would like to acknowledge all of the participants who will work very hard at Warrien Reserve over the next six months. I will mention their names: Simon, Toni, Bradley, Ben, Pat, Bonnie, Jemima, Jonathon, Marcia and Nicki.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I, for one, could not agree more. Recently, the United Nations Youth Association held its 44thÂ  annual youth conference in Adelaide, and I had the pleasure of closing the conference and accepting the Youth Declaration. It is on this topic that I would like to speak today.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The United Nations Youth Associationâor UNYAâis a national, community based organisation that aims to increase youth awareness and participation in international issues and political processes. UNYA is one of the only Australian youth organisations that is run entirely by youth for youth, and it has been broadening horizons for almost 40 years. The major aim of UNYA is to inspire young people to adopt the ideals and objectives of the United Nations, recognising it as the only global organisation that maintains the hope of world peace. UNYA places school students at the centre of the intrigue and excitement of international affairs in mock sessions of United Nations bodies. It exposes them to world-class speakers on a myriad of topics and provides social events to allow young people to develop their skills both educationally and socially.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The UNYA XLIV National Youth Conference brought together over 130 senior secondary school and tertiary students from around Australia and New Zealand for an exciting week of discussion, debate, negotiation and public speaking in Adelaide. Delegates to the conference had the opportunity to listen to a variety of speakers on a range of current domestic and international issues. Ideas were then discussed in smaller workshop sessions, where delegates were able to voice their opinions in a smaller setting and listen to the opinions of other delegates. The final result was the 2005 Youth Declaration. The Youth Declaration from each national youth conference is a concrete outcome which can then be distributed to government and other youth networks. This Youth Declaration is a collective vision for humanityâs future.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The 2005 Youth Declaration covers a range of issues, including human rights, international security and terrorism, globalisation and technology, Australia and the Pacific, economic sustainability, environmental sustainability, youth affairs and empowerment, education, and Indigenous Australians. Some of the 2005 resolutions are that the detention of asylum seekers should be solely for the purpose of essential security checks and identification; that international security is best promoted by international cooperation and multilateralism, which reinforces the importance of international laws and normative standards; and that voluntary student unionism will have alarming effects in terms of reducing vital funds required for the provision of services. These are just a few of the resolutions in the 2005 declaration.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The declaration is available on the UNYA web site, and I would like to encourage all of my colleagues on both sides of the House to take the time to read the document and to listen to the voice of our youth. I believe that UNYA should be commended for their role in educating and empowering young people to express their views. I would like to congratulate all of the participants in the UNYA XLIV National Youth Conference. I thank them not just for their attendance and for their participation but also for turning their thoughts and their efforts to improving both our community and our world. I think we would be a much better place if more of society stopped to do this more regularly.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I would like to acknowledge and congratulate Mr Travers Mcleod, who is the past national president of the United Nations Youth Association of Australia. I would also like to acknowledge Mr Alex Rafolowicz, who is the South Australian state president and who does a fantastic job locally. I would especially like to pay tribute to the 2005 conference convenor from South Australia, Penelope Wells. I know that Penelope and her team worked extremely hard to ensure that the Adelaide conference was a great success.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In closing, I would like to commend to this House the United Nations Youth Association and in particular their Youth Declaration. I encourage all members of both houses of this parliament to familiarise themselves with the 2005 Youth Declaration and its contents. The youth of today need a voice and we all must stop and listen to it. UNYA has provided that voice and I think we all have a duty to pay it some attention. I encourage you all to have a read.</para>

<para>âMr Acting Deputy Speaker, it has been a little whileâand I am sure you have probably missed itâsince I last spoke about the Scoresby Freeway. I, along with the community that I represent, have been going through a grieving phase. We had such optimism and such an opportunity to make sure that the south-east of the great city of Melbourneâthe great metropolisâhad the same access to key arterial road infrastructure, on the same terms, as those to the north and the west of our city. But, alas, after fantastic leadership by the Howard government and more than half a billion dollars of funding assistance being made available, and after the Bracks government made the bold promise, as has been widely publicised and which will never be forgotten, that there would be no tolls on the Scoresby Freeway, our citizens are facing having tolls for quite a period of time.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The federal funding is still sitting there, so if the Bracks government comes to its senses and recognises its dire political circumstances in Victoria as a consequence of these kinds of broken promises, it can do the right thing and come back to the agreement that was signed and the undertaking that was given to the citizens of not only the south-east but the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. It is a shame, though, that on top of that hardship, there is now further neglect. It is now called EastLink, a spunky, flashy new name. They are talking about engineering marvels in an attempt to mask the basic deceptionâthe undermining of our economic prosperity. As interesting as all the bridges and the engineering marvels are, our people know what they were promised and they know what they are not getting. It is now called EastLink; the name change seems to mask its dark history.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">EastLink is also reflecting further disappointment. Labor members at a state and federal level had something to say about the backflip of the Bracks government. They knew that this was not what their taxpayers and their community wanted. If you look along the length of the freeway to the north, there is an interchange that was provided as an enhancement to the original projectâsome could say a pay-off to the citizens in that part of the project area for the hardship of paying tolls. So there was some slight gain for a generation of toll pain. Then you look in the middle of the freeway and to the Dandenong community. To the credit of the Labor advocates in that area, who were also so appalled and had long known the hardship that the tolling reverse would provide, they managed to get a Dandenong bypass. So they actually got an outcome in return for the pain and in return for the deception.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">However, if you look down southâdown to the community that I representâwhat have the Labor members down our way secured from this horrendous backflip, this political deception? Absolutely nothing. Nothing has been delivered. There has been no compensatory project to reflect the hardship that is being imposed.</para>

<para>âI am pleased that my Labor colleagues from my state are as appalled as I am, and I thank them for their interjection supporting how appalled my citizens are. But what a vivid contrast. The noise and the excitement that we see in this chamber are in vivid contrast to the silence, the neglect, the complete indifference that the state Labor members in the community that I represent have shown with regard to our communityâs interests. They have not stood up and said that the Rutherford Road onramp should be built. It would give the commercial area to the north of Frankston, around the Seaford-Carrum Downs area, toll-free access to an alternative route to the Frankston Freeway. That has long been identified as being necessary by the chambers of commerce, Frankston City, the businesses that operate in that area, and the residential community, which has industrial traffic running past St Anneâs Primary School and its urban neighbourhoods. They were all looking to get an onramp onto the Frankston Freeway. What did they get? Nothingâabsolutely nothing.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para pgwide="yes">I mentioned interest in the Dandenong bypass. Did we get any mention of interest in the Frankston bypass? No. There was no effort, no voice, no advocacy, no action, no interest from the state Labor members of parliament down in our part of the world, in the most disgusting, diabolical political betrayal that anyone in my lifetime can remember. The consequences and the costs of this will be carried by my community into the next generation. We will have to try to attract investment, attract people to our region, knowing that we have one hand tied behind our backs, because to use the arterial road infrastructure in our part of the city comes at a price.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">However, if you want to use the arterial road infrastructure to the north and the west, there are no tolls. There is a lack of consistency; there is a lack of voice. To the north of the project and to the centre of the project, there are some compensatory projects being achieved by Labor members of parliament who actually listened to their consciences, who knew that Labor have betrayed their citizens. But down in the south, what have we achieved? Our state Labor members of parliamentâwith no voice, no interest, no leadership, no advocacyâhave achieved nothing in return for a generation of tolls. They stand condemned. As far as I am concerned, and I believe as far as the community is concerned, the state election cannot come around soon enough, because our community needs strong advocates. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talker>
<para>âI listened with great interest to the member for Dunkleyâs spin on the relationship between the Commonwealth and the states when it comes to road funding. Let me use an example in my own electorate to put a different perspective on the debate. Where the F3 Freeway northbound ends, a crisis begins. For the last 17 years, first as a councillor and more recently as a local member, I have been fighting to have funded the construction of a road link between the end of the F3 Freeway and the New England Highway north of Branxton. When I was elected in 1996, that project was on track. The route selection process had been undertaken and a funding commitment had been given. Alas, in the 1996 budgetâHowardâs first budget; it is now historyâwe encountered some significant budget cuts which put back this very important road project by many years.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">In more recent times I had become more hopeful that the project would finally proceed. Why? One, because it is no longer just a wish of the local community; it has become a necessity. Traffic movements through the townships of Cessnock and Maitland, and a number of smaller communities in between, have just become intolerable. The New England Highway between Newcastle and Singleton in the Upper Hunter is like Parramatta Road at peak hour each morning and each afternoon. It is becoming a crisis and it is time the Commonwealth made a decent commitment to funding of the project.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">What worries me at the moment, and what causes me to address the issue again today, is a recent piece of correspondence I received from the then parliamentary secretary for roads, Mr Cobb, who indicated to me in response to questions I put to him in this place that they are reviewing the cost of the project and, to use his term, âsubstantial overrunsâ are expectedâin other words, the cost seems to have significantly blown out. Why should we not expect it to blow out, given the significant delays we have had in Commonwealth commitment over the course of the last 10 years?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The last estimate of this project was in the order of $345 million. The suggestion is that that cost may have close to doubled in recent years. The government claim to be committed to the project. They allocated some $253 million in the AusLink document but are of course scrapping the national highway project of which this road link is a part. As a consequence of that, they are now saying that the state must make a contribution. Maybe that is fair enough. They are saying, âWe are now going to put Commonwealth money into what were traditionally state projects, and the quid pro quo is that we expect the states to put money into projects which were traditionally the responsibility of the Commonwealth.â But whether that is a fair proposition or not depends, I suppose, on the ratio of the funding.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">People are speculating that at $345 million it was reasonable for the state government to make a contribution of some $100 million to make it up to the $345 million or so required under the latest estimate. But if it is true that the cost has blown out to some $600 million then of course the state of New South Wales will not have the capacity to fund any more than $100 million. Of course it will not. So the Commonwealth cannot claim to have a solid commitment to the link between the F3 Freeway and the New England Highway while its commitment is stuck at some $253 million. It must review that commitment. Even more important, it must not only show a commitment in the AusLink white paper but also make a commitment in the forward estimates. Unfortunately, in the May budget of this year there was no such commitment. Given the budget goes out four forward years, are we, as constituents of the Hunter, then to understand that the Howard government has no real funding commitment for this project for the next four years? I hope not.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I call upon the government to, at the completion of the review of the costing, up the ante on this project and deliver to the Hunter what is the most important road transport infrastructure project we will probably ever encounter. Of course, the project has the unanimous support of all the regionâs mayors. There is no parochialism here. They agree that this is too important a project to be delayed any further. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âMr Deputy Speaker Causley, you will know what email is. You will probably even know what eBay is. But I wonder if you know what e-research is. E-research is the latest way that James Cook University in Townsville is expanding the horizons and the collaborative research that it does without anyone leaving an office. It is just truly amazing. I was able to go to James Cook University last week and open the information technology laboratories there. E-research is part of these new laboratories and their facilities. It is an amazing technology that allows the university to be a major player in developing the tools, the methods and the culture of e-research. What that means is that very large amounts of data indeed, no matter where it is in the world, can be linked together, manipulated and transferred across long distances and on advanced networks.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">James Cook is currently connected to the world on a one-gigabit data stream link, which enables it to be involved in all the supercomputing around the world. Indeed one of the projects that I saw was a collaborative project between scientists in Townsville and scientists at Harvard University in the United States. But scientists can be anywhere. They can be in the next room or in the next country or across the world. What e-research enables you to do is promote interdisciplinary research from different fieldsâlike engineering, mathematics, computer science and information technologyâand combine all of those to solve challenging problems in things like biology and biomedicine.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In the IT school at James Cook University, I was able to see leading health researchers and doctors developing new methods of predicting diseases before they happen, but using computer science, using e-research, and manipulating large amounts of data that is held on file to enable these diagnostic tools to work. I have been a strong advocate and supporter of James Cook Universityâ</para>

<para>âThank you. I visit the campus on a regular basis. However, each time I visit the facilities, it never ceases to amaze me how much world-class research is being done there, out in the regions of Australia. It is a great credit to our regional universities that they are able to stay up there with the rest of the world. James Cook certainly continues to forge ahead, particularly over the last five years as the result of a number of new degrees and new backing from the government.</para>

<para pgwide="yes">Last month Brendan Nelson, the Minister for Education, Science and Training, and I had the privilege to officially open the new $6.2 million Rehabilitation Sciences Centre. It is the next link in the chain of medicine at JCU, with the medical degree, the pharmacy degree, the nursing degree and now the allied sciences degrees. The state-of-the-art facility was made possible by a grant from the Australian government. The centre plays an important role in teaching the physiotherapists, speech pathologists and sports science graduates of tomorrow and also complements the universityâs medical school that was established in the year 2000 and will graduate its first doctors on 15 December this year. That will be a mighty proud day for all of us who had a hand in establishing that medical school.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">One of the most important reasons why I have been a strong advocate of the university providing more health degrees is that it is vital in addressing the shortage of health professionals in North Queensland. The statistics have shown over and over again that people who study in the region are more likely to stay and work in the region when they have completed their studies. That has certainly been the experience of James Cook. It is all about investing in our future. That is why the Australian government has committed a record $7.8 billion in funding for higher education this financial year alone. Next year I will be pleased to see the start of the new veterinary science degree and also the tropical agriculture science degree. That will also link into the medical faculty.

<para>âLast week the St George district lost a legend. The chief executive of the St George District Rugby League Football Club, Robert Stone, died at the age of 49 years. Robert Stone was a St George Rugby League great. Robert was known for his courage and toughness on the field, captaining St George in 1984, having played in the 1977 and 1979 premiership teams. Robert played 283 games for St George, a figure exceeded only by famous St George players Norm Provan and Billy Smith. As chief executive of the St George Football Club, he was instrumental in the St George Illawarra Dragons returning to their famous Kogarah Jubilee home ground. Many professional footballers today owe their success to Robert Stone as a coach, mentor or development officer, and many people owe their success to his skills as a teacher.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">From an early age Robert was a role model for others. I grew up around the corner from Robert. We played for the same Blakehurst Rugby Union Football Club, but Robert was two years older. Through representative selection, Robertâs toughness became known throughout the district. I can recall vividly when I was about 16 years of age being at a dance at the Carrs Park swimming pool when a group of my friends and I were surrounded by other boys from a neighbouring schoolâsome brandishing weapons. I remember to this day Robert, who was just two years older, coming to stand beside us. In his calm and relaxed style he simply inquired, with wry humour, âIs there a problem here?â His presence, size and reputation immediately resolved that situation. It was a source of enormous pride to see our mate achieve such success on the Rugby League playing field but, despite his status as a local hero, Robert always had time to have a yarn with his mates in the local area.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I have always enjoyed Robertâs company immensely, but must admit that I did not always enjoy the following morning. It was not commonly known that Robert was a deep thinker and had an earthy wisdom. During policy debates within the Labor Party, if I thought things were going a bit way outâas I must admit they can do from time to timeâI would try to bring them back to reality, as you may recall, Mr Deputy Speaker McMullan, by quoting the Robert Stone view of life. Indeed, Mark Latham played on that fact on the evening before his leadership ballot. When I informed him that I was still undecided later that evening, he was prepared to take a gamble and said to me, âWhy donât you ask Stoney?â The rest of that story is now history.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Robert literally had the ability to mix with all ranks, from a kid in a local football team to the Prime Minister. Indeed, on the day that Robert died, I received a phone call from the Prime Minister expressing his personal grief and asking me for the details of Robertâs family so that he could convey his personal sympathy. Robert brought his courage to his fight against cancer. He was privileged to have the love and support of his family. He was nurtured to the last by his wife, Anne, daughters, Melissa and Belinda, and son, Michael. He was supported by his mother, Iris, his elder brother, Peter, and Anneâs family. The entire St George Illawarra Dragons were first class in their support of Robert during, in particular, his final months. Danny Robinson, Peter Doust and others can take enormous pride in the care they provided to our great mate and a great Australian.</para>

<para>âToday I would like to pay tribute to a group of my constituents who recently journeyed overseas to pay tribute to 30 Queensland police officers killed on active duty during World War I. Current serving Queensland police officers Sergeant Paul Ruge and Sergeant Mal Nicholls, both based in Gladstone, and Senior Sergeant Ian Gall, also based in Gladstone, retraced the steps of these little-recognised Queensland police officers who gave their lives for their country.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">For 18 months, Sergeant Ruge researched and planned a battlefields memorial journey to visit the graves of, or the memorials for, the officers who were killed in World War I. While the names of these police officers are recorded in the Queensland police honour roll, and as they are also acknowledged on Police Remembrance Day, there has been no official commemorative visit to their graves or memorials until this journey. We must bear in mind that the police officers who were killed in battle were in what was classified at that time as âexempt occupationsâ during World War I as their service required them at home. Yet, despite this, 30 men chose to take up voluntary active service in the name of defending their country.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The groupâs visit coincided with the 90th anniversary of the landing at Gallipoli and took around five weeks to complete. It was entirely self-funded. The group visited memorials at Gallipoli in Turkey, Alexandria in Egypt, Haifa in Israel, Hampshire in England, the Somme and Flanders in France and Belgium, and Dessel in Germany. At each gravesite or memorial, Sergeant Ruge, Sergeant Nichols and Senior Sergeant Gall laid a wreath in memory of the sacrifice of the officers and read out a eulogy on their life and their service during the war.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The highlight of the trip was the very moving dawn service held at Gallipoli on Anzac Day, and members were honoured to volunteer their services as marshals at that event. They were particularly honoured that our Minister for Veteransâ Affairs singled them out from the crowd and took time to congratulate them for their efforts. Sergeant Ruge also laid a wreath at Lone Pine on Anzac Day, together with the UN Police Association president, as a member of the UN Police Association of Australia. A wreath was also laid at the Mennen Gate in Belgium on behalf of fallen officers.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">A very positive outcome was the righting of a great injustice to one of the soldiers of the First World War, a police officer, Private John Graham, who won the distinguished conduct medal in action as a stretcher-bearer at Pozieres in 1916. Private Grahamâs headstone did not recognise him as being the holder of a DCM until representations were made by Sergeant Ruge to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission on his return to Australia. Private Graham is now to have the DCM inscribed on his headstone, almost 90 years after his death, so that he will be accorded the honour in death that he was denied in life.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Photographs of the entire journey and research on each officer will be incorporated in a booklet to be presented to the Queensland Police Museum. This will enhance the historical records of the military service of the 30 officers who were killed in action.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Sergeant Ruge himself is a veteran of overseas service, having been one of three Queensland police officers to serve as a member of the fifth Australian contingent of Australian Federal Police to East Timor in 2000-01. He was station commander at Hera and Metinaro police districts in East Timor during his tour of duty. Sergeant Ruge and Sergeant Nichols are also former members of the Australian Army ReserveâSergeant Ruge for 20 years and Sergeant Nichols for 10 years. Both are members of the RSL; Sergeant Ruge is also a member of the UN Police Association of Australia.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">All those who undertook this historic trip deserve sincere congratulations. I commend Sergeants Ruge and Nichols for their commitment to commemorating the service of those brave policemen who went before them.</para>

<para>âAustralia currently has the lowest rate of industrial disputes in decades. Why, then, is this parliament contemplating changing our industrial legislation in the most massive way? The answer is: pure ideology. The ideology of an extreme free market economy, an ideology that has no basis in empirical evidence before any Australian voter or any Australian parliamentarian, now rules both houses.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Recently we have had insulting remarks by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and the Treasurer to various leaders of the Anglican and Catholic churches, telling them to keep out of areas that the government feels they should not have responsibility for, such as the rights of workers. The Treasurer said that the Primate of the Anglican Church of Australia was no industrial relations expert. I feel like that American senator; I feel like saying, âIâve met industrial relations experts, and, Treasurer, you donât appear to be one.â</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The very strongly held views of the churches on peopleâs rights are quite understandable. Indeed, in this chamber, we have recently had paeans of deserved praise for the late His Holiness John Paul II. Pope John Paul II, during a visit to Australia in 1986, met factory workers in Parramatta. This will interest the member for Parramatta. His Holiness John Paul II said:</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">What about the area of part-time students studying with the approval of the employee, something that I would have thought was important in the skilling up of Australia? Let us look at a couple of scenarios that will take place in light of the fact that study will not be part of the five core principles of this governmentâs extreme free market industrial relations legislation. Employees who wish to study to further their careers are generally given the option to study by their employer and, in the majority of businesses, are encouraged to do so. There is generally no compulsion from employers to do so; rather, it is up to the employee to take up the option. A part-time student studying postgraduate business/finance is faced with two subjects per semester at a cost of $1,750 per subject for two semesters per year. Depending on which university you go to, that cost is around the average. It therefore costs about $3,500 per semester or $7,000 per year. Under current working arrangements for industries such as accounting and finance, the employer will pay these costs upon the employee achieving a pass mark.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Time off is given for the student employee. For example, provision for up to five hours a week study leave is contained in clause 14 in the section on study assistance on page 47 of the certified agreement covering members of parliament. Generally two weeks study leave with pay for the examination period is guaranteed, under clause 15.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Yet under the proposed legislation, students studying part time would have to meet all their own costs and have no time off for study leave. Study is not part of the five core principles of the Howard governmentâs industrial relations law. These changes may well be the case in a small accounting or financial services companies that have up to 20 employees. Employees will be forced to use their annual leave for examination periods.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This whole fraudulent industrial relations legislation, based on no empirical evidence, is driven by an extreme free market mentality, by the mentality of Margaret Thatcher, who said, âThere is no such thing as society; there are only individuals.â <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline> Â </para>

<para>âMr Deputy Speaker Baldwin, allow me to congratulate you on so competently occupying this high office in the Main Committee. I am privileged to represent one of the fastest growing areas in Australia, and I refer of course to the Sunshine Coast. The population growth on the Sunshine Coast between 1998 and 2003 was 3.53 per cent, which makes it the third-fastest growing area in Australia behind Mandurah, 74 kilometres south of Perth, with 4.02 per cent, and the Gold Coast-Tweed area, with 3.67 per cent. One of the issues that levels of governmentâstate, local and federalâhave is to make sure that the infrastructure for rapidly growing areas like the Sunshine Coast keeps up with the increasing population. Some people consider that over the next 10 to 15 years the population of the Sunshine Coast will grow from some 260,000 to more than half a million people. That of course places great challenges on all levels of government to make sure that the infrastructure that people need and deserve is there to meet the requirements of our growing population.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I want to praise the Australian government for taking the important step of recognising Australiaâs sea change phenomenon and ensuring assistance for the scores of local governments that are affected by this great change in how we live and where we live in Australia. High numbers of Australians are choosing to shift houses to live in coastal communities, and the resulting unexpected and unplanned-for booms are placing great challenges on infrastructure and, I might add, on all levels of government. This is one of the major issues confronting Australia in 2005. I believe that, as people continue to move to these very desirable parts of the country, this is going to be an ongoing challenge for governments, regardless of their political complexion.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The issues associated with sea change were discussed recently at a meeting of the Council of Local Government and Planning Ministers in Melbourne. The federal Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads attended that meeting, along with the National Sea Change Task Force chairman, my good friend Councillor Joe Natoli, the Mayor of the Maroochy Shire Council on the Sunshine Coast.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We on the Sunshine Coast need to work together, regardless of our political party and regardless of our level of government, to make sure that we continue to receive our share of infrastructure improvements from all levels of government. The Australian government is prepared to play its part. I must say that I have been concerned at the lack of attention to this important matter on the part of the Beattie state Labor government. The government of Queensland has a number of Labor representatives on the Sunshine Coast, and it really is important that they sit down and look at what is required for our local communities. I anticipate actually having a meeting of all levels of government representatives on the Sunshine Coast so that we can make sure that we work together, because we can achieve so much more through cooperation rather than confrontation.</para>

<para>âIn the time remaining to me I want to say how amazed I was to find that the opposition in the Senate are actually objecting to the new allocation of questions to reflect the fact that the Australian people chose to give the coalition a majority in the Senate. Despite the fact that the coalition has a majority in the Senate, the opposition still gets to ask very many more questions each time the Senate sits than does the government. An equitable proposition would be for the number of questions allocated to senators in accordance with the proportions that the parties are in the parliament, but this never happens. What happens, though, in the main chamber of the House of Representatives is that at question time we have questions asked alternately by members on the opposition side and on the government side. When there are Independents they of course have to share the opposition allocation of questions. So in the Senate the coalition is being incredibly more generous to the opposition than is really appropriate.</para>
</talk.start>

<para pgwide="yes">Also, of course, the position of Deputy President of the Senate could well have been taken by the coalition and, in my view, should have been taken by the coalition following the fact that the Australian people reduced the opposition parties to a minority situation in the Australian Senate. I think it is tragic when the Labor Party huffs and puffs and makes such an unreasonable argument. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âAs we start a new parliamentary session, I think it is appropriate to review what the parliament is about and to review the governmentâs agenda and the direction they are taking Australia. This is a new era in Australian politics, with the Howard government having control of both houses of parliament. It places a great responsibility on them, and they need to be very cognisant of the fact that they are the government for the whole of Australia. They must at no stage forget that there are many people who did not vote for them and who disagree vehemently with what they stand for and some of the policies that they will be pursuing. At the same time, they need to try to take those people with them.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">With the government having control of both houses of the parliament, we have got to watch their agenda. I believe that the governmentâs agenda is quite reactionary and has the potential to impact on many Australians. I have always believed that, on any issue, the best outcome is achieved by consensus and cooperation; by inclusion, not exclusion. I do not believe that exclusion is a healthy approach but, unfortunately, the Howard government appear not to share this belief that inclusion is in the best interests of the Australian people. Rather, they have adopted an aggressive, divisive agenda based on exclusion, alienation and the creation of in-groups and out-groups within our society.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Earlier this morning, the member for Port Adelaide made a very good speechâone that I am quite happy to associate myself with. In my three-minute statement I raised the issue of TAFE and the changes that are going to take place there. We need to look at some of the things that have been happening within Australia. You only have to look at university students and see how upset they are about the changes in the area of voluntary student unionism and the impact that they believe the changes in that area will have on their education and on their ability to access all the things that they need as university students.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The sale of Telstra is on the agenda, and I see that that has caused divisions even within the government parties. Once again, there are going to be some people who benefit quite significantly from the sale of Telstra, but there are going to be many people who are going to be disadvantaged by it. It really worries me when you have a situation where some people are going to do very nicely and other people are going to be alienated by a decision of the government.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">An area that is very close to my heart is the disability support pension. Before coming into parliament I worked with people with disabilities for some 13 years, helping those people find work. I know that the greatest thing that you can do to help a person with a disability to find work is to create a secure environment for them to look for work. What will happen under this governmentâs legislation will be the stigmatisation of certain people with certain disabilities, including people with back injuries, because that is something about which there already are some stereotypes. Another area of concern is the supporting parents benefit; and I cannot for a moment leave out the changes that are going to happen in the industrial relations area. I feel that significant groups of people in our community will be disadvantaged, and that is not what the government should be about. It should be governing for the whole of Australia.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">On Tuesday, 9 August I became a grandmother. I have a grandson, Samuel Lindsay Hall, and I worry about the kind of world that he is going into.

<para>âI would also like to congratulate the member for Shortland on the birth of her new grandson; there is nothing greater than grandchildren. I would also like to reassure the member for Shortland about the Queensland uni students and say to her that they are in good hands. I will give the member for Shortland the other side of the story. Recently in my electorate, when uni first began, I had a parent and a student come and see me because they were from a low-income family and they could not pay their upfront union feesâabout $400âand they were not allowed to use any textbooks or any equipment in the university. If you call that a fair systemâwhere you are not allowed to start your education because you have not paid the union some duesâthat is the reason why we have to seriously look at that issue, so that low-income people are not disadvantaged by that particular impost.</para>

<para pgwide="yes">Today I stand up because I would like to talk about a presentation I recently hadâthe Forde Community Awards. I hosted a morning tea to thank and honour the special local residents of my community who voluntarily give so much of their time and effort to help our community be a better place to live in. These awards were established in 1996 as a way for the community to say thank you to the voluntary workers who are the backbone of our community. These are the people who, through helping others and contributing to local events, give our society its heart and soul and who set an example of the way we should all like to be.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is through partnerships and building stronger communities that we begin to tackle some of the tough social problems and to work towards long-term solutions. Governments cannot do it alone, and history has taught us that simply throwing money at social problems does not resolve them. But I have great faith that by building stronger local communities and by fostering a belief that we all can do our little bit to help others, we will begin to turn things around. We can build an Australian tradition of community services and lending a hand to those in need, and that is exactly what these awards are all about.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As I continue to work with our local community groups, I am heartened and inspired by the many dedicated local residents. They are the heart and soul of our community, as I said before. I know that these big-hearted constituents never sought or expected any public recognition for the years of hard work that they gave so freely and for the good of others, and they never needed to be formally thanked. Nevertheless, I believe it is important that we acknowledge and recognise their strong service to our community and hold them as an example for future generations to aspire to. The Forde Community Awards are just one small way that I can recognise and reward service to our community.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I would like to take the time to record their names in this House today, starting with Victoria Laurenzi from Meadowbrook. She is a young lady with a very bright future. She is a member of the Beaudesert Shire Youth Council. She was recently awarded the Beaudesert Youth Citizen of the Year for her contribution to the community. She is also involved in Rotary, Red Cross and the local Police Citizens Youth Club, just to name a few. An award was also given to George and Louisa Harch. George and Louisa have been part of our Beenleigh community for as long as anyone can remember. They received this award for their tireless efforts to Beenleigh senior citizens, Meals on Wheels, the Lutheran womenâs fellowship group and the thrift shops. They entertain at the Beenleigh nursing home and they also contribute largely to the success of our Beenleigh historical village. Our community really felt recently for George at the great loss of Louisa, and we wish him every strength for the future.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Brian Wecker received his award for the work he does for the disadvantaged at the Sunnybank Indoor Bowls Club. He raises money, through the bowls club, for the Royal Brisbane Hospitalâs childrenâs burns unit and the cancer research unit. I was delighted to present an award to Barry Fitton of Canungra. I have seen first-hand the work that he does, and he is a quiet achiever. He receives this award for his service to ex-service men and women for the past 10 years. Barry organises monthly functions for elderly ex-service people. He is currently secretary of the Canungra RSL. He organises all of our celebrations for Anzac Day, Veterans Day and Remembrance Day. He is involved in all aspects of veteran community support, and I congratulate him on this award.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Albert and Pauline Pryor of Beaudesert received an award for their years of dedication to the Woodhill Rural Fire Brigade. Keith Reinke of Beaudesert received his award for his dedication to the Beaudesert Rotary club. Keith makes wheelchairs out of bikes and he sends them to the Asia and Pacific regions. His latest project is getting a hydro pool for the sick and elderly in our electorate. I wish him well with that. Leslie Turner of Eagleby is involved in Neighbourhood Watch, Eagleby police, and he is a liaison officer with the Eagleby garden club. He is a great person; he always has a smile on his face and gives a helping hand. Delaune Pollard has been recognised for her work with the aged. She has written a book to help people with dementia, <inline font-style="italic">Midlife challenges</inline>. She is also chair of the regional disability council. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>âNo doubt you, Mr Deputy Speaker Baldwin, along with other members of the chamber will recall that on 15 July there was imagery of the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, sitting on nuclear waste drums at Lucas Heights and announcing that the government intended to site a nuclear waste facility in the Northern Territory. He proposed one of three sitesâone south of Katherine, one to the north-east of Alice Springs at Harts Range and one to the north-west of Alice Springs off the Yuendumu road.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">This was done without even so much as a by-your-leave. There was no discussion and no negotiation; there was no information given to the Northern Territory community. No discussion was undertaken with the Northern Territory government. Indeed, the Northern Territory government heard of this as a result of a press release and a fax released at the time that the minister was making the statement.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As you can imagine, Mr Deputy Speaker, this has outraged the community of the Northern Territory, not least because, prior to the last federal election, the people of the Northern Territory were given an absolute categorical assuranceâan âabsolute categorical assuranceâ, in the words of Senator Ian Campbell, Minister for the Environment and Heritageâthat no nuclear waste facility would be built in the Northern Territory.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Had the minister said at the time that there would be a nuclear waste facility at one of three sites in the Northern Territory, I can guarantee one thing: the member for Solomon would not be here today as the member for Solomon. He absolutely would not be here today. I would even go so far as to say that Senator Scullion would be very close to not being here today either. Such is the strength of feeling in the Northern Territory community about, firstly, the proposition that there should be a nuclear waste site in the Northern Territory and, secondly, the lies that have been told by this federal governmentâassurances given, guarantees that there would be no nuclear waste facility.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We are told that this is safe. All the experts say that this is safe and we do not have to worry about it. They say that it is low-level wasteâmaybe with some intermediate-level waste. Later we are told, âWeâll be bringing stuff back from the UK and France, which we will have to store in drums.â It will be there for yearsâhundreds of years. There is no reference to disposal, no explanation as to what is going to happen to this stuff in the long term. We are told that we will have one of these three sites in the Northern Territory.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Last week, Minister Macfarlane said that it is treated in such a way and stored in such a way at present that it presents no danger to the environment or the population around it. If that is the case, leave it where it bloody well is. Leave it at Lucas Heights. The people at Lucas Heights say they are prepared to take it. Alternatively, put it in New South Wales at one of the many sites which have been identified by the governmentâs own national site advisory committee, the committee which was established by Peter McGauran when he was minister for science. We have no informationâor not much informationâabout who was on this committee, but it produced a list. Not one of the three sites identified in the Northern Territory was identified as suitable, and two of them were not even on the list. What we have from the government, from this committee, is a list of sites in New South Wales that are deemed suitable by these experts to store nuclear waste. Does it surprise that there is even a site in the ACT?</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Let me take you through a few of the sites, Mr Deputy Speaker Baldwin. I am sure you will be keen to hear about them. I think one of them might be at Singleton. There is certainly one at Denman. It is deemed most suitable. There are 460 hectares. There is Bogan Gate, which is near Parkesâ1,000 hectares, most suitable. There are 7,400 hectares near Narranderaâmost suitable. There is Waggaâ1,688 hectares, most suitable. There is Deniliquinâ1,081 hectares, most suitable. And then there is Mount Reedy near Canberraâjust down the road, near Mount Majura. There are eight hectares there, and it says âsuitableâ.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Not one of these sites has been considered. The government has taken the soft cop. It has said, âWe can do this in the Northern Territory because we have Commonwealth land, Defence land. We can take away the decision making in the Northern Territory community about land management.â The government will take away decision making to do with the Northern Territoryâjust as it has subsequently done over the issue of uranium mining.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We are not going to stand for it. We will not tolerate it. Just so that the House can be informed, I seek leave to table the document headed âShortlist with NSAC CommentsâFinalâ.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Leave granted.</para>

<para>âI rise today to talk about the fact that the Queensland state Labor government continues to ignore its responsibilities to provide adequate road transport infrastructure and adequate public transport infrastructure to the residents of my electorate of Moncrieff and, more broadly, the residents of the Gold Coast. I have spoken on many occasions about the fact that the Gold Coast is the fastest-growing city in the country. For the last 25 years the Gold Coast has grown at a faster rate than anywhere else in Australia, and it is projected that for the next 25 years the Gold Coast will continue to grow at a faster rate than anywhere else in the country. Notwithstanding this fact, the Beattie Labor government continues to shirk its responsibilities on a daily basis with regard to the provision of adequate road transport and adequate public transport. I must highlight the absolute lack of good representation from the state Labor members on the Gold Coast. They are colloquially known as âthe silent sevenâ because of the fact that they are either unwilling or unable to speak up on behalf of the residents and constituents in their respective state electorates.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">One of the latest tricks that the Beattie state Labor government are getting up to with regard to the provision of road transport and roads generally across the Gold Coast is to continually come forward with proposals to part-fund the construction of new roads or to part-fund the maintenance of roads or to part-fund the expansion of existing road corridors. But in each of these instances these are roads that are solely within the domain of state government jurisdiction. In each of these instances, it is the state government that should be providing all the funding for the construction of these roads. There is a line I often use which I think resonates with the community and which I believe underscores the principle at stake: if the federal government went to the Queensland state government and asked for partial funding for new defence ships, helicopters or aircraft, then it would be laughed out of town. Yet for some reason the Queensland state Labor government, with a very straight face, believe that they can go to the community and say, âWeâll part-fund this if only the federal government comes to the party.â The federal government does not directly fund state government controlled roads.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There is a deeper issue at the core of this, and that is the fact that, for every dollar that the Queensland state Labor government spends on roads, 67c comes from the Commonwealth government indirectly, through the money that we provide to the Queensland state government. This year the Queensland state government is running a $3 billion surplus. That $3 billion could be used to ease the traffic congestion that we have on the Gold Coast. In particular I say to those residents of my electorate that live in Nerang, Highland Park, Mudgeeraba and Carrara: the reason that you are suffering from poor traffic infrastructure and a poor road network is that the state Labor member Dianne Reilly, the state Labor member Robert Poole, the state Labor member for the Broadwater area, who is responsible for the traffic congestion around Frank Streetâthat is, Peta-Kaye Croftâand the state Labor Party member for Southport, Peter Lawlor, are all reluctant or unwilling to take the fight up to Peter Beattie, to put forward the case, on behalf of their residents and their constituents, about why the Queensland government must invest in more road transport infrastructure for the people of the Gold Coast.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Recently the Beattie Labor government made a big song and dance about the fact that it intends over the next 25 years to provide additional funding for infrastructure. The problem is that, when you compare the Gold Coast to Ipswich, Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast, when it comes to roads we come last. That is despite the fact that it is the fastest-growing region in the state. So the simple choice for all constituents is to put the truth to the lie currently being told that it is the federal government that is holding up road funding. The reality is that these are state government roads. The state government has a massive windfall surplus as a result of the GST. The federal government already indirectly contributes 67c in every dollar that the Queensland government puts into roads funding, and it is high time the state local Labor MPs stood up on behalf of their constituents and actually did something to make the lot of Gold Coast residents better. That is the reason they were elected, that is the job they have got to do and it is important they do it.</para>

<para>âOver the weekend, on a spectacular Sydney winter day, I joined a group of bikers out at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts at Penrith for the annual blanket ride into Parramatta. In one of the great perks of officeâand I am not talking about the doughnutsâI got to jump on the back of a Harley and join an impressive convoy of bikes that rode down the freeway into Parramatta Town Hall square, all carrying blankets as donations for the growing number of homeless people in our local area. At Parramatta square, we joined many locals who had come together to acknowledge the crisis in accommodation faced by many Australians and to acknowledge the plight of the growing number of homeless people in our local community.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The event in the square was organised by three of our community groups: Parramatta Mission, Anglicare and Street Level Christian Community. The blanket run was the brainchild of a Christian biker group called the Brotherhood, founded by Greg Hirst as the ministry arm to the Street Level Christian Community. Its purpose was to reach out to young people at risk. As well as running a successful drop-in centre in Pitt Street, Merrylands, the Brotherhood organise a blanket run and a Christmas toy run each year.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">On any night, around 100,000 Australians are homeless or at risk of becoming homelessâmany on the street, some sleeping on the floor at relativesâ or friendsâ places and many more in crisis accommodation and shelters. For many Australians who think of homelessness in terms of the older men that they see sleeping in parks and under bridges, it would be a surprise to know that over half of those 100,000 people are femaleâsome 56 per cent. Few people realise that over one-third are under 25 years old and that two-thirds are under the age of 35. Only 14 per cent are over 45 and nearly 10 per cent are under the age of 12. The average age of homeless women or women at risk is only 30, and 33 for men. The highest users of crisis services are people aged just 18 and 19 years.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">But these figures are not reflected by what we see in the streets. That is because some 1,200 agencies around the country provide services and assistance to people who are homeless or in danger of becoming homeless. These organisations are run by committed people in underresourced organisations who work both day and night making sure that as many people as possible have safe accommodation. There are thousands of people working to bring the most vulnerable people back into society as quickly as possible. There can be no question it is because of these people providing support at the early stages, working to reconnect people as quickly as possible before the secondary effects of homelessness set in, that we do not see a far greater number of people in our parks and under bridges. The community as a whole should be grateful for every one of these workers who choose to work in this area for the benefit of the greater community.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Commonwealth government supports the work of these people through the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program, known as the SAAP agreement. The fourth agreement between the states expired on 1 July 2005. In late June, a three-month stopgap agreement was reached, but as of today there is still no agreement and one is not expected until 30 September. Meanwhile, thousands of community workers carry on, unsure of their status and unsure of their jobs, doing more and more with less and less in real terms. Despite evidence of a significant unmet need, the Commonwealth is not offering any new money, no increase above indexation, in spite of an evaluation in 2004 that showed that an increase of 15 per cent is needed just to hold services at current levelsâtoo little and alarmingly late.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This is a common story that surrounds this governmentâthe lateness of decisions concerning the funding of the community sector, and the exploitation of the commitment, generosity and goodwill of our most community-minded and compassionate citizens. It shows a lack of respect and appreciation for people who already work for less money than they could make elsewhere and who are already making sacrifices for the most vulnerable people in our society. They are people who have mortgages of their own and who really do not know what will happen to their jobs as of 30 September or what will happen to the people they work so hard to represent. It shows a complete lack of understanding of the role our community sector plays in holding an increasingly fractured community together. I urge the government to give real support to our community organisations, as they work for all of us in this vital area of homelessness in our community.</para>

<para>âFor some time in my community there has been an issue that has created concern. It is in relation to some land that the Department of Defence is proposing to deal with because it really does not have any further Defence purpose. The land in question is Jezzine Barracks, which is basically on the foreshore in Townsville. It is the home of Australiaâs 11 Brigade, a reserve brigade which is going to move to Lavarack Barracks, home of Australiaâs 3rd Brigade. They will move to be with the Australian Regular Army. The land at Jezzine Barracks, which has been in Defence use for more than a century, will no longer be required for Defence purposes and Defence has to decide what it might do with the land. There are lots of options. There is a lot of concern in the community about the fact that this land, right on the foreshore, might in fact become a developerâs paradise. I think we all understand that, and certainly the government understands it. But it is disappointing to see an emotional debate going on in the community rather than a logical and rational debate. Part of that was illustrated by a story in yesterdayâs Townsville <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline>, which led off with the words:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">An officer from the Australian Defence Force has been in town to start negotiations on the sell-off of Jezzine Barracks and Kissing Point.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">This is just patent rubbish. The journalist who wrote that should be ashamed of himself. He knows that there is no proposed sell-off of Jezzine Barracks or Kissing Pointânone. That was all explained to him, yet he writes an emotive line about Defence being in town to begin the negotiation to sell off the property. It is irresponsible. I do not normally rise in the parliament to be critical of a journalist. I work with journalists every day. But, gee, they have got to tell the truth. They cannot just go for a good headline.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There is further evidence that there could be no sell-off anyway, particularly of Kissing Point, because it is heritage listed. All of the fort area on the top of the headlandâquite a substantial area of landâis entered on the Commonwealth heritage register. It cannot be sold; it just canât. Yet we have the Townsville <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> saying that Defence is here to start the negotiations to sell it off. I would just ask the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> to be more reasonable.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In todayâs <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline>, the editorial writer notes:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Mr Lindsay assures us that Kissing Point will not be lost to the community, but this is not an issue we can take on trust.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> are saying that they do not trust me. You have got a piece of land that is entered on the Commonwealth heritage register and that cannot be sold, and they are saying that they cannot trust me when I say it cannot be sold. I do not think it is a very intelligent editorial, with that sort of thing happening.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There are a number of stakeholders interested in this matter. I understand the communityâs concerns. What the government are doing, and what we have said all along, is this: we will establish a consultative group within Defenceâand that has been establishedâwho will consult widely with the community. As soon as they start the consultation process, the media in Townsville is saying that they are there to sell off the land. It is just not true. I can assure our community that groups like the North Queensland Military Museum, the RSL, the city councilâthose sorts of groupsâwill have full and open access to the consultative committee, and in fact the wider community of Townsville will have that access. I note that, before writing to other key stakeholders, the parliamentary secretary who is responsible for this process yesterday wrote to the Mayor of the Townsville City Council, Tony Mooney, extending to him the first invitation to join the consultative forum. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<item label="(1)">
<list type="loweralpha">
<item label="(a)">
<para>The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairsâ (DIMIAâs) post in Suva has reported that there have only been 2 applications at post by Chinese citizens for student visas in the current 2004-05 program year to end February, one of whom was a Central Queensland University (CQU) student. During the 2003-04 program year, 161 student visa applications from PRC citizens were lodged at the Suva post. Of these, 121 or 75 per cent were for study in the Higher Education Sector (subclass 573). The majority of these applications would have been from students at the Fiji campus of CQU seeking to transfer their studies to an Australian campus of CQU.</para>
</item>
<item label="(b)">
<para>During the 2003-04 program year, there were a total of 8 applications refused by the Suva post for PRC nationals in the Higher Education Sector. The majority of these would have been from students who were studying or had studied at the Fiji campus of CQU.</para>
</item>
<item label="(c)">
<para>In the 2003-04 program year, a total of 79 cancellations were reported against all students studying at a CQU campus in Australia (38 at the Sydney campus and 41 at the Melbourne campus) relating to students not attending classes or not meeting the academic course requirements.</para>
<para>To verify the exact numbers of CQU students who had their visa cancelled and had previously studied at the CQU campus in Fiji, would be a very resource intensive task as this information cannot be extracted directly from DIMIA systems.</para>
<para>(d)Â Â  (i) For resource reasons, DIMIA is unable to verify the numbers currently involved in the determination process relating to visa cancellation, who previously studied at the CQU campus in Fiji. We anticipate that this number would be minimal, if any.</para>
<para>DIMIA is able to confirm that during the 2003-04 program year, the total number of Non-Compliance Notices (NCNs) issued to all students who were studying at a CQU campus in Australia was 1,020 (278 for students studying at the Melbourne campus and 742 for the Sydney campus). This figure relates to both NCNs issued for non-attendance at classes and poor academic performance and also administrative notices issued for reasons such as the student changing provider. The vast majority of these NCNs were related to administrative notices and would therefore not result in a cancellation.</para>

<para>No. While Defence has contributed in excess of $1 million to marine mammal research in Australia over the past five years, including ecology population, distribution and abundance studies, Defence has not conducted any studies that have knowingly exposed whales or dolphins to sonar. This work has guided the development of the management plans that have been implemented by the Royal Australian Navy to ensure activities involving the use of active sonar do not impact on marine mammals.</para>

<para>The Royal Australian Navy does not operate its equipment in a way that is likely to cause injury to marine mammals or harm the marine environment. The Environmental Management Plan for Australian Maritime Exercise Areas prescribes mitigation procedures to minimise the likelihood of adverse impacts on marine mammals and the marine environment. Strict protocols apply to the operation of sonar to ensure that marine mammals are not inadvertently exposed to high levels of acoustic energy that might affect their health or interfere with behavioral characteristics that are important to their survival. The controls in place are among the most stringent employed by any Navy in the world.</para>

<item label="(1)">
<para>I can confirm that the Codex Alimentarius Commission will be considering the adoption of the draft Guidelines for Vitamin and Mineral Food Supplements at its meeting in Rome in July 2005.</para>
<para>I can also confirm that Australiaâs position at the upcoming commission meeting states that it would not be bound by these guidelines. However this statement is subject to a critical provision, which limits the application of the guidelines to countries that regulate vitamin and mineral supplements as foods, being retained.</para>
<para>Australia regulates vitamin and mineral supplements as complementary medicine. As such, they are outside the scope of the currently drafted guidelines. Therefore, Australiaâs system of regulation of vitamin and mineral supplements as complementary medicines is not expected to be affected, nor would Australia be expected to be vulnerable to challenge under the relevant agreements of the World Trade Organization.</para>

<item label="(2)">
<para>Australia played an active role in deliberations on the draft guidelines. In addition to supporting the aforementioned exception, Australia strongly supported a scientific risk-based approach to establishing maximum limits for vitamin and mineral food supplements. The approach to setting maximum limits had been strongly debated by the delegations.</para>

<para>All applicants for entry to Australia must meet character requirements. These include that they have not been involved in human rights abuses or war crimes. In order to ensure that persons entering Australia are of good character, my Department gathers information on countries where war crimes or crimes against humanity have taken place and uses this information to develop screening tools for applicants from those countries. Rwandans resettled under the refugee program would have also been screened by UNHCR in relation to their need and background. Further, there are over 1000 names of Rwandans who may have taken part in human rights abuses held in departmental databases. These have been sourced from the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, other countries and open source information. Any allegation about the involvement of a non-citizen in war crimes or human rights abuse is investigated by my Department. If substantiated, action can be taken to cancel any current visa and refuse further visas.</para>

<item label="(1)">
<para>There have been no recent changes to the Medicare Benefits Schedule relating to mammographic examination of the breast.</para>
<para>Diagnostic mammography is for women who have clinical breast symptoms that require investigation. Diagnostic mammograms are usually taken in conjunction with clinical assessment. These services are not designed to recruit and screen large numbers of women who are likely to benefit from regular screening mammography. The current scheduled fee to have a diagnostic mammogram, under the Medicare Benefits Schedule, is $89.50. Private practices may charge above this fee.</para>
<para>Women without symptoms or a previous history or family history of breast cancer are not entitled to a Medicare rebate and would have to pay the full cost of the mammogram.</para>
<para>Free screening mammographic examinations are available to eligible Australian women every two years through BreastScreen Australia, a joint initiative of state and territory governments and the Australian Government funded through the Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements. States and territories have primary responsibility for the implementation of the program at their local level. The Australian Government provides overall coordination of policy formulation, national data collection, quality control, monitoring and evaluation.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>BreastScreen Australia is the national mammographic screening program. It provides free screening mammograms at two-yearly intervals for women aged 50â69 with the aim of reducing deaths from breast cancer in this target group, through early detection of the disease. The target age group for screening is women aged 50-69 years, but women aged 40-49 years and over 70 years are also eligible to attend, however women in these age groups are not actively recruited into the program.</para>
<para>International research has shown that breast cancer screening of women aged 50-69 years is an effective way to reduce the number of women who die from breast cancer. Women aged 70 years and over are advised to discuss the requirement for ongoing screening with their general practitioner to assist them in making an informed decision about whether or not to continue having screening mammograms.</para>

<item label="(2)">
<para>Yes, the delisting of calcium tablets from the PBS was one of the Budget measures and is expected to save around $36 million over four years. The National Health Act (1953) requires that the advice of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) is obtained before action is taken to delist a PBS medicine. The PBAC is an independent, expert advisory body whose members include medical practitioners, health scientists, other health professionals and a consumer representative. The advice must be tabled in both houses of the Parliament.</para>
<para>(3)Â Â  (a) and (b) Yes, concession card holders currently pay $4.60 for PBS prescriptions. Calcium tablets are relatively inexpensive and available over the counter at most pharmacies for around $13 to $15 for two months supply.</para>
<para>(4)Â Â  (a) to (d) Yes. I am aware that many people take calcium tablets for a variety of reasons and conditions. The PBS includes a wide variety of medicines for many conditions, but it is not possible and it is not intended that the PBS cover every useful treatment.</para>
<para>(5)Â Â  (a) and (b) Access Economics has estimated the direct cost of osteoporosis to be $1.9 billion per annum, and the indirect cost to be $5.6 billion per annum, based on a costing for 2000-01 (Access Economics 2001. The Burden of Brittle Bones: Costing Osteoporosis in Australia.)</para>
<para>Cost estimations vary widely with the large variety of methodologies used and there is no generally accepted costing methodology. The Australian Government uses the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare as its statistical data source, including for costing estimates. For an indicative comparison, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare estimates that the direct cost of osteoporosis in 2000-01 was $221 million (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (2004), Health system expenditure on disease and injury in Australia, 2000-01, AIHW Cat no HWE 26, AIHW: Canberra http/www.aihw.gov.au). The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare does not provide estimates of indirect costs.</para>
<para>Using the methodology adopted by the AIHW, pharmaceuticals accounted for the greatest proportion of the expenditure for osteoporosis, followed by expenditure on aged care homes and hospital services in 2000â01.</para>
<para>Subsidies for inexpensive medicines, such as calcium tablets, make only a small difference in affordability for individuals. It is preferable that PBS dollars are directed to those medicines that would otherwise be difficult for individuals to afford. The measure supports PBS affordability by reducing the cost to government of subsidised medicines and improving value for money from the scheme.</para>
<para>Medicines listed on the PBS for use in the treatment of osteoporosis with a related fracture will continue to be subsidised. These medicines need to be prescribed by a doctor and, at between $50 - $60 for one monthâs treatment, are much more expensive than calcium tablets. PBS subsidies for these other drugs for osteoporosis cost over $130 million per year.</para>

<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>The Minister for Foreign Affairs is responsible for monitoring and reporting on Australiaâs levels of Official Development Assistance (ODA). This includes both AusAID and ODA eligible expenditure by other government departments. A range of inter-governmental coordination mechanisms are used to ensure a strong and coherent whole-of-government approach to the strategic positioning of development assistance. Australiaâs level of policy coherence on development issues and its innovative whole-of-government approach was commended by the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD in its review of the Australian aid program in December 2004.</para>
</item>
<item label="(2)">
<para>The DAC is the principal body through which the OECD addresses issues related to development cooperation, and is the key forum and review body for major bilateral donors. Official Development Assistance (ODA) is the primary quantitative measure used by the DAC to compare donor efforts. The DAC sets and provides guidance on ODA eligibility of government expenditures.</para>
<para>AusAID, as the Australian Governmentâs aid agency, is responsible, in cooperation with other Government departments, for reporting to the DAC on Australiaâs ODA. The Minister and AusAID drive and participate in a variety of inter-governmental coordination mechanisms. This ensures the aid program remains part of a broader, integrated whole-of-government approach to engaging with the region. However, the performance and expenditure of individual departments within the Governmentâs broader approach remain the responsibility of the relevant Ministers. This is the logical and most practical approach, given that ODA eligible expenditure constitutes only a part of the overall expenditures of other government departments.</para>
</item>
<item label="(3)">
<para>The level of ODA in the form of OGD expenditure is monitored by a single Minister and agency, namely the Minister for Foreign Affairs and AusAID.</para>
<para>Development issues in our region are increasingly complex and require the engagement of not just one Australian Government department, but an integrated whole-of-government approach. While AusAID remains responsible for reporting on levels of ODA eligible expenditure related to these approaches, individual departments and Ministers remain responsible for delivery of their respective contributions. It is therefore appropriate that individual Ministers and departments remain responsible for their performance and expenditures.</para>
</item>
<item label="(4)">
<para>See above.</para>
</item>
<item label="(5)">
<para>No. The most appropriate approach to ODA-eligible OGD expenditure is that individual Ministers and departments remain responsible for their performance, within broader whole-of-government coordination mechanisms.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The Entrepreneursâ Tax Offset will provide small businesses in the Simplified Tax System with a turnover of $50,000 or less a 25 per cent tax discount on the tax liability relating to their business income. The discount also applies to businesses with turnovers above $50,000 but tapers out at the rate of one per cent per $1,000 turnover, so that it ceases once turnover reaches $75,000.</para>

<para>RAMSI program initiatives in 2004/05 focus on implementing reforms in the three key pillars of economic governance, machinery of government and law and justice. Some of the key new projects in 2004/05 include assistance to accountability institutions, a partnership with the Australian Electoral Commission to strengthen the Solomon Islands electoral system, phase 2 of the Budget Stabilisation Program (known as the Financial Management Strengthening Program), the parliamentary support project and assistance to the high profile High Court trials.</para>
<para>Final expenditure figures for 2004/05 are not yet available, however it is anticipated that actual expenditure will vary from estimated expenditure (above) given significant increased demands on support to the Solomon Islands justice system, in particular the High Court trials. The needs of the justice sector have been able to be met from the Machinery of Government program, an initiative which is still in an early phase.</para>
