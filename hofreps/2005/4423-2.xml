<para>—It gives me great pleasure to report to my colleagues on both sides of the House on the 113th Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly held in Geneva from 16 to 20 October 2005 and a bilateral visit to the Republic of Singapore from 23 to 27 October 2005. I had an outstanding delegation who made an outstanding contribution to the work of the 113th Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly in Geneva. I was ably supported by the deputy leader, Mrs Julia Irwin, the member for Fowler; Mrs Kay Hull, the member for Riverina; and Ms Annette Ellis, the member for Canberra. They were the elected members of the delegation, but we also had Senator Julian McGauran, from Victoria, who played a very important role in our delegation, although he came to the assembly in a private capacity. We appreciated the contribution that he made to the work of the delegation in Geneva.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We were accompanied by Neil Bessell, secretary to the delegation from the Department of the Senate. Both the work that he did to prepare the delegation for this visit and his work during the visit were very capably managed, and we appreciated the assistance that he gave us at all times. Jeremy Kruse, who was the adviser from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, provided excellent advice, sometimes on the run as matters came up that were unforeseen. We appreciated very much his assistance both prior to the delegation’s visit and after it.</para>
<para>The proceedings on this occasion were dominated by the election of a new president of the IPU to replace Mr Paez from Chile, who completed his term of office. We thank Mr Paez for the contribution he has made to the work of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. It was good to see that there was some good competition. There were two very capable candidates: Mr Pier Ferdinando Casini, the Speaker of the Italian parliament, and Mr Geert Versnick from Belgium. Mr Pier Ferdinando Casini was elected as the President of the Inter-Parliamentary Union for the next three years. His term will end in October 2008. They were both excellent candidates. Both had some experience but particularly Mr Versnick, who has had long experience with the IPU. We thank the delegates for their enthusiastic approach to the work of the assembly.</para>
<para>All members of our Australian delegation participated in the various forums of the assembly. Ms Ellis addressed the first committee on ‘The respective roles of the parliaments and the media in providing the public with impartial, accurate and verifiable information, especially on armed conflicts and the struggle against terrorism’—very topical. Mrs Irwin addressed the second committee on ‘Migration and development’, which Mrs Hull also addressed, and Senator McGauran participated in the third committee on ‘The importance of civil society and its interplay with parliaments and other democratically elected assemblies for the maturing and development of democracy’. I addressed the emergency item, ‘Natural disasters: the role of parliaments in prevention, rehabilitation, reconstruction and the protection of vulnerable groups’. My colleague the member for Fowler, the deputy leader, will address the Singapore end of the visit. Of course the whole visit was overshadowed when we arrived in Singapore by the impending death of Mr Nguyen by hanging, but I will leave my colleague to speak to that.</para>
<para> Before finishing, I would like to thank the ambassador, Mike Smith, in Geneva for the great assistance and the hospitality he gave to the delegation. I also thank his staff because certainly they were important in working out the logistics and providing administration and assistance at all times to the delegation. We also hosted a lunch for Mr Lu Congmin, who was leader of the Chinese delegation, and that was a very useful activity. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I support the remarks of the member for Pearce and leader of the delegation. I would add my thanks to Jeremy Kruse from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and our special thanks to Neil Bessell from the Department of the Senate. Neil is always a reliable source of advice and a tireless organiser for IPU delegations.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As the member for Pearce has dealt with the proceedings of the IPU conference in Geneva, I will focus on the bilateral visit to Singapore. While the visit was overshadowed by the sentence of Van Nguyen, the delegation, as far as possible, fulfilled the commitments arranged beforehand. Our visit began with a tour of the World War II memorials at the Battlebox at Fort Canning and the Changi Prisoner of War Chapel and the Changi Museum built on the site where 15,000 Australians, captured at the fall of Singapore in 1942, were first interned. It is a solemn site and a stark reminder of the suffering of our service men and women, but it is also a memorial to their unbreakable spirit.</para>
<para>The delegation’s official round of meetings began with a visit to the parliament of Singapore where we met the Speaker and parliamentary members of the Singapore-Australia friendship group. Discussions covered the number of Singaporeans who have studied in Australia and the large number of Australians who have worked in Singapore. The Singaporean Minister for Health informed the delegation of steps being taken in Singapore to deal with bird flu. The leader of the delegation expressed our deep appreciation to the government of Singapore for their assistance in the treatment of Australian victims of the October 2005 Bali bombings.</para>
<para>Later the delegation made a special visit to the Mount Elizabeth Hospital to extend our best wishes to Bali bomb victims Paul and Penelope Anicich prior to their return to Newcastle, and also to thank the staff of the hospital for their assistance. At our meeting with the Economic Development Board, we learned of Singapore’s vision to become a global schoolhouse, and we also had the opportunity to visit the site of the University of New South Wales new Singapore campus.</para>
<para>Singapore is the location of the secretariat of APEC, and the delegation received an informative briefing from senior staff. At meetings with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Defence, the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies, the delegation was briefed on the Five Power Defence Arrangements and efforts to combat terrorism in the region. Free trade and people-to-people exchanges were also discussed and the delegation visited the port of Singapore to see the world’s busiest transhipment hub.</para>
<para>This report would not be complete without mention of the delegation’s efforts to secure clemency for Van Nguyen. On the day before the delegation’s arrival in Singapore, the President had announced that his appeal for clemency had been denied. The issue was raised with members of the Singaporean parliament at formal and informal meetings as well as being directly raised with the acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Defence. The delegation was moved to write to the President of Singapore seeking a review of Van Nguyen’s appeal for clemency.</para>
<para>The delegation left Singapore with heavy hearts, determined to continue to press for clemency, and delegates moved and spoke on the private members’ motion presented to the House on 7 November. In thanking the Australian High Commissioner to Singapore, Miles Kupa, I would also express the delegation’s admiration for and thanks to Second Secretary, Ms Annette Morris. Annette was the main point of contact between Van Nguyen and the Singapore authorities. Members will have seen her familiar and beautiful figure in the television coverage outside Changi prison. Annette was the last person to embrace Van Nguyen, and that was at the time of his arrest. Our thoughts are with Annette at this sad time, as they are with Van Nguyen’s family and friends. Van Nguyen’s execution has left the delegation saddened but very determined to advocate for the abolition of capital punishment in all countries through the Inter-Parliamentary Union and other forums.</para>
<para>In the short time I have left, I would like to thank three great women: the members for Canberra, Pearce and Riverina for their friendship, their courage and their conviction at such a very sad time.</para>

</talker>
<para>—It gives me great pleasure to speak on the tabling of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Human Services report <inline font-style="italic">Overseas adoption in Australia</inline>. The number of adoptions in Australia has declined markedly, from a peak of over 9,000 in 1971-72 to approximately 500 in 2003-04, of which only 73 were domestic adoptions, the remainder being from overseas. This decline appears, in part, to be due to a backlash against the way adoptions were managed between the 1950s and 1970s and the growth of successful IVF births, of which there were 7,000 last year. Fostering and other forms of out-of-home care are now the preferred way for the bureaucracy to place children who need a home.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>In 2003-04, over 21,000 children were in such care. The pendulum has swung so far that there is now a pervasive anti-adoption culture in the bureaucracy across Australia which spills into the overseas adoption units. Parents face enormous personal and financial challenges to build a family through intercountry adoption and the committee is firmly of the view that adoption is a legitimate way to form families. However, Australia’s per capita rate of intercountry adoption is poor. It is only one-third the rate in most First World countries. The per capita adoption rate in New South Wales is only one-eighth that in the ACT.</para>
<para>The committee has made 27 recommendations in its report, the acceptance of which would make a significant difference in the lives of adopting parents and their children. An important recommendation is that non-government organisations should play a greater role in managing intercountry adoptions. Currently, no NGO is accredited to process intercountry adoptions in Australia, despite the Hague convention setting out guidelines for their establishment. Accrediting NGOs would result in intercountry adoptions being much less of a drain on the resources of community service departments from what they regard as their core business. The New South Wales Department of Community Services told the committee that it regards the 105,000 local children it considers to be at risk in New South Wales to be its core business. Accrediting NGOs would allow the department to focus on these children and improve its adoption service. The committee is pleased to see that New South Wales has at least begun this process by placing an advertisement asking for expressions of interest from NGOs.</para>
<para>The report also recommends that the Commonwealth government should manage the programs with overseas countries of origin. This is a matter of external affairs and thus the Commonwealth, not individual states, should be negotiating new programs and managing existing ones. The committee has combined this recommendation with the proposal that Australia should not limit its intercountry adoption programs to countries that have ratified the Hague convention and has suggested a role for AusAID.</para>
<para>This inquiry has attracted much media interest and has been received as a much needed report. However, the Queensland Minister for Child Safety, the Hon. Mike Reynolds, seems to have missed the point in his media release last week. The minister’s main message was that the Queensland government would postpone the review of its adoption legislation until the Commonwealth has formally responded to the committee’s report. Minister Reynolds has made no commitment to take any action to move on state controlled issues such as reopening their applications for intercountry adoptions, which have been shut now for 12 months. The minister could also devote more resources to processing existing files as well as moving to accredit NGOs to give them what, one must conclude, is much needed help. Any state government can take immediate action in response to this report. I should also add that the committee is happy to cooperate with the Queensland government, or any Australian government—state or federal—in order to progress this report.</para>
<para>Compiling such a report relies on the help of many people. I thank my fellow committee members for the assistance they provided, in particular my deputy chair, Julia Irwin, and Harry Quick, who on his own initiative went to Beijing to see adoption operations first-hand. I also thank the committee secretary, Mr James Catchpole, and all the staff who worked so hard with the committee, and the many individuals and organisations who assisted by making a submission or giving evidence at the hearings. Their expertise and experience are greatly valued and laid a strong foundation for our deliberations. I commend the report to the House. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talker>
<para>—I join with the Chair of the Standing Committee on Family and Human Services, the member for Mackellar, in expressing my thanks to the many people, organisations and government agencies who made submissions to and appeared before the inquiry into overseas adoption. This is their report. On one level, this is quite an emotive topic, but at the same time this is a serious task for the agencies charged with the responsibility of ensuring the welfare and safety of vulnerable young children. The committee detected in government agencies an unhelpful attitude towards adoption, although this was typically expressed as a lack of positive action by governments rather than outright opposition. The committee noted that the primary focus of state and territory agencies was children with problems in dysfunctional families.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The committee received submissions which dealt with a number of aspects of local adoption. As this was clearly outside the inquiry’s terms of reference, the committee’s consideration of this aspect is included as an appendix. I should point out that, in the interests of presenting a credible report, this section should be viewed as a work in progress rather than a final report. The fact that individuals, organisations and government agencies were not advised, through the terms of reference, that local adoption practices were the subject of the inquiry makes this part of the report unbalanced and incomplete. The only conclusion that can be drawn from the section dealing with local adoption is that further inquiry is warranted.</para>
<para>Coming back to the subject of the report—overseas adoption—the most striking fact for me was the very low number of overseas adoptions. It is hard to see why, as a successful multicultural society, Australia is so close to the bottom of the table of Western countries in its per capita rate of overseas adoption. Countries such as Norway and Sweden have an adoption rate nearly 10 times as high as Australia’s. There can be little doubt that the arduous process of applying for overseas adoption is the main cause of the low rate of overseas adoption in Australia. And the experience of individual parents must discourage other potential adoptive parents. The report quotes Professor Peter Boss of Monash University, who sees the opponents of overseas adoption as being largely the professional groups involved in adoption, such as social workers and psychologists. It is hard to escape the conclusion that professionals who oppose overseas adoption do so for their own moral reasons.</para>
<para>Another issue was children from a different race being raised in an alien culture. But no evidence given to the committee suggested that this presented any major problems, particularly for children adopted at a young age, and many parents who have adopted children from overseas stated that the physical and emotional wellbeing of their child was much improved on the circumstances they endured in their home country.</para>
<para>The committee did not address the question of whether Australians should focus on improving the conditions of all children at risk in overseas countries in preference to encouraging the adoption of a relatively small number. Clearly, that is a matter for individual families to decide. But, having taken that decision, and subject to a process of approval which satisfies the requirements of the country from which the child is adopted and local requirements, the moral question of how best to assist the plight of children at risk should not influence the assessment process.</para>
<para>In the many recommendations of the committee, a greater role for the Commonwealth in overseas adoption appears to be the most effective means of overcoming the states’ bias against overseas adoption. In more immediate terms, the Commonwealth can assist families adopting children from overseas. Families adopting children over the age of two, which is not uncommon, are not eligible for maternity payment. The committee has therefore recommended that the Minister for Family and Community Services remove the age limit for eligibility for maternity payment in relation to adopted children. This measure would provide welcome assistance to many adoptive families. I hope that consideration of that recommendation begins immediately to introduce extended eligibility at the time of the next budget.</para>
<para>I thank very much the staff of the committee secretariat, some of whom are present today, and I especially thank the chair for such a wonderful and interesting inquiry. I commend the report to the House.</para>

<para>—In this report the Procedure Committee addresses two issues: the amount of time for statements and debate on committee reports, and the admission of visitors and other members to committee meetings. The committee makes three recommendations. I turn firstly to the time allocated to committee work in the House and the Main Committee. The limited time given to discussion of committee reports has been of continuing interest to the Procedure Committee and a recurring theme in a number of the committee’s reports. The committee found that very limited time is devoted to presentation and statements on, and debate of, committee reports in the House and the Main Committee. During the past two years ended 30 June 2005, only 49 hours were devoted to committee business in the House and the Main Committee. This represented only 3.4 per cent of the available hours of the House and Main Committee during that period. If we look at the House alone, we can see that there was significantly less time. During that two-year period, the House allocated only 19 hours to committee business, and this represented only 1.6 per cent of the sitting hours of the House.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>To put these figures into context, during that two-year period House and joint committees held more than 1,400 meetings and presented 181 reports. These figures include domestic or internal committees. It is now standard practice for most reports to receive only 10 minutes speaking time in the House following presentation, and only a minority of reports are debated further. Over the past two years, less than 20 per cent of the general purpose standing and joint committee reports presented in the House have been referred to the Main Committee for further debate. The committee found that a factor in the small number of referrals is the timelag between report presentation and debate in the Main Committee. This has been particularly the case more recently.</para>
<para>One of the great bipartisan strengths of the House of Representatives is its committee work. Backbench members put an enormous amount of effort into this work and, on most occasions, it is undertaken in association with the community. The committee considers that the significance of committee work to the House should be reflected more substantially in the time devoted to committee business in the House and the Main Committee. However, there are limited options for change. Members do not favour increased sittings of the House, and they do not wish to reduce the time available in the House to debate private members’ business. However, they do support increasing the meeting hours of the Main Committee.</para>
<para>Accordingly, the committee has recommended that the standing orders be amended on a trial basis during 2006 to allow a dedicated weekly period of 4 pm to 6 pm in the Main Committee on sitting Mondays for the debate of committee and delegation reports. The committee will review the trial in late 2006 so that, if the arrangements are successful, their operation will be ongoing. The amendment will mean that reports presented on Mondays will be able to be debated later that day. Committee members and other interested members will be able to speak on reports for a maximum of 10 minutes each. As to how this will work in practice, as part of their report deliberations the committee will need to agree to seek referral of reports to the Main Committee and to identify members to speak on the reports. Committee chairs will need to write to the Chief Government Whip, seeking referral of the report and specifying the committee members who are to speak on the report, well in advance of report presentation. It would seem convenient to do this at the same time as advice is sent to the Selection Committee about the presentation of the report. The committee stresses that the success of the trial will be dependent on backbench members using the additional time available.</para>
<para>The second issue is attendance at committee meetings by visitors and non-committee members. The particular issue is that the revised standing orders introduced on 16 November 2004 may have inadvertently created some uncertainty about whether committees can admit visitors and non-committee members to some private meetings. The former standing orders excluded visitors and other members from meetings when the committee or subcommittee was deliberating or taking evidence in camera. Under the new standing orders, however, visitors and other members must leave when the committee or subcommittee is conducting a private meeting. Use of the broader term ‘private meeting’ instead of the narrower terms ‘deliberating or taking evidence in camera’ has meant that there is inconsistency in the standing orders as to whether visitors and other members can attend some private committee meetings. To resolve this matter, the committee recommends minor changes to standing orders 240 and 241. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

</talker>
<para>—I welcome the opportunity to make some comments about the Standing Committee on Procedure report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Inquiry into procedures relating to House committees</inline> and also about the value of committees. As the chair explained, the report deals with just two issues: arrangements for presenting committee reports and attendance at committee meetings by visitors. I will comment on visitors at committee meetings first, since it is a relatively simple issue. When the standing orders were being revised and reorganised between 2002 and 2004, one of the underlying values was to rewrite them in plain English. The previous standing orders excluded visitors and members who were not members of the committee when a committee or subcommittee was ‘deliberating or taking evidence in camera’. It was felt that ‘deliberating’ was an outdated word. Similarly, the use of the Latin phrase ‘in camera’ to describe hearings at which the public would be excluded and the evidence taken would not be on the public record was also considered archaic. Consequently, the redrafted standing orders simply state that visitors must leave if the committee or subcommittee is ‘conducting a private meeting’. The exclusion also applies to members of the House who are not members of the committee.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As you know, Mr Speaker, committees gather evidence and inform themselves about issues in a wide variety of ways. Some of these might be considered ‘private meetings’ even though they would not have been included in the exclusions intended by the standing orders. In order to avoid any doubt about when visitors should be asked to leave a meeting, the committee now recommends returning to the more precise terminology of a meeting in which a committee or subcommittee is ‘deliberating or hearing witnesses in private’.</para>
<para>That brings me to the more substantive issue addressed in this report—that is, the time of the House devoted to committee business, particularly the presentation of committee reports. In most cases, committees attempt to honour the intention of the standing orders by presenting committee reports during the time allotted for that purpose on Mondays. You will all know that a pattern has arisen in which the Selection Committee allocates 15 minutes per speaker at the time of presenting reports rather than the maximum 10 minutes allowed by the standing orders. Further, it is very common to allow only two speakers per report—generally the chair and deputy chair of the committee. This is a profoundly unsatisfactory state of affairs. It denies the majority of members of a committee the opportunity to speak at the presentation of a report. Even if a motion to take note of a report allows further debate, almost invariably in the Main Committee, this is removed in time from the presentation. Committee members will have moved on to the next big issue and what should be the culmination of their efforts in reporting on an inquiry becomes, instead, an anticlimax.</para>
<para>How has this situation arisen? In 1987, when the House committee system was restructured, it seemed the House was acknowledging the importance of committee work both for the parliament itself and for the members who work so hard at their committee work. Ten years ago much more time was made available for the presentation of each committee report—even acknowledging that there were fewer reports. In the contest for House time between government business, committee business, private members’ business and what used to be termed ‘parliamentary business’, time for committee business has been the big loser. The committee spoke to chairs, deputies and ordinary committee members to try to find a solution to the problem of lack of time for the presentation of and debate on committee reports. The outcome is not entirely satisfactory. The contest for House time is only one of the time management issues facing members. There is also the contest between House sitting time and time for electorate and other priorities.</para>
<para>The committee’s recommendation is for additional report-debating time to be created by having the Main Committee sit from 4 pm to 6 pm on Mondays if required. Members—not necessarily limited to committee members—would have 10 minutes each to speak to a report. If there were no committee or delegation reports to be debated, the Main Committee would not sit at this time. The suggestion is a compromise. It provides additional debating time for reports without impacting on the time members need to be in Canberra. We propose it be introduced as a sessional order, with the committee to review its operation at the end of 2006. I should note that the ‘father of the Procedure Committee’, the Hon. Roger Price, had some additional—indeed innovative—suggestions for adding value to the debate on reports. The committee has not accepted them at this stage. The suggestions appear as additional comments at the end of the report and the committee would welcome feedback on these comments, as well as on the recommendations in the report. I commend the report to the House and I thank all those members who participated—the chairs and deputy chairs of committees and also those who filled in the survey form. That is the way these reports should proceed: with proper consultation so that people are aware of the result. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—On 7 July 2005, the Australian National Audit Office, ANAO, released Audit report No. 1 2005-06: <inline font-style="italic">Management of the detention centre contracts—part B</inline>. This was the second of a three-part assessment of the management by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, DIMIA, of detention centre contracts. The current contract with the service provider Global Solutions Ltd, GSL, was the focus of the second assessment. The committee commends the ANAO’s rigorous and detailed work in conducting this audit and awaits with interest the final report in this series. The committee considers that the inherent vulnerability of the detainee population means that it is essential there be careful monitoring of how DIMIA is managing its detention function. The tabling of Audit report No. 1 2005-06 provided the committee with the opportunity to undertake a focused examination of certain aspects of DIMIA’s detention centre contract management.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>As members will be aware, DIMIA has come under intense scrutiny this year. Various independent reports and internal reviews have been undertaken into aspects of the department’s immigration detention function. The committee did not wish to duplicate the work of wider inquiries and has not examined Australia’s mandatory detention policy, arrangements for offshore processing or the lawful detainment or otherwise of individuals. The committee’s review focused on certain key issues identified by the ANAO in Audit report No. 1 2005-06 and the action that DIMIA has taken in response to the ANAO’s recommendations. The ANAO made four recommendations for improvement in key areas relating to the detention function: insurance, liability and indemnity; planning, performance information and monitoring arrangements; financial reporting; and the management of Commonwealth equipment and assets.</para>
<para>However, the committee could not consider Audit report No. 1 2005-06 in isolation. The release of the report was followed a week later by the release of the Palmer report, <inline font-style="italic">Inquiry into the circumstances of the immigration detention of Cornelia Rau</inline>, and the Comrie report in October. Many of the problems identified by the ANAO in its report in relation to the provision of services to detainees, contract management and performance monitoring arrangements were similarly highlighted as problem areas in the Palmer report. The committee held a public hearing on 10 October 2005, with representatives from the ANAO and DIMIA appearing. In evidence to the committee, DIMIA advised that the implementation of the recommendations of the Palmer report of the <inline font-style="italic">Inquiry into the circumstances of the immigration detention of Cornelia Rau</inline>—also known as the Palmer implementation plan—also included the department’s proposed action to address the ANAO’s recommendations.</para>
<para>The ANAO identified a number of problems with DIMIA’s management of the detention centre contract at the time of review. A recurrent criticism throughout Audit report No. 1 2005-06 is that the standards and performance measures for monitoring GSL’s performance lacked clarity and consistency, which compromised, in ANAO’s view, DIMIA’s ability to monitor GSL and subcontractor performance. The department was initially reluctant to accept this criticism. However, it has since conceded that certain improvements may be possible in this area. The committee shares the ANAO’s view that the nature and complexity of the detention services environment warrants a more proactive approach to performance monitoring to ensure that detainees’ needs are met, there is some degree of quality assurance in the delivery of detention services and agency responsibilities are met.</para>
<para>Linked to this, and of concern to the committee, was the ANAO’s finding that there is ‘insufficient information about the quality of services being delivered and their costs to allow a value-for-money calculation’. It was troubling that DIMIA could not demonstrate whether or not increased investments in contract administration were producing greater levels of operating efficiencies. At an annual cost of $90 million, plus overheads and administrative costs, and with an additional $230 million committed over the course of five years to the Palmer implementation plan, the committee considers it crucial to ensure that adequate financial reporting and measures— <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—The public policy decision of the current government was to use private sector contractors to run immigration detention centres, and it is those contracts that are the subject of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Detention centre contracts: review of Audit report No. 1, 2005-2006, management of the detention centre contracts—part B</inline>. I think this policy has been in place for long enough—indeed, since 1997—to pass judgment on its success or failure. In that time we have had three changes of providers and various reports indicating the performance of those providers and, by implication, DIMIA. There is no doubt that the privatisation of detention services has been a spectacular failure. Its costs for the last financial year now run over $300 million, and it exposes government to elevated risk. ANAO report that $16.9 million has been paid out in compensation since 2000, and there are numerous claims in the pipeline, some of them now notorious. There have been appalling outcomes for detainees—again, the subject of numerous reports—and persistent evidence of a lack of proper oversight and control by the government.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>No justification for shifting from public to private provision was ever given. It was really an ideological preference. I have searched high and low to find the reasons for the shift and have not found any justification offered by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs at the time or, indeed, the government. I think it was inevitable that the companies that were invited to contract for these detention centres came from the criminal detention sector where privatisation of detention facilities was pioneered. Unfortunately, they brought with them attitudes towards those detained that equated them very often with convicted criminals—certainly that is the way they appear to have treated them from time to time.</para>
<para>Of course, the privatisation necessitated the development of contracts which included agreed outcomes and standards—or at least should have—and apportioned responsibilities between DIMIA and the private providers. What the evidence to date shows, including from ANAO, is that those contracts were poorly designed and managed from the outset. No-one could claim, looking at all the evidence, that the policy of having the private sector run the facilities has been a raging success—indeed, quite the opposite. There have been riots, hunger strikes and the destruction of property. There has been evidence of the use of excess force, the abuse and mistreatment of detainees by guards, inappropriate use of isolation and so on. All in all, there has been a failure to provide adequate care, especially for the mental health needs of detainees. There have been many suicide attempts, numerous incidents of self-harm and endemic depression—all well documented.</para>
<para>We have had major reports by Palmer, Comrie, HREOC and ANAO identifying scandalous inadequacies, both in government and in the private providers. The two most recent major reports from ANAO show continuing weaknesses in the contracts with private providers. The audit findings, which, amongst other things, say—in that particularly bloodless language that is used by auditors—‘The current contract with GSL and associated arrangements do not adequately address best practice for public sector outsourcing and meet the practical operational needs of the detention services delivery function.’ In other words, they are not delivering on the contract. They go on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... the contract does not establish clear expectations for the level and quality of services to be delivered; mechanisms to protect the Commonwealth’s interests are not clear; and there is insufficient information about the quality of services being delivered and their costs to allow a value-for-money calculation.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This is a pretty damming assessment. They also go on to say that DIMIA’s ability to monitor the performance of GSL and its subcontractors was compromised—as pointed out by the chair—by the lack of clarity in standards and associated performance measures. So they did not even have a clear view of what should be done. Their reliance on the reporting of incidents to determine when standards are not being met and their limited control over subcontracting arrangements were also mentioned in those audit findings.</para>
<para>This is especially problematic, as the Palmer report vividly illustrates, for health services. We have sub-subcontracting, for instance, for psychological services and little or no accountability. The audit report points out that DIMIA had taken a purely financial view of the provision of psychological services and, in general terms, failed to deliver on the duty of care that was required of them and of the contractors. I think it is time to conclude that the policy of privatising detention centres is a failed policy. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—This is the second part of an inquiry into governance arrangements for Norfolk Island to be considered in the context of the financial sustainability of the island. There is no doubt that Norfolk Island is a beautiful place. It has cultural and historical heritage which adds to the island’s attractiveness. However, Norfolk Island and its population have some serious issues to deal with. This bipartisan committee report considers all of these issues on the evidence before it, offers up recommendations to address the concerns and, I believe, adds value to Norfolk Island’s future.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The island is facing serious concerns about its future financial sustainability. Its isolation, its very limited internal revenue base and its overreliance on a tourism industry that is facing ever increasing competition supports the committee’s view that a renewed direction be adopted. The committee believes that all Australians citizens, irrespective of where they live, deserve competent government administration and service delivery. The island has an ageing population at a rate significantly higher than the rest of Australia.</para>
<para>The committee examined the island’s internal revenue-raising options, and we have considered the ability of the Norfolk Island government to increase expenditure for government services and asset replacement. On the evidence, it is very clear that the challenge has become too great for the Norfolk Island government alone to resolve. The future direction we are recommending will be neither easy nor quick. We are recommending that Norfolk Island should come under the income taxation and welfare systems of the Commonwealth, as is currently the case for the Indian Ocean territories.</para>
<para>The committee stated its preference for the Commonwealth to resume responsibility for social security, health and aged care services, national census and economic statistics collection, immigration, customs and quarantine. Commonwealth law should be applied to Norfolk Island, most particularly in the areas of Corporations Law and trade practices. A range of state type services, insofar as they do not already exist, would also fall under the Commonwealth’s umbrella, including primary and secondary school education, vocational education and training, legal services and the courts, telecommunications, broadcasting, and environment protection. The Commonwealth would also resume responsibility for the funding and upgrade of island infrastructure, including the hospital, roads, the school, power generators, a deep water harbour and the airport.</para>
<para>We believe that a number of significant matters will require management and determination by the Norfolk Island government. A local representative body would be required to assist in providing appropriate services and to lobby on behalf of the Norfolk Island community. The Norfolk Island government and its administration, we believe, are best placed in this regard.</para>
<para>As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, being a member of this committee, the committee has worked long and hard on this report. As I said, this is the second of a two-part inquiry—the first part into governance and the second into financial sustainability—on behalf of the people of Norfolk Island. Many people on the island came forward to the committee in a very open and honest way and presented their views to the committee as best they could. It was very evident to the overwhelming majority of the committee and in this bipartisan report that something needs to be done to ensure the future of Norfolk Island. This in no way reflects on any of those people on the island who are working hard to provide those services. I particularly think of the school education system and the health system where we have people doing their absolute best. Locals on the island are also attempting to service that community with one lone ambulance. There is a lot to be done and it is with those people in mind that these recommendations come forward.</para>
<para>On behalf of the committee, I thank all of those people on the island who have represented their views and their concerns to us. I also thank my colleagues on the committee for the role that we as a committee have collectively played, I believe, in working on behalf of the population of Norfolk Island. I also thank the secretariat of the committee. We have had a change of staff on the secretariat of this committee in recent times but the committee’s thanks go to each and every one of them who have played a part in the work behind this report.</para>

<para>—I present the review by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD of the operations, effectiveness and implications of ASIO’s questioning and detention powers. The committee’s name changed on Friday to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security; however, this review was wholly completed under the old name so that is the name that appears on the report being tabled today.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>This review is a fulfilment of the requirement in section 29 of the Intelligence Services Act that the committee would review the operations of this provision three years after its implementation and prior to the activation of the sunset clause in July 2006.</para>
<para>ASIO provided the committee with a substantial and comprehensive classified submission detailing the operations of the powers over a three-year period. The committee is most grateful for this information, which it found immensely important to its understanding of the operations of the act.</para>
<para>The committee’s findings in relation to the operations of division 3, part III are as follows. ASIO used its questioning powers, under warrant, 14 times over the period of the review. It did not use its detention powers. No request for a warrant was rejected by either the Attorney-General or the issuing authority. All subjects of warrants had access to legal advisers, although not all subjects used legal advisers for the whole period of their questioning. No legal representatives were removed on the grounds of disrupting the proceedings. All applications for financial assistance made to the Attorney-General’s Department have been granted.</para>
<para>ASIO complied with both the act and the protocol in relation to the general conduct of the questioning—that is, it adhered to the laws and regulations in relation to the periods of questioning, the granting of breaks, the allowing of prayer times and the explanation of the procedures to the subject et cetera. The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security or someone from his office attended the first day of all questioning warrants. All questionings were videotaped and transcribed and all videotapes and transcripts were provided to the office of the Inspector-General. The committee also had an opportunity to view videotapes and transcripts for the first eight warrants, but not the last six.</para>
<para>The nature of the questioning was described by the IGIS as ‘professional and appropriate’ and ‘the subjects of warrants were treated with humanity and respect for human dignity’, even in the face of ‘abusive and evasive comments’. The prescribed authority described the nature of the questioning as ‘questions merely to get information’ rather than ‘cross-examination’.</para>
<para>No complaints were made to the Federal Court or to the Ombudsman. However, some complaints about the process were made to IGIS and to the committee. The details of these complaints are set out in the report. They included:</para>
<list type="bullet">
<item>
<para>A lack of specificity in the warrants and therefore a limiting of the supervision of the questioning.</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>A series of complaints about the nature of the questions which, while they were acknowledged to be polite and professional, might be considered to be improper.</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>The right of lawyers to intervene—in circumstances where questions appeared to be improper, lawyers believed they should have a right to intervene.</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>Problems associated with the right to use interpreters—interpreters were refused on occasions and, where the period of questioning had been extended for those using interpreters, there was a danger that this might inhibit a subject from asking for the use of one even where that might be advisable.</para>
</item>
<item>
<para>There were claims of prejudicial reporting in the media about people subject to questioning warrants whose right of reply was curtailed by the secrecy provisions of the act.</para>
</item>
</list>
<para>These complaints were central to the debate during the inquiry and have informed the committee’s subsequent recommendations. A number of the committee’s recommendations were supported by the IGIS and regarded as reasonable by officials from ASIO and the Attorney-General’s Department during the inquiry.</para>
<para>The committee has also asked that the secrecy provisions be re-examined—that penalties for breaches be made standard, that the definition of ‘operational information’ for the purposes of the secrecy provisions be narrowed, that greater disclosure be possible on questioning-only warrants and that the prescribed authority be given some decision-making power in relation to disclosure under the secrecy provisions.</para>
<para>The committee took a great deal of evidence from the Muslim community on the implications of the legislation for them. They expressed concern that the impact on them was negative, that it had created apprehension and a sense that they had to prove their innocence.</para>
<para>Finally, the committee acknowledged and accepted the view put to it by almost all witnesses that the powers within division 3 part III were extraordinary powers that should remain on the statute book only so long as necessary. Therefore, the committee believes that the sunset clause, albeit over a longer time frame, must be re-inserted into the legislation when it is re-enacted next year.</para>

<para>—I rise also to speak on the report that has been tabled by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD into division 3 part III of the ASIO Act 1979 which, obviously, governs ASIO’s questioning and detention powers. In rising to speak on the tabling of this report, I would like to acknowledge and welcome the return of the committee chair, the Hon. David Jull, and to also acknowledge the excellent work that his predecessor and acting chair, Senator Alan Ferguson, put into the committee. It was a relatively difficult inquiry, and the manner in which Senator Ferguson chaired that committee—in a very bipartisan and a very fair way—was a great credit to him and also to the spirit of the committee. I would also like to thank the staff of the secretariat of the committee, particularly its secretary, Mrs Margaret Swieringa, Dr Cathryn Ollif, and the executive assistant, Donna Quintus-Bosz, for their assistance, without which we would not be tabling this particular report.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As a member of that committee, examining something which is regarded as a relatively controversial piece of legislation, I was particularly grateful for the cooperation that was exhibited by the members of ASIO and particularly its former director, Dennis Richardson. It enabled us as committee members to have a detailed understanding of the operation and the execution of a law which had generated much debate within a particular community. It enabled us to see how it worked and some of its potential shortcomings as well. Getting that frankness out of ASIO and watching the workings and the operations of this law gave us a very detailed insight into its execution, particularly in light of the current debate about existing legislation.</para>
<para>A lot of the committee’s deliberations on these matters—whether or not the actual legislation needed further strengthening, shall we say—were shaped on the first day of the hearing in evidence that was put forward by the former director of ASIO, Dennis Richardson. He was questioned by Senator Ray, putting aside the question of the sunset clause, as to whether or not there should be increased powers in this legislation. The answer to that was no. In fact, a member of the Attorney-General’s Department said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">With us, the answer is no as well. In fact, the amendments we included in our submission are about clarifying the powers probably in the direction of the rights of the individual.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The director-general was asked, again by Senator Ray:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... you are satisfied that the existing powers equip you to do the job you need to do?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The answer by the director-general was yes. In effect, the committee was not arguing for an increase of the powers in this particular piece of legislation to combat the threat of terrorism but, in the words of the Attorney-General’s office, ‘improving the safeguards of the powers and clarifying the rights of the individual’.</para>
<para>In reflecting as an individual committee member on this piece of legislation, when I looked at the debate in June 2003 I found that, in his concluding remarks, the Attorney-General said about these particular powers:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">We have always said that we recognise that this bill is extraordinary; indeed, I have indicated repeatedly that I hope the powers under the bill never have to be exercised. But this bill is about intelligence gathering in extraordinary circumstances ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">We have heard from the chair that the use of those powers has been appropriate by the agency and it has been appropriately independently monitored by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. I would say in this place that it emphasises that, when you bring legislation of this nature to the Australian parliament, it should be subjected to an independent and bipartisan committee process. There should be some independent supervision and some accountability to this place.</para>
<para>I would certainly welcome the insertion of the sunset clause. This is a very important mechanism to keep agencies accountable—not because we believe that they will not exercise their powers prudently, as has been the case in the execution of the 14 questioning warrants, but because we need to provide the legislative security protection for them to be exercising their powers. That was one of the key recommendations arising from this report.</para>
<para>I would also argue this: in terms of the execution of this particular legislation and its passage through the various committees, which has strengthened the legislation—in fact, we have 19 recommendations which, in my view, strengthen the effectiveness of the legislation—that, in future, when governments bring forward legislation like this, they should refer it to this committee: a bipartisan committee. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Report 69 contains the findings and recommendations of the committee’s review of two treaty actions tabled in parliament on 13 September and 11 October 2005. The treaty actions relate to the maintenance of the moratorium on commercial whaling and to measures to protect children from commercial sexual exploitation. The amendments to the schedule to the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling will maintain the moratorium on commercial whaling, which commenced in 1982, for an additional year. The International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling establishes an international system for the regulation of whale fisheries to ensure proper and effective conservation and development of whale stocks. Australia has been a signatory to the convention since it came into force in 1948 and, with the closure of the last Australian shore based whaling operation in 1979, remains a strong advocate of whale conservation.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The committee was concerned that under Japan’s latest whaling for scientific research program its next whale harvest from Antarctic waters will be more than double the previous number. The committee was told that the number of minke whales harvested will unfortunately increase from 440 last season to 935 this season. Japan will also harvest another 10 fin whales annually during its two-year program. At the end of its research program, Japan will harvest annually up to 50 fin whales and 50 humpback whales as well as the 935 minke whales. The committee discovered that Australia has developed non-lethal ways to conduct whale research. The committee was told that Japan has rejected the use of such non-lethal methodologies and, despite concerns expressed to it by the International Whaling Commission, has proceeded to commence with its latest whaling program. Australia is continuing to make strong representations both to Japan and within the commission to end whaling.</para>
<para>The second treaty examined by the committee—the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography—is designed to protect children from the worst forms of commercial sexual exploitation. The optional protocol obliges Australia to prohibit the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and any acts which may assist in the sexual exploitation of children. Submissions received by the committee were supportive of the optional protocol, with one submission raising two issues. The first issue raised was whether the definition of ‘sale of children’ in article 2(a) could be misinterpreted to include the legitimate adoption of children. The second issue is whether the optional protocol includes provisions relating to advertising material that depicts or describes a person who is, or who appears to be, under the age of 18 in a sexual context or activity.</para>
<para>In relation to the first issue, the committee found that the definition of ‘sale of children’ under the optional protocol is limited by article 32 of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. This interpretation allows distinction to be made between the sale of children and the legitimate adoption of children, where fees or costs may be incurred. In addition, the optional protocol contains provisions requiring states parties to criminalise the improper inducement of consent for adoption. Legislation between tiers of government differs on the second issue, but generally, under the optional protocol, states parties must take appropriate measures aimed at effectively prohibiting the production and dissemination of material advertising the offences described.</para>
<para>In conclusion, the committee believes it is in Australia’s interest for the treaties considered in report 69 to be ratified. I thank all committee members who contributed to the report, especially the deputy chair, who is in the House today. I would particularly like to thank the secretariat members for their advice and support during our deliberations. I commend the report to the House.</para>

<para>—The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties report 69 contains the review of two proposed treaty actions. I will comment on both the treaties contained in the committee’s report. The amendments to the schedule to the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling come before the committee each year and extend the moratorium on commercial whaling for an additional year. The committee received evidence about Japan’s latest Antarctic research program. The chair has already mentioned the increased number of whales that will be harvested under that arrangement, about which we were very disappointed. We also believe there are other methods. In fact, the committee were informed that Australia has developed non-lethal ways of conducting whale research and has also been active within the International Whaling Commission to compel Japan to desist from whaling for scientific research purposes.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The second treaty action reviewed by the committee is the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. The optional protocol would protect children from commercial sexual exploitation and supplements the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Australia is already a contracting party. Not only does the optional protocol require Australia to prohibit the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography; it also prohibits supplementary acts which might aid or assist these areas. These include offering, delivering or accepting a child for the purposes of sexual exploitation, the transfer of organs for profit or the engagement of the child in forced labour; improperly inducing consent, as an intermediary, for the adoption of a child in violation of applicable legal instruments on adoption; offering, obtaining or procuring a child for prostitution; and producing, distributing, disseminating, importing, exporting, offering, selling or possessing child pornography. Finally, the optional protocol requires states parties to cooperate to prevent, detect, investigate, punish or prosecute acts of child prostitution, child pornography or the sale of children.</para>
<para>I would also like to thank the acting chair, who has been looking after the committee while the chair has been away in the UN. She has done an admirable job in some adverse circumstances on occasions—often created by us. I would also like to commend the work of the secretariat and thank them for the work they have done during the year. We are tabling another report tomorrow, but unfortunately I will not be present. The secretariat have done a fantastic job, as I believe the committee has. I would like to wish the secretariat staff and their families all the best for the festive season and for next year.</para>

<para>—Today I introduce the <inline ref="R2474">Crimes Act Amendment (Incitement to Violence) Bill 2005</inline>, which would provide new offences in the Crimes Act for threats and incitement to violence on racial and religious grounds. Labor have supported laws like these for a long time and we think that in a multicultural and multi-religious society we can have no tolerance for those who preach violence on the basis of race, religion, ethnicity, colour or nationality. Every government has a basic responsibility to protect citizens from violence and the fear of violence.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Lately we have been most concerned about protecting the whole community from terrorism but we should also be concerned about racist thugs who terrorise minority communities. Indeed, there is a link between the two. Heaven forbid that there should ever be a terrorist attack on Australian soil, but if there were, we would need to make sure that thugs and bullies did not use it as an opportunity to whip up hostility against scapegoat groups from a particular religion or racial background—or any other reason they had for singling them out.</para>
<para>The laws that we propose would act against all those who make threats and incite violence on racial and religious grounds. It would give our authorities the power to act against jihadists preaching terrorism but also against neo-Nazis terrorising Jews or others terrorising Muslims or ethnic communities—along with many other examples.</para>
<para>Every time we have proposed laws of this sort in the past they have been opposed by the Liberal and National parties. In the past John Howard has always argued that these laws impede free speech. Labor does support free speech, but the right to free speech is not absolute. Free speech should not permit people to cross the line and whip up or incite violence against others.</para>
<para>After years of opposition to the idea, in the last few months the Howard government has swung to the other extreme. It now proposes tough new sedition laws that are so badly designed and drafted that they will cast the net too wide—possibly catching journalists, artists and peaceful protesters—with the effect of chilling national debate. The problem is that the government is using a 16th century law for the 21st century challenge of terrorism. Not surprisingly it is ill-suited to maintaining multicultural harmony and controlling violent material on the internet. This result is a clumsy and unfocused law.</para>
<para>The bill I propose is designed for a particular purpose. The link to violence gives Labor’s proposal precision by focusing exactly on the type of conduct to be prohibited. Under our plan there is no way anyone could be prosecuted for mere criticism, evangelism, mockery or satire. To get in trouble you would have to go that extra step—actually making threats or calling on others to commit acts of violence motivated by religion or race. The focus is on catching the promoters of violence before their followers actually commit violent acts. This is a current gap in our law.</para>
<para>The Howard government sedition provisions do provide a crime of encouraging violence between groups but it will only be activated when the urgings of violence between groups also threatens the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth. So the big gap is that the government’s planned law will not be effective against localised neighbourhood thugs even though they can cause just as much fear and risk to the community. The sedition provisions also imply that the offence will apply to minorities that urge violence against majority groups but not necessarily the other way around—another odious weakness.</para>
<para>On the whole, Australia has avoided problems on the scale that we have seen overseas. All around the world we have seen examples of conflicts between ethnic and religious groups. The success in Australia of avoiding these problems is the result of a more open and active approach that we have taken to multiculturalism. We have encouraged ethnic communities to maintain cultural practices and we have celebrated the diversity that results. But we have also made efforts to make sure that immigrants and their children learn Australian values and have opportunities to participate in the economic and cultural life of the nation.</para>
<para>The Australian experience has not been perfect. We have problems to iron out, for sure. But on the whole we have created a multicultural miracle—not through luck but through effort. The next step in that effort is to have laws that stop incitement to racial or religious violence. These might help us to protect the community before harm is caused and underwrite the harmony our nation is fortunate to take for granted.</para>
<para>If we are to limit free speech in any way, the laws must be drafted carefully and in a considered and targeted way. We do want to catch the violent cheerleaders who urge followers to terrible acts against the community but we do not want to prevent others simply from speaking their minds. This bill seeks to achieve both those ends. I commend it to the House and present a signed copy of the explanatory memorandum.</para>

<para>—The people of my electorate believe in the dignity of work. They also believe in a fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work. They are certainly very concerned about the government’s extreme industrial relations legislation.

This brings the total of concerned people signing petitions in the electorate of Chifley to 5,692. Their dearest wish is that this legislation be killed.</para>

<para>—I rise today to make special mention of two successful local business owners in Bayside of my electorate who have very recently offered a positive solution to the new Welfare to Work requirement that encourages single parents whose youngest child is eight to re-enter the work force. Bayside Family Day Care manager, Linda Harnett, and Wynnum Family Day Care manager, Cathy Bavage, are offering to train parents so they have skills to run their own home day care businesses. Through operating their own businesses in the home, parents could fulfil their 15 hour a week work requirement whilst still being able to spend quality time with their children. This is a realistic and viable option.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I realise that there is some angst in the community at present about this government’s Welfare to Work policies and that this issue, alongside workplace relations reform, has been a subject of debate within the Bonner electorate. Subsequently, I find it refreshing to note the enthusiasm with which Ms Harnett and Ms Bavage have encouraged single parents in the local community to consider a career in family day care. In doing so, single parents can ultimately determine their own working hours, receive the personalised support and training that is unique to the industry and maintain a family-oriented lifestyle that meets the new Welfare to Work requirements. Family day care is a scheme that I believe should be more widely embraced by parents and families. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I am rising today because the girls of St Scholastica’s College in Glebe in my electorate have brought me this wonderful banner, which they have signed. I will not spread it out in here, Mr Speaker, but I have been given leave to table it and I hope you do not mind. It has on it ‘Make Poverty History’. Make Poverty History has been a fantastic campaign this year and a very important one. Thirty thousand children die every day due to extreme poverty. We have done an excellent job in getting this issue onto the agenda internationally, but much more needs to be done. On 13 December, World Trade Organisation talks begin in Hong Kong and it will be very important to make sure that those talks address the issue of trade justice for the world’s poorest people. We need more and better aid, and we need to drop the debt. In July this year the G8 made some significant commitments on debt and aid, and there were further commitments made by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in September. But there is still a long way to go to ensure that the world’s poorest people, mostly living on below a dollar a day, are able to lift themselves and their families out of poverty and have a decent standard of living. With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will table this banner from the girls of St Scholastica’s.</para>

<para>—Last Thursday night I attended the Prime Minister’s New South Wales and national Employer of the Year Awards. It was tremendously encouraging to see during the evening the number of employers from around the country who are providing valuable employment opportunities for young people with disabilities and giving them a real chance to stand on their own two feet. I was particularly encouraged because one of my local employers won both the New South Wales category and the national category for medium sized business of the year. My sincere congratulations go to Blaxland Super IGA for their work in providing employment opportunities for people with disabilities. My congratulations go to the owner, the manager, Peter Smith, and Work Choices, who provided the connection and support for these people. This store really tries to find the best opportunities for these people, opportunities that will meet their abilities, provide them with a chance to gain valuable work experience, to interact with other employees and to develop pride in their own ability. Employment like this gives these people and their employers a chance to focus not on their disabilities but on their abilities. These employees all have something valuable to contribute to the workplace. Blaxland Super IGA, as well as many other employers around the country, is doing a tremendous job in providing valuable employment opportunities for these people.</para>

<para>—On Friday a group of workers got together in my electorate to establish a public appeal to support a local family in need. At the Multiplex site in Parramatta, the CFMEU launched a public appeal to help the family of Lauren Huxley with the assistance of Unions New South Wales and Parramatta City Council. Lauren was the subject of a horrible crime that shocked our local community. This young woman was attacked and left for dead in her Northmead home. She has since undergone more than 10 hours of facial reconstruction and neurosurgery. Recent reports are cautiously optimistic.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Lauren’s mum and dad are members of the FSU and CFMEU respectively. Her father, Phil, a carpenter by trade, did his apprenticeship in Granville and has worked on some of the biggest sites in Sydney. He has been a big supporter of workers’ causes and not so long ago was out supporting Marlene Shaw and her two teenage daughters after Marlene’s husband was killed during the construction of the cross-city tunnel. Unfortunately, Phil’s family is now in trouble but his fellow workmates have gathered around to help. The Huxley family home was burnt as part of the malicious attack and the family have had the overwhelming task of staying strong for Lauren. Neither parent is working; both are living in a one-bedroom flat. Both parents are off work as they provide 24-hour comfort and support for their daughter. The money raised will help the family financially so they can give their daughter all the attention and care she needs. Multiplex management and workers joined to launch the campaign, and approximately $20,000 was raised in the first 48 hours of the appeal. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Like the Chief Government Whip, I wish to acknowledge the 2005 Prime Minister’s employer awards that were held in the Great Hall on Thursday. I particularly congratulate Avia Produce, tomato growers in Torquay in the heartland of Corangamite, on their win in the small business section. Proprietors Andy and Porta Kakouros run this enterprise and have provided 30 opportunities for workers with disabilities. They have been genuinely committed to the concept of looking after those people who have not got their full capacities but can enjoy full-time work. They justly won the prize here in Canberra against all other competitors. I also acknowledge the contribution of St Laurence, through their ability to coordinate the program, and that of Colin Entwistle and Michele Marcu, who were here on Thursday night to celebrate this great win for Corangamite. I congratulate the minister on a wonderful evening. Some of the speeches and reports were heart-rending as to the ability of small business, medium sized business and big business to provide opportunities for people with a wide range of disabilities so that they can join the work force and make a meaningful contribution to the profitability of these enterprises and, more importantly, make a contribution to their own esteem. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>We are living in a time when half the world’s population lives on less than $US2 a day, when one woman dies every minute as a result of problems with pregnancy or childbirth—of these, 99 per cent are in developing countries—and when one child dies every 15 seconds from water related diseases. The petition that will be tabled later in the week is a great example of local churches acting locally but thinking globally. Although many of the signatories to this petition may never meet those they seek to help, they do not choose to see them as strangers but rather as their neighbours. This is an integral part of the Christian ethic, an ethic which has long had a strong tradition in Ballarat.</para>
<para>While I welcome the government’s recent decision to increase Australia’s level of development assistance from the embarrassingly low levels to which it had fallen, more needs to be done. Labor has a longstanding commitment to the internationally agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income as our long-term objective for development assistance. When you think what could be achieved if we worked as one, we have little choice but to do everything that can be reasonably expected to make sure the goals laid down are reached. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I rise to speak on a function that I attended in my electorate over the weekend. It was organised in conjunction with Leigh Thornton, who is the school chaplain at Golden Grove High School, as well as the Pedare Uniting Church. The function was a skate competition presented by ARKAID, an organisation which has been established in my electorate to assist at-risk kids. The day was attended by hundreds of young people, as well as their parents, who came along to support ARKAID. I want to pay particular tribute to some of the sponsors who were there for the day—people from the local Dial-A-Digger were out in force, as was the Daily Grind, which is based in Tea Tree Gully.</para>

He did a fantastic job, along with some of his other friends, including Andy Dunt from Ingle Farm Uniting Church— <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Last week saw the release of the latest current account figures. And what a frightening picture that was. The current account deficit is now $13½ billion and rose by 13 per cent in the September quarter—all this at a time when the world is paying more for Australia’s exports than at any time in our past. If we cannot turn in a decent trade result when the world economy is booming and when the Chinese expansion means our raw materials are in huge demand, when can we? Australia had a current account crisis in the mid-1980s, but at that stage the world was not willing to pay a premium for Australia’s exports. In 1986 our terms of trade were at a low point. If Australia had the terms of trade today that we had in 1986, our current account deficit would be 12 per cent of GDP. That would not be a crisis; it would be a catastrophe.</para>

<para class="block">Mr Bassanese also pointed out that, if our export performance over the next 10 years matches the performance over the last 10 years, Australia’s current account deficit will be 10 per cent of GDP by 2015. It is time for the government to drop their ideological obsession with driving down wages and take practical measures to increase research and development, improve our skills base and drive up exports so that the account difficulties we currently face do not get even worse in the future.</para>

<para>—On Friday I and the member for Jagajaga attended one of the most emotionally moving services I have ever been to, at St Ignatius Church to mark the passing of Van Nguyen. Twenty-five bells rang out to signal the 25 years of his ever so short life. I attempted to visit Kim Nguyen on Sunday. Sadly, I think the press camping out the front of her home had scared her away. Like so many others, I left a floral tribute on the doorstep to express my concern for the loss of her son and to say that for us it may have passed but for Kim and her family the loss of Van through this tragic process will never be forgotten. I have passed on that I, in my capacity as her local member, and the community will not forget her. I look forward to helping through this terrible time—and for all of us to work on this campaign to end the death penalty wherever it may occur.</para>

That structure would take the form of a giant ostrich with its head in the sand and it would be called the ‘Nimby’, because that sums up the members contribution to public debate of late, particularly in relation to the proposed Westgate development project in my electorate of Oxley.

</talk.start>
<motion>
<para>That the House expresses its deep regret at the death on 3 December 2005, of the Honourable Peter Francis Salmon Cook, former Federal Minister and Senator for the State of Western Australia, and places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service,  and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</para>
</motion>
<para class="block">The House will be aware that Peter Cook was a former Labor Party senator from Western Australia and senator for that state from 1983 until the election last year. His term ended on 30 June 2005. He was a senior minister in the Hawke and Keating governments and he was a person who, by any measure, had given very long and conspicuous service to the trade union movement in Australia and also to the Labor Party.</para>
<para>I rise on behalf of the government to express to his widow, Barbara, to his four children and to his extended family my sympathy and that of my wife and of all members of the government. He was a true believer in the principles of the Australian trade union movement and he was a very loyal and faithful servant of the Australian Labor Party. No doubt there are a number opposite, particularly the Leader of the Opposition, who can speak more directly, more personally and therefore more eloquently than I can of his contribution, but I did have the opportunity, when I was shadow minister for industrial relations in the early nineties, to see a lot of him and to understand the strength of his trade union beliefs, to respect them—although to disagree with some of them, not all of them, very strongly—and to appreciate the contribution and the passion that he brought to his membership of the trade union movement. He was Secretary of the Western Australian Trades and Labour Council. He rose to become the Vice-President of the ACTU. I was reminded in a brief conversation I had with the member for Hotham over the weekend that they were, at one time, trade union rivals, but in the fullness of time, as so often happens in this place, as fellow members of a government they became good friends.</para>
<para>He was born on 8 November 1943 in Melbourne, Victoria. He left school at the age of 15 and began his working life training to be a fitter and turner. One of his first jobs was as a clerk at an abattoir when he joined the South Australian branch of the Federated Clerks Union. Somebody opposite will explain to me the interrelationship of the South Australian branch of the Federated Clerks Union with his subsequent membership of other sections of the trade union movement. He then moved to Western Australia to further his career in the union movement. He rose through the ranks to become the Secretary of the Trades and Labour Council in 1975 and became a member of the ACTU executive. He served as vice-president until 1981 and he entered the Senate in 1983.</para>
<para>He held three very important portfolios. I have already mentioned his time as Minister for Industrial Relations but he also held the resources portfolio and subsequently, after the re-election of the Keating government in 1993, he became Minister for Trade, where he negotiated with great credit on behalf of Australia and other members of the Cairns Group of countries in the current Uruguay Round. He is widely credited by people in trade circles and generally for the contribution that he made in those negotiations. He was a strong advocate for freer trade policies and for tariff reductions. May I say, in relation to the latter, that was greatly to his credit, given the obvious sensitivity of tariff reductions to many sections of the Australian trade union movement.</para>
<para>In November 2003 he failed to win preselection for what would be regarded as a winnable position on the ALP’s Western Australian Senate ticket. He was diagnosed with a form of cancer somewhat more than a year ago, and I remember getting in touch with him just before the last election to convey my good wishes for the struggle that lay ahead. In the year or more that has gone by since then he has impressed his family and his friends with the extraordinary courage, commitment, resilience and guts that he has displayed in fighting the secondary cancers that have appeared over the past months.</para>
<para>He took all sorts of treatments and he undertook extensive research into the treatments available. In his remarks to the Senate when the report of the Senate Community Affairs Committee was tabled on 23 June—that was a committee dealing with treatment options for people living with cancer—he said that the report looked at:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... the experience of cancer patients who have survived what many call their ‘cancer journey’—from the impact at the time of diagnosis through sometimes lengthy cycles of treatment.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He went on to say that he expressed the hope that the report would:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... help people who are currently being treated and significantly improve the outlook for those who are diagnosed in the future.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It is important on occasions such as this when somebody dies tragically early—a victim of a disease which has threatened and claimed the lives of so many people, so many millions of Australians over the years—to pause, importantly across the political divide, to express respect for somebody who fought according to his principles and who acted on his beliefs. If you look at Peter Cook’s life, it is a model of commitment to the trade union movement and to the Australian Labor Party. I can unconditionally express my respect for the contribution that he made to the Australian trade union movement and to the Australian Labor Party. He was a forthright advocate of their values and their principles. He never wavered and he never compromised on those.</para>
<para>He came into this parliament with a commitment, as the overwhelming majority of members on both sides of parliament do. For all the cynicism that is hurled at parliamentary and public life, it is important that on occasions such as this, as on other occasions, we reaffirm the value of public service and we record our gratitude to somebody who, according to his principles and beliefs, contributed much to this country. To be elected to this parliament is in itself an extraordinary honour; few people have achieved that honour since Federation. To become a senior member of a government is a very special honour. To achieve policy change through those ministries is yet an additional honour and to be remembered and regarded highly by people and colleagues on both sides of the parliament is a mark of a life in public service well and truly lived and properly accomplished.</para>
<para>On behalf of my colleagues, I extend again my sadness at his death. I did make, through the member for Hotham, and I thank him for his courtesy and facilitation in relation to this, the offer on behalf of the government of a state funeral and that offer has been accepted by his wife and family. Again, on behalf of my colleagues, I express my condolences and sympathies to his wife, Barbara, and members of his family.</para>

<para>—I second the motion and support the Prime Minister’s remarks. I thank the Prime Minister for those remarks. There were heartfelt and will be a source of great comfort, I know, to Peter’s family in the week that now confronts them prior to his burial. Peter Cook was many things. He was a hardworking and effective senior minister in the Hawke and Keating governments. He was a stalwart of the labour movement, a senior figure in the industrial wing and, to many who will miss him, a deeply loyal friend. He was more than that. He was a considered man. He was a person of powerful but ordered passion. He was a person who could think through issues at their very roots and determine a policy line free of prejudice. He had profound convictions but he was a man remarkably free of prejudice.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>He remade himself in many ways in each of a series of careers. In each career he has pursued he has exposed a little more of himself to the public to emerge at the conclusion of his political career as one of the most significant politicians that the Australian Labor Party has provided in federal politics in the very long history of our organisation. He started, of course, in his political life as a labour leader, a union leader. As the longstanding Secretary of the Western Australian Trades and Labour Council, he pursued his union career in what is probably the toughest industrial environment in the country. Western Australia is a very difficult area to unionise. Whilst he was leader of the trade union movement in Western Australia and Secretary of the Trades and Labour Council, fierce battles were being fought over the unionisation of the work force and the mines in the north of the country. There was a struggle with the Court government which, from time to time, would introduce legislation affecting freedom of assembly issues. There was a whole range of concerns that made it very difficult for a labour leader of his time. It is also not easy to get recognition in the national movement as a labour leader from Western Australia. The fact that he was an elected Vice-President of the ACTU shows that his union colleagues around the country recognised the qualities of the man and the capacity that he had to contribute to a wider Australian view of the issues that the labour movement had to confront.</para>
<para>He remade himself too in other ways whilst he was a trade union leader. He was the son of a waterside worker; he was a fitter and turner by trade. When he assumed the role that he ultimately did in the union movement, when he shifted from South Australia where he had been involved with the Federated Clerks Union to being an organiser for the Building Workers Industrial Union—a predecessor of the CFMEU—in Western Australia, he realised that he needed to advance his knowledge to be more broadly effective in his representation. At that point, he chose to study for an economics degree. There is certainly no doubt at all that, when he subsequently pursued a parliamentary career, the value of those studies was made evident to all. To answer the Prime Minister’s question briefly as to how somebody could move from the South Australian Federated Clerks Union to the BWIU, it was the Left. The Federated Clerks were controlled by the Left in South Australia, which is why he was able to move across.</para>

<para>—It was, yes. I digress and I do not want to. He then entered parliament in the 1980s. He entered the ministry first outside the cabinet and then in 1990 he entered cabinet as the Minister for Industrial Relations. It was in this crucial portfolio that he demonstrated that fair and just reforms are best achieved through cooperation and inclusion. He was responsible for what has arguably been the most significant change in the Australian workplace in the last 30 years—the formal acceptance of enterprise bargaining by the Industrial Relations Commission in 1991. It was not easy, but his success was a credit to his energy, determination and ability and a credit to the trade union movement, which recognised that reform was essential to remake the Australian economy and underpin prosperity for all the Australian people.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>So we in the Labor Party honour his memory today and vow to hold fast to the ideals of justice that guided his life. From his early days as a tradesman and union official and right through his distinguished career as a minister and a member of the Senate, he held fast to those convictions. His memory will be an inspiration to us as we will fight, in his name, the industrial relations changes which have come about in the last week. I know that one of the things he would most profoundly have regretted is that he would not be on deck over the next couple of years to find himself engaged in that battle.</para>
<para>Whilst Peter was a union official, he remade himself as a public figure. He was an extraordinarily effective minister. Over the last few years I have been conscious of the repeated gatherings, for the purpose of reminiscing, of the Cook office. The tens of people who worked with him have maintained relationships with him, though they are now in business, the legal profession and the Public Service. They have frequently gathered together to remember the achievements they had when they were members of Peter Cook’s staff. It speaks enormously well of his organisational capacities that he was able to do that.</para>
<para>But, while public servants, members of the legal profession and those who succeed in business like to have a friendly personality—a cheerful and kindly fellow—to do business with, they do not have that level of respect unless they respect a man’s intellect and his capacity to turn his convictions into sound and effective policy. Peter Cook got that respect because he was a man of considerable breadth, precision and depth in his thinking about the various portfolios he held. As Minister for Resources from 1988 to 1990, he was involved in resolving the Gove alumina dispute and presenting the Energy 2000 policy paper. As Minister for Trade, he chaired the Cairns Group and finalised the Uruguay Round of negotiations. I have already referred to his achievements as Minister for Industrial Relations. He subsequently took on the Industry, Science and Technology portfolio and recognised that, to become a clever country, we needed to go through substantial renewal in industry. He recognised that we needed to make the manufacturing industry in particular a more export oriented entity if we were to succeed and prosper in the years ahead in the world in which we operated.</para>
<para>Despite his background, he fully comprehended the changing terms and conditions of Australian success on a global scale that have been evident to us for the last 20 years but which have been so hard for governments to adjust to over those years. He was one of the leaders of thinking in the Labor Party and the labour movement about the need to change in order to make Australia an effective and competitive country. In opposition, he was on our frontbench and, for a time, on our backbench. His qualities as a parliamentarian showed through in his effectiveness as chairman of a series of very significant Senate committees. As I recollect, the penultimate committee he chaired was the Senate Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America and that made a very significant contribution to my party’s determination ultimately to support that treaty. We looked to Peter for a lead on that. We are not naturally inclined towards bilateral agreements as foremost among the means by which trade agreements ought to be settled, and we required Peter’s advice before moving on that matter.</para>
<para>He was Chair of the Senate Select Committee on A Certain Maritime Incident, the ‘children overboard’ committee, and his last committee involvement was with the Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiry into services and treatment options for persons diagnosed with cancer. Unfortunately, because of his own experience he was a standing witness on that committee. He was the person you could talk to: ‘What are you doing? What are you going through? How are the services affecting you?’ You could devise a whole committee report out of his experiences. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">… in my experience people diagnosed with cancer often have to make life affecting decisions at short notice, in a traumatised state of mind with very little information about the range of options available to them.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He also said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Cancer patients should not be left to the luck of the draw or to serendipity in order to have their disease treated in the most effective way.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He did not rely on serendipity himself. When he was diagnosed, he coolly and rationally examined his situation and his options. He decided to fight that disease, that affliction, as hard as anything else he had fought in his life. In the end, it was one of the few battles he did not win.</para>
<para>Many of us on this side of the House recently had the opportunity to visit him in hospital in Sydney where his wife, Barbara, set up a watch at his bedside for month after month. All of us were impressed by his stoicism, his optimism, his care for all the things that we were doing and his fascination for every aspect of politics and public affairs. He was fascinated by the West Coast Eagles prospects for victory in the AFL Grand Final, which were so thoroughly dashed. His room had a life outside itself. It was not an insular sick room; it was a focal point in the hospital for public affairs.</para>
<para>But the focal point of that room, as much as Peter himself, was his wife, Barbara. I have never seen a person devote themselves to another person so intensely, with such forbearance, such unselfishness and such capacity to free herself from exhaustion while going through the most exhausting routine in looking after her husband. He finally came home in the desperate hope that this December he would spend at sea, because he developed during his parliamentary years a fascination with the sea and acquired several boats. He did not do so. He did not get back to his boat, but I am sure his spirit is there now. The thoughts of all members of my party and the labour movement will be with Barbara and his four children at this time.</para>

I do that on a number of bases. Obviously Peter and I shared a passion for what we engage in professionally, and that is not just politics but our pursuit of a better set of circumstances as far as the global trading regime is concerned. Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the great contribution that Peter Cook made in that regard in terms of initially building the case and the argument within the Labor Party that this was absolutely necessary and right for Australia, for the future of the country and the place it needs to take in the global economy in the future. He did that extremely well.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Secondly, there was a strange circumstance only four weeks ago. Members would be aware that I was hit with the news that I also had been affected by a melanoma type cancer, and very quickly I was advised by my medical practitioners to go and get it seen to. I did that in the Mater Hospital in Sydney four weeks ago. Having had the operation in the morning I was, at about lunchtime, very groggily coming out of the anaesthetic and who should appear at my door but Peter Cook in his wheelchair, being pushed by Barbara. It was a fantastic gesture. I had already built quite a warm and strong professional relationship with Peter as my opposite number in my earlier days as Minister for Trade, back when we both travelled to the WTO meeting in Seattle in 1999 and then Senator Cook was part of the official Australian delegation. But I must admit it was moving that, in the condition he was in, he took the time to come around and see how I was, just having had an operation. I know that others in this place have been affected in the same way, but I share the concerns that he expressed through the committee work that he did on this issue in the Senate. I certainly look forward to working with the Minister for Health and Ageing and within the government in responding to the recommendations of the committee report. It is a very frightening prospect to be confronted with one’s own mortality and realise that you are not bulletproof. You get to an age—you go through your life thinking that nothing can happen to you and then something does, and it causes you to reflect.</para>
<para>I am aware of how hard and in a very focused way Peter Cook fought the disease that he had for a long time. It obviously sapped a lot of energy from him but he kept on going. That was a reflection of how he undertook his professional life as a very senior minister in what was a very long term Labor government under prime ministers Hawke and Keating. To have had the ability to serve in the diverse range of portfolios that he did—industrial relations, resources, industry and trade—certainly stands as testimony to his ability and his intellect. That was certainly very apparent to all of us who had the opportunity of working with him.</para>
<para>During the Uruguay Round of negotiations he established a position for Australia—a platform, if you like—from where we have been able to take Australia forward as a key player in this global regime of the international rules based system of global trade. Notwithstanding the fact that we are a country of only 20 million people and about the 13th largest economy, going forward from those days we have been able to establish that. Ironically, the news of Peter’s passing came to me when I was sitting in a meeting in Geneva on Saturday with a number of ministerial colleagues in preparation for the next round of negotiations in Hong Kong in a week’s time. We reflected on the great contribution that Peter Cook made in establishing that, in concluding the Uruguay Round that went on for far too long and in delivering Australia into a circumstance where we have collectively been able to take ourselves forward in terms of influence and prominence in the global trading regime and in terms of the counsel, I suppose, that is sought from Australia on these matters.</para>
<para>I know that Peter felt very strongly about not just the benefits to Australia from trade liberalisation but what it meant for the poverty-stricken countries and people of the world in terms of opening up markets and giving them opportunities. Of course, there is the complexity of the system. I understand that he authored a book to give guidance to many of those developing countries so that they could better understand how they could exercise their rights within the organisation. Certainly his contribution to the global trading regime and the rules based system is a legacy not just to Australia but also to the organisation itself, and that certainly will be well and truly remembered. I should also make comment on the fact that Peter was, during the time of the debate in this place, after we had negotiated the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement—although he may not have agreed with every aspect of what we had negotiated—supportive of the fact that it was an important pillar in our economic relationship with the United States. I understand that he argued that within the councils of the Labor Party at the time, and we certainly appreciated that.</para>
<para>So I add my condolences and sympathies and those of my wife, Wendy, and express them to Barbara and family. It is a sad loss to Australia, but we should also recognise the great contribution that Peter Cook made in a personal and professional way to Australia, particularly in this latter period in his life when he did not just cave in and give up to the disease that afflicted him but went on to try to put down a bit of a platform for broadening our thinking on how we should help people to manage their lives when confronted with cancer. As I say, I certainly look forward to continuing that legacy and intend to work with the health minister in the government’s response to that report.</para>

</talker>
<para>—It is with great sadness that I join with the other speakers in this condolence motion for Peter Cook. He was not only a terrific friend; he was a wonderful human being and pre-eminent of Australian politicians. He believed in and practised the values that a number of us believe are important: integrity, loyalty, determination and courage. Peter was of humble background. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, he was the son of a waterside worker. He was born in Melbourne, he grew up in Adelaide and he pursued his career in Perth. His all too short 62 years were dominated, essentially, by one third or more of his life in the Australian Senate—eight of them as a minister and four of them as Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. He held the role of Minister for Resources, Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. He had many roles but, as other speakers have said already today, his crowning achievement—and he held it as the most important achievement in his career—was in 1993, when as Minister for Trade he saw home the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. He counted that as his proudest moment and I think that demonstrates the true patriot that Peter was. In front of the Australian flag he delivered that outcome not only for this nation but for global trade as a whole.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>He was able to deliver this outcome because he applied the formidable skills that he learnt as a trade union official—the skills of thinking strategically. Peter was a great lateral thinker. When you came in with the options he was always the person with another option. He thought creatively and instinctively about where the other argument would come from. He was also a great negotiator. I was reminded recently of someone who had been on the other side of the negotiation table from Peter and they said that he was a fantastic negotiator but you never came away feeling that you were dudded when he was in the room. He always understood the importance of giving dignity and something of a win to the other side. He was also capable, most effectively, of articulating the importance of openness in trade not just within the Australian Labor Party but to the nation as a whole. It was not just the trade union movement that had its reservations then, nor is it the only group that has them now. Peter understood the importance of us as a nation, if we were to go forward, engaging with the rest of the world. He never deviated from that position, despite the fact that from time to time there was pressure, not just within our party but within the community, to change it. He built great relationships and great respect through those trade talks. As the Minister for Trade has indicated, he was commissioned by the World Trade Organisation to write a book—essentially a training manual for the raft of new countries joining the WTO and an explanation to them of the role of the WTO.</para>
<para>He was industrial relations minister at a crucial period, seeing the emerging implementation of the accord. This was the movement to enterprise bargaining which commenced in 1987—the breaking down of centralised wage fixing. He realised that it was important, through government programs and policy, to build incentive into the system. He developed a best-practice program to encourage growth in manufacturing output as well as cooperative approaches in the workplace to achieve it. It was a shared approach to productivity. He understood the importance of building incentive into it. I join with the Leader of the Opposition in the hope that as we reflect upon his legacy in the years to come—when this new, emerging industrial relations system takes place—people do not forget what was achieved and where the big step-up in productivity occurred in this country.</para>
<para>He was proud of his roots—he always was; many of us on this side are—but Peter never lost focus on the policy outcome. He wanted to leave this a better place and indeed he did. He believed in the nobleness of the cause that is politics. It was not just in government that he left a legacy. His role in opposition—in strategising, planning and prosecuting—saw him as a politician second to none. Those who doubt it should have a look at the way he prosecuted the GST inquiry—and just be sorry he is not around today to do it in terms of industrial relations. There was also his approach to what was called a ‘certain maritime incident’—the kids overboard issue. Reference has already been made to the free trade agreement discussions, but I think this embodies most of all the courage of this man. It is true he chaired the committee inquiry into the free trade agreement between Australia and the United States; it is true it came at a critical time because the government and the opposition were on the horns of a dilemma as to how to proceed with this. Peter’s wise counsel and direction were critical to our position. But people forget that as chair of that committee he delivered that report by telephone hook-up the day before his first operation. I think that shows enormous courage, dedication and determination. That is, most of all, what he will be remembered for.</para>
<para>Peter did realise the enormity of the battle ahead. He talked to a number of us about it, and many of us were able to give advice to him as to how he might be helped. But that did not stop him—he was not just interested in listening; he wanted to learn. He understood the consequences, but he also wanted to study them, read them assiduously, swap stories, get knowledge and challenge the health providers about what else could be done to heal him. He set goals for himself. He bought an ocean-going yacht. When he told me that he had bought it, I said, ‘That’s good.’ Then he told me that he had bought it in Brisbane. I said, ‘What were you doing buying it in Brisbane?’ He had to get someone to sail it to Perth, which he eventually did.</para>
<para>I remember one day when I rang him that he said: ‘You’ll never believe where I am. I am 10 miles out, off Cape Leeuwin. I’ve just taken charge of this boat and this is the most fantastic feeling that I have experienced in a long time.’ It was a great source of pride to him that he had taken charge of the boat and that he was where he loved to be. It was giving him great inspiration for the fight ahead.</para>
<para>His courage again came to the fore when he realised what he had gone through in trying to understand the problem, where others could go and what that meant. He turned adversity to advantage, not just for himself but for the community at large. He insisted upon the Senate inquiry, whose report later came to be called <inline font-style="italic">The cancer journey: informing choice</inline>, so that his experience could be translated, made simpler and turned to positive policy advantage for the many other victims of cancer. I welcome the preparedness of the Deputy Prime Minister, in particular, and the Minister for Health and Ageing to work on a solution and a response to this, because it is very important today that we not just mourn Peter’s passing but learn from it and build the legacy from it as well.</para>
<para>The report deserves not just a detailed response but an expeditious one—in particular, the recommendation that requires us to establish a new Medicare item so that every cancer patient can have a multidisciplinary plan developed for them is a crucially important thing to do. This was Peter’s lesson; this was his experience, and he was in a very privileged position to push it. We have to ensure that all Australians benefit from this and that doctors and health professionals work together—that we get a team approach. If the government is interested, we have had this policy costed. It does not cost a lot, Treasurer, and I think it would be a worthy response to the circumstances of today.</para>
<para>Finally, I have spoken most of all about Peter’s courage, determination and positive attitude—but Barbara’s, too, was incredible. I have never seen a double act like this. The Leader of the Opposition has talked about Barb at Peter’s bedside in Perth. What people do not understand is that Barb came across with Peter for an operation that was supposed to last less than a week; he was in hospital in Sydney for 16 weeks. Anyone who has had to leave home in the circumstances of not understanding that sort of time frame and live in a hotel near a hospital and be there day in, day out—at the end of the day and at the beginning of the day—and through every operation would understand the fantastic effort on her part. She is so positive and so determined. She did it all with great humour, but with great grace. I think that Peter, his survival, his and her determination and the fact that it did not work in the end showed what Peter was up against. Today we honour a great Australian. He is on his final voyage. We wish him godspeed and fair winds.</para>

<para>—Mr Speaker, could I briefly have the indulgence of the House to mention another sad event. The huge storm in Canberra on Friday tragically claimed the life of Athol Sellars, who had been employed as a contract gardener at the Lodge for a period of over 12 months. He was a delightful man who carried out his duties with great skill and commitment. To his wife, Lorraine, to whom he was married for 40 years, and to their two children, Mark and Margaret, and their grandchildren, I extend the sympathy of myself and my wife, Janette, and record my appreciation of his wonderful service.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I am aware of reports today concerning the granting of a temporary protection visa to Mr al-Tekriti, who, it is alleged, was a member of Saddam Hussein’s special security service. I am concerned about these reports and I have made some inquiries of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs concerning the background of the case and any further options which may be available and, when I have further advice, I will be very happy to inform the House.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Thus far, these inquiries have revealed that Mr al-Tekriti is an Iraqi citizen who arrived unlawfully by boat on 6 December 1999. He was initially denied a visa by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs in September 2000 on the basis of admissions Mr al-Tekriti made to Immigration officials about his membership of Saddam Hussein’s special security service. Those admissions, I am told, were subsequently denied by Mr al-Tekriti. That decision by the department of immigration to deny Mr al-Tekriti a visa was overturned by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which is the relevant body for reviewing decisions made by DIMIA as to whether an individual should be excluded from protection because of suspected crimes against humanity. Based on Mr al-Tekriti’s evidence to the tribunal, that tribunal found in the following terms:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The applicant—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Mr al-Tekriti—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">at no point in time has held a position within the Iraqi regime which was involved directly or indirectly in any crimes which could in any way be said to be against humanity or non-political, or of any acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The government lodged an appeal against this decision, but later withdrew that appeal following advice received from senior counsel that an appeal of this decision was unlikely to succeed as a question of law. This is an important point. The basis for Mr al-Tekriti’s grant of a visa was a decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal—not the department of immigration—that he could not be denied a protection visa on the grounds the department had sought to refuse him—that is, because, in their view, he was a member of that special security service. The AAT’s finding to the contrary was that at no time did he hold a position within the Iraqi regime which was involved directly or indirectly in any crimes which could in any way be said to be against humanity.</para>
<para>That decision of the AAT has influenced and underwritten subsequent decisions, including the decision to grant him a temporary protection visa on 21 June 2005. As I have indicated, I am seeking some further information and advice from the minister as to whether any options are appropriately available. But let me conclude by saying that, with respect to the critical decision to overturn the department’s refusal of the visa—in other words, the department did not want to give him a visa—Mr al-Tekriti, in exercising his rights, went to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal overturned that decision by the department. I would say to any gathering critics of the government on this issue that they cannot have it both ways: they cannot demand a transparent process when it suits them but, when it does not, criticise that transparent process on political grounds.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I thank the member for Mallee for his question. In answering the question, I would like to take a moment to pay tribute to a family that has made an enormous contribution to Australian agriculture and more recently to the Australian beef industry. I refer to some former constituents of the member for Mallee, Peter and Angela Menegazzo, who were tragically killed in a plane crash last Friday outside of Condobolin. Peter Menegazzo and his family have made a remarkable contribution to agriculture in Australia, particularly in the produce and beef cattle industries. He was the nation’s biggest potato producer and the third largest beef cattle producer in Australia, operating in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. I am sure that everybody in this place expresses their condolences to the family of Peter and Angela. They will be sadly missed. The hard work and success of the Menegazzo family and other rural businesses, and the gutsy way Peter Menegazzo made investments throughout Australia in the rural industries that he engaged in, have been vital to the improved employment opportunities in rural Australia, and it is an absolute tragedy that their lives were cut short.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>But the member for Mallee asked primarily about the Australian beef industry and its contribution to exports. Of course, our beef industry is one of the great success stories of our rural exporting industries, where the beef industry in 2004-05 increased its exports by 24 per cent to a record value of $4.9 billion—almost $5 billion worth of beef products exported out of Australia—with a record one million tonnes exported. Of course, in that year, we set a record in the Japanese market by dominating that market, where almost 90 per cent of all the imported beef in Japan in that year came from Australia. Of course, while we have been in office since 1996, we have continued with our objective of creating and sustaining an economic environment that is conducive to developing and growing these businesses and in particular their competitiveness internationally. We will continue to work with these industries to enhance their opportunities and to ensure that they remain competitive and that they remain productive in the common circumstance.</para>
<para>It is ironic: today is the 20th anniversary of the day when in Darwin in the Northern Territory Justice Morling reconvened the Federal Court in the hearing of the Mudginberri damages case in the beef industry. It was the beginning of a process that ultimately led to the endgame which was to see the full bench of the Federal Court two weeks later find that the Commonwealth has an absolute obligation to supply export inspection services to meat export works which comply with the law. Mr Speaker, you might ask why the Commonwealth would not want to supply export meat inspection services to help exporting industries. That was the case at the time, and that is exactly what the Hawke-Keating government in 1995 had done to prevent a small abattoir from entering into flexible working arrangements and agreeing to end the unit tally system, one of the meat industry’s most appalling work to rule award conditions.</para>
<para>Following the passage of the Work Choices legislation last Friday, that circumstance is a thing of the past. Under Work Choices, employers will immediately gain access to common-law remedies in the courts to deal with unlawful industrial action, and the Australian Industrial Relations Commission will have to determine an application to stop unprotected industrial action within 48 hours. All parties to an industrial dispute are now required to meet acceptable standards of behaviour and must not be able to avoid the rule of law. With this legislation passing at the end of last week, we have ensured Australia will have fair, practical and sensible laws supporting Australian workplaces in the interests of employers and employees. As we have continued to say, this continues our government’s commitment to improve productivity, create more jobs and increase living standards for all Australian families. We have demonstrated that our government is committed to working with the job creators in Australia to create a better economic environment and a better workplace for employees and employers, whilst we continue to see the focus of the Labor Party just to work with the job destroyers in the community.</para>

<para>—My question is to the Treasurer, and it refers to his previous answer. Treasurer, is it the case that Mr Gerard’s business dispute with the tax office was on the public record at the South Australian Supreme Court Registry before Mr Gerard was appointed to the board? Treasurer, does this mean there was no privacy constraint stopping the tax commissioner from discussing the public tax dispute involving Mr Gerard? Given this, did the tax commissioner advise the Treasurer, his office or anyone acting on the Treasurer’s behalf of the tax office’s public dispute with Mr Gerard?</para>

<para>—The tax commissioner did no such thing. As to matters in the South Australian Supreme Court, as I understand the situation, there were matters on the file which were never put to court and, as such, are in fact not on the public record. I would not want to take my chances on the legal question, but that is in fact what I am advised. Seeing as the tax commissioner did not give any advice to the government, nor did Mr Gerard give any advice to the government, now the opposition says, ‘Oh, well, of course, you should have been down at the registries checking through all of the court cases, because everybody knew all about this particular incident.’ Let me say: if everybody knew, why wasn’t it until last week that the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> reported it? If everybody knew, why didn’t the opposition raise it three years ago?</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Mr Rob Gerard has been on the Reserve Bank for three years. Far from everybody knowing over the last three years, it is claimed that nobody knew over the last three years. That is the evidence. I can rest assured that, if somebody had known, the opposition would have raised it a long time before now.</para>

<para>—Can I say that, with continued growth in the Australian economy, unemployment is now at or around its lowest level since 1976 at 5.2 per cent. Since this government was elected, 1.7 million new jobs have been created in Australia. However, there are still 750,000 children living in jobless households. If we want to do something for the children who are living in jobless households, we ought to be focusing on allowing parents who are in jobless households to get into the work force and encouraging them to move from welfare to work. The best kind of help for someone on welfare is to arrange for them to get the opportunity of a job. This is what this government believes in: job opportunities for Australians. That is why this government is reforming the welfare to work system, to give people the opportunity to move from welfare into work.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I am asked a question about family tax benefits. Can I say that per child under 13 years the family tax benefit is $4,200 a year; for a child aged 13 to 15 years it is $5,150 per year. A family with one child between 13 and 15 and two under that age would be receiving in family tax benefits around $17,000 per annum to help with the raising of those children. In addition to that, a single-income family would be entitled to family tax benefit B, which is part of that $17,000, and a low-income family, approximately another $13,000 as parenting payment. That is $17,000 in family tax benefit A and B and, in addition to that, around $13,000 of parenting payment. Let me make this point: that $17,000 of family tax benefit is for the benefit of the children. It is targeted for the benefit of the children: to pay for their education, for their clothing—for the things that they need. We believe that it is families and parents that can look after those children the best. There will be occasions when those in receipt of family tax benefit, for one reason or another, are not able to properly expend it or look after their children. In those circumstances there ought to be an option for a grandparent or other significant other in the family to receive those payments to look after those children.</para>
<para>Noel Pearson, who has been campaigning very strongly on this issue for a very long period of time, has advocated that in Aboriginal communities there be a new opportunity for a responsible adult to receive income on behalf of children. Just recently he said on <inline font-style="italic">PM</inline>:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">And if there’s an irresponsible adult who’s receiving income on behalf of children or on behalf of a disabled person, if that person is irresponsible and is using their income to drink or to gamble, I say the income should be taken off that person’s responsibility and placed into the hands of a more responsible family member or a responsible community agency.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Noel Pearson is probably one of the most serious Indigenous thinkers in Australia today. That is a recommendation that he is making. I believe there is enormous sense in that recommendation, because family tax benefits are for the benefit of children. Overwhelmingly, when they are paid to parents that is for the benefit of children, but in those cases where the parent, for one reason or another, is not looking after the child it stands to reason that in order to help the child there should be alternatives.</para>

The opposition ought to come clean: either they are serious about opposing the use of the word ‘sedition’ as a heading or they are against the measures that deal directly with those who urge force or violence in pursuit of their political objectives. That is what you have to come clean on.

The Australian government’s industrial relations changes have been warmly welcomed by business.

<para>—First of all, can I thank the honourable member for Forrest for his question and for his interest. He will be interested to know that I asked our ambassador accredited to North Korea, Alan Thomas, who is also the resident ambassador in Beijing, to visit Pyongyang, which he did between 29 November and 3 December. This was the first senior official visit from Australia since I myself visited North Korea in August of last year. While he was there the ambassador met with not only ministers and senior officials but non-government organisation representatives as well. The ambassador essentially had two tasks while he was in Pyongyang. The first was to reaffirm to the North Koreans Australia’s view that the six-party talks should not only progress but lead to North Korea abandoning its nuclear weapons program and the second to say that we are deeply concerned about a decision made by the North Korean leadership to eject from North Korea by 31 December humanitarian aid workers and to deny the provision of any humanitarian aid to the people of North Korea.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>On the six-party talks, the North Koreans remained of the opinion that they wanted to keep their nuclear weapons for the time being—and obviously Australia would urge them to commit to abandoning those programs. Also, the North Koreans have made it clear that they have an objection to various financial sanctions that are being put in place to stop illicit trade of one kind or another. Secondly, in terms of the humanitarian aid workers, the North Koreans have made it clear that they wish to see an end to all humanitarian aid by 31 December. NGOs that the ambassador spoke to were very pessimistic about the consequences of this decision. They believe it could have a devastating impact on the people of North Korea, who, despite a reasonably good harvest recently, certainly do not have enough food to provide for the whole of the country, and there is no indication in North Korea that significant economic reform is under way.</para>
<para>I want to make it clear that Australia is one of those countries that provide humanitarian assistance to North Korea. We urge North Korea to change its policy, to allow humanitarian assistance to continue to be provided to the people of that country, who are undergoing enormous hardship as a result of the policies pursued by the leadership in North Korea. I hope that the ambassador’s representations while he is there will have had some impact on the thinking of the leadership of North Korea in terms of abandoning its nuclear program through negotiations in the six-party talks process. I also hope that it will reverse its decision to stop all humanitarian assistance on 31 December.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Deakin for his question as I am always delighted to get a question in this place about industrial relations. I inform the House that at about 6 pm last Friday the Senate passed the government’s Work Choices bill. That decision came after some 22 hours of debate here in the House—more than any other bill since 1996 other than the stem cell legislation—and some 32 hours in the Senate, which is the equivalent of some three whole weeks of Senate legislative business.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>This package of legislation represents the government’s reform agenda since 1996. Indeed, since the 1996 Workplace Relations Act the government has put forward some 58 bills relating to further workplace relations reform. The government has argued for further reform over the last nine years and, indeed, in the last three elections. So nobody in Australia could be in doubt about the government’s intention to further reform workplace relations for the good of Australia.</para>
<para>That, of course, stands in stark contrast to the Australian Labor Party. Most Australians are still unaware of what the Leader of the Opposition and the Australian Labor Party stand for. For example, last week the Australian Labor Party voted against a simpler system of workplace relations. They voted against a single national system of workplace relations. They even voted against improved protections for outworkers in Australia.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. I can inform him that, since the government announced its Tough on Drugs strategy in November 1997, it has committed some $1 billion to drug education, drug rehabilitation and, most importantly, drug law enforcement. The results show that the war on drugs is not doomed to be lost, especially if policy is based on a clear understanding that there is no safe way to use illicit drugs.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Since 1999, heroin deaths have declined by some 300 per cent. The number of Australians who report that they have used illicit drugs has dropped from 22 per cent to 15 per cent since 1998. Since 1998, the number of people who regularly use heroin has dropped by 12,000. The number of people who regularly use marijuana has dropped by 180,000, which is just as well because there is increasing evidence of the clear links between marijuana use and subsequent serious mental illness. A 2002 <inline font-style="italic">British Medical Journal</inline> article found that heavy cannabis use increased the risk of schizophrenia sixfold. In 2001 an <inline font-style="italic">American Journal of Psychiatry</inline> article found that cannabis use increased the risk of depression fourfold. Last year a Sydney university paper found that regular cannabis use was associated with subsequent increases in suicidal behaviour and psychotic illnesses.</para>
<para>I can inform the House that this year the government has spent some $13 million on a campaign against the use of illicit drugs. I would ask the states to be careful lest any moves towards further decriminalisation of marijuana should send precisely the wrong message about something which has the potential to be a very dangerous drug indeed.</para>

The minister would be aware of recent media reports that 10,000 foreign fishing vessels are operating in Australian waters. Is the minister aware that the average Australian fish catch is 276,000 tonnes whilst the average for the United States, with only half our coastline, is 4,263,000 tonnes? In light of this, will the minister release to the House the scientific evidence from GBRMPA and other sources which shows that a reduction of fish stocks in Australian waters justifies this and the previous government’s shutdown of nearly two-thirds of the Australian fishing industry and the destruction of 4,000 jobs? Further and finally, would the minister advise whether Senator Ian Macdonald’s decision to reduce Australia’s fishing fleet from 1,200 boats to 600 boats indicates that the United States is being criminally irresponsible by overfishing or whether Minister Macdonald is a destructive embarrassment to the government?</para>

<para>—I thank the honourable member for his question. The government place the greatest priority and importance on policing our northern waters. To date in 2005, 233 illegal fishing vessels have been seized and the government have invested $180 million to deter illegal fishing in our northern waters. At the same time, we have used a multi-agency approach—the latest example, in October, being Operation Clearwater II, which involved Customs, Coastwatch, AFMA, the Federal Police and state bodies.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The message has been very strong to illegal fishers that they risk severe penalties, including prosecution and the loss of their catch, their fishing equipment and even their vessel. It is a very strong message that we are taking to a number of the Indonesian fishing villages from whence these vessels originate. I would caution the honourable member against using figures of 10,000 or 11,000 sightings of vessels because there are often multiple sightings; there are a number of vessels transiting in Australian waters. That is in no way to diminish the seriousness of the problem or the commitment in energy and resources the government is bringing to solve it.</para>
<para>The member asked me about GBRMPA. My view is that it is largely a scientific organisation. Its data, unless there is some exceptional reason, should be available. Transparency and accountability are required for GBRMPA, as they are for any other government business agency, so I will make inquiries. If there is no reason that that information is not available, it should be.</para>
<para>Turning now to the allegation of the United States overfishing, Senator Ian Macdonald is an outstanding fisheries minister. He is responsible for a $220 million structural adjustment package that has been universally welcomed by the fishing industry far and wide. It has as its centrepiece $150 million for a one-off, capped buy-out focused on reducing excess fishing capacity in those Commonwealth managed fisheries. The member raises a point about internationally managed fisheries that are excluded from the package, so his criticisms of Senator Macdonald are utterly ill conceived with regard to the structural adjustment package and unfair overall.</para>

<para>—I thank the honourable member for Hasluck very much for the question and say how much I appreciate the interest of the member in serious issues. The Iraqis will be going to the polls, as many members on this side know, on 15 December to elect a new national assembly. There are 307 political entities registered for the election, contesting 275 seats. Given that it is a regionally based election, there are 230 seats which are divided amongst 18 governorates in proportion to the numbers registered in each province. So the results are likely to be different—for a number of reasons—from the results of the election which was held back on 30 January, which was a whole-of-nation election.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Honourable members on this side of the House will be pleased to hear that 15½ million Iraqis have registered to vote in these elections. Australia, as I mentioned last week, is providing support for that democratic process, including for out-of-country voting for Iraqis who reside here in Australia. That includes providing an electoral adviser. It is expected that the 11,000 people in Australia who are eligible to vote in Iraq will vote, so the voting here in Australia is not insignificant. There will be new polling centres in Adelaide, Perth and Brisbane in addition to the ones in Sydney and Melbourne which were previously provided. It is another illustration of the very strong commitment the government has to democracy in Iraq and to ensuring that that country is able to achieve, in the long term, a peaceful, democratic and free future. Likewise, we have taken the same view with Afghanistan.</para>
<para>Are there any alternatives? The alternative to the policy that we are pursuing in relation to Iraq is the 31st policy that has been put forward by the Leader of the Opposition. In an interview with Mike Carlton, the interviewer of choice for the Labor Party, the Leader of the Opposition said that the government should withdraw our troops from Iraq—very much a reflection of what his predecessor said. The point is the Labor Party believes that we should have troops in Afghanistan in order to support the evolving democracy in that country—and I agree with that, of course—but the Labor Party does not believe we should keep troops in Iraq to support the emerging democracy and to get the terrorists in that country. If anyone can work out the logic of that—</para>

<para>—Mr Speaker, I have a question to you and it relates to the requirement you placed on the member for Calare on Wednesday, 30 November to withdraw a series of statements he had made about you outside the House by way of press release. As you would recall, and I am not intending to take the House to the detail of it, the member for Calare made an assertion about a procedural matter during the final stages of the <inline ref="R2469">Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005</inline> in this House. In respect of that assertion he was wrong, as we are aware, but I believe that the assertion was made in good faith by the member for Calare.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Mr Speaker, you would be aware that the precedents for requiring a member to apologise for remarks made outside the House about the Speaker or the Speaker’s conduct of parliament are actually very few and far between. In fact, the one relied upon, the one that has stood the test of time, was what was referred to as the Tuckey case of 1987. I do not think it would surprise anybody to learn that it involved the member for O’Connor. As you may be aware, Mr Speaker, his remarks publicly made on that occasion included saying, ‘Speakers who are in control don’t get troubled,’ ‘Yes, I think the Speaker should resign,’ ‘I believe the Speaker was very unfair,’ and, ‘I think the Speaker is now just a political animal and I say she has been intimidated.’ Mr Speaker, I would put to you that the remarks made by the member for O’Connor in 1987 are of a completely different nature to the press release remarks issued by the member for Calare—</para>

<para>—Showing the normal understanding of the procedures of the House, we have the member for O’Connor chiming in. But, Mr Speaker, my submission to you is that the remarks made by him in 1987 are of an entirely different nature to the assertion made by the member for Calare. Mr Speaker, I can understand that, while no-one likes to be criticised, you should err on the basis of allowing the maximum amount of free speech by members of the House when it comes to the conduct of the House. Mr Speaker, in that regard and for some guidance on this matter, can I perhaps somewhat unusually refer you to the opening paragraphs of the speech of the now Prime Minister when the member for O’Connor’s suspension from the House was debated by the House.</para>

First of all, I will give consideration to the point that she has raised, but the response to the member for Calare was very much aligned with the comments he had made in the press release which reflected on the chair—not on the occupant but on the chair itself.

<para class="block">To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament:</para>
<para class="block">The petition of certain undersigned citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the extreme suffering caused to cattle, sheep and goats during their assembly, land transportation and loading in Australia, shipment overseas, and then unloading and local transportation, feed-lotting, handling, and finally slaughter, without pre-stunning in importing countries.</para>
<para class="block">Further we ask the House to note that heat stress, disease, injury, inadequate facilities, inadequate supervision and care and incidents such as on board fires, ventilation breakdowns, storms and rejection of shipments contribute to the high death rates each year, e.g. 73,700 sheep and 2,238 cattle died on board export ships in 2002. During the incident with the <inline font-style="italic">Cormo Express,</inline> nearly 6,000 died. Many thousands more suffer cruel practices prior to scheduled slaughter.</para>

</motion>
<para class="block">The cost of petrol is hurting families and businesses in regional areas across Australia, and my electorate of Richmond is no exception. Locals are telling me loud and clear that they are doing it tough and they are sick and tired of this government doing nothing about the massive increases in petrol prices. Businesses are finding it harder and harder to keep in the black because their stock prices, delivery costs, running costs and production costs have gone up—all flowing on from the huge rises in petrol prices. To add to this, soaring petrol prices are having a huge impact on our lucrative domestic tourism industry as families realise it is just too expensive to get on the road for their holidays.</para>
<para>The Northern Rivers region, which includes my electorate of Richmond, is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Australia. Consequently, tourism is one of our most important industries and many local businesses depend either directly or indirectly on the tourist dollar for their survival. For local families, the cost of living—or simply surviving—is going up and up all the time. Health care, food and housing prices have all risen, and petrol prices have skyrocketed to over $1.20 a litre in parts of my electorate. The Howard government tells us that petrol prices are solely dependent on world prices and that nothing can be done. This is not much comfort to the mums and dads in my electorate who are breaking the family budget at the bowser every week. The government is just plain wrong. Global prices are not the only factor impacting on petrol prices.</para>
<para>We all saw the press reports last week on petrol price gouging and Caltex’s staggering profits. An article in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> on 29 November 2005 entitled ‘Petrol giant’s $70 million rip-off’ said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Spiralling profits at Australia’s biggest oil refiner have at last revealed the true extent of the petrol gouge.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">What this means is that, months after world prices have dropped, motorists are still being charged at the bowser on the basis of higher world prices. The profit Caltex made on each barrel of refined crude oil surged from $9.54 to an average of $15 in the second half of the year. So we are not talking about small bickies. Caltex revealed a staggering $70 million jump in post-tax profit to $420 million. Ordinary Australians are footing the bill for this profit, especially those from regional areas such as my electorate of Richmond.</para>
<para>The General Manager of Fueltrac, the price monitoring firm, Geoff Trotter, said that oil companies have especially not passed on any price decreases to rural and regional centres of Australia. In short, where petrol companies do not have to compete, they simply will not. So in regional centres, where wages are lower, unemployment is higher and people can least afford it, we are being ripped off the most at the bowser by oil refineries. In the words of the President of the NRMA, Alan Evans, ‘the Howard government must get off its behind’. And it certainly should.</para>
<para>Federal Labor is calling on the Howard government to show some leadership on this issue and do something about it. First, we need an ACCC inquiry into petrol prices and we need it now. Local people are constantly telling me that some action has to be taken. We need to have that inquiry started immediately. The ACCC themselves have said something funny is going on. The rest of Australia knows something funny is going on, so it is about time the Howard government did something about it. It is not enough for the Prime Minister to sit down with his big mates from Caltex, BP and Shell and let them satisfy him that they are not petrol gouging. We need an independent ACCC to monitor prices and ensure that consumers are being protected from the price gouging around Australia.</para>
<para>Second, we need to develop a long-term strategy to reduce our dependence on overseas oil. This is vitally important for our future. If we take no action now, we face the very real possibility of $5 per litre prices at the pump within 10 years. Labor’s blueprint for developing the Australian fuel industry outlines how we can foster an Australian fuel industry and provide relief to families at the petrol bowser in the long term. While Mr Howard sits on his hands, we as a nation are becoming increasingly dependent on foreign oil. We need to put measures in place immediately to increase the use of Australian fuels so that we are less vulnerable to external price shocks. We need to develop existing alternatives such as liquid petroleum gas, ethanol and biodiesel and emerging alternatives such as compressed natural gas, liquid fuel from gas and stored electricity.</para>
<para>Australians deserve a government that is willing to show some leadership on petrol gouging and a plan for the future. People in regional areas are doing it tough. They see petrol prices increase day by day and week by week and they want to have something done about it. They need to be relieved of the burden of having to continue to pay these high prices. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Petrol prices will always be a significant issue among the Australian people because, per capita, they are large consumers of that product. But popular solutions such as ‘the government should do something about it’ were even rejected by the member for Rankin in a very intelligent paper that put together the realities of the petrol market, with the point being that, whilst you can accuse people such as refiners of profit gouging, those figures are not supported when one looks at the international marketplace in which Australia properly operates. For instance, we have international prices for crude oil that are measured in Australia by the Malaysian Tapis rate, and we have retail prices for which the benchmark is Singaporean Mogas 95 unleaded. So if there has been price gouging, as the member for Richmond has just alleged, one would think things would be a little different. Obviously, the gross profit margin of refiners is the difference between the Tapis price and the Mogas price, which was $6.25 on average during 2004, before we saw this massive escalation in world crude prices. In August 2005, as the price of crude started to increase, that margin was $5.96. In September 2005 the margin had increased to $11.29, and in October 2005 it had crept back down to what one could almost call the average at $7.42.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>But what have we been told about this escalation in the price of refined product? There is an international shortage of refinery capacity. So the member for Richmond wants us to believe that, if by some regulatory mechanism we keep screwing down the retail margin or the margins available to fuel refiners, they will go and build a new refinery and will spend the hundreds of millions that governments on both sides have demanded they spend to improve the quality and reduce the emissions of the fuels we use at this stage. I note that Caltex got a mention from the member for Richmond. It is a company that is struggling to meet those particular requirements, and that might be because it is the only publicly traded fuel refiner in Australia. Where do those profits go that the member for Richmond complains about? In many cases they go to union super funds. We all get this wonderful view from time to time that profits are consumed by the chief executive or some other powerful individual in the world when our marketplace today recycles profits into the investment community, with credit to be given, as I have been reminded previously by the member for Gorton, to an initiative of the Keating government—or Keating as Treasurer, I have forgotten which side of the fence he was on at the time. It was at about the time that he did not put in two tax returns, as I recollect—a matter that has always been ignored on the Labor side because they say they knew nothing about it. The reality is that, in these matters, investment has been created by compulsory superannuation, and no doubt on the computer screens every major super company has a share in Caltex. But the reality is that in Adelaide there still sits a mothballed refinery. Why was it closed? Because the margins were insufficient to keep a relatively small operation open.</para>
<para>So that is the first thing. In my remaining couple of minutes I do want to complain about some of the differentials that exist in the prices between city and country. I cannot understand them. It costs half a cent a litre per 100 kilometres to freight fuel by road to virtually anywhere in Australia, and there are some pretty big outlets outside of the capital cities. This economy of scale argument is relative, but not always. I will never know why those prices have to jump in that fashion.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for Richmond for placing the issue about petrol prices on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>. It is an important motion, because it allows us an opportunity to consider the consequences of very high petrol prices and the adverse effects on ordinary consumers of petrol. There are a number of areas relating to this consumer concern. There has already been some discussion about the way in which the ACCC should regulate how petrol companies behave and, indeed, about the relative difference between crude oil and produced oil prices. Why is there a much greater increase in prices of petrol at the petrol pump compared with the price of barrels of crude oil? That is the concern that a number of members on this side of the House have had with the hike. As members of this place who are sensitive to concerns of constituents would know, the massive increase in petrol prices has had an adverse effect on families in terms of making sure they can pick up their kids from school and go to work and get home by car. These everyday things have become more difficult for many who are on low incomes.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As I have said before in this type of debate, we can look at a number of options. I have said before that there was an opportunity to consider cutting excise tax, and that is certainly an option, but the government has chosen to do nothing. The Reserve Bank could obviously consider tightening monetary policy, and the government could also have considered cutting income tax. The one option that I do not think has been considered as regards a response by government has been the cutting of excise tax.</para>
<para>There is no doubt that monetary policy can deal with any inflationary consequences of an oil price shock. Monetary policy can generally squeeze away any inflation. It is slow but sure. The difficulty is that if that is the sum total of the policy response then the consequences for economic activity, as I have said before, are very painful. So I suggest an answer may be something that simultaneously alleviates the need for tighter monetary policy and offsets the worst consequences of any tightening that occurs. A cut in fuel excise taxes may be that magic bullet. One way to describe the argument for cutting fuel excise duty is that, if the government does not do something, the Reserve Bank surely will. The economy faces stagflationary pressures. The sensible response is some policy change which is price-decreasing and which also encourages economic activity. A fuel excise tax cut does that. None of the other policy options does so.</para>
<para>The essential conceptual problem which the government view entails is that, if it acts as if it is independent, it means it is irrelevant. Just because the Reserve Bank is independent does not mean that its likely actions and reactions can be ignored. If a macro-economic shock is large or sustained, the consequences are known. There is a policy response which is effective, macro-economically responsible and powerfully superior to the main alternative. This last point bears emphasis. It would appear that the government proposes to do nothing with a view to later cutting income taxes. No doubt the Treasurer would like to delay any further tax cuts to coincide with his challenge to the Prime Minister for the prime ministership next year.</para>
<para>I think it is important that the government looks at ways to respond to this particular crisis. It is fair to say that the hikes in the petrol price have been on the decline in recent weeks for a number of reasons, but the hikes allow us to consider whether we use fiscal policy or monetary policy. They allow us to consider examining alternative fuels. Allowing this potential crisis to precipitate proper consideration of taxation and environmental concerns allows the parliament and parliamentarians to—I hope—confront issues and provide answers for future problems. I suggest parliamentarians consider this. The government should investigate the options available for cutting excise tax because I think it can provide the benefits without the disadvantages associated with other forms of taxation policy.</para>

<para>—The motion on petrol prices is an important one. It would be good if we could do something about this issue. But the fact of the matter is this: of the 30 OECD countries, we have got the fourth lowest petrol prices. Ours are much lower than most countries in the world. In fact, one of the reasons for the low price of petrol in Australia compared with other countries is the low taxes applied to fuel by the Australian government. This was brought about in part by a decision not to continue the indexation of excise that was introduced by the Australian Labor Party. The fact of the matter is that if Labor’s policy had continued then the price of petrol would have been roughly 14.7c per litre higher than it currently is. That is the story that we confront today. We have got the Australian Labor Party saying that we should do something about petrol prices; the Australian government has. The member for Richmond ought to remember that half of her constituents are driving across the border to Queensland to fill up their cars because the Queensland government is actually giving back some of the GST funds provided by the Commonwealth with the changeover in excise and GST at the time of the introduction of the goods and services tax. The government in New South Wales is not interested in anything but raising more taxes everywhere it can with every means it can think of.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>It is interesting to note that the ACCC does conduct informal inquiries and keeps a check on oil prices. Its summaries are very useful. Its summary indicates that the higher margins recorded in recent months are primarily due to the shortage of supply of refined product in the US following Hurricane Katrina and the Chinese government’s recent decision to take steps to halt the export of petrol because of an acute shortage of fuel in several of China’s southern and eastern provinces. So we have got the US and China gobbling up fuel. I refer to an article by the member for Rankin, which I thought was a pretty interesting sort of article and at complete odds with what has been said in the House today. He said on 20 July this year that it is simply not feasible or practicable to legislate lower prices. He said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">China is burning oil products for its industrialisation as if there is no tomorrow.</para>
<para>Added to the price increase from Chinese consumption is a terrorism premium on the world oil price.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He concluded his comments by saying:</para>
<quote>
<para>So no, there are no magic solutions to high petrol prices. It might seem clever to pretend there are, but the Australian people are smarter than that.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The comments of a prominent member of the Australian Labor Party are completely at odds with the presentations here today by fellow members of the Australia Labor Party.</para>
<para>The support for Australian families by this government has been substantial. Our costs for energy rose only 13.4 per cent in the September quarter, compared with an OECD average of 21.1 per cent. In the September quarter the CPI increased by 0.9 per cent, including the price increase in petrol. If we exclude the price of petrol in the CPI increase, the CPI increase was 2.2 per cent. The increase was 0.9 per cent for petrol; that means 3.1 per cent is the actual increase in the CPI. So the impact is significant but restrained, as it is not elsewhere in the world. For the 2005-06 year, Australians will be able to earn up to $63,000 and stay in the 30 per cent tax bracket. From 1 July 2006 this will rise to $70,000. So there are tax concessions coming through consistently, year after year and as the budget can afford in the government’s management of the Australian economy.</para>
<para>The ACCC informally monitors. It gives prices. It monitors 4,000 sites. It puts out a regular price list. It conducts random sampling of prices throughout Australia. Recently, in Ballarat, it took a number of retailers to court for fixing prices. The ACCC is on the job. It is doing what it is designed to do. I believe that the government is managing high oil prices and high petrol prices as best it can. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—While the member for Rankin did make the point that there is no silver bullet, it does not exempt the government from attempting to do something about an issue that is impacting on all of our electorates. In my electorate and that of the member for Throsby, a large number of people commute to work. According to most recent studies, it is probably the largest commuter corridor in Australia. Most of the 16,000 people a day who travel into Sydney in order to obtain work are doing that trip by car. For many of those people, the experience a few months ago of spiralling petrol prices created a great deal of anguish for them and a great deal of pressure on their family budgets.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>People can come into this House and say that there are always international pressures and other forces causing this and that we cannot be exempt from them—that is absolutely true—but it does not mean that the government can therefore hold their hands up and say, ‘Unfortunately, that will flow through to family budgets and there is not much that we can do about it.’ There is a great deal that the government can do about it, including ensuring a legislative requirement for the ACCC to monitor and report on petrol prices.</para>
<para>Despite comments and explanations as to why the spikes have occurred, the most constant monitors of petrol prices are family members who go to a petrol station every two to three days—particularly those who commute to work—to fill up their cars. They see quite clearly that when oil prices at the international level go up, petrol prices very quickly go up at their local petrol station. When they hear reports that the international price of oil is going back down, they see that petrol prices at the pump where they are filling up are very slow to go back down.</para>
<para>That is the reality for constituents. We are consistently having concerns expressed about the monitoring of petrol prices. That is why I support the member for Richmond’s motion about petrol prices today. There should be a requirement that petrol prices be consistently monitored. If there is nothing smelly or dirty about the way the price of petrol is being set, what is the problem with having it monitored?</para>

<para>As much as government members may not like to acknowledge it, there is a rolling sense of discontent amongst families in our communities about their capacity to manage spending an amount of their income on things that they choose rather than on costs that they feel are an unnecessary burden on them.

<para>—Perhaps the member recognises that people do not always react immediately and that there is significant resentment about the impact of the GST on family budgets. That is being compounded by things like petrol costs. I suggest to you that, under the new industrial regime, people will be concerned about whether they will get their overtime and penalty rates. In many households, they are the only things keeping their budgets above the red line of debt. That will be a real concern for many families. If members want to laugh, I suggest that they get out and talk to families, because that is the reality for those households. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I am pleased to speak on the motion on petrol prices moved by the member for Richmond, because it is another example of the opposition and, in this case, the member for Richmond gilding the lily. The presentation by the member for Cunningham, who has just spoken, is another example of an incomplete contribution in every sense of the word. This is another motion that tries to challenge the credibility of the Howard government, and it fails miserably.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The motion fails to take into account, as my colleagues have already suggested, that a former shadow minister of the Labor Party, the opposition, has written an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> about all the factors that contribute to the increase in petrol prices and all the dynamics that are involved with rising prices where that occurs. I want to quote from that article because it is very instructive. The member for Rankin says:</para>
<quote>
<para>Australia’s record petrol prices have one cause and one cause only—high world prices. The OPEC oil-producing countries are pumping oil out of the ground as fast as they can, but not as fast as the world want to use it. China is burning oil products for its industrialisation as if there is no tomorrow. Nobody really anticipated how fast the Chinese economy could grow and how thirsty for oil it is.’</para>

<para class="block">Anyone listening to this address or watching it here in the parliament would be very interested to know what this motion is about. I want to read the motion by the member for Richmond. She asks:</para>

<list type="decimal">
<item label="(1)">
<para>notes that petrol prices in regional areas have dramatically increased and are averaging well over $1.20 per litre ...</para>
</item>
</list>
</motion>
<para class="block">The sum of $1.20 per litre is the essence of the motion. I actually took the opportunity today to have a look at what petrol prices were in the electorate of the member for Richmond. Lo and behold, what do I discover? Remarkable prices that stand well below the price of $1.20 per litre, as suggested by the member for Richmond. That is another superb example of a federal Labor opposition member gilding the lily and failing to be complete in the entire story. In Murwillumbah, the price of petrol is $1.10.9; in Kingscliff—in the electorate of Richmond—it is $1.17; in Brunswick Heads, it is $1.14.9; in Alstonville, it is $1.15; in Hastings Point, it is $1.08.5; in Tweed Heads, it is $1.09.9; in Bangalow, it is $1.14.9; in Uki, it is $1.15.9; and, in Tyalgum, it is $1.15.9. That is in sharp contrast to the motion that says that regional petrol prices are $1.20 per litre. It is very important for members of the coalition to remember—and I am sure they do not need any reminding—to always be careful regarding what members opposite say. It is very important because they quite often fail to be complete and accurate in what they allege.</para>
<para>When we compare petrol prices in this country to international prices, such comparisons reveal that we are better placed than many of our international competitors. This country enjoys more competitive prices than most places in the world. We rank fourth lowest among OECD countries for petrol prices, according to the International Energy Agency. Only the USA, Mexico and Canada have lower petrol prices. I am highly disappointed that someone who is so concerned about petrol prices and has moved in this House a motion on petrol prices fails to sit in the chamber whilst this motion is being discussed.</para>
<para>The motion also refers to jobs. As the Treasurer mentioned in question time today, the Howard government has created over 1.7 million jobs since its election in 1996. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para class="block">There is no doubt that healthier people are happier people. They remain in the work force beyond traditional retirement age, they are more productive and they require fewer support systems in later life. In fact, overall, if one is healthy, life is pretty good. But this country is facing the burden of chronic disease, and the effect of chronic disease is reflected in the increasing incidence of disability and premature death. The rise of obesity is alarming, particularly in young Australians. The level of diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer and cholesterol are all increasing—diseases that in many cases are preventable. These diseases are often influenced by lifestyle choices and behaviour, but the levels still keep climbing because Australians are not taking responsibility for their own health.</para>
<para>We have one of the best health systems in the world. We have high standards of treatment and preventative care—and of course there is always the local public hospital and the specialist care that is available to all in this country—but all too often individuals believe they are invincible and that a trip to the GP will solve any health problems. It amazes me that individuals will continue down a destructive path with regard to their health, even armed with all the information that is available about healthy living: how to eat, how to cook our food and how we must take up some exercise and breathe in fresh air, have adequate sleep and rest, throw out the cigarettes and cut back on the alcohol—everything in moderation. We do not need to stop living but, to live and enjoy life, we need to monitor our behaviour. There is nothing wrong with a glass of red, but too many glasses of red every night and eventually one’s health will suffer.</para>
<para>More than half the Australian population is overweight or obese. These are shocking statistics when you consider that an estimated 1.5 million of those people are aged under 18. Childhood obesity in Australia is rising at the rate of one per cent each year, and over half of all young Australians will be overweight by 2025 unless parents, governments and the community start addressing the problem together. An overweight child often becomes an overweight adult. In fact, the AMA have said that nutrition is the key in the fight against the obesity epidemic. They launched a plan last week with some simple steps on addressing poor nutrition in babies and children, the adult population and older Australians. The steps are simple; it is basic commonsense. As a country, we need to take heed of those steps and get serious about the health of this nation.</para>
<para>Australians who do not take responsibility for their own health just expect that, by having access to medical goods and services, they will be fine. I wonder how many think about the long-term effects that an unhealthy lifestyle will have on them. The health system cannot fix every health problem, but the burden on the health system both in an economic and social sense is enormous. We must not give up. Through our schools and local sporting groups and community bodies we must find ways of introducing healthy lifestyle programs. We need to get our kids away from the computers and onto the playing fields. Around 40 per cent of children aged between five and 14 years of age do not participate in any organised sport.</para>
<para>The federal government has gone some way in addressing this situation by supporting a number of programs to help address the very real problem that will have long-term effects on a whole generation of Australians. The parliament legislated in 2004, requiring schools to include at least two hours of physical activity per week in their curriculum for children in primary and junior high schools. There are healthy eating programs supported by school canteens and education staff, but more needs to be done. The AMA has made recommendations that include the banning of selling chocolates and lollies as fundraisers and banning junk food advertising. Some people would say they are extreme measures, but it is time for extreme measures if we as a nation want to ensure the young people of this country lead healthy, happy, productive and active lives.</para>
<para>We also need more emphasis on preventative medicine. Our health work force needs to be skilled in delivering interventions to address the major risk factors for chronic disease such as smoking, poor nutrition, risky and high-risk alcohol use and physical inactivity. But it is not a one-way street. Quite frankly, every Australian needs to take on the personal responsibility of their health. It is not the job of governments to continually fund soaring health costs if individuals are negligent and do not heed the warnings of lifestyle choices and the impact those choices have on their short- and long-term health. This is a partnership, but I fear we have reached a time when extreme measures, or maybe even incentives, must be put in place so that individuals take control of their health today and in the future. I would like to take this opportunity of thanking my parliamentary colleagues for their contributions to this motion today.</para>

<para>—I support the motion moved by the member for McPherson because I am also a firm believer in preventative medicine and physical activity. There is no avoiding the statistics warning us of a looming and largely preventable health crisis in Australia. We will all pay the price unless we start giving greater priority to preventative health measures—and start right now. For example, the government estimates that the cost of obesity in Australia is between $680 million and $1.239 billion per year. The AMA estimates that around 15 per cent of our children are already overweight and that that figure will increase by one per cent each year so that, by the year 2025, half of Australia’s children will be overweight. Figures for Australian adults are even worse: 58 per cent of Australian men and 42 per cent of Australian women are currently classed as overweight or obese. And, with overweight children being 50 per cent more likely to become overweight adults, this constitutes a real problem both now and into the future.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Obesity is a risk factor for a number of diseases including diabetes, coronary heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke and cancer. To combat the increasing levels of obesity within the Australian population, Australians need to be educated about the health risks posed by obesity and the benefits of incorporating physical activity into our lives. There are numerous programs across the country aimed at increasing Australians’ physical activity levels. Today I would like to talk about a fantastic community based program which many people in the chamber will already be aware of: the 10,000 Steps program.</para>
<para>This program began in Rockhampton in 2001 as a Queensland Health funded whole-of-community project to encourage greater physical activity. Rockhampton was chosen as the location for a two-year trial of the program due to its residents’ typical level of activity. The program is based at Central Queensland University and has a number of other active partners throughout Rockhampton. The program has consistently shown results and has rapidly spread to many other centres across Australia. 10,000 Steps now boasts 372 providers and has logged over three billion steps. The program uses the message of 10,000 steps per day as a way to encourage people in the community to increase their physical activity levels. Participants in the program use a pedometer to measure the number of steps they take per day with an aim of consistently reaching 10,000 per day.</para>
<para>The 10,000 Steps Workplace Challenge has become a particularly popular program across the country with the 10,000 Steps program estimating that over 40,000 people have taken part in that element of the initiative. Indeed, several Commonwealth departments and agencies, including the tax office, Finance and Administration, Centrelink and Treasury, have taken part in the challenge. The challenge consists of workplaces organising teams who log the number of steps per day that each team takes. The goal is to increase participants’ awareness of their level of physical activity. By taking note of the number of steps they take each day as part of their normal activities, participants can see where they are deficient and need to increase their physical activity in order to maximise the health benefits.</para>
<para>The Rockhampton community have really gotten behind this program, and several local groups, including the Central Queensland University, the Rockhampton City Council, Queensland Health and local media outlets, have been heavily involved in promoting the program. For example, the Rockhampton City Council has established a number of walking paths around the city under the 10,000 Steps logo and has also set up a program of organised activity in local parks to encourage people to get out, get active and get moving. The 10,000 Steps program is a fantastic tool that is spreading across the country. The program shows people that physical activity does not have to be time intensive, cost a lot of money or be too strenuous. The message is clearly that everyone can do it and, echoing the member for McPherson’s remarks, everyone should do it—young or old, thin or not so thin. The point is to get out there, become aware of your health and get those 10,000 steps per day.</para>
<para>Physical activity is a vital part of any preventative health regime. I think that everyone would agree with the member for McPherson that it is important to try to prevent illness rather than just treat it. That very obvious point needs to be reflected in both policy development and funding priorities if we are to protect the sustainability of our health system into the future and at the same time assist Australians onto the path of a longer, healthier and happier life.</para>

<para>—I congratulate the member for McPherson on moving this motion, and I endorse the comments of the member for Capricornia. So far we have heard from the mothers, and one of the key things in terms of return to health has been the involvement of mothers returning to health post pregnancy and looking after the early childhood years of their children in a healthy way.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The function of protecting and developing health must rank even above that of restoring it when it is impaired, so Hippocrates said, and the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council has put together a national approach through the National Health Priority Action Council. That is made up of six volumes. The first volume is the <inline font-style="italic">National Chronic Disease Strategy</inline>, which is a nationally agreed strategy for taking on chronic diseases. Volume 2 is the <inline font-style="italic">National Service Improvement Framework for Asthma</inline>; volume 3, the <inline font-style="italic">National Service Improvement Framework for Cancer</inline>; volume 4, the <inline font-style="italic">National Service Improvement Framework for Diabetes</inline>; volume 5, the <inline font-style="italic">National Service Improvement Framework for Heart, Stroke and Vascular Disease</inline>; and volume 6, the <inline font-style="italic">National Service Improvement Framework for Osteoarthritis, Rheumatoid Arthritis and Osteoporosis</inline>.</para>
<para>Chronic disease is estimated by these ministers to account for nearly 70 per cent of our health spend. The behavioural and social risk factors for those chronic diseases are poor health in early childhood, tobacco smoking, risky and high-risk alcohol use, poor diet and nutrition, physical inactivity, excessive sun exposure and social isolation. Those are the things that we have to address. I endorse the motion put forward by the member for McPherson about looking at young people and those early childhood factors for a lifetime of health. In my electorate of Lindsay, the Active After-school Communities Program, funded by this government, has been introducing children from Joey’s Outside of School Hours Care to baseball, softball and T-ball, providing opportunities to child care and to schools for physical activity outside the school curriculum, which is already jam-packed with advice on drugs, alcohol and healthy eating. We are aiming to engage children with fitness and team sports to carry them through life with those activities.</para>
<para>Other schools in my electorate are growing vegetables and introducing breakfast programs under the Healthy School Communities program. A number of my schools have also elected to receive the $1,500 the government offers for schools to get their canteens in order. But there is only so much we can ask schools to do. At most, five meals a week are consumed in the schools. The parents must take responsibility for the rest. In doing so, we can have a lot of intervention in the early preschool years. I have advocated for a national preschool program where we involve a number of agencies to support parents with parental, nutritional and activity advice.</para>
<para>If the mother is returned to health post-partum, she will be an active mum. I have lost about 10 kilos in the last 12 months and, with two toddlers, it is amazing the difference it makes: you are able to actively engage with your children—with piggybacks on the beach, the old shoulder carry and the things that encourage children to be active, running and in motion all the time. When you are running and out of breath, it is important to call your children back to walk close by because, in Western Sydney, there have been a number of school kidnappings. So the way we design our cities is a social issue.</para>
<para>I recommend the 10,000 Steps program to the Penrith City Council. Footpaths should be designed so that people can partake of exercise in their local area. By setting up community walking programs around the local area, people can be encouraged to become physically active and less socially isolated. Physical activity should be a normal part of their day—from the age of 12 months, when you learn to walk, until you are well aged and into your active retirement years. Congratulations to the member for McPherson and all our health ministers, but I stress that more needs to be done.</para>

<para>—I thank the member for McPherson for moving a motion that is intended to encourage the government to pursue policies which would see a greater emphasis on actions, particularly in education, which would increase the awareness and uptake of preventative health measures. It is a timely and welcome motion, but it is also a rebuke of current government policy and particularly the efforts of the Minister for Health and Ageing, Mr Abbott, who is presiding over an obesity epidemic of young people in this country but seems incapable of overcoming his ideological barriers and doing something effective and real about it.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The urgent need for front-end health prevention can be seen in the rising costs of the health budget and health related technology. No doubt it will become increasingly important for nations to focus on preventative health in the future, especially with the high incidence of preventable diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, high cholesterol, obesity and diabetes.</para>
<para>I note that since 1996 federal government health spending has grown from around 15 per cent to over 20 per cent of the budget, a rise of around 3.8 per cent to 4.4 per cent of GDP. The cost imbalance of treating the endgame of poor health practice rather than investing in preventative health measures is clear. If you look at something like minimally invasive heart surgery, the costs are in the order of $3 million up front and then $2,300 for each procedure for disposable equipment that cannot ever be used again. Surely this is the wrong way to achieve effective and prudent treatment of health issues.</para>
<para>The member for Capricornia pointed out the health measures that are present in the community, such as 10,000 Steps, but the fact is that there has been a huge increase in obesity in Australia—from nine per cent in 1989-90 to 16 per cent in 2001. Alarmingly, the projections for 2010 suggest that at the current rate of obesity there could be 5.6 million Australians overweight—not obese, but overweight. By 2020, this could stretch to 6.3 million overweight and three million obese. These are startling figures and demand the attention of the Howard government and the health minister. If we say that the estimated growing rate of childhood obesity of one per cent a year continues, half of all young Australians will be overweight by 2025. Clearly, this is an unsatisfactory state of affairs.</para>
<para>I refer to the fact that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are twice as likely to be obese than non-Indigenous people. There are a number of historical factors, including the removal of children from their families, which have meant that a generation of mothers has not learnt traditional childrearing and feeding practices. A recent study shows us that 28 per cent of Indigenous low birth weight babies could be attributed to maternal malnutrition, and obesity is a factor there too.</para>
<para>It is time for the government to act, but it has been remiss. Labor state governments have moved to address the issue of childhood obesity, but the minister continues to blame parents for the national epidemic, washing his hands of responsibility. Parents and families for Minister Abbott exist in hermetically sealed isolation—not impacted by government policy, the commercial sector and its expertly constructed advertising campaign or the substantial budgets that go with it. I think a reasonable person would accept what Kaye Mehta, the nutrition lecturer at Flinders University, says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Food advertising does create increased preferences for those food products and increased pester power to their parents.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">That is why Labor supports the Australian Medical Association’s call for a nutrition survey—the last one was conducted 10 years ago—and a national nutrition centre to coordinate a national response to Australia’s obesity problem. Additionally, Labor calls on the government to conduct a national audit into junk food advertising during children’s programs, examining the impact it has on children’s health.</para>
<para>This is urgently needed. If the minister addressed himself to the situation that I have described—a national childhood epidemic in obesity—then it is absolutely clear that the government must act. The government’s 2004 announcement for $116 million over four years to curb Australia’s declining physical activity needs to be brought into effect now. The National Obesity Taskforce’s recommendations to understand and assess the impact of current food and drinks advertising practices on community levels of overweight and obese people need to be taken into account by the government. It is time for the federal government to accept its taskforce’s advice and do something about childhood obesity. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion of the member for McPherson. It is a motion that shows great wisdom on her part.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>We have many great medical professionals, but one of the most influential health practitioners is the individual themself. Many people believe that their health care starts when they see a doctor and that it is the doctor or the nurse who is somehow responsible for their health. It is a case of ‘When I’m ill, it’s “bulk-bill and pill” treatment to solve all the problems.’ There are times when we need a medical practitioner, but in reality the individual can contribute a great deal to their own health and wellbeing. It is the individual who should be taking greater responsibility for their own health by a good diet, by taking regular exercise, by drinking only in moderation and by not smoking. It is really important that we focus on preventative measures. Preventative measures create good health outcomes—preventative measures by way of education but also preventative measures by way of individuals themselves ensuring that they conduct the type of lifestyle that produces good health.</para>
<para>I am amazed that people persist in smoking. Figures in 1989 and 1990 showed that 28 per cent of adults smoked; by 2001 that figure had reduced, but only to 24 per cent. With regard to exercise, there was only a five per cent increase in the number of people conducting low levels of exercise between 1989 and 2001. We know what the benefits of regular exercise are, yet the uptake of exercise or the increase in exercise has been relatively modest. By taking regular exercise, people dramatically improve the health outcomes that they can achieve.</para>
<para>The rate of obesity has almost doubled amongst Australian adults over the last two decades. Australia is now ranked as one of the fattest developed nations, closely following the US. We are being supersized, and many people are not doing anything about it. If current trends continue, at least 60 per cent of Australians aged over 18 will be overweight or obese by 2010. That figure will increase to 65 per cent by 2020. We have already passed the point where more men are overweight or obese than are not. This is not a good scenario. Some 20 to 25 per cent of Australian children are overweight or obese. Between 1985 and 1995, the combined level of overweight and obese children more than doubled. The figures are alarming indeed. Figures on smoking, exercise and obesity show that we have a long way to go in encouraging a sense of personal responsibility with regard to health matters.</para>
<para>As I said before, this bulk-bill and pill approach to medicine, requiring medical practitioners to be the sole solution to the problem, just is not on. Obese people as a group receive more sickness benefits and more unemployment benefits than people within the normal weight range. I believe in the concept of a social contract. We as a community have the responsibility to provide high-quality health services. But in return for that, individuals have the responsibility to do as much as they can to preserve their own wellbeing through the measures I mentioned—not smoking, not excessively consuming alcohol and taking the appropriate amount of exercise. It is vital that there is a two-pronged approach.</para>
<para>This motion should be commended. It has a focus on education, putting people in the picture with all the information they need to make correct lifestyle choices—to avoid obesity and to ensure that they are conducting a healthy lifestyle—and, in doing so, to produce great outcomes for our community through reduced health care costs.</para>
<para>Medical technology is making huge strides in solving a whole range of problems, but we can leave more funding available for acute areas by taking care of the things that can be handled through personal responsibility. As I said, they are proper diet, regular exercise, drinking only in moderation and not smoking. The government has done a great deal in promoting those ideals, but it is very much in the hands of the individual. I believe that people have to take that personal responsibility much more seriously to ensure that we get very positive outcomes. We have an ageing population. In the future our medical resources are going to be very much focused on the more elderly people in our community. If, through a healthier lifestyle, we can produce lifelong health into old age, we can dramatically reduce the call on our health services and we can dramatically increase the availability of resources for others who could not help the situation that they were in, who could not help the condition that they had. Personal responsibility, like improved medical technology, is going to be a major driver in improved outcomes.</para>

<para>—I would like to congratulate the member for McPherson on bringing this motion before the House. I encourage the government to act upon the motion, because I believe that she has identified some very important issues in it.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>There is no single factor that impinges more on a person’s quality of life than their health status. A person who enjoys good health has a positive outlook and a sense of wellbeing. A person who has poor health tends to have a more negative outlook, and that detracts from their sense of wellbeing.</para>
<para>There are many factors involved. It is multifaceted. There are many factors that influence a person’s health. There is diet—and diet starts at childhood. From the time they are born, diet plays an important role in people’s health. There is physical activity. Unfortunately, our lifestyle tends to lead to a lower level of physical activity than we previously enjoyed. Socioeconomic factors, unfortunately, also impinge upon the health status of people in Australia. People who are in lower socioeconomic groups tend to have poorer health than others. That relates to the cost of obtaining good foods and good nutrition. Other factors that impact upon a person’s health are their sense of connectedness or isolation and their psychological wellbeing. These are just a few factors that impinge upon a person’s health.</para>
<para>In considering this motion, I would like to focus on the epidemic that is consuming our society—the obese and overweight. It is a disease of affluence. Worldwide there are one billion people who are overweight. There are only 792 million who suffer from malnutrition. That is quite a telling factor. Most of those one billion people can be found in affluent countries.</para>
<para>Obesity leads to high blood pressure, liver disease, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. I looked at what the Heart Foundation had to say and found that 37.6 per cent of all deaths in Australia were caused by heart disease, stroke and cardiovascular disease. There are 3.67 million Australians affected by cardiovascular disease, while 1.10 million Australians are disabled long term by cardiovascular disease. The prevalence of cardiovascular disease has increased by 18.2 per cent over the last decade. This can be really closely associated with obesity.</para>
<para>Last week the AMA released a paper that highlighted the importance of good nutrition and the impact obesity was having in Australia. It pointed out that childhood obesity is increasing by one per cent a year, and it gave some strategies for addressing this. Babies should be solely breastfed, where possible, for at least the first six months of their lives. School canteens should not profit from selling junk food. Vending machines within schools should not be able to stock anything other than water. Selling chocolates and lollies as fundraisers should be banned. All junk food advertising should be banned. I think it is very important that we are very mindful of the impact on children of the advertisements shown with children’s programs on television.</para>
<para>The federal government funds a program to improve the nutritional status of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, especially women under 20 who are pregnant and breastfeeding and women with children. I think that program needs to be extended.</para>

<para>—I grieve today for those who experience mental illness and for the carers and companions of those who experience mental illness in this country. It is not as though this subject is unfamiliar to this House or to any level of government but, in light of the horrendous cost of untreated mental illness and uncared for mental illness in this country, something that continues to disturb me is the number of our fellow citizens who are committing suicide or leading lost lives—and the terrible costs to the carers of those with mental illness in the community.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>In 1993, there was a groundbreaking study and report by the then Human Rights Commissioner, Brian Burdekin. It spoke about mental illness, about how those with mental illness were being treated and about the stigma associated with mental illness. Primarily as a consequence of that report, two good federal government programs have arisen. Two other reports have followed that 1993 report—<inline font-style="italic">Out of hospital, out of mind,</inline> an excellent report by the Australian Mental Health Council; and the most recent report by that same council, in conjunction with the Human Rights Commissioner, called, interestingly, <inline font-style="italic">Not for service: experiences of injustice and despair in mental health care in Australia</inline>.</para>
<para>With respect to <inline font-style="italic">Not for service</inline> and its recommendations, the report really hits the nail on the head when it talks about why governments of all persuasions must take some level of responsibility for fixing this community disaster. I will read from the executive summary of <inline font-style="italic">Not for service</inline>, which is the latest report to be commissioned into the state of mental health in this country:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">What this cumulative data shows is that after 12 years of mental health reform in Australia, any person seeking mental health care runs the serious risk that his or her basic needs will be ignored, trivialised or neglected. The adverse health, social and economic effects of Australia’s mental health care system falls largely on those with recurrent or chronic disorders and their families and carers. These are some of the most vulnerable people in our community.</para>
<para class="block">In the short-term, the system as it currently operates may result in a failure to provide basic medical and psychological health care, inappropriate use of short term seclusion, confinement or over-reliance on sedating medications. Longer-term, the impact may include deteriorating mental health and wellbeing, suicide, higher rates of homelessness, prolonged unemployment, incarceration or increased financial burden and poverty. Failure to attend to the urgent needs of those with severe mental disorders on a systemic basis may also lead to infringements of the wider rights of the community to reside in a safe and secure environment. For many people, ongoing financial and personal support from family and friends is the only real safeguard against these outcomes.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">These are stories that we heard 12 years ago. Given the problem with the provision of mental health services in this country acknowledged in this latest report, it is incumbent upon us as legislators in this place—and people that provide funding to health systems in some ways, particularly to the mental health system—to do something.</para>
<para>I understand that as a consequence of this report the Prime Minister has given an undertaking to raise this matter at COAG. I would like to point out that this is a national priority. In 2001, 2,454 persons died by suicide. Virtually all those deaths occurred as a consequence of mental illness. So it is not as though we have a lot of time. We do not have time, because the more time we spend not addressing this particular situation the more people are dying in this country. In a fair-minded country—and a country that professes to look after its most vulnerable—we cannot stand here as legislators, as a government and an opposition, and say that we have done enough. We have to do more.</para>
<para>Speaking about statistics: currently, for example, I think as a consequence of the lack of funding across all levels of government for mental health services, 62 per cent of people with mental health disorders do not actually access services. Most of the 38 per cent of people who do access services will seek treatment by a general practitioner. There are a lot of people who are literally dying in this country because they cannot get access for appropriate treatment, services and care. I say in this place that we cannot accept that.</para>
<para>We speak about statistics—we talk about, say, the fact that one in five people have a mental illness in this country. I would like to read you the story of someone who could not get access to the treatment that she needed and what sort of effect it had on her. I have been told that I can tell this story but obviously not relate this person’s name. This was a person who sought a treatment that had been successful at a psychiatric facility in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne but who was told that she could not continue to get that treatment because of funding cuts. She says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">A cloud of depression has enfolded me. I have been fighting so hard, trying to think positive and trying to keep busy and exercise, telling myself it will pass ...</para>
<para class="block">Everything is too hard—I am scared, frustrated and sad, my head is going round and round. I can’t turn it off—everything is too worrying.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This individual has a psychotic disorder. She continues:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I have tried, I can’t do it. I want to slip away quietly. I love—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">this particular person—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">with all my heart. I don’t want to hurt them, but my feelings are too overwhelming ... I need to turn off permanently. It’s got to the stage where I can’t keep a lid on things ... It’s time to end this turmoil. I have to turn everything off.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This is where, I am afraid, it gets a little bit difficult:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I tried to suffocate myself for 1 hour in bed this afternoon with a big rubbish bag ... It didn’t work. I was so upset. I wanted to go off in the car, attach a hose and drift off to sleep ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">But she could not actually do it. She continues:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Please everyone know that I did try extra extra hard, but I failed ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This person, in this state in this country—what are we doing as a fair minded country? Whilst this is a horrendous situation, this person has now been able to access appropriate treatment and is well. So the fact is that, if people in this country who cannot get access to treatment and are contemplating killing themselves, as I have read in this place, do get access to treatment, they can restore their lives. Many of those with psychotic disorders are untreated because of the stigma, because of the lack of access to services. Very effective treatments are available, provided governments of all levels appropriately fund the services.</para>
<para>The other thing is to basically talk about it, because it is still one of the taboo subjects in this society. There are many issues that you read about in magazines; you can read about virtually everything. But one of the things that you consistently do not read about is mental illness and the cost to the community. It is not a sexy story. It is not a quick fix story. It is not a story that you can splash on page 3 in a bikini. But it is a story that affects every level of this community and every layer of government.</para>
<para>Now I have spoken quickly about someone who is experiencing mental illness, I want to speak of the despair of someone who is a carer of a person with mental illness. She says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I have witnessed and been subjected to a distinct lack of understanding of mental illness, a distinct lack of compassion for mental illness, a distinct lack of care towards the relatives and sufferers of this illness, and most disturbingly, a distinct lack of adequate and appropriate facilities for the sufferers of this illness.</para>
<para class="block">The plight of a carer of a mentally ill person is fraught with much unpleasantness: heartache, sorrow, sadness, worry, misgivings, fear of and for the future, fear of being labelled, fear of being ostracised ... In short, the path we carers travel is all too often intolerable, insufferable and at times inhumane.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It is time that we in this place actually make a commitment to do something. I ask—in fact, I beg—the Prime Minister to convene this summit, to make it a priority issue. The longer that we leave this issue untreated, in the way we have in our community, more of our citizens are going to die, more people are going to be untreated, more lives will be lost to mental illness. In this country, we just cannot allow that to continue.</para>

</talker>
<para>—When I consider the most important issues facing communities in my electorate, roads are without a doubt one of the main priorities. For all towns, but in particular for towns like Gloucester, Dungog or Forster-Tuncurry, roads keep their economies alive. They need the infrastructure for agricultural business, to attract tourists and to keep jobs going. Since 1996 the Australian government has provided the electorate of Paterson with $295.8 million in Roads of National Importance funding; $8.7 million in national black spot funding; $142.3 million in financial assistance grants to local councils; and $7.8 million in Roads to Recovery funding.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>But when I look back on 2005 it is with great disappointment that I look at the appalling way that roads have been managed, resourced and funded by the New South Wales government. The Commonwealth provides the states with funding for roads and it is then the states who manage them—and, in the case of New South Wales, it is the Roads and Traffic Authority who manage the roadworks. To say that I have been appalled by the management of some projects in my electorate would be an understatement. The Pacific Highway and Weakleys Drive are two of particular note.</para>
<para>But I have also been angered by the failure of the New South Wales government to match Commonwealth funding of $10 million for local roads, as budgeted for under AusLink. When you consider the debacle of the cross-city tunnel in Sydney and the millions of dollars it has cost, taxpayers in my electorate can quite rightly question why it is that money is not going to their projects from the state government. In the case of the Australian government’s commitment of $10 million to specific roads in Paterson, a matching contribution of $10 million from the state would greatly assist local councils in the upgrade and maintenance of important regional roads. The funding is earmarked for the Dungog Shire, for the Dungog to Clarence Town road; the Clarence Town to Raymond Terrace Road, which also crosses into the Port Stephens Shire; the Dungog to Paterson road in the Dungog Shire; and the Lakes Way in the Great Lakes Shire. To bring these roads up to scratch, all levels of government need to make an extra contribution in funding. The Commonwealth have put money on the table and, to date, we have heard nothing from the New South Wales roads minister, Joe Tripodi.</para>
<para>Take the case of the Bucketts Way, which links the Pacific Highway to the New England area and goes through towns like Stroud, Gloucester and Kramback and all the way to Taree. The Australian government are investing $20 million over four years into this road, and we are currently into the third year of funding. This money is on top of any federal funding that councils receive from the Roads to Recovery program, the black spot program or the Financial Assistance Grants Scheme.</para>
<para>The funding has made a considerable difference to the quality of the road. Anyone who has ever driven on the Bucketts Way will appreciate the enormity of this upgrade task. The road falls across four council areas and covers terrain that is very hilly and winding—but very beautiful country at that. Once again, the state government has not matched funding on this project. The Commonwealth had no responsibility for injecting extra funds into the upgrade, but it understood that it was the right thing to do for the community.</para>
<para>Another project that I have fought hard to obtain funding for is the Weakleys Drive intersection on the New England Highway. The Australian government has committed $25 million to finalising this project, which involves the construction of a flyover on Weakleys Drive to carry traffic unimpeded in both directions along the New England Highway. Weakleys Drive will extend over the New England Highway via a new section of road, connecting it directly to the Thornton-Beresfield link road. Traffic lights will be installed on Weakleys Drive at the intersection below the highway to provide for safe turning movements for traffic to and from the highway.</para>
<para>While I had hoped that, in this the second year of funding, construction would have already started, we found out in May this year that the RTA had not finalised their planning. As a result, only a further $5 million was allocated to the project in this year’s budget to complete the process of design, development and land purchases. I have been advised by the minister’s office this week that a stage 3 project report for construction will be delivered to the department in January next year, and tenders are expected to be called in the following months of February or March. So I hope that 2006 will finally herald the start of construction of the long-awaited Weakleys Drive project and that ongoing delays with planning will finally be overcome.</para>
<para>Also of particular interest to me is the Pacific Highway. Last week there was a horrific accident which claimed the lives of four people from one Maitland family. It occurred between the Tea Gardens turnoff and Bulahdelah. The crash happened when the car carrying the Maitland family, which was southbound, veered onto the other side of the highway, colliding with another vehicle. No-one was killed in the second vehicle, but passengers from Bulahdelah did sustain some very serious injuries and are in hospital recovering. As police have said, the site of the accident was not known as a dangerous section of the highway and was in fact a straight corridor with three lanes. Only time will tell why this accident occurred, when the results of an investigation are known.</para>
<para>Unfortunately, when there is an accident on the Pacific Highway, finger pointing and squabbling seem to be the order of the day. To my mind, it is completely disrespectful for politicians to start waving their fingers at each other when families and communities are grieving for their loss and investigations have not been completed. This is also fuelled by sections of the media who do not understand jurisdictions when it comes to road responsibilities, nor respect when it comes to the fatalities that occur.</para>
<para>Perhaps when the construction of a dual carriageway on the Pacific Highway is completed, this debate will be over, but until such time I will continue to fight for priority to be given to specific road projects that my community wants. Of particular concern on the Pacific Highway is the turnoff to Tea Gardens. Anyone who drives past this intersection will see a great deal of work currently under way, but unfortunately it does not include a flyover. For a very long time now, the community, headed by Patricia Michelle, have been calling for a flyover to be included in this roadwork design, similar to the flyover at Karuah, to enable traffic moving on and off the highway to do so in a safe manner.</para>
<para>We lobbied the federal roads minister about the project, who then wrote to the New South Wales roads minister, asking for a design and the cost of the flyover project to be canvassed. Hundreds of people from Tea Gardens and Hawks Nest rallied on the steps of Parliament House in Sydney, calling on the state government to build a flyover, yet to date no-one has seen a report detailing possible designs or costings from the RTA. The state government, in their usual arrogant way, have dismissed community concerns. The silence from John Bartlett, the member for Port Stephens, has been deafening. At the next election he will take over the Tea Gardens-Hawks Nest area. His only response is that this area is not in his electorate yet—and, with a response like that, I doubt it will be in his electorate!</para>
<para>When it comes to the Pacific Highway, I make no apology for lobbying all levels of government to build a dual carriageway in my electorate, just like federal members north of me all the way to and beyond the Queensland border do. I have welcomed the increase in funding from the Australian government under the AusLink proposal, which recognises the importance of upgrading the road as soon as possible. The government has increased funding from $60 million to $160 million per year, and over the next three years both the Australian and the New South Wales governments will provide $480 million for the upgrade.</para>
<para>There has been significant progress made in the Paterson electorate so far. Completed projects include the Raymond Terrace bypass, Raymond Terrace to Karuah, the Karuah bypass, Bulahdelah to Coolongolook, Coolongolook to Wang Wauk and Wang Wauk to Bundacree Creek. There are two projects now under construction. One is the $114 million construction of section 1 of the Karuah to Bulahdelah upgrade, which will provide 11 kilometres of dual carriageway from the Karuah bypass to just south of Viney Creek Road. Construction has also started on the $115 million Bundacree Creek to Possum Brush section, which is 23 kilometres south of Taree. It will provide 9.7 kilometres of new four-lane divided freeway, including an interchange serving Nabiac. Twin two-lane bridges will be constructed over the Wallamba River to replace the existing narrow bridge. Planning is also under way for two further projects, being the F3 link to Raymond Terrace and the Bulahdelah upgrade. We need to upgrade the Pacific Highway to a dual carriageway as quickly as possible. Certainly, the accident last week has again highlighted why it is that the Karuah to Bulahdelah section must be made a priority. I understand that the state minister announced last week that tenders will be called.</para>
<para>One of the most frustrating aspects of being a member of the federal parliament is that, whilst the Australian government provides funding for the Pacific Highway, it is the state government who prioritises the work, and the Pacific Highway is actually a state road. In an effort to expedite the construction of a dual carriageway, the Australian government agreed some time ago to increase their level of funding support. As I said earlier, we now have an agreement where both levels of government will be paying $480 million each over the next three years.</para>
<para>This is an investment into road infrastructure that has to be made. Most importantly, priority has to be given to those areas on the highway which are known to be the sites of frequent accidents. The concerns of local communities have to be heard. This is a topic that I am very passionate about, and I do not apologise for banging on the doors of all levels of government to try to have this completed as quickly as possible. This year the federal government will have a $14 billion surplus. I call on the government to invest some of that money—to be matched by the state governments—in infrastructure development like the Pacific Highway under an AusLink proposal. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—Article 6 of the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights states:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">Every human being has the inherent right to life. This right shall be protected by law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The Australian Van Nguyen was hanged on Friday, December 2 by the government of Singapore after pleas for clemency by this parliament, by the government and by many others were declined. Singapore’s mandatory death sentence must now come under closer scrutiny because government sponsored execution of a human being is a crime against humanity and a breach of the UN convention. As such, Singapore stands condemned for the wilful deprivation of human life.</para>
<para>Certainly Van Nguyen’s grotesque punishment was absurdly disproportionate to his crime. No amount of spin on the part of the government of Singapore can disguise the fact that this is a government with attitudes and practices towards punishment of crimes that are archaic and barbaric. Singapore is one of the world’s leaders in the execution of people, and my condemnation of its actions is not reserved for the execution of Van Nguyen alone but extended to the killing of other foreigners as well as of the citizens of Singapore.</para>
<para>When Prime Minister Lee explained his refusal to grant clemency, he said that he was aware of the seriousness of the matter and was therefore making his decision knowing that he would be accountable for his actions. But the question is: who is he accountable to? The organs of accountability do not appear to work independently of government in Singapore. Reporters Without Borders have ranked Singapore’s press freedom 149th out of 167 in its 2005 world press index. Singapore’s former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong attacked this report by saying:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">It is a subjective measure computed through the prism of western liberals.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Such dismissiveness is typical of this government, which argues that its draconian laws and control of the media are necessary to ensure its stability. Suppressing freedom of the press, and in fact government control of the media and journalists, is a sure sign of a government desperately trying to maintain its rule by the use of totalitarian practices that are inconsistent with the principles of accountability and freedom of speech. State control of people’s rights to congregate and protest without a permit, draconian laws and the quashing of dissenting voices through the use of fear and repercussion are certainly characteristic of a totalitarian regime and are, again, inconsistent with the values and practices of our Australian democracy.</para>
<para>I want to join with the many Australians who have come together to offer support to the Nguyen family and in particular to Van’s mother, Kim. I want to concur with the statement by Father Peter Hansen that he was proud of the compassion shown by the Australian people. Like most Australians who have been horrified by this barbaric act, I do not know the Nguyen family personally. But I deeply empathise with their tragic circumstances and in particular with Van’s mother. As a mother myself, I know she will endure an unspeakable grief. I offer her my condolences and I know that she will find comfort in the compassion and the humanity of the people who have come to her aid—everyone from her lawyers to the staff of the Australian High Commission in Singapore, to friends, to the Australian public and to the caring hands of the Catholic Church, amongst them Father Peter Hansen, who leads the Catholic Church congregation in Craigieburn in my electorate of Calwell.</para>
<para>I am aware that there are many Australians who were supportive of Van Nguyen’s execution. It is easy for people to be unforgiving and to loathe those who they believe by their actions perpetuate the misery of drug abuse. But we must never allow such feelings to cause us to lose sight of our humanity. I cannot therefore agree with those who support capital punishment. Putting aside all the moral and legal arguments that militate against the use of capital punishment, for me personally it is a simple case of a profound belief that no human being has the right to take the life of another under any circumstances. I particularly derive this conviction from my own Christian faith, which preaches the sanctity and dignity of life and the power of forgiveness and mercy. I know this to be an absolute truth applicable in all circumstances without exception.</para>
<para>Particularly indefensible, therefore, is the case of Singapore and, might I say, the other 74 countries in the world—including the United States, which I understand has just hanged its 1,000th prisoner—who retain and employ the use of capital punishment. State sanctioned or judicial killing is immoral and senseless because it is wilfully employed and sanctioned by governments, some of which claim to uphold the highest standards of democracy and are at the forefront of defending human rights violations in places other than their own backyards.</para>
<para>Singapore in particular must answer to the claims put forward by many that there is an inherent contradiction between their hardline stand on punishment for drug smugglers, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, their alleged tolerance of Burmese businesses operating out of Singapore and, indeed, of known Burmese drug lords frequently moving into and out of Singapore. If these allegations are true then the government of Singapore are guilty of gross hypocrisy and double standards, making their mandatory death penalty regime even more outrageous and indecent and a perfect example of why the fear of capital punishment will never succeed in eradicating drug abuse or obstructing the global movement of narcotics. It appears that the big players are rarely caught and punished, and it also appears that some may even enjoy the hospitality and tolerance of governments who purport to be tough on drugs.</para>
<para>The execution of Van Nguyen and the issue of capital punishment will continue to confront and to challenge our civility both as individuals and as a nation for some time to come, particularly as we await the fate of other Australians facing death penalties abroad, including the Bali nine. We are a democratic country that long ago abolished capital punishment because we realised it to be barbaric and inhumane. We believe in the rehabilitation of those who transgress and commit crimes, and we are a fair-minded people who believe in the principle that the punishment must fit the crime. As such, I would like to support Amnesty International’s growing global campaign calling for the end of the death penalty. I would also like to welcome and support former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser’s calls, and those of Nguyen’s lawyer, Lex Lasry, for Australia to become an advocate for the abolition of capital punishment.</para>
<para>However, it is not enough to run such a campaign only at a people-to-people level, even though history does teach us that the drive for change always begins at the grassroots and is then followed by politicians and governments; such a campaign should also transact at a government-to-government level. There are ways that this could be done and we, as a parliament, should be exploring them. I know there have been many calls, in particular from the public, for the government to link the issue of human rights with trade. That in itself, I understand and acknowledge, is a difficult issue; nevertheless, it is one that may need to be considered.</para>
<para>As I said earlier, I did not know Van Nguyen, but he was a young man who had much to live for. He made a mistake for which, unfortunately, he paid with his life. Common human decency, however, tells us that this young man’s punishment far outweighed the severity of his crime. His death was therefore senseless and cruel. Although it should serve as a warning to other young Australians, unfortunately it will not, such is the cold reality of the lucrative world of drug merchandising. For me and other Australians, the Van Nguyen tragedy serves not only to remind us of the fragility of human life but more importantly to reaffirm the need to uphold the sanctity and the dignity of human life. We have a duty and particular governments have a duty to preserve, protect and, indeed, uphold every human being’s inherent right to life. Capital punishment is a violation of that right and we must fight for its abolition.</para>
<para>In conclusion, on Friday many Australians expressed their grief in many ways. A former university professor of mine sent an email to me and no doubt to other people. It is a poem written by a very prominent Greek poet, CP Cavafy. It is about a young man who was executed by hanging and is headed ‘27 June 1906, 2 pm’. I would like to dedicate this poem to the memory of Van Nguyen. It reads:</para>

<para>—Last Wednesday, a scathing 538-page report into the Dr Death scandal was presented to the Premier of Queensland by Commissioner Geoff Davies. This report is the result of a six-month $6 million inquiry that was undertaken at the request of the Premier after allegations that India-trained surgeon Dr Patel was linked to the deaths of more than 80 patients at the Bundaberg Base Hospital. The report is damning. It is damning of a health system that has been out of control and inadequately funded and which has operated under a culture of secrecy. The report said that the former health minister, Gordon Nuttall, had hidden information about a report into Dr Patel, which was ‘at best naive and at worst disingenuous’. The report states:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">Such misconduct was misleading, unreasonable and careless.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">This long-awaited report does not reflect the heartache, the tears and the suffering of so many patients who have survived to tell their horrific stories—stories where patient care was compromised and elective surgery was less than adequate and certainly, in many cases, not safe.</para>
<para>It is important to put on the record how this inquiry came about. In fact, if it was not for one very brave intensive care nurse, Ms Toni Hoffman, this inquiry might never have taken place. But Ms Hoffman, to her credit, blew the whistle. She took her concerns about Dr Patel and the treatment of patients at the Bundaberg Base Hospital to her local MP, Mr Rob Messenger, who detailed her concerns in the state parliament. Ms Hoffman gave damning evidence to the inquiry. She told how she had repeatedly tried to raise her concerns with hospital management and senior doctors but had gotten nowhere. Her courage and compassion on behalf of her patients is to be commended. If she had not taken her concerns to her local member, we might never have heard the true story of the state of Queensland Health.</para>
<para>When the report was delivered last week, Toni Hoffman was at work in her job as nurse unit manager in Bundaberg’s intensive care unit. She said that she and fellow ICU nurses welcomed the charges that had been recommended against Dr Patel and their former bosses, Darren Keating and Peter Leck. Toni Hoffman has been vindicated. Her concerns about the cover-up of Dr Patel have been borne out in the report. Mr Davies found Dr Keating and Mr Leck had displayed a ‘gross dereliction of duty’ in not investigating complaints against Dr Patel. The report recommends that Dr Keating be referred to the Australian Federal Police over allegedly knowingly or recklessly giving false information to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs over Dr Patel’s application for a four-year visa. It also recommends that Dr Keating be prosecuted for official misconduct. As for Mr Leck, the report found that he had failed to check Dr Patel’s qualifications. Dr Patel had been banned from practising in Oregon and New York. In addition, Mr Leck’s failure to suspend Dr Patel may constitute a disciplinary breach that would warrant dismissal.</para>
<para>This inquiry opened on 23 May 2005 and finished with the final report being handed to the Premier on 30 November 2005. Tony Morris QC was the first commissioner to oversee the inquiry; however, he was sacked after 50 days and 85 witnesses by a Supreme Court ruling of apprehended bias. After being dismissed from the inquiry, Mr Morris provided the federal Standing Committee on Health and Ageing with a 33-page submission cataloguing a plethora of systemic problems, serious dysfunction at Bundaberg Base Hospital and a shocking culture of concealment in the bureaucracy. Mr Morris urged that a rapid response team investigate serious clinical problems in Queensland, that there be a review of pay scales for doctors and nurses, and the re-education of bureaucrats to ensure that they were effective rather than remote and aloof. In his report to the standing committee, Mr Morris said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">One of the most urgent needs was honesty about the limitations of the public health sector ... what occurred at Bundaberg is not itself the disease—it is merely an acute symptom of a condition which is chronic, widespread and potentially terminal.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Those are damning statements about the Queensland health system. And what now for the former health minister Gordon Nuttall? We know that several bureaucrats were advised last week that they will face criminal charges or disciplinary action, but their former boss, Gordon Nuttall, has shrugged off the scathing findings on his behaviour and until late last week had his bags packed for an all-expenses-paid, 10-day, taxpayer funded jaunt to Brazil and the United States. Even worse, he was going with the blessing of the Premier. But the trip has now been cancelled, and so it should be. The Premier has refused to sack this minister, despite the commissioner describing his conduct as ‘misleading, unreasonable and careless’.</para>
<para>Gordon Nuttall himself should do the honourable thing and resign. He was the minister in charge. He was aware of what was going on. His departmental staff will pay the ultimate price. He should fall on his sword and take full responsibility for what happened in Queensland Health. Ultimately the buck stops with the minister. Mr Nuttall has rejected all claims made against him in the report in a statement to parliament. This is a man who is currently being investigated by the Crime and Misconduct Commission over allegations that he lied to a parliamentary committee over his knowledge of problems with overseas-trained doctors.</para>
<para>Key recommendations made by Commissioner Geoff Davies in the report include charging Dr Patel with manslaughter and assault, charging him with assault occasioning bodily harm, charging him with negligent acts causing harm and charging him with fraud. It has been reported that relatives of patients who died at the hands of Dr Patel, and the living victims of the botched operations of the so-called Dr Death, are delighted at the charges recommended against him. However, the patients and their families will not experience complete closure to this horrific chapter in their lives until Dr Patel is extradited from the United States to face prosecution in Queensland.</para>
<para>There is no doubt that we have in Queensland a crumbling health system and a premier and a government who will not accept responsibility for the situation we now find ourselves in, even with a damning report—an extensive report—that highlights the grossly inadequate and underfunded public health system, a system that has let down the people of Queensland. They have not enjoyed for many years a safe and effective health system that they can have faith in.</para>
<para>Instead, the finger pointing has begun—the blame game, a game that the Premier plays very well: hand on heart, ‘I will fix the problem; we are an open and accountable government.’ But of course he claims to have been underfunded by none other than the Commonwealth government. Premier Beattie is a master of shifting blame, particularly to the Commonwealth, for the underfunding, but the truth is that the most recent data clearly shows in a June 2005 report that the gap in the underfunding of Queensland public hospitals is growing. Queensland’s recurrent expenditure per person on public hospitals in 2004 was still the lowest in Australia, at $440, which is below the national average of $552 per person. As for the remuneration rates for doctors, Queensland Health specialist rates are low by Queensland and Australian standards. It is no wonder that we have experienced a severe shortage of doctors in Queensland. Now the Premier is on a recruiting drive to encourage doctors back to Queensland, and it is about time.</para>
<para>Gold Coast City has also experienced severe cutbacks as a direct result of a dysfunctional health system, a health system that has been ignored for years and starved of funding, with waiting lists that continue to grow for elective surgery. Only recently I spoke in this House about the blow-out in the number of patients waiting for elective surgery and the shutdown of the cancer treatment ward at the Gold Coast Hospital. Oncology services have been suspended and patients now have to travel to Brisbane—another indictment of the Beattie government.</para>
<para>The Queensland government must be made to answer for the mess the health system is in. The abominable delivery of health services in Queensland has cost lives, and there is nothing as yet to indicate that conditions will improve. This government has put the lives of its citizens at risk, and one would hope that this report will see an end to that culture.</para>
<para>There is absolutely no reason for this state government to short-change its citizens on health care. The Beattie government has received record amounts of funding under the Australian health care agreement. The Commonwealth will spend $42 billion on public hospitals over five years, and $8 billion of that budget will go to Queensland to assist with providing public hospital services to public patients. So one would have to ask: where are these dollars being spent? Why isn’t the state government delivering adequate and safe health services for all Queenslanders? There is also the GST bucket of funding, a growth tax that has seen record dollars delivered to Queensland. In 2004-05 the Beattie government received $7.328 billion. No state has benefited more from the GST arrangements than Queensland.</para>
<para>In Queensland we have experienced boom times with boom revenue, but where has it gone? It certainly has not gone into our health system. With our growing population, it is important to make the right decisions for Queensland’s future, but it would appear that we are moving backwards. Premier Beattie only recently said: ‘Our government are the No. 1 economic managers in the country—ahead of any other state or territory.’ It would appear that Queenslanders are paying a very high price for Premier Beattie’s shallow and bungling style of economic management that does not deliver.</para>
<para>In conclusion, I want to pay tribute to all those involved in exposing the Dr Death scandal. Their courage to speak out will undoubtedly deliver a safer public health system to our state. To those who lost loved ones: I hope your pain diminishes. To those who are left bearing the scars: I wish you well and hope you recover to lead productive lives, free of pain and suffering. This era in Queensland politics has been a nightmare. I hope we can now move on and put this incredible chapter in Queensland history behind us. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I recently received a number of letters from a group of year 7 girls at Kilbreda College in Mentone in my electorate. Lucinda Bishop, Emily Johnston, Taylor Wilcox, Beck Crowe, Alisi Falevai, Nicole Agapitos, Stephanie Hay, Marissa Moro, Lydia Honan, Michelle Mah and their teacher Louise Harms wrote to ask me to encourage my fellow parliamentarians and the government to help make poverty history. These girls have been studying experiences of poverty from around the world. Many of the girls were shocked by the enormous gap in living standards between First and Third World countries. The girls were inspired in their studies by the grassroots energy generated by the Make Poverty History campaign.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Sadly, Australia lags far behind many developed countries in its pursuit of the eight Millennium Development Goals which are at the core of the campaign. One of the goals is a target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income to be spent on foreign aid by developed countries by 2015. Australia’s aid level remains at an embarrassingly low level of about 0.25 per cent of GNI.</para>
<para>In writing to me, one of the girls, Nicole, asked a question I would like everyone in this House to consider. She asked: ‘Are we really doing everything or is there more? If there is, why aren’t we doing it?’ I found myself quite moved by the sincerity and emotion of the girls, which comes through very clearly in their letters. It is a pity that time constraints prevent me from reading more of their letters here.</para>
<para>We are approaching Make Poverty History White Band Day, which is on 10 December. Now is the time to renew our commitment and to redouble our efforts. The girls of Kilbreda College are doing whatever they can to make poverty history. It is to our national shame that the same cannot be said of every member of this House. We can and must do better in our contribution to this very achievable aim. I join the girls of Kilbreda in saying that it is time to get serious: we can make poverty history.</para>
<para>I recently met with a constituent who has campaigned for many years to promote a greater understanding of a heavily stigmatised and often mismanaged disease: Huntington’s disease. Jim Rutherford lost his first wife, his mother-in-law, four sisters-in-law and his youngest son to Huntington’s disease. His eldest son is now in the final stages of the disease. Huntington’s is a genetically inherited, rapidly acting degenerative brain disease. It tends to hit sufferers in early middle age, and its effects can be similar to Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s. Sadly, specialised care for Huntington’s sufferers is almost nonexistent and they are often placed in aged-care facilities. Given that management of the disease involves intensive mental and physical stimulation, aged-care facilities are entirely inappropriate for Huntington’s sufferers.</para>
<para>Mr Rutherford explained to me how frustrated he has been over the years in his efforts to raise awareness of this problem in political circles and in the wider community. Recent scientific developments have given some hope to sufferers; however, a cure for the disease is still many years away. Until that day comes, it is essential that, as a community, we give greater understanding and more effective support to the thousands of Huntington’s carriers in our midst and to the many thousands who are destined to battle the disease.</para>
<para>Isaacs has been short-changed a number of times in recent weeks and will be short-changed on an ongoing basis once some particularly nasty bits of legislation have been passed. Isaacs has been short-changed, firstly, because I have been gagged from speaking on three out of four critical pieces of legislation that have recently been before this House. I was gagged from speaking on the <inline ref="R2436">Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 2005</inline>, on the <inline ref="R2461">Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (Welfare to Work and Other Measures) Bill 2005</inline> and on the <inline ref="R2469">Anti-Terrorism Bill (No. 2) 2005.</inline> I was lucky that I had already spoken on the <inline ref="R2465">Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Bill 2005</inline> when the government gagged that debate. Many of my colleagues have not had the opportunity to represent their electorates in any of these important debates. The second ‘short-change’ is ahead for many people in Isaacs, who will be short-changed once the Work Choices and the Welfare to Work legislation kick in.</para>
<para>I would like to spend some time talking about the issues around the Welfare to Work legislation. The essence of this bill is that the government plans to move people from one form of welfare payment to another cheaper form—that is, those who are already under financial strain will have their incomes reduced. There are no real plans to actually help people move into work. The kindest thing that can be said is that the government is naive and thinks that a lower income will encourage people to look for work. Those of us with a better grip on reality know that most people on the DSP and on the sole parent payment are already working if they can.</para>
<para>For those on the DSP, there are many barriers to finding suitable work, and these measures will make life even more difficult for those already under considerable financial stress. There are a number of myths circulating about the DSP, and these need to be debunked before a sensible discussion can be had about it. The Australian Council of Social Service issued an excellent document in January this year that set out 10 myths and facts about the DSP. I recommend this document to anybody interested in learning a bit more about it. Three of these myths are as follows. The first is that many people on DSP do not have ‘real’ disabilities, just ‘bad backs’. The second is that people who can work part time do not have a ‘real’ disability and should not be on the DSP. The third is that Australia has more people on disability payments than do comparable countries. The facts are that people only get the DSP if they have a severe disability that has been assessed by medical or other experts chosen by Centrelink. People with poor vision or hearing or who use wheelchairs are not the only ones with disabilities that stop them from working full time. For example, over one-quarter of DSP recipients have a mental illness. If your only problem is a back condition, you have to be in almost constant pain or be unable to sit or move around properly to get the DSP. Many people, such as multiple sclerosis sufferers and people with recurring mental illnesses, are able to work part time but cannot hold down a full-time job. Allowing these people to keep the pension while they work part time, as the present DSP rules allow, is sensible because it encourages DSP recipients to look for work. About five per cent of Australians of work force age are on the DSP, which is around the average for wealthier OECD countries.</para>
<para>One of the myths that regularly bobs up is that single parents are all young girls intent on having babies in order to get onto welfare and live an easy life ever after. Those of us with children know that that is a bit of a myth in itself. The facts are that the majority of single parents are aged between 30 and 50 years, less than three per cent are teenagers and 45 per cent of single parenting payment recipients who have school-aged children work. The barriers to single parents working include a lack of education. Sixty per cent of those who are not working have education only to year 10, 20 per cent have recently experienced violence and five to 10 per cent will have moved in the last year.</para>
<para>I would be more convinced about the government’s stated intentions if there were any sign of positive help being offered to those on the DSP or sole parent payment. The rationale of the government seems to be that DSP recipients and sole parents are rorting the system and that a big stick will sort them out. Let us look at the DSP compared with Newstart. I am grateful to the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling for providing the following information. Currently a DSP recipient receives $257 per week compared with the Newstart allowance which is $211 per week—a difference of $46 per week. DSP recipients can earn $64 of income before payments are reduced; Newstart recipients, $31—a difference of $33 per week. The DSP cuts out once private income reaches $706 per week; Newstart cuts out at $398 per week—a massive difference of $308 per week.</para>
<para>Now let us look at the parenting payment single. These figures are based on a person with one child. Currently the PPS is $257 per week. The Newstart payment would be $228, a difference of $29 per week. The amount a parent can earn before payments are reduced is $76. On Newstart it will be $31, a difference of $45 per week. The difference in the cut-out point—the point beyond which the payment stops—is a private income of $718 per week for those on the PPS compared with Newstart’s $426, a huge difference of $292 per week.</para>
<para>We hear about a thing called the effective marginal tax rate. This is the rate at which someone moving from welfare to work loses on each dollar they earn because of the combination of income tax and reducing social security benefits. The effective marginal tax rate for DSP and parenting payment single recipients moving into work from Newstart will be in the range of 70 to 80 per cent. We have heard a lot of talk lately about an argument that a marginal income tax rate for higher income earners of 47c is a disincentive to those seeking more work. If we are going to accept that argument, why on earth are we asking those moving between welfare and work to accept an effective tax rate of 70 to 80 per cent? And we forget the extra costs that come with going to work—the bus fare, child care and buying a clean shirt to wear to work.</para>
<para>Labor supports real welfare reform. We believe that people who can work should and that those who cannot work should be supported, and we recognise the value of looking after young children. Labor wants real reform that tackles the reason someone is not working and that delivers practical solutions.</para>

<para>—I take this opportunity to speak today about a number of issues which are having a significant impact on constituents in the Hume electorate. I will begin with a matter that I have raised already with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and also the Minister for Human Services, as the person responsible for Centrelink. That matter is the administration of this government’s exceptional circumstances relief payments. I am thankful that both ministers have already acknowledged my concerns. However, I would like to place my disappointment on record with regard to events which have occurred during the past few months.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Several weeks ago, farmer constituents in the Hume electorate, in the community of Young in particular, found themselves in a very difficult financial situation because of this government department’s procedural tardiness. Families who had been relying on the exceptional circumstances relief payment were shocked to receive notification from Centrelink that their payments were being cut off. Despite countless phone calls and letters from my office in the weeks and, indeed, months prior to the deadline, the minister for agriculture and his department failed to ensure that assistance was extended in a timely manner. The result for farming families was that Centrelink cut off their payments, and they were left in limbo for close to two weeks before a decision was announced and the payments reinstated.</para>
<para>It is all well and good for the minister’s office to say that payments will be backdated. However, that does not put food on the table or fuel in the truck or tractor for families surviving just above the breadline. And although families in Young have now been granted their extension, at least for a few more months, the same issue is threatening to put an end to Christmas for families in other drought affected areas, including East Gundagai, Yass and Goulburn, the South Coast, Moss Vale, Braidwood and the Central Tablelands. For them, the government assistance runs out this Thursday.</para>
<para>In a letter to me back in September, the Yass Rural Lands Protection Board sought my assistance to ensure that relief would be extended beyond the 8 December deadline. The letter stated:</para>
<quote>
<para>In November 2003, support under Exceptional Circumstances Assistance was granted for the areas covered by the Yass RLPB. The assistance was provided to help producers through one the most severe drought periods in history and through the subsequent recovery period.</para>
<para>Whilst the district has received substantial rainfall throughout winter of 2005, during the remainder of the recovery period the district has endured severe drought conditions. To maintain financial viability and sustainability under these circumstances, a large number of producers have been forced to sell off increasing numbers of their core breeding stock, invest large sums of money in failed crops and the purchase of fodder supplies.</para>
<para>Sheep numbers in the district have dropped approximately 20 per cent and beef cattle by 10 per cent from 2001 to 2005. Whilst this may seem relatively insignificant, it equates to 274,700 sheep and 6,224 cattle. This is a significant number when it comes to rebuilding flocks and herds.</para>
<para>The Yass RLPB would like to bring to the attention of the Federal Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry the fact that this district was in drought for the term of the EC recovery period and is in fact still drought declared. Time and support is required for producers to rebuild their stock numbers, fodder supplies and to try and recover some financial backing which has been drawn upon so heavily during this period.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I understand that the government cannot enter into decisions lightly and that decisions must be based on solid fact. My complaint is that, to date, investigations have not been conducted, results examined and recommendations considered by the minister within a reasonable time frame. This is not just numbers on paper but people’s lives and futures we are talking about here.</para>
<para>I call on the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry to ensure that, come Thursday, families in the rest of Hume will not have to face the same stress and uncertainty as those rural producers at Young which I referred to earlier. This issue is too important to linger at the bottom of some public servant’s ‘to do’ pile or on the desk of a government minister. This decision needs to be made now so that families can make plans not only for this Christmas but also for the months and the years ahead.</para>
<para>I move on now to an issue which has angered residents in the Hume electorate for a very long time. Petrol prices may have begun to fall in our metropolitan areas. However, in country areas, including Goulburn in the heart of my electorate, prices remain at more than $1.20 a litre. Late last week, for example, the local Shell service station in Goulburn was selling unleaded petrol for 123.9c a litre. On the same day, the same fuel in Young, in the western part of the Hume electorate, was selling for 127.9c per litre. Meanwhile in Picton, still in the Hume electorate but on the outskirts of Sydney, fuel was just 109.9c a litre. That is a price differential of 18c per litre between an outer metropolitan petrol station and a rural one.</para>
<para>According to the Australian Automobile Association’s FuelTrac pricing summary, unleaded petrol in the Sydney metropolitan area during October 2005 averaged 124.6c per litre, with a top price of 139.9c per litre. In Goulburn, by comparison, the average price for October was 135.9c per litre, with a top price of 143.5c per litre. That is an 11c difference in the average price of fuel between the city and a rural area. On several occasions I have contacted the ACCC to report this price difference and the way in which fuel prices locally fail to move in line with the price of oil, only to be told that unless collusion could be proved there was nothing they could do.</para>
<para>The government so often points out that fuel prices are driven by world oil prices and market forces. However, as was pointed out in the media this week, Caltex has reported that its profit per barrel of oil increased from $7.28 to $11 this year, as consumers in many areas paid more than $1.40 a litre for their petrol. To my constituents, that is highway robbery. Surely when we talk about keeping the economy strong we should also be thinking about how we can ease the burden of high petrol prices on Australian families. It is what Australian families want.</para>
<para>Moving on now, what Australian families also want is affordable and accessible health services. Like all members in this place, I know that the provision of hospital services is a state responsibility. However, the situation is getting so bad in New South Wales that I am starting to feel, and my constituents are starting to feel, that it is time for the federal government to step in and put pressure and conditions on the state government for all Commonwealth funding. In one local example, it was reported recently that the Greater Southern Area Health Service owes somewhere in the vicinity of $7 million to its medical staff and suppliers. So bad is the situation that, in one case, a woman who had gone through the trauma of a mastectomy—and, might I add, I know this woman personally—went to her local department store to be fitted with a prosthesis and was told that they could not help her because the health service had not paid its account. The hardworking Liberal state member, Daryl Maguire, had to step up and pay for the prosthesis himself, and I compliment him for doing that. What sort of government can allow this sort of thing to go on?</para>
<para>The local branch of Country Labor cannot even get action from their own government, so Country Labor members have organised a rally, to be held in Goulburn this coming Sunday, to protest against any downgrade of Goulburn health services as a result of both the health service’s current financial position and the shortage of nursing and medical staff. Country Labor have their hands tied, because we all know they are restricted to public posturing, as any effective action taken against the Iemma state government will break caucus solidarity and see their members expelled from the ALP. The rally will also recognise the wonderful job that nurses, doctors and other health personnel do for the community. On the day of the rally I have commitments elsewhere in the electorate, but the point I make is that there is an increasing concern within the community about these important health issues. Our hardworking local doctors, nurses and health personnel deserve better.</para>
<para>Constituents in my electorate are constantly asking me to do something about the state of health services both in Goulburn and elsewhere in the electorate and, as a committed local member, I will do everything I can do to assist. In a letter to me recently, one very vocal and passionate advocate issued a plea:</para>

<para>When you and I were boys things were different: our local hospitals—St John’s, the Base and Kenmore—were LOCAL, run by local administration and serviced by local organizations such as Hospital Auxiliary, Pink Ladies, and service clubs. Our women and children, the elderly and mentally ill were well looked after.</para>
<para>Wonderful things have happened with health services over the years but unfortunately it has not all been good, particularly now when people are being turned away from hospitals because there is a lack of staff/accommodation, expectant mothers have to travel to centres an hour away, the mentally ill wander the streets and contribute to the ever growing population of homeless people.</para>

It has gone beyond the political posturing being undertaken at the moment. It is a serious issue and it needs to be addressed.</para>

<para>—I join the member for Hume in his indictment of the Howard government’s shocking and systematic failures in the area of health. Of course, most of the things he mentioned are things that the Howard government could address if it chose to, but it refuses to do so. I rise to grieve also about a health issue—that is, the shameful record of the Minister for Health and Ageing and, in particular, his failure to heed the advice of his experts not to take calcium tablets off the PBS for people who need them for osteoporosis. I grieve not only on my own behalf but on behalf of the oldest and sickest Australians, who will disproportionately bear the impact of this policy. I also grieve on behalf of the Australian Medical Association, which wants the federal government to rethink its decision to remove calcium tablets from the PBS. As you would be aware, there is an old song that goes, ‘All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth’—a child’s song, of course. Unfortunately, this Christmas there are too many older Australians who are saying that what they want for Christmas is their calcium tablets. But, like the Grinch that stole Christmas, the minister for health, Tony Abbott, is denying them access to this basic dietary supplement, which is so important to their health.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, you would recall that in the last election campaign the Howard government gave a rock solid, ironclad guarantee to maintain the Medicare safety net, and its failure to honour its promise on the safety net now is a matter of public record and public consternation. We should also note that during the last election campaign the Howard government made no mention of what it was planning to do to the PBS safety net. But, since the election, it has hacked into the PBS safety net, including by increasing the thresholds to qualify and excluding from the safety net many prescriptions filled within 20 days of the previous prescription. There is only one goal here, and that is budget savings.</para>
<para>These measures come at a time when the data show that the growth in PBS spending has slowed to 2.5 per cent, down from an average of 12 per cent over the past four years. This slowdown is due primarily to the 21 per cent increase in copayments—that is, the amount that patients have to pay to access medicines—introduced in January and does not as yet fully reflect the impact of the 12.5 per cent generics pricing policy. More particularly we see, in the four-month period from 1 July to 31 October, that there was a decrease of over 1,300,000 scripts over the same period last year. Given that the growth rate in PBS scripts over this time frame has averaged 3.8 per cent over the previous four years, the decrease is really around 3.8 million scripts in that four-month period. More work needs to be done on these statistics, but I think we are right to exhibit real concern that there may be millions of times that people are making a decision not to fill their scripts because of lack of affordability, and such a drop in the access to prescription medicines requires careful analysis.</para>
<para>PBS spending in that same time frame has dropped from $2.2 billion in 2004 to $2.034 billion in 2005. Given that the growth rate in this time period over the previous four years has averaged 13.3 per cent, the savings are actually $461 million in four months. If these trends continue we can expect to see savings for the year 2005-06 of $1.38 billion on the PBS and 11.4 million fewer scripts being filled—and that is before the implementation of the new safety net provisions.</para>
<para>The government seems certain to meet its savings targets, but at what cost? Who is missing out on medicine when we look at these statistics? I think we are right to fear that it is the poorest and sickest Australians who are missing out. Depending on what medications they are failing to take due to affordability issues, it may not really be a saving at all, as the consequences of not taking their medicine show elsewhere in the health system when they need other forms of care.</para>
<para>The decision to take calcium tablets off the PBS is a clear example of what happens when you look for a saving today but do not give a second thought to the costs tomorrow. In making this decision the minister for health has completely disregarded expert opinion and sound policy. The minister for health was in a rush to find savings to deliver to the Treasurer in the lead-up to the last budget. On that basis of rushing around and looking for savings, he decided to remove calcium tablets from the PBS to achieve savings of $36 million over four years. That is a $9-million saving a year.</para>
<para>What damage has this rush for savings—a rush for savings that was done without expert advice—created? That is right. I think Australians need to clearly understand this: the Minister for Health and Ageing in the budget decided to take something off the PBS without any expert advice. If this were to keep up, what else would be coming off the PBS when he is looking for a saving? Cancer medication, antidepression medication, cholesterol-lowering medication; are they things that are going to be ripped off the PBS next when the minister for health is looking for savings?</para>
<para>We know that the cost of calcium tablets to the government when they are on the PBS is around $13 a bottle. This means that the cost for concession card holders who are accessing calcium from the PBS has gone from $4.60 to around $13 a bottle. We should note that it was not everybody who could have access to calcium on the PBS. You could not just get calcium on the PBS because you felt like taking a supplement; calcium on the PBS was only available on authority from your doctor and the doctor was required to certify that the patient needed calcium tablets. Only then were you subsidised by the PBS.</para>
<para>The minister for health was the subject of a great deal of criticism after he took this decision. Instead of getting expert advice before the decision, he sought expert advice after the decision. He consulted the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee about his decision. They sent him some advice. He sent that advice back to them for review and then they sent him some further advice. That advice stated that they were:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... concerned that ... patient groups would not be optimally treated if they ceased taking calcium tablets should they become less affordable by de-listing.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">So the experts told Tony Abbott, the minister for health, that he had made a mistake and that he ought to put calcium back on the PBS. What the minister did in the face of this expert advice was to complete half a humiliating backflip. He backflipped on the question of the provision of calcium tablets to people with kidney conditions, who need a lot of calcium. But he has not backflipped on the rest—which is what he should do, no matter how humiliating the decision for him.</para>
<para>The people who have been left without access to PBS calcium tablets are people with osteoporosis. This is a disease that costs Australia $1.9 billion per annum in health costs, putting a heavy burden on hospitals and nursing homes. It costs a further $5.6 billion in indirect costs. It represented a total of 1.2 per cent of GDP in 2000-01, or $389 for every Australian. The mortality rate for hip fractures in the elderly is high—about 20 per cent in the first 12 months. Elderly Australians around the country have been raising this issue, including at a seminar held by the member for Richmond, where one of the attendees stood up and said she had voted for The Nationals all her life but would no longer do so, specifically because of this decision.</para>
<para>This decision is a disgrace. It came into effect on 1 December. I am using my first parliamentary opportunity to raise it. This decision needs to be reversed. The minister for health should stop pretending to be the Grinch who stole Christmas and actually do something positive for the health of Australians before we leave this parliament. The positive thing that he should do is accept the advice of experts, recognise he was wrong when he desperately clutched for budget savings and put calcium back on the PBS.</para>

<para>—I rise in this debate to grieve about the way a water by-product of the mining and extraction of coal bed methane gas from the Surat Basin is merely being left to evaporate away. There are many companies in the Surat Basin extracting coal bed methane and obviously being able to find a ready market for the methane gas. This is a technology that even 10 years ago was in its infancy. Twenty years ago, coal bed methane was just lost to the environment as part of a coalmining operation. It is really about value adding to the coal industry and being able to utilise something that would otherwise have been wasted.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I will explain to the House this afternoon how the coal bed methane is extracted from these coalfields. First of all, they drill to find the reserves and then they have to extract the gas. As they extract the gas, a large volume of water comes up with the gas. Why is that? The water molecule is larger than the gas molecule; so, as part of the extraction process, the water comes up to the surface ahead of the gas, as I understand it. The companies that are mining the coal bed methane gas, obviously stripping the gas from the water, are able to process it and feed it into the Roma-Brisbane pipeline to supply industries in Brisbane. There are gas pipelines that head north to Gladstone and Townsville. So an invaluable source of energy is being extracted from the Surat coal bed, and coming up with it is water.</para>
<para>The problem with this water at the moment is that it carries salts with it, and it has to be cleaned up if it is to be used in any way other than perhaps in an industrial sense. An industrial use, for instance, could be to wash coal, as the coal industry develops in that part of Queensland. There are a very large number of feedlots in that region which require water. More water will be required as both those industries expand in the future. One of the first things that industries require before they invest capital is a known reserve of water, whether it is in the development of the coal industry or whether it is in the feedlot industry. Both of those industries really are being held back through the lack of guarantees of an available or suitable water source.</para>
<para>Here we have a known water source which is a by-product of the coal bed methane being sold for purposes within Queensland now. Why, on the driest continent on earth, are we allowing this water that comes up as part of the coal bed methane extraction process to be merely evaporated away? It is beyond me. These companies are not doing anything illegal; it is quite legal. One of the conditions of their licence is that they can actually evaporate this water away.</para>
<para>I want to talk a bit about the Queensland Gas Co. It has put a proposal to the federal government, under the National Water Initiative, for financial assistance to build a water pipeline so as to be able to sell this water into markets in the Condamine-Murray-Darling Basin system, particularly for towns in that region. The Queensland Gas Co. is to be commended for its actions because it wants to amend the use of the water, which is merely being evaporated away now, and to use a process of reverse osmosis to provide potable water for urban communities. Some of the water that is a by-product of that reverse osmosis process could also be used for industries.</para>
<para>The size of the known water reserves that, over the next 20 years, will be extracted from the fields that the Queensland Gas Co. is operating in at the moment is quite staggering. There are something like 352,000 megalitres of water that is known to be available over the next 20 years just from the current extraction wells of the Queensland Gas Co. There are other wells in the region from other companies. North of Roma, where I live, I know that for a number of years they have been evaporating the water away once they have extracted the coal bed methane. There is a large number of them. But, going back to the proposal of the Queensland Gas Co., 352,000 megalitres of water is known to be available over the next 20 years.</para>
<para>The City of Toowoomba right now has a proposal, under the National Water Initiative, in front of the federal government for some money to secure more water or to have more sustainability in their water supply. Toowoomba is a city of some 95,000 people and it needs something like 14,000 megalitres of water per year. To put that into context, that is 352,000 megalitres of water over the next 20 years just from the operations of the Queensland Gas Co. that will evaporate unless something is done to assist companies to utilise this water in ways other than just evaporating it away. Put another way, 352,000 megalitres of water would provide enough water for 20 years for 2.388 million people. That gives you some idea of the sheer magnitude of the water that will be evaporated away unless something changes in the way we use it and unless financial assistance comes from both the Queensland and the federal governments.</para>
<para>Progressive towns in my electorate—Dalby, Chinchilla and Miles—are all looking with great interest at this water source. They recognise that, if they are able to buy this water at affordable prices—because at the end of the day they would have to on-sell this water to the residents of these local council areas—and if they are able to enter into contracts with the Queensland Gas Co. and other companies that are in this industry, it will release water from their sources now into the Condamine-Balonne-Murray-Darling Basin system. In other words, if we are able to see a process whereby this water is not evaporated away but is put through a process of reverse osmosis and then the potable water is made available to these shires—and I know the Chinchilla Shire has shown a great deal of interest in this—then we will see a market for that water. The water would be released and, I would suggest, they would be then able to sell their current allocation of water out of the Condamine River. That would be a win-win situation for the community and for the environment because it would release that water for other purposes downstream or for environmental flows.</para>
<para>Mr Deputy Speaker, you can see that what I grieve about this afternoon is that, whilst current licensing conditions allow these companies that are in the coal bed methane extraction industry to merely evaporate water away, we must do more than that in the future. I am supporting the application of the Queensland Gas Co. under the National Water Initiative for financial support for that project because of the benefits that will flow to industry, the community and the environment. At the end of the day we will be utilising a resource on the driest continent on earth. It is one of the most valuable resources we have—I could almost say that it is more valuable to us than the coal bed methane gas itself. We have to use water better in the future, and I am strongly in support of seeing this water not being evaporated away but utilised to a greater extent for industry and the community.</para>

<para>—Before my contribution to this second reading debate on the <inline ref="R2444">Tax Laws Amendment (Improvements to Self Assessment) Bill (No. 2) 2005</inline> was interrupted by question time last Thursday, I had made a number of comments about how tax issues had troubled the Treasurer during the whole time he has been in that position. The pressure placed on the Treasurer by the opposition last week, and obviously by the coalition backbench, resulted in the resignation last Friday of the cause of the Treasurer’s latest tax problem—Mr Gerard.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The resignation of Mr Gerard from the board of the Reserve Bank is proof of the poor judgment of the Treasurer in appointing him in the first place. Despite the strong protestations of government members who have said that the government had no influence over the decision of Mr Gerard to resign, I find that a little bit difficult to believe. The whole affair demonstrates the poor judgment of the Treasurer in this regard. I found it particularly interesting to read the comment of an unnamed coalition member who is reported to have said—</para>

<para>—In deference to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will do that, but I think my comments reflect on the bill in terms of the decisions being made by the Treasurer, who is responsible for the administration of the tax act. The Treasurer’s problems with taxation do not stop with what occurred last week. As my colleague will probably be able to attest, there was correspondence from coalition backbenchers to the Treasurer—which I referred to last week—that detailed a couple of key issues of concern about this very piece of legislation. It said that, firstly, the legislation should more fully reflect the Treasury recommendations contained in the review of self-assessment report; secondly, the legislation should have specific application to the groups who complained and prompted the Treasury review; thirdly, the legislation should apply retrospectively; and, finally, there should be greater controls on the commissioner’s ongoing ability to retrospectively and unilaterally make determinations.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>As I said last week, that correspondence was sent by coalition backbenchers to the Treasurer to consider in relation to this legislation. I have no doubt that these are pretty insightful comments but at the same time they offer a damning criticism when they are ignored. And that is precisely what did occur—they were ignored. Unlike the Treasurer in this regard, Labor are willing to consider the issues that have been raised by the coalition backbench. We on this side of the House are willing to take the tax proposals that were rejected by Treasurer Costello and would be prepared to give effect to them as appropriate. I urge all of the signatories to that correspondence to the Treasurer, who have expressed concerns about this bill, to have the courage of their commitment and stand up to the Treasurer. You are on common ground with us in many respects on this matter.</para>
<para>While I feel that the provisions of this bill could have gone further—and, as a matter of fact, should have gone further—I do support the increase in the level of certainty that these changes bring to Australian taxpayers. Having said that, I cannot rise to speak on a bill concerning issues of tax without passing comment on the pretty feeble attempt by the Treasurer to reduce the pages of the income tax legislation by, as he claims, 30 per cent. According to the Treasurer’s media release on 24 November, the Board of Taxation estimates that 2,100 pages of the combined income tax assessment acts can be repealed. The Treasurer claims that this is the largest simplification of tax legislation in Australian history. Of course it is: the tax acts have become so unwieldy that cutting out 2,100 pages is by any means a considerable change. The Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 have a combined total of 6,450 pages. When you take into account the ancillary legislation, there are, as I understand it, some 10,000 pages of legislation.</para>
<para>So the Treasurer has decided that it is time to give the 25-centimetre thick, four-volume tax assessment acts a bit of a prune. This will only get them back to the level of the taxation acts he inherited back in 1996; he will only be able to prune the tax assessment acts back to the size when he got control of the legislation in 1996. That is not reform. Sure, it is important that periodically we do act to trim the size of legislation by removing clauses which are redundant, cumbersome or infrequently used—but let us not kid ourselves: that is not reform. Unlike other so-called reforms by government—such as the Work Choices or Welfare to Work provisions, which tear at the very fabric of Australian society—throwing out clauses in the tax acts that have passed their use-by date is hardly radical reform.</para>
<para>It seems that the Treasurer has lost even the modicum of reformist zeal that he had at the start of his nine years in office in control of the tax system. The Australian taxpayer has nothing to fear from these reforms—mind you, they have little to gain either—but at least there is nothing hiding in the fine print as is the case with many other initiatives of this government. The only changes that the Treasurer has set about making to the tax laws since he has had carriage of them have resulted either in pages being added to the tax laws or in middle Australia missing out on tax cuts. In 1996, the tax acts were 3,500 pages long. Now there are nearly 10,000 pages of tax law—a threefold increase. The Treasurer’s record is not a thing to be admired when it comes to tax reform, and it seems that the coalition backbench is starting to work that out.</para>
<para>Under the Australian income tax system, if you are an ordinary PAYE taxpayer you pay tax. You are not able to avoid tax like some millionaires around the country seem to be able to. I understand that before the 1996 election both parties were advised that it was possible for millionaires to reduce their average tax bill to around 25 per cent. At that time that rate was below the rate that would have been paid by ordinary working Australians on $40,000 per annum. Nine years later, we have the highest taxing government in Australian history and what does a recent study from the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research show us? It reports that the nation’s wealthiest households are still paying a tax rate of around 25 per cent. What a sensational effort by this government: after nine years and a threefold increase in the number of pages in the tax acts, the wealthiest Australians are still enjoying a tax rate below that of ordinary working Australians.</para>
<para>Working Australians in my electorate would love nothing more than to be able to minimise their tax to the same extent that the Treasurer continues to allow the richest among us to do. It is quite clear that there are deep-seated economic inefficiencies contained in Australia’s current taxation regime. A tax regime that allows the highest of income earners to pay less tax than the average income earner has got to be seen as being in desperate need of repair. As the Treasurer said himself in the lead-up to the 1998 election:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">High tax rates mean rich people spend more time and money on tax planning to reduce their tax liabilities. Low-income earners who cannot afford such advice keep paying more tax.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">He is dead right about that. This makes complete sense when you consider taxation statistics which show that almost half of all individual taxpayers seek professional taxation advice that produces a total deduction in the tax system of around $1 billion annually. When individual taxpayers consider it necessary and in their interests to spend $1 billion on tax advice, surely we must realise that there is something crook in the system.</para>
<para>When you dig a bit deeper into the tax statistics, the case for reform of income tax starts to become somewhat overwhelming. Probably the biggest inefficiency—and the greatest opportunity for rorting the tax system—comes about because of the sometimes very generous claims for work related deductions that are allowed. Don’t get me wrong: work related deductions are often necessary and do reflect the fact that in order to work many people sometimes need to make purchases directly related to their occupation. But, given the current level of deductions, you would have to ask a couple of questions. In the 2002-03 financial year, there were some 10.7 million taxpayers who reported a total income of $381.2 billion. A total of $20.7 billion was claimed in deductions, about half of which were work related deductions. When billions of dollars are claimed in work related deductions, it seems to me that these deductions are starting to move away from the reasons for which they were introduced and to become means of lowering taxable income and avoiding or at least minimising tax liabilities. While the Treasurer feels that lopping off redundant and unused parts of the tax acts is radical reform, there is an overwhelming need to address Australia’s income tax system at a more fundamental level. I take this opportunity to again call on the government to get serious about tax reform, to get serious about putting incentive back into the tax system and to get serious about providing tax cuts for the more than 80 per cent of income earners in my electorate of Werriwa who missed out on the tax cuts in the last budget and are now seeing their money locked up in a $14 billion surplus that this government seems to have little desire to let go of.</para>

<para class="block">Okay, if there is opportunity for amendment in that regard, and considering the fact that day after day in this place the opposition complain about their lack of opportunity to properly examine legislation, surely now is the time to put forward amendments of substance and have a discussion and a debate about them. They say these opportunities for debate are so important to them when, of course, if anyone listened to their contributions on the IR legislation, for instance, there was constant repetition of ‘the sky is falling in’ and no proper analysis of the legislation being debated—then or now.</para>
<para>It is not too hard to talk constructively about legislation of this nature. In a speech earlier today, I gave a tick to the member for Rankin for his very sensible remarks about petrol pricing. I live in hope that, when I conclude my contribution, he will bring some light to this debate in terms of positive measures to deliver to the Australian people the simplicity, certainty and equity that define a good tax. But he does not have much opportunity because, presumably, his caucus or his executive have decided that the amendment I just read out is the opposition’s position on this legislation.</para>
<para>I have said in this place time and time again that good tax law will be the responsibility of this parliament, not the government of the day. But I can say with some pride that when the Hawke government and, for that matter, the Keating government brought matters of substance into this place that gave the impression of being good for Australia, such as floating the currency and other matters, it was the opposition, of which I was a member, that said, ‘Good on you.’ I have said before—and I want to seriously discuss this bill—that when Keating as Treasurer proposed the sale of the Commonwealth Bank he was able to get that through caucus as an icon issue for the Labor Party because he could tell them there would be no mischief emanating from the coalition opposition. We believe in privatisation and we supported that measure. As I recollect, there was criticism by the minor parties in the Senate that they were sidelined in the debate because the two major parties actually came to a decision that they believed was right for Australia.</para>
<para>In tax particularly, where scare campaigns are so easy to run, it is time that there was a bipartisan view. It is not helped by the member for Werriwa complaining that his constituents did not get a big enough tax cut. When he is next handing out material that asks people to vote for him, he wants to just check out how many of his constituents actually fell into the previous 42c level. Obviously not all of them would have, but I will bet you there were too many. Of course, it is a fact that, many years ago, to break into those top marginal rates you had to earn 15 times average weekly earnings. Today the figure has reduced to between one and two—I am not sure exactly where it is at this moment. It is silly, it is wrong and it is not fair. It is not equitable. Therefore, there is an ongoing battle in the broader context of tax to have a review of taxation.</para>
<para>I note frequently people standing up and saying, ‘You can only erode revenue so far.’ I do not disagree with that. The Australian people, sometimes unwisely, seem to be more interested in having cash for an overseas trip than to pay the doctor. That is their view; it is not one to which I subscribe. On the other hand, governments are expected by the people to raise money to defend the country and provide certain services. That does not mean that we cannot revisit the structures of tax. As I have informed the House before, there are numerous ways that would allow us to reduce high rates of tax, which I think are very regressive, without significant reduction in revenue. It is not appropriate for me to go through those today having just suggested to another member, who got widely off the issue of income tax, to not speak about it.</para>
<para>The explanatory memorandum gives us clear advice that the principal outcome of this legislation is to address a serious problem for the community—that is, the legal capacity of the tax commissioner to revisit self-assessment arrangements years after the event. Having assessed that the claims previously made by a taxpayer were not consistent with the law—most taxpayers have never had the financial capacity to take the commissioner on in the courts, unless it is a collective decision—the commissioner can say, ‘You avoided x dollars tax. I am applying a 50 per cent penalty and interest rates as high as 11 or 12 per cent compounded up until the point of advice, until the point I have told you that I think you are wrong.’</para>
<para>Those who have dealt in the usury market would soon discover how gigantic compound interest can be. It can double a debt in a very short period. Some taxpayers, shocked by this arrangement, are sometimes reassured by, for instance, promoters of various schemes who say: ‘You’ll be right, mate; hang in there; we are going to take the tax office to court.’ If and when the taxpayer loses, the clock has continued to tick up until that point.</para>
<para>That is not good enough. An example that really concerned me was when a group of taxpayers sought relief from tax by contributing to an agricultural program that had received a product ruling from the tax commissioner of being acceptable under the tax act. Yet, later on, this group received a request for huge amounts of money because, in the view of the tax commissioner—eventually supported by a court—the promoter of the scheme had not complied with all aspects of the ruling. That is fine. You had better sue the promoter. Who does that? These taxpayers were not advised in a short period of that matter. The very high interest rate clock continued to operate.</para>
<para>This legislation is doing something about that. More particularly, it is a step in the right direction. Nevertheless, I am concerned that, if a taxpayer has made full disclosure of all their affairs—which I think is fundamental to self-assessment—but in that process has claimed a deduction for a scheme or other matters that might be in dispute by the tax commissioner, there needs to be a prompt response.</para>
<para>It appears that this legislation, in the normal course of business, will limit the tax commissioner’s opportunity in which to respond to a fair and reasonable tax return to two years. That to me is a fair and reasonable proposition. I am less enamoured of the fact that, where a scheme is involved, the response can be extended to four years. It is better than the never-never plan of the past, but it is still a long time if the clock is to be clicked back to the day of lodgment of the return. I may stand corrected by the member for Rankin, but my understanding is that this legislation says that the commissioner has up to four years but that the clock starts ticking after he writes back. I believe that that should be a component of any legislation. In other words, you cannot be charged, in the case of full disclosure, with interest or penalties until you get an objection to your self-assessment from the commissioner. I will continue to campaign for that arrangement.</para>
<para>I have been told by a very senior member of the tax office that that is possible. I have argued directly to the tax office on behalf of the people of Australia that you ought to be able to have a yellow, red or brightly coloured form that you put on the front of your tax return—I do not know how you transmit that electronically, but we are into coloured copiers now, so maybe it can be done—which says: ‘Red alert! I have participated in the woop woop scheme. Everything I tell you in this return is true. This is how much money I have taken, but I am claiming an additional reduction in my tax of $5,000’—or $10,000—‘because of my participation in this scheme.’ If you give that sort of notice, it seems simple to me that the commissioner’s clock has to start ticking. I would think that in those circumstances something measured in days, or a very short period of months, would be available to the commissioner in which to say, ‘No, I’m not happy with that. I advise you to pay your full tax. On the other hand, if future debate proves I’m wrong, I’ll give you your money back.’ Wouldn’t it be nice if the commissioner added a bit of interest!</para>
<para>The reality is that, whilst this legislation goes part of the way, it unfortunately does not address the circumstances that many people have found themselves in. There has been some moderation of the commissioner’s claims, and I thank the ATO for that. And this legislation does clear up a lot of the grey areas. It is summarised by the advisers in this area in the explanatory memorandum under ‘Summary of regulation impact statement’, which says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The new law will provide improved ways for taxpayers to find out the Commissioner of Taxation’s (Commissioner’s) view on how certain laws apply, so that the risks of uncertainty when self assessing, or working out their tax obligations or entitlements, are reduced. This is achieved by:</para>
<para class="block">making rulings available to many taxpayers on a wide range of matters;</para>
<para class="block">ensuring that the Commissioner provides rulings in a timely manner;</para>
<para class="block">enabling the Commissioner to obtain, and make rulings based on, relevant information;</para>
<para class="block">protecting taxpayers from increases in tax and from penalties and interest where they rely on rulings;</para>
<para class="block">limiting the ways the Commissioner can alter rulings to a taxpayer’s detriment; and</para>
<para class="block">giving protection from interest charges where a taxpayer relies on other advice from the Commissioner, or on the Commissioner’s general administrative practice.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">All that is positive. I am in here to support the legislation. But I would have been much more comfortable if there had been a greater degree of retrospectivity. I voted against retrospective tax in this place when it was an imposition on the taxpayer. It was a very lonely day. I think six of us sat in splendid isolation on one side of the parliament whilst the entire Labor opposition and the then Fraser government members sat on the other side. We must have gone very close to the problem that Harry Quick had the other night with another piece of legislation.</para>
<para>The reality is that we held out very strongly against negative retrospective tax law or, for that matter, any negative retrospective legislation that shifts the goalposts after the event. I stand by that. But, as this would have been a positive measure, I think that probably we ought to have had a better response to taxpayers who got trapped in the schemes for an inordinately long period. I am not arguing in this place that people who incorrectly reduced their taxation should have got away with paying the tax. But if the ATO is unable to advise them of the failing of their request within a few months, it becomes unfair to the taxpayer, presuming they have made full disclosure. This legislation does not exclude people from the normal processes of the previous tax act where they have taken fraudulent or other actions that are means of evasion. The explanatory memorandum tells us:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">The unlimited amendment period for cases of fraud or evasion will continue to apply.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">I am not putting any argument there. But, where people make a full disclosure of their income and consequently seek to have certain reduction in that amount of money, then, if they do that through appropriate advice, they should not be subject to any penalties or interest until the tax commissioner disagrees with their claim. That is not part of this legislation at this point. I trust that the parliament might one day decide that that is a good idea.</para>
<para>As I said, when the parliament can get up and bring in a much more simplified tax system, it could be reduced to not many more items than exist in the new IR legislation when it comes to awards. That would be a good idea. I am a great supporter of the GST. It should be collected at a level that fully compensates the states for all their regressive taxes. I do not think they have one that is a good idea. When people are paying $30 a week throughout their life in stamp duty on their personal residence, that is just an example of how bad some of those taxes are.</para>
<para>All in all, I support this legislation. I would have liked it to go further, but I reject any suggestion that at this point in time the opposition has made any productive contribution to the legislation. Considering the public announcements of the member for Swan, the opposition had a responsibility to put up some decent amendments if it believed in them.</para>

This bill arises out of concerns expressed in recent years by taxpayers and accountants in circumstances where the Australian Taxation Office issues an amended tax assessment—often, in the process, overturning previous advice which taxpayers had relied upon. Bills like this, of course, go to the heart of the integrity of our tax system and the stewardship of our tax system. As I speak, we now know that Mr Ron Walker was told by Mr Gerard about his tax problems prior to the appointment of Mr Gerard to the Reserve Bank board.</para>

<para>—It seems that everybody knew about this particular tax problem except the Treasurer, Peter Costello. As every day goes by, the Treasurer gets in deeper and deeper. I say that it is about time the Treasurer came clean on these matters and told the truth. The public has had enough of the Treasurer’s false denials.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>But let me go back to the bill. Public concern led to a process of review announced by the Treasurer in November 2003. The Review of Aspects of Income Tax Self Assessment was intended to examine whether an appropriate balance had been struck between protecting the rights of individual taxpayers and protecting the revenue for the benefit of the whole community. This bill introduces the recommendations from the review that require legislative change.</para>
<para>In particular the bill proposes, firstly, to reduce the time period within which the ATO can audit a taxpayer—reducing it from four years to two years for those with simple tax affairs and from six years to four years for taxpayers with more complex affairs. Secondly, it proposes to alter the process by which tax rulings are made: to ensure that, where a taxpayer relies upon ATO advice, including oral advice formally requested, that taxpayer will be free from penalties; to expand the situations in which the commissioner is bound by advice tendered to the taxpayer; to specify time limits for the provision of a ruling; to allow the ruling to be made electronically; and to give the commissioner more flexibility about the date at which a ruling applies.</para>
<para>On the whole the Labor Party sees the proposals contained in this bill as progressive and, as such, it will be supported<inline font-size="14pt">.</inline> The nature of our income tax system, with its self-assessment regime, is that it seeks to ease the administrative burden on taxpayers when complying with tax law. The system operates to a large degree on trust, with taxpayers submitting details of their arrangements to the ATO without substantiation per se. However, the system places an onus on individual taxpayers to substantiate their affairs should the ATO conduct a review. Such reviews and detailed audits, if necessary, are conducted on a risk basis, depending on the particular taxpayer’s affairs and whether particular claims are in excess of what would be expected for a taxpayer in similar circumstances.</para>
<para>At most times the system works well; sometimes it does not. It is difficult to get the balance right. There will always be those who seek to exploit the system and avoid paying their fair share of tax. We have seen plenty of debate about that in recent weeks in this parliament. People want to know that the system is administered in an impartial way and that all taxpayers are treated equally. People want to know that there is not a double standard in the tax system, one for a few select mates of the government and entirely another for those struggling small businesses who are coping with the GST and for those working taxpayers who are paying PAYG tax.</para>
<para>On the other hand, there are sometimes occasions when taxpayers find the law confusing and request clarification from the tax office. Typically, they receive advice and act on it in good faith. Occasionally, the tax office may revisit this advice and issue amended assessments to those taxpayers who originally relied on the tax office’s advice. These taxpayers in turn feel aggrieved at this retrospective action, even though the amended assessment is often made with a more contemporary understanding of the tax law, in the light of emerging circumstances that have the potential to threaten the tax base. Given such events, the changes made in this bill are a step in the right direction.</para>
<para>The changes in this bill to make rulings binding in more circumstances and to reduce the time frame for issuing amended assessments should increase the onus on the tax office to get it right the first time. This is a good thing, but ultimately these changes are a compromise. They are an attempt to rebalance the relationship between the taxpayer and the tax office, as each grapples with an overly complex tax system—for we do, of course, have a complex tax system. We now have some 9,500 pages of tax law—up from some 3,500 pages when the government was elected over nine years ago. Those pages include current and inoperative provisions and thousands of pages of taxation rulings and determinations.</para>
<para>Surely if we are interested in improving the administration and fairness of the system we should tackle the root cause. Tedious and overly complex tax law will always result in more disputes than simpler laws. There is a need for simplicity. The truth is we need a simpler tax system that is easier for taxpayers to comply with and for the tax office to police. That is why the integrity of the tax system is so important. That is why the person administering the tax system and its integrity must be seen to have acted in an impartial way and must be seen not to be favouring one particular taxpayer over classes of other taxpayers.</para>
<para>Now, despite promising to cut the burden of red tape, the Treasurer has ‘slashed’ the number of pages in the tax act from an estimated 3,500 to more than 9,000. Given this record, it was extraordinary to see the Treasurer’s announcement on 24 November about cutting some 2,000 pages from the tax act by repealing inoperative provisions. He heralded this as a major reform, but it was a joke. Indeed, he went on to claim that this was ‘the biggest overhaul of legislation that has ever been done in Australian history.’ I kid you not. The truth is this is not tax reform; it is just window-dressing. Ridding the act of provisions that are no longer current is a good thing, but it is not reform; it is just housekeeping. The farcical thing is that tax practitioners will still need to keep the 2,000 pages of inoperative provisions, so that they can deal with retrospective tax assessments.</para>
<para>The truth is, if the government were concerned about simplifying the tax law, they would look at truly streamlining it. That would mean revisiting the complex system of deductions, concessions and tax offsets that have seen expenditures explode under the coalition. It would also mean looking at ways to simplify the way that tax is administered and the way individual taxpayers interact with the tax office. For example, why doesn’t the government contemplate measures that have the potential to end the annual grind of completing a fully-fledged tax return? Plenty of ideas have come forward, like streamlining annual income tax returns by simply issuing assessment notices to those with a history of simple claims and asking them to verify the assessment as is or amend it as necessary. Such a system could deliver significant administrative savings and ease the burden on taxpayers.</para>
<para>I urge the Treasurer to consider proposals such as these. He has not had such a good time of late when it comes to tax, Mr Deputy Speaker—you may well have noticed that—but we know he collects record amounts of it. He is the highest taxing Treasurer in Australian history. That tax take is built off the back of ordinary taxpayers on low and middle incomes, who expect to be treated fairly. I urge the Treasurer to stand shoulder to shoulder with those taxpayers rather than with a few of his mates from the Liberal Party, as he has been doing in recent weeks in this parliament. He needs to reduce the tax and compliance burden. It is a reform that is essential for the economy and one that would be pivotal in boosting our nation’s productivity. These are all substantive issues, and they need to be addressed. The bill we are debating today is a small improvement, but it does not lessen the obligation on the Treasurer to come into this parliament and tell the truth about Mr Gerard.</para>

<para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2444">Tax Laws Amendment (Improvements to Self Assessment) Bill (No. 2) 2005</inline>. I am pleased to support the amendments to our tax laws in this bill. These are measures designed to improve certainty to taxpayers, particularly in two areas: time frames for tax audits; and public, private and oral rulings. These two areas have caused a great deal of uncertainty in recent years and this is a very important series of amendments to our tax laws.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I am pleased to speak to the amendments in this bill because of the distress that uncertainty in the past has caused many individuals, including a number of my constituents who have been adversely affected by what are commonly known as mass marketing schemes as well as employment benefit arrangements—people who believed they had sound advice from financial agents and who acted on the advice of these promoters in schemes that were understood to be legal ways of minimising tax. In many cases the Australian Taxation Commission has altered interpretations, causing great financial and emotional stress to individuals. The changes in this bill will in future remove much of this uncertainty and the associated potential for distress.</para>
<para>As the member for Canning has done before me, I would also like to thank the member for Longman, Mal Brough, for the initiative he has taken as Assistant Treasurer to see sensible settlement of outstanding cases and for his introduction of these amendments to the House, amendments that should help in the future by ensuring that the commissioner is bound by undertakings made. The bill provides a capacity for the taxpayer to rely on public and private rulings or oral advice formally requested from the commissioner without penalty, even if that advice is subsequently deemed incorrect or the commissioner’s interpretation subsequently changes.</para>
<para>The main aim of the tax administration system is to collect revenue with a minimum of compliance and administrative costs. To this end our tax system has operated via a self-assessment system since 1986. Under this system taxpayers’ returns are accepted in the first instance and the tax office may subsequently review the accuracy of the information in the return within a prescribed period. Essentially, the self-assessment system requires taxpayers to perform certain functions and take some responsibility that was previously taken by the tax office. Under the old system taxpayers provided the tax office with the relevant information and the tax office then assessed their liabilities accordingly. Under this system the obligation to the taxpayer was to provide full and true disclosure and the assessment was left to the ATO. After the tax office made assessments they could amend an assessment that had an error of fact or calculation but could not fix errors of law. Under this system taxpayers had a measure of certainty, while the costs to the tax office were borne by the community as a whole.</para>
<para>However, under the self-assessment system the ATO still issues notices of assessment, but returns are generally taken at face value, subject to a post-assessment risk based audit and other verification checks. Under the self-assessment system the tax office is allowed to amend errors of calculation, fact and law after processing the assessment or paying a refund. The self-assessment system changed the balance of cost and risk between the tax office and the taxpayer. The self-assessment system also allows for more efficient use of tax office resources so that more revenue can be collected for less revenue costs.</para>
<para>In the early nineties problems had been identified with the self-assessment system. The problems related to the penalties and interest and the need to provide greater certainty to the taxpayer. We are still trying to come to grips with some of these problems. When the balance changed between the cost and risk of the ATO and the taxpayer under self-assessment, some of these problems emerged due to penalties and interest and the need to provide greater certainty accordingly.</para>
<para>In 1992 the Keating government brought in the Taxation Laws Amendment (Self Assessment) Act, with the most notable changes being a new system of binding public rulings, a new system of binding private rulings, an extension to four years of the period within which a taxpayer could object to an assessment, a new system requiring penalties for underassessments of income tax liabilities based on the requirement that taxpayers exercise reasonable care and a new interest system for underpayments or late payments of income tax based on commercial principles and market interest rates.</para>
<para>Since coming to office in 1996 the Howard government has shortened the period of review for taxpayers with straightforward affairs; introduced binding oral advice; reduced the interest rate on shortfalls and late payments; and introduced the office of the Inspector-General of Taxation, a new statutory office with governance responsibility. This brings me to the current review and the new legislation against those matters introduced since 1986 and subsequently amended and improved.</para>
<para>In December 2003 the Treasurer announced that the Treasury would be conducting a review into the self-assessment system. The review was asked to consider whether certain aspects of the self-assessment system achieved the right balance between protecting the rights of individual taxpayers and protecting the revenue stream to benefit all Australians. The review was not asked to consider fundamental tax policy changes. These amendments do not go to fundamental tax policy changes.</para>
<para>In 2003 the review considered a wide range of issues and held discussions with many groups. Following the initial analysis, in 2004 the Treasurer released a discussion paper and 30 comprehensive submissions were received. Key comments in the submissions were criticism of the accessibility of advice from the ATO, criticism of uncertainty in relation to ATO interpreted decisions—this has been the underpinning of much of what we have in front of us today—criticism about private rulings and great concern that the penalties for failing to follow a ruling discouraged people from applying for private binding rulings unless they were confident of getting a favourable ruling. The discussion paper was amended in the light of those submissions and the final report was released in December 2004. The government subsequently announced that it would adopt the 30 legislative recommendations made in the report.</para>
<para>This bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Taxation Administration Act 1953. Schedule 1 of this bill reduces the periods during which the commissioner may amend income tax assessments in a range of circumstances. This is a very important provision. For most individuals with straightforward returns, the period will be two years. Currently it is four years. The majority of taxpayers will fall into this band. A four-year period will apply to taxpayers with more complex affairs. These can include people who carry on a business which does not participate in the simplified tax system; a taxpayer who is a beneficiary of a trust estate; a taxpayer who has entered into or carried out a scheme for the sole or dominant purpose of obtaining a scheme benefit; and other special cases as prescribed by regulation.</para>
<para>The period of review and amendment of assessments involving arrangements with the dominant purpose of avoiding tax will be four years. Fraud or evasion cases will continue to have an unlimited amendment period. These amendments apply to assessments for the 2004-05 income year and later income years and are a very important part of improving the certainty associated with many of these tax issues.</para>
<para>Rulings are the second major area of this legislation. The tax office gives a wide range of advice to taxpayers and their representatives about how, in the tax office’s opinion, tax law applies or would apply. That advice ranges from general information for the public to advice relating to specific taxation arrangements. Since 1992 the tax law has made certain categories of advice, called rulings, binding on the tax office. There are three kinds of rulings: public rulings, private rulings and oral rulings. Oral rulings were enacted in 1999 in response to a range of recommendations. They are available to individuals who apply to the tax office for a ruling on the way in which the income tax law applies to them. Oral rulings are only available on interpretive matters that are straightforward or simple, and they are legally binding on the Commissioner of Taxation if they result in a lower amount of final tax payable by the taxpayer.</para>
<para>The object of the new system in front of us is to provide improved ways for taxpayers to find out the commissioner’s views on applying certain laws and to reduce the risk of self-assessing. Previously, the commissioner was able to give public and private rulings only on issues of tax liability. This included income tax, withholding tax, mining withholding tax, Medicare levy, fringe benefits tax, franking deficit tax, venture capital deficit tax, overfranking tax and product grant and benefit laws. Under the new system, the commissioner will be able to make rulings on the above, plus on matters of administration and collection of those taxes in relation to the rulings regime.</para>
<para>Another new measure under this package is that, where oral advice is provided by the tax office and is reasonably relied upon by the taxpayer, that taxpayer will not have interest or penalties imposed. Also, the new measures will mean that, if an oral ruling is sought in writing, there is protection granted against an amended assessment which would impose a higher primary tax. This bill will also give taxpayers further protection when they rely on advice or other administrative practices of the tax office. Currently, when a taxpayer relies on other advice or general administrative practices of the tax office, the taxpayer is protected from penalties but does incur interest on the tax debt. In many cases, this has caused enormous distress and great uncertainty, with serious bills mounting up. In some cases, businesses have gone to the wall because of this uncertainty and the interest on this tax debt. Under the new system, a taxpayer will be protected from both penalties and interest when relying on other advice or general administrative procedures.</para>
<para>Documents outlining rulings can include any publication that the commissioner makes, such as fact sheets. If a document says it is non-binding, these new provisions do not apply. In addition to the above, this new bill provides that the tax office will produce rulings in a style that is simple and easy to understand. In the submissions received by this inquiry, one of the issues that featured was the difficulty for the general public in understanding public rulings.</para>
<para>There have been some serious problems in many parts of Australia across many groups. The provisions and the uncertainty have been used and abused by those advocating schemes that have caused much uncertainty to many law-abiding people. People who acted in a way that they thought was legal have subsequently suffered from changed determinations by the tax office. This bill will provide a greater level of certainty for taxpayers by expanding the current self-assessment system, giving protection to taxpayers in a wider range of circumstances. I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para>—The reason the parliament is debating the <inline ref="R2444">Tax Laws Amendment (Improvements to Self Assessment) Bill (No. 2) 2005</inline> is straightforward: the income tax system is riddled with lurks and loopholes. The complexity of the tax system has increased astronomically under this government and the opportunities for avoidance have risen commensurately.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I was a member of a House of Representatives inquiry into mass marketed schemes. That inquiry was originally about employee share ownership arrangements and ostensibly was about more closely aligning the interests of employers and employees through concessionary arrangements for the acquisition of shares by employees. But the inquiry unearthed a very high level of tax avoidance, not only through employee share ownership schemes but, much more prevalently, through managerial arrangements where very well paid executives got into tax avoidance through schemes that were promoted aggressively by unscrupulous operators. That inquiry heard evidence that a conservative estimate of the contributions to such schemes was $1.5 billion. We on the Labor side suspected that it would be much larger than that, because that estimate was not much more than a back-of-the-envelope calculation.</para>
<para>There has been a proliferation of private binding rulings, and this legislation clarifies the rules applying to those rulings. In that sense, it is welcome legislation and Labor supports it. But, to give you some idea of the dimensions of the problem, during the inquiry about which I spoke we heard evidence on 11 May 2000 from officials of the tax office that every year the tax office would issue over 3,000 private binding rulings. That is an astonishingly large number of private binding rulings and it certainly does highlight the complexity of the tax system.</para>
<para>During the winter recess, while that inquiry was still under way, the Auditor-General issued a report entitled <inline font-style="italic">The Australian Taxation Office’s administration of taxation rulings</inline>. On page 99 of that report, it says:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">For the calendar year 2000 the ATO issued 89,779 PBRs ...</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">No, you have not misheard me: it was not 8,900 private binding rulings but 89,779 in one year. Upon further investigation, it became clear that a large number of those were in relation to the so-called streamlined new tax system for the new century, the GST, which was meant to simplify tax arrangements. It had obviously done anything but that, as evidenced by the fact that the tax office in one year alone had to issue such a massive number of private binding rulings.</para>
<para>I have not been successful in obtaining information from the government on how many private binding rulings have been issued since then. I do believe that it would be in the public interest for us to know that. I am not sure that it is a state secret, but I am sure that the government is a little reluctant to provide that information. So, in anticipation of the debate, today I have lodged questions in writing. We will see if we have more luck in this term of the parliament in getting answers to those questions. I certainly will be pressing the matter if we have a repetition of the situation in the past, where I have put questions on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>, have pleaded with the Speaker to get answers from the Treasurer and have been unsuccessful right through the term of the parliament. At the end of that parliament, those questions lapse. Then you start all over again and he just sweats it out for another three years. He will not get away with it this time. I will make a very big fuss about it if these basic figures are not provided.</para>
<para>Further evidence of the poor state of repair of the income tax base in Australia is provided by the annual statement of tax expenditures. These are basically the concessions, the tax breaks, that are available, which do cost money in revenue forgone but also have the characteristic of making the income tax system ever more complex. That does not mean that Labor or I oppose every such concession. For example, superannuation tax concessions are very important in promoting retirement incomes in this country. But, again to give you an idea of the dimensions of these concessions, there are now more than 240 tax expenditures and fully 89 of those have been created in just the last nine years of the coalition government. So, from the beginning of the Income Tax Act—I think it was 1932—through to 1996, in excess of 150 were created, but another 89 have been created in the short space of time since then. It shows that the income tax base in this country is under siege. It is under siege from a Treasurer who seems to place no weight on the integrity of the income tax system in this country.</para>
<para>Further evidence of that are the new business tax arrangements that were introduced in the year 2000. Some members will recall the Treasurer sitting at the table, completing the negotiations with the then shadow Treasurer, the member for Hotham. The whole basis of those negotiations was that, yes, there was a case for reducing the company tax rate from 36c to 30c in the dollar but that this would be self-financed. That is, it would be revenue neutral, paid for by removing some of the tax concessions, the tax breaks, in the system and therefore providing a simpler company income tax system. Quite important in that equation was legislation related to the alienation of personal services income, which meant that sham contractor arrangements would be seen through by the income tax system. We supported that legislation, but the long and short of it is that, very recently, documents that were obtained by the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper under freedom of information legislation revealed that the government has no idea as to how that particular piece of legislation is working. In other words, it has not put any genuine effort into enforcing the legislation that was part of that arrangement between the two major political parties in this country.</para>
<para>I would also point out that part of that arrangement was the taxation of trusts in the same way as companies. The Treasurer signed a letter saying that would be part of improving the integrity of the income tax system, but he was rolled by the National Party. Here we have the Treasurer of the country being rolled by the member for New England, who himself was then rolled out of parliament. But the member for New England rolled the Treasurer and the government reneged on that commitment.</para>
<para>You do get a sense from what I am saying—89,000 private binding rulings, 240 special tax breaks, the breaking of promises in relation to improving the integrity of the income tax system—that this Treasurer does not have his heart in doing what he should be doing: his job of ensuring that there is tax integrity and some tax morality in this country. Indeed, in the past week the Treasurer has done more to debase tax morality in this country than any Treasurer for 25 years. It is a big statement and goes a long way back. But when we do go back 25 years to what I am referring to we reach the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes, when the previous Liberal Party Treasurer, now the Prime Minister of Australia, presided over a massive tax evasion industry. It was called tax avoidance at that time, but it was outright evasion. They were contrived schemes. The Treasury begged the Treasurer of the day to legislate against the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes—the wet Slutzkins and the dry Slutzkins. He was dragged kicking and screaming, by Labor, to do something about it. The Treasurer of the day, the now Prime Minister, did not want to repair the income tax base back then. As a result, the remaining honest taxpayers were left with a top marginal rate of 60c in the dollar.</para>
<para>Let us remember that the top marginal tax rate under the Fraser-Howard government was 60c in the dollar. In fact, the relevant marginal rates were all high because the government needed to obtain from honest taxpayers the revenue that was being avoided or evaded by dishonest taxpayers. Does that sound familiar? Come forward 25 years and here we have the same Liberal philosophy; that is, if you have some wealthy mates who can go their hardest in avoiding or evading tax, this government almost says that that is a legitimate activity. The government turns a blind eye to it. As a result, we have had high marginal rates of income tax incurred by people who are not necessarily wealthy but who are honest—and that is the difference. The honest taxpayers confront the high marginal rates of tax.</para>
<para>The <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> newspaper, through a survey called HILDA, was able to confirm that the wealthiest Australians do not pay the top marginal rate of 48½c in the dollar. In fact, their average tax bill is about $28,000 a year, which is less than would be paid by an honest taxpayer earning $100,000 a year. For the very wealthy, the income tax system in Australia is essentially a voluntary tax, as it was when the current Prime Minister was the Treasurer of this country during the notorious bottom-of-the-harbour arrangements.</para>
<para>I say that the Treasurer has done more to debase tax morality in this country than any other Treasurer has for 25 years on the basis of the defence that he launched in favour of Mr Gerard. I recognise that I do not have the time to go through all of the statements that the Treasurer made in defending Mr Gerard, so I will point to only a couple to illustrate that point. The Treasurer said that Mr Gerard had ‘broken no law’. He got whacked with a penalty tax of 45 per cent. A penalty tax of 45 per cent is applied by the tax office in the case of blatant, contrived tax evasion arrangements. I do not think tax evasion should be condoned in this country, but the Treasurer spent last week saying that Mr Gerard was a fine man and a fine person to have on the board of the Reserve Bank. The Treasurer also said in this parliament that Mr Gerard had not avoided one dollar of tax—that was not for want of trying. Mr Gerard tried his little heart out to avoid paying $150 million of tax, but in the end he was caught by the tax office and defended stoutly by the Treasurer. The Treasurer said:</para>

<quote>
<para class="block">... Mr Gerard is eminently suitable to be a member of the Reserve Bank board.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">There you go: someone who has been whacked with a 45 per cent penalty tax is eminently suitable! That tells us a lot about the philosophy of this government and about the approach of the Treasurer.</para>
<para>I do not always praise the member for Wentworth, Mr Turnbull, but on this occasion he has had the courage to say that the way to reduce high marginal rates of tax in this country is to repair the income tax base to remove some of these lurks, concessions and loopholes. That is what the member for Wentworth has been saying and he is right. Every self-respecting economist in Australia will tell you that the way forward for tax reform is to repair the income tax base and use the proceeds to reduce the marginal rates of tax that cause genuine disincentives in this country.</para>
<para>I have argued long and hard, and will continue to do so, that a very important rate to reduce is the 42c rate. The 42c rate is paid by one million taxpayers who earn between $70,000 and $125,000 a year. One million taxpayers at present confront the 42c rate, but within the next three years 400,000 more taxpayers will confront it. They will move from a marginal rate of 30c to a marginal rate of 42c. These are people who are trying to get ahead, who are deciding whether to go for promotions and whether to work overtime—and 42c is a pretty steep rate.</para>
<para>In a prebudget submission that I lodged with Treasury, upon invitation by the Treasurer to anyone who wanted to make a submission in advance of the budget, I suggested that an instalment could be made in the forthcoming budget to reduce the 42c rate to 36c, on the way to its total abolition—halfway, indeed, to its total abolition. If that were to happen, think of the sort of system we would have. Ninety-seven per cent of taxpayers would face a top marginal rate of no higher than 30c in the dollar. That is genuine incentive. That is the restoration of incentive to work hard and to improve oneself.</para>
<para>I differ from the member for Wentworth where he argues that the most important rate to reduce is the top marginal rate of 48½c in the dollar, counting the Medicare levy. That rate is paid by three per cent of taxpayers. It is clear to me that the much stronger case is to abolish the 42c rate.</para>
<para>But then we have to consider the forgotten people. Who are they? The forgotten people are those who are on incomes of between $22,000 and $52,000 a year. The parliament will be astonished with this fact: under this government, between the year 2000 and the year 2008, the forgotten people—hairdressers, receptionists, account clerks, metalworkers, farmhands and hospitality workers—will have had a tax cut totalling—wait for it—$4 a week. This is the famous ‘sandwich and milkshake’ tax cut that was delivered by this government in 2004. Yet by 2008, in that period, through bracket creep alone—that is just with the effects of inflation—they will be paying extra tax of between $17 and $31 a week.</para>
<para>The reality is that the forgotten people—those of them who do not have children and therefore do not benefit from increases in family payments or any family payments at all—are footing the bill for the family payments system, which has been extended in this country to the very wealthy. The forgotten people are being smashed by this government. They are being hit with incentive-crushing, high marginal rates of income tax, yet they will have had one tax cut, and one tax cut only, of $4 a week in the entire eight-year period from 2000 to 2008.</para>
<para>Their lot could be improved in a very affordable way by giving them a tax cut of $12 a week. How do we do that without making it completely unaffordable? The answer is: by increasing the low-income tax offset from $235 to $625 and converting it into a weekly or fortnightly pay-as-you-go payment. So they would get $12 a week, which is double the derisory tax cut that low- and middle-income earners received in the last budget; but the cut in the 42c rate to 36c would deliver very substantial tax cuts and improvements in incentives for people earning between $70,000 and $125,000. This proposal is a proposal for genuine reform. It is a down payment on an ultimate reform package that I also outlined in that submission. But, if we are going to genuinely achieve reform in this country, we must repair the income tax base.</para>
<para>This legislation simply highlights the numerous tax lurks, concessions and holes that this Treasurer has poked into the system, very much at the urging of those on his backbench. That is why people get into trouble with mass-marketed tax schemes—because the promoters of these schemes are forever saying, ‘I can give you 100 per cent return overnight if only you get into this scheme.’ People get into the scheme, get into trouble and the rest, as they say, is history. We support this legislation, but Labor fundamentally support genuine tax reform. That means repairing the income tax base in order to fund reductions in the high marginal rates of tax faced by people on welfare and by those in the middle-income and higher income reaches as well. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R2444">Tax Laws Amendment (Improvements to Self Assessment) Bill (No. 2) 2005</inline>. I probably will not be speaking about Robert Gerard this evening, because this amendment bill is really not about the high-flying, high-avoiding taxpayer. It is very much about the average taxpayer who pays their fair share, largely through PAYG—about eight million individual taxpayers and about 745,000 very small businesses that do the right thing and deserve the trust of our government in a way that Robert Gerard does not.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Firstly, I would like to comment on the name of the amendment bill. In the last couple of weeks we have seen this government play very loose with names when it comes to the truth. We have seen a Fair Pay Commission which is not fair; Work Choice, which is not about choice; and Welfare to Work, which is not about getting people to work. When I first saw the name of this bill, ‘Improvements to Self Assessment’, I found myself thinking, ‘Oh no, they’re going to scrap self-assessment,’ because so far we have found very much with this government that the bill’s name usually reflects the exact opposite of the intent. But I am pleased to say that this bill really is about improvements to self-assessment, and it really does achieve substantial gains. I have not had much good to say about this government in the last couple of weeks, but I would like to acknowledge that this is a substantial improvement for nearly eight million individual taxpayers and 745,000 small businesses.</para>
<para>These amendments came about thanks to a report called <inline font-style="italic">Report on aspects of income tax self assessment</inline>, released by the Treasurer in December 2004. The review commenced in November the preceding year and examined whether the right balance had been struck between protecting the rights of individual taxpayers and protecting the revenue for the benefit of the whole Australian community. There were 30 legislative recommendations made in the review. The first of the bills which gave effect to some of these changes, the Tax Laws Amendment (Improvements to Self Assessment) Bill (No.1) 2005, was passed into law earlier this year with the support of the opposition. This second piece of legislation gives effect to the remainder of the reforms.</para>
<para>It is very rare that I would commend this government for acting quickly. Many reports brought down during the term of this government have been ignored completely. This is one case where there has been quite speedy action, although the calling of the review could have taken place a number of years earlier. The review recommended a number of refinements to the current self-assessment system that will reduce uncertainty and compliance costs for taxpayers while preserving the tax office’s capacity to collect legitimate income tax liabilities.</para>
<para>Our current self-assessment system was introduced in 1986-87 by the Hawke-Keating government. Under the self-assessment regime, taxpayers’ returns are generally accepted at face value in the first instance. A taxpayer submits their return to the ATO. Once the ATO receives the self-assessment—the tax return—it issues a notice of assessment. It is that assessment which creates the formal obligation to pay tax. Underpinning this whole process is the notion that the vast majority of taxpayers can be trusted—that they will act in good faith. Given the sheer complexity of tax law at the moment, one must also accept that even taxpayers acting in good faith will from time to time make mistakes in good faith. This amendment bill certainly recognises that.</para>
<para>The ATO does not usually check the accuracy of the tax return before sending out the notice of assessment, but it can, and often does, do it later. The ATO may verify the accuracy of the return and, if it so decides, amend its assessment of the tax return at a later time. The ATO now has the power to reopen assessments after many years. This leads to considerable uncertainty for taxpayers and many calls for constraints on the Commissioner of Taxation’s capacity to enforce payment and penalties long after the original tax return has been submitted. Concerns of this nature have received some attention recently because of schemes propagated by a number of promoters and mass-marketers. Many people were caught by these schemes, even though they appeared to be quite legitimate and the commissioner had given rulings which appeared to legitimise them.</para>
<para>This amendment makes substantial improvements to the self-assessment system and substantially swings the balance of power in the relationship between the Australian Taxation Office and the taxpayer towards the taxpayer. It moves the balance of fairness markedly in favour of taxpayers who act in good faith, and it does so in two main ways. It reduces the time period in which the ATO can audit and amend an assessment. For a taxpayer with simple tax affairs, it reduces the period from four years to two years and, for those with complex tax affairs, from six years to four years. For eight million individual taxpayers and 750,000-odd very small businesses, this creates certainty and closes the door on their tax returns within a reasonable time frame.</para>
<para>One unusual element in respect of the government’s approach to this amendment is that the bill does govern for people who behave well. I have said in this House recently that many of the past amendments to legislation that have been introduced by this government, whether they be about super choice, industrial relations or welfare to work, assume that the vast majority of people behave badly and that most people will break the law unless forced not to. This amendment, however, does completely the opposite. It builds on a level of trust that was established by the Keating and Hawke governments. It assumes that people act in good faith, and it does so until they are shown to have acted otherwise. It trusts taxpayers, and it reduces the time given to the ATO to revisit assessments to the minimum time required to do the job. In doing so, it reduces uncertainty for the taxpayer, or at least it does so for taxpayers who are doing the right thing. Where the ATO believes there is fraud or evasion, an unlimited amendment period continues to apply. The unlimited amendment period kicks in with cases of deliberate bad behaviour—that is, people who engage in calculated behaviour to avoid tax.</para>
<para>The amendment recognises that taxpayers need to operate in a state of certainty about the law. It recognises that people who seek the advice of the tax office and act on that advice should not be penalised later if the tax office changes its mind. The tax rulings system has been controversial for many years. Taxpayers have rightly complained that the commissioner can change his interpretation or withdraw a ruling after the event. There has also been consternation about relying on oral advice from the ATO and facing penalties later when the ATO changes its mind.</para>
<para>This bill outlines a whole new process by which private and public rulings are provided. There are a number of key changes. Firstly it ensures that, if a taxpayer relies upon ATO advice, including oral advice, the taxpayer will be free from penalties. An oral ruling can be requested, which becomes binding and provides protection from imposition of any additional primary tax and a later increase in the quantum of the original tax owing prior to interest or penalties—in other words, if the ATO gives the taxpayer advice and the taxpayer acts on that advice, the taxpayer is protected from changes later on. It expands situations in which the commissioner is bound by advice given to the taxpayer, and it specifies a time limit of 60 days on the provision of a ruling. After this period, the taxpayer can request a ruling within 30 days. If the commissioner fails to respond, this can form a valid objection to the commissioner’s assessment. Again, this provides a level of certainty for taxpayers making decisions about the way they conduct their affairs on a day-to-day basis. Originally the government planned that the legislative changes recommended in the review would apply to assessments from the 2004-05 income year. It did not meet that deadline; nevertheless, from December 2004 until now is really quite fast for this government, where we sometimes wait several years for promised action.</para>
<para>There are many who quite rightly criticise the government for the dramatic growth in the sheer height of the tax law. We do not deal with it in numbers of pages anymore; we measure it in inches. This amendment does simplify the tax regime for many taxpayers. It does not reduce the number of pages in the tax act, but it does make life simpler for hundreds of thousands of small businesses and millions of everyday taxpayers. Unfortunately it does not go far enough for the taxpayers already caught by past advice from the tax office, which some of my colleagues on this side of the House and some on the government’s side have already mentioned. We on this side would have liked to have seen some protection for those taxpayers who acted in good faith and have been caught much later in the ATO net. There is also a remaining unresolved issue about how the ATO will keep records of its oral advice so that taxpayers can be free from penalties when relying upon this advice, but on the whole they are small amendments. This is quite an effective amendment that provides certainty for millions of Australian taxpayers.</para>

<para>—I would like to thank all the members who participated in this debate for their contributions. The main objective of Australia’s tax system is to efficiently raise the revenue required to facilitate the good running of the country, the maintenance of things such as aged care, pensions, the Defence Force—and on it goes. We try to collect this revenue with the minimum administration and compliance costs possible. The <inline ref="R2444">Tax Laws Amendment (Improvements to Self Assessment) Bill (No. 2) 2005</inline> goes to the heart of these issues.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>On 24 November 2003, the Treasurer announced a review of aspects of income tax self-assessment. The review examined aspects of Australia’s self-assessment system for income tax to determine whether the right balance had been struck between protecting the rights of the individual and protecting the revenue for the benefit of the whole Australian community. The review concluded that a number of refinements to the present arrangements were needed to improve certainty and reduce compliance costs for taxpayers without significantly affecting the capacity of the tax office to collect legitimate income tax liabilities.</para>
<para>This bill continues the process of reform of self-assessment by implementing the remaining legislative recommendations of the report. The first schedule of the bill makes a number of changes to reduce the period during which the Commissioner of Taxation may amend income tax assessment in a range of circumstances. The period in which the commissioner can amend an assessment for most individuals or very small businesses will be standardised at two years. A four-year period of review will apply for taxpayers with more complex affairs.</para>
<para>The period for review and amendment of assessments involving arrangements with a dominant tax avoidance purpose will be four years. This will reduce the current period, which is known as part IVA, antiavoidance provision, from six years and also applies to other cases with a dominant tax avoidance purpose. Where a taxpayer returns a nil tax liability for an income year, the taxpayer will have a limited period of review, either two or four years depending on the complexity of their affairs, rather than an unlimited period of review, as is presently the case.</para>
<para>Many people have suggested that the review of self-assessment provisions should be retrospective. This suggestion has been made in the light of the mass marketed schemes that were prevalent in the mid-nineties. This argument is often raised as a result of those issues, but if the government were to do that it would throw into doubt every assessment that has been lodged in good faith and would create an enormous amount of uncertainty. The commissioner, I might add, would still have four years to amend the circumstances for those individuals, so it is doubtful that many, if any, of those caught unfortunately in the mass marketed schemes would benefit from the retrospectivity of this particular bill.</para>
<para>Making the shorter review period recommendations retrospective would potentially reverse many amended assessments, including those based on general antiavoidance provisions in income tax legislation. It would also restrict the Commissioner of Taxation’s ability to raise amended assessments for those years, despite the claim of tax benefits being considered to be unavailable under the law. I am sure no genuine, honest member of parliament would want to see that happen. In such circumstances, the proposals would be unfair to those taxpayers who had correctly self-assessed their tax liability but who subsequently settled their disputes with the ATO. Moreover, retrospective operation would invalidate action taken by the commissioner that was sanctioned at the time, with a dramatic consequence for taxpayers’ confidence in the system. This is the reverse of what the review of aspects of tax assessment has set out to achieve.</para>
<para>The amendments proposed in this bill should be considered in a broader context. This government has a good record when it comes to improvements in tax administration, and this bill is merely the latest in a long list of changes. As the review points out, over the last few years this government has shortened the period of review for taxpayers with straightforward tax affairs, introducing binding oral advice, reducing the rate of interest on shortfalls and late payments, and introducing the office of the Inspector-General of Taxation, a new statutory officer with the responsibility for investigating systemic tax administration issues.</para>
<para>While dealing with the issue of binding oral advice, I know a couple of members, including the member for Parramatta, who is in the chamber currently, asked a question seeking clarification as to how that would apply. It is a valid question. This has always been a bone of contention with taxpayers who say that they have rung the ATO and been given some advice but it is not binding and they cannot clarify who it was from. Approximately $11 million has been allocated by the ATO to improve oral ruling systems, including introducing a voice recording system. An oral ruling includes a registration identifier—in other words, a number—so that the ruling can be identified, if required, at a later time. This is under proposed subsection 360-54 of schedule 1 to the Taxation Administration Act.</para>
<para>In line with recommendation 2.24 in the report of aspects of income tax self-assessment, which is an administrative recommendation, the ATO has purchased voice recording equipment which, when it is fully rolled out, will provide a more robust recording system for oral advice. The first phase of the implementation of the new oral advice recording system will occur from early 2006. To put everyone’s mind at rest, this will allow taxpayers to ring the ATO to get either binding tax advice or a ruling. They need to keep that number in their records so that, if they are ever audited or questioned at some stage further down the track by the ATO, they simply quote that number and it will refer to a particular oral ruling that has been provided. This is a quantum leap forward from where we have been in the past. It provides certainty and confidence to taxpayers that the advice and the rulings that they are receiving can be relied upon.</para>
<para>Importantly, schedule 1 to this bill improves certainty by reducing the periods allowed for the Taxation Office to increase a taxpayer’s liability in a wide range of situations. Around eight million individuals and over 745,000 very small businesses will have a shorter period of review. The changes will take effect with the assessment of the 2004-05 and later years of income.</para>
<para>The second schedule to the bill implements a better framework for the provision of tax office advice. The tax office presently gives a wide range of advice to taxpayers and their representatives about how, in the commissioner’s opinion, the tax laws apply or would apply. That advice ranges from general information to the public to advice relating to specific taxpayers and arrangements. This schedule expands the current advice and ruling framework in scope and effectiveness to provide protection in a wider range of circumstances. I thank the member for Parramatta for her acknowledgment of that very fact.</para>
<para>Under the new framework, all tax office advice provides a level of protection for taxpayers who have acted in good faith and who have reasonably relied on that advice. In addition, this schedule expands the categories of legally binding advice to cover matters of administration, procedure and collection. Importantly, this schedule improves the arrangements for taxpayers to find out the commissioner’s view about how the taxation laws apply so that the risk of uncertainty when they are self-assessing is reduced. The changes will take effect from 1 January 2006 or from royal assent, whichever is the later. The measures contained in this bill are important steps in improving the taxpayers’ experience of the self-assessment system. The government is committed to improving certainty for taxpayers by improving the Australian taxation system, and this bill is just another example of that commitment.</para>
<para>The member for Hunter raised one other issue I will deal with before closing, and that was in relation to the shortfall interest charge changes applying retrospectively. This bill does not contain the government’s shortfall interest charge changes at all. Those changes were dealt with by the parliament in the Tax Laws Amendment (Improvements to Self Assessment) Bill (No. 1) 2005, which received royal assent on 29 June 2005. Those changes are not part of this bill at all.</para>
<para>For the reasons I have outlined above, I commend the bill to the House. I am sure that Australian taxpayers will have a better relationship with the tax office and continue to have strong confidence in the tax office. Most importantly, they can now get things such as oral rulings, know that they are binding and have confidence that the advice they have received can be relied upon. The period that taxpayers have to retain their records, the period in which the ATO can go back and review the predominant number of Australian taxpayers, has been reduced. This legislation gets the balance right between the need to raise revenue in a fair and equitable manner in the interests of the nation and protecting the interests of the taxpayer. I commend the bill to the House.</para>

<para>—It is my duty to make a statement to the House concerning two of the Senate amendments with respect to this bill and the matters of constitutional principle they raise. I understand that proposed Senate amendments (1) and (2) will, if enacted, have the effect of moving expenditure between financial years. The view has been taken that legally this would amount to a change in the destination of the appropriation. There is doubt that the Senate may proceed in these circumstances by way of amendment because of section 53 of the Constitution. Among other things, this section prohibits the Senate from amending a bill so as to increase ‘any proposed charge or burden on the people’.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I am advised that the view has been taken that, where expenditure is to be transferred in such circumstances, section 56 of the Constitution requires that the proposed appropriation must be recommended by a message from the Governor-General. I understand that such a message has been obtained in this case. The House will need to consider the way in which it should proceed to deal with the matters raised in Senate amendments (1) and (2). If it wishes to entertain the proposals reflected in the amendments, it may choose to proceed by alternative means. The matter for consideration is not so much one of the privileges and rights between the two houses as one of observance of the requirements of the Constitution concerning the appropriation of revenue.</para>

<para>—I would like to speak very briefly in support of the amendment and thank the Senate for their work in putting this proposal forward. The University of Western Sydney is very much an icon over a very large area, and it is extremely important to the people of the area. It is a very young university, with particular needs because of its youth—the need to grow its campuses, the need to grow its courses and the need to grow its student population. Also, it has a particular problem because of the sheer area it covers. With campuses spread over an enormous area, it can take 45 minutes to one hour to travel from one end to the other. The university has asked that the funding be brought forward, with $3 million in 2006. The Senate has moved an amendment in accordance with that, and I thank them very much for doing that and support the amendment.</para>

<para>—While we will not oppose these amendments, because we do not want the money to be lost to the universities, it is very disappointing that the government has not been able to spend this money, given the huge demand in our universities for the funding from the Collaboration and Structural Reform Fund. As I understand it, the whole purpose of the fund is to achieve better higher education outcomes in teaching, learning, research and innovation by promoting structural reform in the sector. I think these might even be the government’s own words. So it is very disappointing to see that we have such a serious level of underspending.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>As I understand it, we have had a mere 10 projects funded this year, with a total amount of $3.8 million allocated from a $41 million program which was supposed to fund over $13 million this year. I am sure many of the universities are very disappointed that so much money that could have been allocated and that could be put to good use at so many places around the country is not being spent. We are very disappointed. I think it is certainly not good for the universities to see the government fall behind in this way. Nevertheless, it is very important that the money stay in the fund.</para>

<para>—I can assist the opposition in this regard. The Collaboration and Structural Reform Fund is, as the member for Jagajaga points out, intended precisely for that—collaboration and structural reform. It is one of many facets of the $11 billion reform program in higher education. I made a conscious decision to rephase the money and not to specifically fund all of the projects that came forward this year. The reason for that is that the 10 that I agreed to fund as the minister responsible were those that I really thought would deliver collaboration and structural reform—that five or 10 years from now we would look back and think, ‘Yes, reform was achieved through the expenditure in that way.’ There were a myriad of other projects which came forward which had value, but I could not see that there would be significant reform in the sector as a consequence of that. I have informed the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee and other people in the sector of the reasons for the decision, and I think it is fair to say that they are quite comfortable with the outcome.</para>

<para>—It is a great pleasure for me to rise in support of the <inline ref="R2283">Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005</inline>. It is longstanding coalition policy, and I will be very pleased when it finally passes though parliament.</para>
</talk.start>
<para> Since the resumption of this debate, I have been reminded by colleagues that similar legislation aimed at ensuring that freedom of association principles apply to all Australian students has, in fact, been introduced in every parliamentary term since the first coalition victory in 1996. It is about time this legislation was passed by the parliament so that Australian students, including those living in the electorate of Stirling, are able to choose how to spend their money and the organisations they want to be members of.</para>
<para>This bill will amend the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to prohibit all higher education providers, both public and private, from requiring a person to become a member of a student association, such as a union or guild. It will also prohibit all higher education providers from requiring that students pay fees for non-academic student services.</para>
<para>As a Western Australian and former university student, the debate about voluntary student unionism is one that I have followed closely. As a student, I was forced to pay guild fees, regardless of whether or not I utilised the services on offer. It is a situation that all Australian students currently face. As somebody who believes that in our democracy nobody should be forced to join an organisation, I am passionately opposed to compulsory student unionism. I will always defend the right to free association and freedom of choice, just as I will the right to freedom of speech.</para>
<para>I have been amazed by some of the comments that have been made in this place prior to this debate being resumed tonight. The Labor Party have spent a lot of time lately talking about freedom of association, yet they plainly want to deny Australian students this basic right. The arguments that have been put by some on the other side of the House have, in some cases, been plainly ridiculous. Members opposite have stood in this chamber time after time and tried to make out that this is some sort of ideological debate designed to crush student guilds and the student union movement. But nothing could be further from the truth. This bill is about choice and giving university students the freedom to exercise that basic democratic right.</para>
<para>In the arguments put, those on the other side of the House have claimed some extraordinary things. They have tried to claim that this bill will do everything from jeopardising Australia’s proud sporting identity to suppressing freedom of speech, even to undermining the values of Australian mateship. Listening to those on the other side, I am reminded of one of the sad realities of modern day politics, which is that those on the Left no longer value freedom and are always ready to use coercion to get what they want. It is part of an intellectual snobbery that people on the left of politics always believe they know what is best for other people. They think that, if we allow people to exercise their own free will, it will result in terrible things, which the smarter people in the Australian Labor Party know are not good for them.</para>
<para>Listening to previous opposition speakers, you would think that this bill abolished student unions—you would think that the government were pursuing a vendetta against their ideological opponents to wipe these organisations from the face of university campuses. That is simply not the case. All we are doing is providing students with the freedom to choose whether or not they wish to join these organisations.</para>
<para>The higher education support amendment is about the right of students to choose whether or not they will pay for a service or product that they do or do not require. It is about the right of people to complete their education and receive their results without being forced to join a particular organisation or pay for a service that they do not want or need. It is about the right of students to spend their money on textbooks or sporting activities that they enjoy, not on those that they do not, and the right of students to support a political party that they believe in instead of the one that the student association likes most.</para>
<para>The National Union of Students, an organisation that receives $5 per full-time student from every affiliated organisation, spent almost a quarter of a million dollars at the last election campaign playing politics. Considering where this money ended up, it is no wonder that the Australian Labor Party want to defend the privileged status of these organisations on Australian campuses. I have no doubt that much of the membership of the organisations from which the money had been compulsorily acquired would have preferred to have seen the money spent on services.</para>
<para>I cannot think of any other area of life where people are forced to join a specific organisation, and I cannot think of any rational argument about why Australian students should be exempted from these fundamental rights. In all the political posturing and scaremongering that we have seen about this bill, I am yet to find one person who has answered either of these questions satisfactorily. Instead, the ALP have argued in this place that we must have compulsory student unionism because if we do not student unions will collapse.</para>
<para>It is a telling argument that speaks volumes about the Labor Party’s belief that no-one would want to be part of a student guild or union unless they are forced to be. Can there be any clearer indication that even the opposition know that students do not value the frolics of their current unions in their present state? And why should they? Woeful unions around the country waste the forcefully acquired money they get on such things as stickers that urge students to bomb the White House, which was done in appalling taste after the attacks of September 11. As I detailed earlier, they have also used other people’s money to campaign for a Labor victory during last year’s election.</para>
<para>As we are resuming this debate—and it has been some time since this matter was last debated in this place—I would like to remind those present about some of the other contributions that have been made, because I think that they bear repeating. The member for Boothby pointed out in his speech that last year, during the six-week period of the federal election campaign, the National Union of Students spent over $75,000 on broadcasting electoral advertisements, over $40,000 publishing such electoral advertisements, nearly $50,000 on producing campaign material like how-to-vote cards, posters and pamphlets, and almost $90,000 on direct mailing. That is over a quarter of a million dollars of students’ money being used to campaign during the last federal election. To emphasise the point about which party this advertising favoured, the mailing address on the NUS return mail to the Australian Electoral Commission is ‘care of Trades Hall, Victoria’.</para>
<para>This would be quite a different proposition if the funding to student unions had been given voluntarily by people who shared the political views of the NUS. But that is not the case. We need to be reminded that this money was compulsorily acquired. Given that, I am not surprised that the ALP wants to defend its mates. I would venture to say that much of the money spent funding this electioneering previously belonged to students who would rather have seen that money spent on services on campus.</para>
<para>Claims from the other side of this House that allowing students to choose what services they use at the university or whether to join a student union or association will destroy sport in this great nation are equally ludicrous. Ensuring that someone who does not play sport does not have to pay for the upkeep of university soccer ovals and squash courts will not reduce participation when the student was never involved to start with.</para>
<para>It may come as a surprise to some members of this House that voluntary student unionism does not spell the end of student unionism and student guilds. We only need to look at the experience of Western Australian universities when the Court government introduced voluntary student unionism in 1995 to see that democracy and student representative bodies can actually coexist.</para>
<para>Between 1995 and 2002, student unionism was voluntary at Western Australian universities. The practice of voluntary student unionism in WA did not decimate sport in Western Australian universities. It did not silence student guilds and indeed it did not remove or damage the concept of Australian mateship. What it did do—and I think this is very important—was force the various student organisations and bodies to focus on providing services that were of value to students. Funnily enough, I always assumed that this was what a representative organisation was supposed to do—provide services that were valued by its members.</para>
<para>In 1998 a study was commissioned to report on voluntary student unionism in Western Australia. The review studied the impact of voluntary student unionism on Western Australian universities. A quick flick through the pages of the report shows that, rather than services reducing during this period, they actually improved. The report concludes:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... most student services have been maintained since the implementation of VSU in Western Australia.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It goes on to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">... Despite the introduction of VSU, student guilds have, in most cases, added services in response to the needs of their members. This has been achieved with lower guild fees and without university loans or subsidies.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">In short, when VSU was implemented, student guilds and associations in Western Australia became better and more responsive organisations. They provided services that responded to their members’ needs. And all this happened despite a smaller membership base and less income.</para>
<para>Far from demonstrating the need for compulsory student unionism, the Western Australian experience demonstrates the very reason that we need to have voluntary student unionism Australia wide. We need to do it not only to ensure that students enjoy the same freedom of association as all others in our community but to ensure that student organisations are accountable and responsive to their members.</para>
<para>It is unfortunate that this promising start to voluntary student unionism in Western Australia was summarily dismantled when the current Gallop Labor administration was elected. Labor has turned the clock back in WA and made students pay compulsory up-front fees unrelated to academic study for purely ideological reasons. It was a costly and retrograde decision for university students.</para>
<para>The decision to reinstate compulsory up-front fees was made despite overwhelming evidence that the voluntary system was working. As a result, students in my electorate of Stirling—and those in your electorate of Swan, Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie—are now forced to spend their hard-earned cash on amenities fees that fund services that they do not use, that they have no intention of using and that they will not use in the future—essentially to fund services that they simply do not want.</para>
<para>Some of the services that they do not want have already been mentioned by the member for Indi. I want to repeat some of them here, simply because of their outrageousness. In the year ending December 2004, Monash University collected over $8½ million of compulsorily acquired fees. These fees supposedly went to essential services, but, extraordinarily, 56 per cent of the money was spent on administration. At the University of Melbourne, things were even worse. An extraordinary 72 per cent of compulsorily acquired money went into administrative costs.</para>
<para>I am more than happy for any Australian to pursue issues that they believe are of concern to them. But when you see that this compulsorily acquired money has been used for political campaigning that does not necessarily reflect the views of all students, you realise that this is not part of our democracy. I am perfectly happy for people, including students, to campaign, but for goodness sake do it with your own money and not somebody else’s.</para>
<para>As I have stated before, this bill is not about ideology or petty politics, as the Labor Party would have us believe. It is not about preventing students from expressing their views. It is not about stopping student protests. It is not about destroying student activism. This debate is about a fundamental and most basic right that every member of our democratic society should expect to have and to enjoy. Education is one of the important protectors of democracy, but the fact that almost every Australian student at university is currently being forced to pay between $100 and $600 in up-front student union fees in order to get their education defies reason. It is not a proud symbol of our democratic country.</para>
<para>This debate is about the fact that everyone in our community has the right to make their own choices, based on their own personal circumstances and their own individual needs. This bill will do some very important things. Firstly, it will ensure that students are no longer forced to belong to any form of student association. Secondly, it will ensure students are not forced to pay for services they do not value or utilise. Finally, it will ensure that universities cannot penalise, either through expulsion or by withholding results, any student who chooses not to pay up-front student union or service fees. This gives students the same rights that everyone else in our community enjoys. This bill will allow students to actually get some accountability from their union. They will be able to pay for the services that they value and to pass judgment on the services that they do not value. Do Australian students really need to be treated as second-class citizens and denied fundamental freedoms?</para>
<para>I have listened closely to the debate on this bill and it has exposed some of the more unpalatable beliefs held by some members of this House. The belief that any Australian citizen should be forced to join a particular organisation should be abhorrent to anybody who values freedom. Yet speaker after speaker has risen to defend this untenable position and accused the government of trying to abolish student unions as part of some wider ideological crusade. Well, I have some news for those members: voluntary organisations can exist, based on people’s desire to join and fund them. Tens of thousands of these organisations exist across Australia, including chambers of commerce, art clubs, Rotary clubs and Lions clubs. Even political parties manage to exist on the basis of people’s voluntary preference to join them. All of these organisations manage to exist and to contribute to our community, without forcing people to join them against their will. In fact, under this bill, students can pay for services that they value and, as I said, pass judgment on the services that they do not value. I would like to challenge any member speaking after me to come into this House and provide us with an example of any other organisation within Australia where people are actually forced to join.</para>
<para>We have heard a lot of talk about how we oppose free speech because we do not believe that students should be forced to subsidise particular organisations. I hate to break it to you, but that is not free speech. So do not come in to talk against this bill and cite freedom as your fundamental reason for not supporting it. That is just an insult, because what this bill is about is freedom and a fundamental freedom of association.</para>
<para>One of the other larger problems to do with the up-front fees that are forcefully acquired from students around Australia is that they take absolutely no account of a student’s ability to pay. The fees force students to pay, regardless of how difficult that might be at any given time. I am surprised that the Labor Party believe that students are not to be trusted with basic rights of freedom of choice, and I am really astonished by the energetic opposition that has been shown to this bill. Nobody who genuinely believes in freedom and fairness could realistically oppose these measures to allow students to associate or not to associate with the student union on their campus. I congratulate the Minister for Education, Science and Training for bringing this legislation before the parliament and I, along with tens of thousands of Australian students, will welcome its passage.</para>

<para>—It is my pleasure to make a contribution to this debate, and I rise to oppose the <inline ref="R2283">Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005</inline> and to support the compromise amendment moved by my colleague the member for Jagajaga, which protects university student services while giving students the choice of whether they want to belong to a student union. It is very clear that the Labor Party has advanced in a public policy sense while the Liberal Party is still stuck in the ideological straitjacket of the 1970s. The bill proposed by the government joins a long list of bills brought to this place that essentially reflect the bald ideological prejudices of Tory members of this House. It joins the workplace relations bill as one of the most misconceived, devious and illogical bills produced by this government.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The enduring legacy of this bill will be the removal of many support services to students—services that have become part of the fabric of general and at times quite specific support delivered to students as they move through their university years.

</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>This bill is not about good public policy, nor is it about the promotion of a core political value of modern liberalism. It is really about the pent-up frustrations of some former Liberal uni student activists who have huge spots on their liver about the past and who are dreadfully frustrated that their political ambitions within the government are being thwarted by a bevy of bozos who now occupy portfolios on the Howard frontbench. That is the real reason why the member for Indi and the member for Casey got up in here—as I recall it, the last time this matter was debated in this parliament—and unloaded some extraordinary vitriol on student unions, people in the Labor Party and life in general. The cat was let out of the bag by the honourable member for Indi in her speech. She had this to say:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">So today I rejoice and join with other former Liberal students around the country and around the world who have fought the battle and waited for decades for this day.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">It must be a proud moment for the honourable member for Indi to support a bill that drives the boot into ordinary students and the services that they receive, already heavily penalised by the policies of the Howard government. They have been penalised with massive HECS debts, which I understand now total $11 billion; and of course they are saddled now with trying to compete for access to courses with students of lesser intellectual capacity whose parents happen to be able to afford the $100,000 to $200,000 to buy their way into a university course.</para>
<para>Reading the member for Indi’s speech, I see she has laid bare for all students in Australia the real political motivation behind this legislation: an ugly payback for some unseemly political brawls over the University of Melbourne’s student union many years ago. This legislation is not motivated by what is best for Australian students today; it is about some ugly happenings in the past.</para>
<para>The government’s attempt to shroud its true intent in this bill behind the rhetoric of choice is a favourite tactic of the Howard government when it deals with these matters. It is no use talking to me about choice provided by any Liberal government, because I had an experience as a young university student myself of the way the Liberal Party delivers choice to students. In my day, the Liberal government was happy to compulsorily draft 18-year-old Australian males to kill in Vietnam. They had no choice in the matter—the choice was the battlefield or jail. That was the reality of Liberal choice when I was at university. So, when any Liberal member gets up in this place and talks about choice for young people, they ought to read their own history. They ought to have an appreciation of their own history, because then they would not come in here with their pathetic meanderings about providing Australian students with choice. We are talking here about a student union fee, or a fee to provide services for other students. But there has been a case in the past where a Liberal government of the day provided no choice to Australian young people about whether they would be drafted into the Australian armed forces and sent to a foreign land to kill. So let us have no nonsense in this debate about Liberal choice.</para>
<para>I think it is important to dissect the philosophical basis for this legislation. It is encapsulated in the speeches that we have heard, particularly from the Minister for Education, Science and Training. This is an extraordinarily interventionist policy. It seeks once again to micromanage the affairs of the universities of Australia. I would have thought that, if the basic philosophical reason for this bill were choice, the minister would give universities the choice to run their own affairs. We do not see that with this minister. What we see is an extraordinarily interventionist policy, one which is manifest not only in this particular legislation but in other pieces of legislation dealing with the sector.</para>
<para>The other philosophical basis for this legislation is the fact that it is extraordinarily punitive. If the minister cannot get his way with managing the internal affairs of a university, he is going to penalise them financially for that. That is great public policy, isn’t it—you cannot win the argument in the university institutions, you cannot win the argument in the community, you cannot win the argument amongst the student body, so you bring in a punitive regime to penalise those who do not particularly agree with your view. This is an extraordinary bill in that regard.</para>
<para>The current policy of the universities allows students to opt out of any student union. Yet the minister now has a rather fanciful notion that he is going to run a taxpayer funded student vote on voluntary student unionism. He is going to pour money into some sort of a referendum amongst students about student unions and about how universities should be running their affairs. I have a simple piece of advice for the minister: let the universities run their own affairs. Let the democratic processes within the universities work their way through and resolve these matters internally.</para>
<para>It is very clear that a whole range of essential services are provided by student unions or student associations, and I am indebted to the member for Jagajaga for a note to this effect. They provide food and beverage services, meeting rooms, sport and physical recreation, child care, counselling, legal advice, health care, housing, employment, visual arts, performing arts and audiovisual media, debating, libraries and reading rooms, academic support, personal accident insurance for students, orientation information, support for overseas students, student representation and advocacy, student clubs and societies, social activities, cultural activities, welfare, commercial activities, capital funds and infrastructure, investments and reserves, student publications, student financial assistance and administrative matters related to any of these. So it is an extraordinary range of services that this government wants to curtail. That will be the inevitable result of this legislation. Services that have been provided in the past to students in universities, fully administered and accountable under the charters of the universities and the operational and administrative arrangements of the associations, will be sorely affected by this legislation.</para>
<para>I have had many discussions with the Deakin University Student Association on this matter. They have laid out very clearly their opposition, on behalf of students in the Geelong region, to this legislation and its implications. As they point out, DUSA currently operate under the Victorian system of voluntary student unionism. The student association have listed the attributes under which they operate, and I am indebted to the student association for this material. There is a compulsory fee collected by the university. The university determines the distribution of the fee. The money is divided between the library, off-campus student support, the university’s own student support services and DUSA. They have optional membership, so a student can at any time choose not to be a member of this particular organisation. But in fact very few students opt out, and I think that ought to tell the member something. It certainly tells me something—that is, that there is widespread support within the university and student body for the model that currently operates.</para>
<para>Membership of the student association is free, and DUSA negotiates a general service fee agreement annually that determines the manner in which DUSA will conduct its business, along with its accountabilities. As far as democratic elections to the student union are concerned, all student representatives are elected by the general student population. So here we have a system where the university collects a fee and it is optional for students to join—but most of them do. They get their membership for free, and the administrative and operational matters ensure proper accountability.</para>
<para>This is what the member for Indi and the member for Casey want to destroy through this legislation. I read with interest the contributions of the member for Indi and the member for Casey to this debate. It is really sad to see aspiring Liberal politicians using as a justification for this legislation their own bitter, sordid and twisted experience of student politics in their younger days at Melbourne university. I read with interest their contributions to this debate, and they both gave prominence to certain Labor Party members that they did battle with in their former university years. I note that Andrew Landeryou and Richard Marles feature rather prominently in their speeches as good Labor mates with whom the member for Indi and the member for Casey fought bitterly in their student union days at Melbourne university. Who cares? Why bring it into this particular debate to justify their point of view?</para>
<para>Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, you may—and I know I certainly do—feature from time to time on Mr Landeryou’s blog site, euphemistically called ‘The Other Cheek’. It must be the right cheek, rather than the left cheek, because he is forever hopping into the left wing of the Labor Party on a whole range of matters. I am surprised that the member for Indi would even drag this into the debate, because the interesting thing about Mr Landeryou is that he can hardly ever get his facts right on the blog site. For example, the other day he made the fanciful statement that I know little about agriculture. I did grow up on a dairy farm until my 17th year, and I was involved in every productive activity on it. On the death of my father in 1979, I returned to the farm and engaged in a range of productive farming activities. I have held the agriculture portfolio for over six years, carrying Labor’s values and its standard into hostile political territory for the party, and I currently serve on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. I am a person in the Labor Party caucus who knows the farm sector intimately. Yet, in the framework and context of this debate, the honourable member for Indi used Mr Landeryou to justify an attack on the students of Australia. That is an extraordinary proposition.</para>
<para>This parliament needs no contemporary history lesson on the Victorian Labor Party by the members for Indi and Casey. It is already public knowledge that Mr Landeryou is under police investigation for certain commercial matters. It is no secret around Labor circles that Mr Marles is a good friend of Mr Landeryou. So bringing these matters into this debate as a justification for this legislation is as spurious as much of the material that appears on Mr Landeryou’s blog site. It is a sad commentary on the Liberal Party today that its younger members can stand up in this House and deliver the coup de grace to student associations around Australia in the guise of this bill and somehow justify it because of the prejudices that were honed in some sordid political battles they engaged in at the Melbourne University Student Union many years ago.</para>
<para>The students of Australia deserve better. They deserve better than hoary old prejudicial argument underlying a bill of such moment. One thing we do know is that students rely on these services to get through their courses, to help them through their courses. At Deakin University in my electorate they have resoundingly made their statement, with the voluntary student union model, that they want to be a part of that arrangement. Of course here we have Liberal members in support of this bill peddling the worst prejudices imaginable.</para>

</talker>
<para>—I am pleased to speak in the parliament today on this very important bill, the <inline ref="R2283">Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005</inline>. This is a significant bill for the universities of this country and for the students who attend those universities. Indeed it is a far-reaching bill that will serve very well the overall community and the reputations of these universities throughout our country. I want to at the outset congratulate the Minister for Education, Science and Training and all his staff, who have worked very hard to ensure that this bill came before the House for us to debate.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Before I speak about some of the contents of the bill and some of the thoughts I have on this bill, I want to take a moment in the parliament to compliment and commend very strongly and very warmly my old university at St Lucia, the University of Queensland. Last week the University of Queensland was awarded more than $10 million of the total $30 million given to five universities nationally in the top band of higher education providers by the federal government’s Learning and Teaching Performance Fund. This is a very significant recognition of a great sandstone university. Being in the suburb of St Lucia in the Ryan electorate, I am very proud to represent it, in particular as a graduate of that university in arts and law.</para>
<para>In the Australian Awards for University Teaching the University of Queensland won four of 12 awards, in the categories of physical sciences, teaching large first-year classes, enhancement of the quality of teaching and learning, and approaches to improving and enhancing assessment. So again for the record and for the benefit of the people of Ryan and those who have a very deep interest in tertiary sector education, in the parliament today I am delighted to extend warm congratulations to the academics of the university, to students and to the Vice-Chancellor, John Hay, who at the moment is leading the university with great distinction.</para>
<para>This is an important bill, as I mentioned, and one that I have for quite some time been looking forward to speaking on. I regret that I only have a short time in the parliament to speak on it. This bill amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to abolish compulsory student unionism in tertiary institutions which receive federal government funding. Let us not forget that when we talk about federal government funding we are talking about the taxes of the people of Australia, the taxes paid by everyday Australians from my electorate who go to work and sacrifice time at home and with their family. It is very important for all of us to remember that we are not talking about endless buckets of money; we are talking about money which comes from the hardworking people of our country. This bill provides a mechanism to reduce Commonwealth funding to institutions which enforce unionism on their students. Unlike other citizens of our country, students are in the situation where they are forced, compelled, to join a student union or guild and to pay fees to that entity, which I think is quite an affront.</para>
<para>I am delighted that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing is in the chamber, my good friend the member for Sturt, who I know feels very strongly about this issue, has campaigned long and hard in his time in this parliament and was very active in his time at university in South Australia. Notwithstanding that he comes from South Australia—of course I come from Queensland, the greatest state in the Commonwealth—I know that he in particular has campaigned long and hard. In fact I might take the opportunity in the parliament to pay tribute to and acknowledge all my colleagues in the coalition, who have fought very long and hard for this bill to come to fruition because it is very important.</para>
<para>This bill will finally make student unionism a voluntary activity in higher education institutions. Finally, students will be afforded a right that we all take for granted and will no longer be coerced into an association. How ridiculous, how preposterous, that in our country in the first decade of the 21st century we have a situation where students are compelled by institutions of higher learning to join an association. It is a ridiculous state of affairs for the education sector to be in.</para>
<para>I am very strongly in favour of this bill. I support the right of students to have freedom of choice and freedom of association. I have received many representations from students, particularly from those at the University of Queensland—because, of course, I represent that university. I have had many representations also from other members of my community of Ryan. I have been delighted to meet with all those people and I have been very receptive to their representations. As the local member, it is my job to meet with my constituents and to hear their points of view and constructive comments about the government’s performance and how we can improve policy and think of new ideas to make our country more progressive and more prosperous. The strong feeling that came through was that the overwhelming majority of people in my community support this piece of legislation. There are students from the university whose views differ. But I think the strong element of protectionism in the way that student unions are run and funded currently has come to an end. Once funding is distributed, there is very little impetus on the bodies that receive that funding to account for the spending of those funds.</para>
<para>I believe that student unions and organisations which are supported on a voluntary basis will be more responsive to student needs and more accountable. It is very important that we have transparency in universities and our institutions of education and higher learning. In that regard, there is no difference between universities and student unions. Student unions will have to be in order to attract support from the student body and they will be compelled to deliver their services more efficiently and more productively.</para>
<para>I want to draw the attention of the House, the students of the University of Queensland, all the young people of Ryan and, indeed, the broader community to an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald Sun</inline> on Wednesday, 23 November 2005. Quite frankly, if there is a skerrick of truth to it, this is a very disturbing article. It points to sheer abuse by student unions. I am sure that many of my colleagues will be interested to know of this article; I am sure that many of them have had their attention drawn to it already. It concerns the Monash University Student Union agreeing to pay some $1,000 to an association that has, as a key motive, the intention of attacking the good Australians who are serving in our armed forces in Iraq; it considers them a group hostile to its motives. This is very troubling indeed.</para>
<para>I have somehow managed to be given the minutes of a meeting in May of the Monash Student Association, which show that the union gave $1,000 to Foraok Isma’al as part of an Australian speaking tour for the union activist. One student abstained from the Monash union vote, but the rest supported the motion of giving political support and $1,000 to the speaking tour. This came from the campus of Monash University and I think it is troubling indeed. MSA council chairman, Mr Nick Richardson, admitted that the resistance could include ‘violence aimed at coalition forces’. This is absolutely shocking. This is unacceptable to any Australian who supports our forces in theatres of conflict. Nick Richardson took the time to defend his decision to provide financial support to the Southern Oil Workers Union in Iraq, which he described as a ‘progressive organisation’. That is rather incredible, but it is precisely the sort of evidence that has come to our attention with such organisations.</para>
<para>The Monash Student Association should be hauled before significant authorities and questioned about why it is donating money coming from students who attend Monash University to individuals or groups of individuals that, as a very central part of their activity, advocate action that could put at risk the lives of Australian soldiers and other civilians. I think it is abhorrent in the extreme to have a student organisation at an Australian university collecting money for and donating money to the Southern Oil Workers Union in Iraq.</para>
<para>The minutes of that meeting reveal many other things but, as I have mentioned, it is very disturbing that, but for one student, the overwhelming majority of the students at the Monash Student Association meeting in May agreed to give $1,000 of students’ hard-earned cash to this cause, which is inimical to the national interests of this country.</para>
<para>I want to place on the record and draw to the attention of the people of Ryan this example of what students in union organisations at campuses around this country do. It illustrates what they get up to. I think it is high time that an end is put to this sort of activity. Its days are over. It is unacceptable certainly to me and, I know, to the people of my community in Ryan—and I am certain that it is unacceptable to the overwhelming majority of Australians. It is important that we pass this legislation, as it will play its part in preventing this sort of nonsense from happening.</para>
<para>Importantly, with this piece of legislation there is choice for students. They are perfectly free to join unions but, equally, they are perfectly free to resist the compulsion to join; they do not have to join. I draw the attention of the House to an interesting article in Brisbane’s <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> of 13 October 2005 by Ms Lucy Percival, who lives in Indooroopilly. I do not know Lucy, but she has written to the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> and, being on the record, I draw her words to the attention of the House and particularly to the attention of the students and young people of the Ryan electorate. It is a very instructive article and really captures the essence of the bill and what it tries to address. In the article, Lucy Percival of Indooroopilly writes:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">I am in my third year of university so this means, at the University of Queensland, I have paid $816 in union fees. I want to know where it goes</para>
<para>…       …            …</para>
<para>A plain roll at the bakery costs at least twice as much as at other bakeries. All their food is at least as expensive as that in comparable bakeries and cafes. The coffee and drinks are just as expensive. No, union fees aren’t used to provide cheap food for poor students.</para>
<para>Maybe they’re hiding it in other services? No, not there. Some of the sports are 20 per cent more expensive to play than in non-university teams so the money isn’t hiding there. Photocopying is only 1c cheaper than at Officeworks. (The subsidy is only $10 per 1000 pages so it doesn’t account for much of our fees.)</para>
<para>Could it be in the “free” entertainment the union provides? Hold on, I already paid for that entertainment in my union fees so it’s not free, and I don’t like the bands that it chooses.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Lucy Percival goes on:</para>
<quote>
<para>For my three years at university thus far, it appears to me that a lot of money goes to vested interests in the union. All those anti-voluntary student unionism T-shirts must have cost a fortune. Can I have some money for pro-VSU T-shirts? A huge amount goes to clubs and societies that spend it on bar tabs. When I see the union spending money on students’ real needs, I will gladly hand over my fees.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Lucy Percival is an Australian who lives in the suburb of Indooroopilly in the Ryan electorate. I think that is a very salient piece which puts to shame many of the members of the Labor opposition here in terms of capturing the spirit and the importance of what this bill is all about and what it tries to do. Indeed, a significant reason for this bill coming to this parliament and for the government parties to pass it is that there is an enormous amount of waste by the student unions that manage the student union fees.</para>
<para>In my meetings with the National President of the NUS, Felix Eldridge, and the Queensland Branch President, Jon Hames, they certainly put their views to me very strongly, and I commend them for having their views and their ideology. But I also made it equally clear to them, while giving them the courtesy of hearing what they had to say on this matter, that I strongly disagreed with them. But it was important for me as a federal member of this parliament to listen to them on this important issue.</para>
<para>The NUS of course made it clear that it does not support this bill. It is quite ironic that the NUS speaks out against changes to HECS fees, fees that are not up front and do not have to be repaid until a student is earning in excess of $36,000—fees that will ensure the sustainability of high-quality education for all tertiary students. Yet, when students are at their most vulnerable financially, at the time when they are studying and their capacity to earn is tempered by their need to focus on their academic work, this is the time when the NUS demands that students cough up, pay more money, for services that the overwhelming majority of students do not even use. Of course, the NUS fears that if it cannot hold students to ransom and force them to be student union members then it will not have any members and it will not have any funds to support its activities—activities which are, significantly, of a very political nature and which do not serve the interests of students.</para>
<para>This is why these students no longer have a mandate—why they no longer have the support of the majority of students on their campuses, of the Australian public and, of course, of the national government of this country. They are not using these funds for the purpose of taking care of the majority of students. They may certainly take care of some students. No doubt they take care of those students at universities who use the sporting ovals. No doubt they take care of the rugby clubs and the swimming clubs. I am sure they do that, but there is no interest by the majority of students in subsidising a minority of students who play rugby, who use the track and field oval or who use the swimming pool. I am a very strong and passionate believer in the game of rugby. Indeed, it is a game that I think is played in heaven. But I certainly would not have wanted the majority of students at a campus to subsidise my right and pleasure in playing the game of rugby when I was at university.</para>
<para>I want to make very clear in the parliament today that it is important for us to acknowledge that student union fees are all about subsidising a small group of students who enjoy their own activities, at the cost of the overwhelming majority of students. That is the nub of it. That is why this government must legislate and why I encourage all my colleagues in the House of Representatives and my coalition colleagues in the Senate to pass this legislation.</para>
<para>When we have activities in the streets where students of universities are protesting about the government or protesting about the Minister for Education, Science and Training, why is there always violence? Why is it that, unlike the majority of Australians when they have an issue, these students cannot put forward their views in a peaceful manner, in a democratic fashion? Why does there have to be violence when the minister for education turns up at a campus? Why does there have to be protest? It has always struck me as somewhat remarkable for young people who are supposed to be well educated, who are supposed to be receiving an education, who are supposed to be future leaders of our country—young people who will hold positions of importance in this nation—to be involved in this activity, these clashes with police and law enforcement officers. It is a disgrace, and I very strongly condemn any student who in the past has been involved in this sort of violent activity. It does them no good whatsoever. It does their organisation no good whatsoever. It just diminishes what they are all about. I pay tribute to the minister for education for the spirit, the manner and the fashion in which he has conducted himself in dealing with these violent protests of many young Australians.</para>
<para>We do not hear anything from the opposition in this debate on VSU about TAFE or the vocational sector. There are some 1.6 million Australian students in the publicly funded VET system, and yet we hardly hear a word from the opposition, we hardly hear a murmur from them, about the interests of these young Australians. Are they any less important? Are they any less significant to the future of this country? Of course they are not, and yet we hardly hear anything from the opposition about the importance of the role that those young Australians are playing in the fabric of our community. There is choice there. There is no compulsion on students at TAFE or in the VET system to pay fees, so it is quite important to note that lesson as well.</para>
<para>We all know that the nature of education in this country is changing. We know that the face of student life has changed dramatically. With the rise of the internet and flexible teaching arrangements and with students coming into this country from abroad, we must be aware that the fabric of the education sector in this country is changing and that the modern campus today is certainly a world away from the campuses of the previous decades, when many of those in opposition attended them. I commend the bill very strongly to the House. I encourage all my coalition colleagues very strongly to pass this bill.</para>

<para>—I rise tonight to pay my respects to the late Lynda Blundell, a woman with a great legacy in my electorate who sadly passed away on 24 November at the age of 65 years. Lynda was one of those community members who dedicated her life to the service of others. She was a woman of great strength of character who put up a pretty good fight in her long battle with cancer. Unfortunately, it was a fight that she lost just over a week ago. Lynda was a much loved and loving mother of Noel and Kathleen and the devoted grandmother of eight grandchildren, five who live in Victoria and three who live in Queensland.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Born in Tallangatta in 1939, Lynda moved to Broadmeadows in her adult life, where she spent most of her life and touched the lives of so many people. Lynda had a remarkable life. Whilst commending many of her activities tonight, I am sure there are many more achievements than those that I will discuss. Lynda was not one to speak of her own achievements as she did not consider what she did to be remarkable at all. It was just a part of her life. Lynda was one of those people for whom actions speak louder than words.</para>
<para>Lynda’s great achievement in her service to the community of Broadmeadows was to be the first woman elected to the Broadmeadows Council, on which she served for four years. She also became the first woman mayor in the 127-year history of that council. Even though her term on council was relatively short, she left a huge mark and an enduring legacy. Lynda had many interests, all centring on the betterment of society and involving selfless dedication to others. She worked as a youth worker, a teacher, a financial counsellor, a justice of the peace for about 13 years and a civil marriage celebrant.</para>
<para>As everyone involved in community activism knows, we often remain driven by our occasional victories on issues that we are passionate about. Lynda had many of these passions and, thankfully, she also had very many victories—for example, as a member of the Victorian People Against Child Exploitation, Lynda was one of those who lobbied for and was successful in gaining the implementation of mandatory reporting as well as for the use of videotaped evidence by children in legal proceedings. These legal reforms remain today and they represent significant milestones in the development of the law in the state of Victoria.</para>
<para>Another of Lynda’s tireless campaigns involved assisting and advocating for the rights of workers who had been denied their entitlements after the collapse all those years ago of the Waltons stores. Lynda fought with and for those workers and was successful in securing their entitlements. Lynda was passionate about her union activities and was a committed and devoted unionist.</para>
<para>For 18 years, Lynda also worked as a community development worker for the Uniting Church, where she helped so many people in her community. As testimony to this tireless work, Lynda was awarded a Churchill Fellowship in 1981. Lynda was a much deserving recipient of this honour. This fellowship enabled her to travel overseas to study legal aid, financial counselling and the history and workings of credit co-ops, which provided her with additional information and skills with which to help her much beloved community of Broadmeadows on her return to Australia.</para>
<para>In 1988 Lynda’s achievements and commitment to her local community were also recognised by the then Broadmeadows City Council, when the Lynda Blundell Community Centre was named in her honour. This is a very important and popular centre in our local community and provides assistance and support to the senior citizens, the disabled and carers in the Broadmeadows area. It is indeed a fitting tribute to a woman whose life was very much spent in the assistance and service of others.</para>
<para>Writing was another of Lynda’s passions, which was not realised until later in her life. She was a member of the Grey Scribblers group. Through this group, she contributed to the book <inline font-style="italic">Droplets from the Grey Scribblers</inline>, which was published in 2003. Lynda will be fondly remembered by many people in my electorate, including me. She was an incredible woman and she helped so many people in our community.</para>
<para>All those who knew Lynda, and in particular her dearest and closest friend, Terri McNaughton, who was with her to the very end, are saddened by her passing. I speak on behalf of all of them when I express my deep condolences to her family and her friends. People with the dedication and selflessness of Lynda Blundell are certainly few and far between. Her life provided a great example to others and her passing will be felt by so many in the community. Lynda Blundell was a great inspiration to all of us, in particular to all the younger and older women of the community of Broadmeadows. She will be sorely missed.</para>

<para>—Thank you very much for the opportunity tonight to reflect briefly on a coalescence of events that I have enjoyed. The first of these was a visit from the Queensland Teachers Union to reflect on the events of last Friday. The second, which arrived on my desk, was the ACCI position paper <inline font-style="italic">Workplace reform: working for Australian women</inline>. Finally, and probably most entertaining of all, was a fascinating, signed copy of <inline font-style="italic">Imagining Australia: ideas for our future</inline> by the authors Andrew Leigh and Peter Tynan, who are two of the four authors who join us in the Speaker’s gallery today. I welcome them. I must admit that I have already had a sneak preview of this book, which came out before the last federal election. One part struck me:</para>
</talk.start>
<quote>
<para class="block">Equality, opportunity and community should be our core values—</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">but we must—</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">focus our energies on making the social challenges of today the success stories of tomorrow.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">Nowhere is that more important than in combating long-term unemployment. A specific part of that is to make sure that women have every opportunity to join the work force if they choose and also to have the gender pay gap minimised wherever we can. I know that I have bipartisan support on the issue of narrowing the gender pay gap.</para>
<para>It brings me back to the visit from the Queensland Teachers Union today, when I was asked three questions, obviously after the events of last Friday. The first question was, ‘What will you do when the bad news stories roll in next year about employers who are doing terrible things to their employees and when the sky is falling in?’ The second was, ‘How will you answer the critics when all of the vulnerable find themselves out of a job in large numbers?’ The third was, ‘When you lose your seat, will you be prepared to negotiate an AWA?’ So you can see it has been an interesting day. I would like to take this opportunity to answer these questions in the next three minutes.</para>
<para>I am not going to start with an impassioned story about creating new jobs, because I know it is so much more than that. What we do know is that over the last 20 years we have seen substantial inroads into gender pay equity. That has continued under the most recent series of workplace reforms over the last four years. Evidence has it that the gender pay gap was 20 per cent in 1983. It has now fallen to under 15 per cent. There are continuing falls in that pay gap, even with the availability of AWAs. What I found even more compelling in this publication was not only that wages are higher for those who negotiate AWAs—and that obviously pertains to a certain selection bias—but that the gender gap narrows even more significantly for those who negotiate AWAs. That is going to continue to roll out next year and give my QTU colleague an answer, I am sure.</para>
<para>What we have also found—and this silences those on the other side—is that, while the general number of people in part-time and casualised employment has remained fairly similar over the last 10 years, it is not how many are doing part-time and casual work but who is doing it and for what reasons. I was referred to by the Leader of the Opposition in the last sitting term as a ‘child of privilege’. I certainly was the child of a mother who could not enter the work force, no matter how hard she tried in the early 1990s when she had to help to put me through university. But I am also the child of a mother who, once she found herself back at work and preferred to leave the workplace, was unable to because she had to pay the high home loan interest rates. So even for one family, for one single person, you can see that over that period where there was poor economic management there were people out of the work force who had chosen to work but who could not, and there were others who were working and who would have prefered the option of parenthood, training or further education.</para>
<para>The most compelling argument for the series of reforms upon which this government has embarked is providing people with choice—choice to work, educate or raise a family. Those options were not available 12 years ago the way they are now, and no amount of historical revision can convince anyone, apart from a few who sit on the other side, of that fact. The past reforms have now led to record levels of employment. Even as recently as a year and a half ago there was a reference in Mr Leigh and Mr Tynan’s publication as to how tough it is to bring unemployment down; there was the reflection on how tough it is to find employment for 15- to 19-year-olds. The very good news for the authors of this book, of course, is that only today we discovered that not 16 but 60 local government authorities now have unemployment rates under six per cent. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—The southern Sydney freight line is a major project which will bring great benefit to the economy by improving interstate rail freight services. The line will run parallel to the existing southern Sydney line, through Liverpool to Cabramatta and then through to Chullora via Sefton. The line provides a rail link from Melbourne to Brisbane via Sydney, in the ownership of the Australian Rail Track Corporation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>The most significant impact of the line in suburban Sydney will be the section from Warwick Farm to Villawood in my electorate of Fowler. Its most severe impact will be on Cabramatta Station, which will need to be completely rebuilt to allow for the new line. Cabramatta is a vibrant commercial centre, catering to Sydney’s Asian community. While the present railway line cuts Cabramatta into two sections, the construction of a third line will result in greater separation as well as the loss of much needed parking space adjacent to the line. This impact of the line on Cabramatta is of concern to Fairfield City Council.</para>
<para>In private and public briefings with the Australian Rail Track Corporation, the council has expressed its desire to see the Cabramatta section of the line placed underground to reduce its impact on the area. This proposal is not favoured by the corporation, and Fairfield City Council has held a meeting with New South Wales government ministers, with a view to obtaining modifications to the plans affecting suburban rail services to reduce the impact on Cabramatta. Last October, Fairfield City Council wrote, seeking a meeting with the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to express its concerns and seek the best outcome for residents and businesses in the Cabramatta area. To date, the council has not had a reply from the minister.</para>
<para>I should point out to the House that the line is designed to carry freight trains up to 1½ kilometres long, travelling at speeds of 80 kilometres an hour. At full speed, such trains take over one minute to pass by. At the expected capacity of the service, there will be 24 trains in each direction—that is, a train passing through every half hour, day and night. There is no curfew whatsoever on the line. The noise and vibration from these trains is excessive and requires the highest standard of track and well designed noise barriers to relieve at least some of the impact on residents and businesses in the Cabramatta area.</para>
<para>At Cabramatta Station, there is barely enough room for the existing two lines with separate platforms. Construction of the freight line at ground level would leave almost no room for pedestrian access from Railway Parade on the western side or from Broomfield Street on the eastern side. Only the complete rebuilding of the station, either underground or with an elevated concourse, will provide an acceptable means of handling the passenger traffic at Cabramatta.</para>
<para>I should mention that Cabramatta is an important transport link. Three train services travel to the city via Granville, Regents Park and also via the Bankstown line. Trains also travel to Blacktown on the Cumberland line. Cabramatta Station services a large population and is a hub for bus services from Cecil Hills, Bonnyrigg, St Johns Park, Mount Pritchard and Edensor Park. It is one of the busiest suburban stations in Sydney.</para>
<para>Cabramatta is an important shopping destination, with many people travelling by train to buy the range of Asian groceries and foods, and the fabrics and home wares in its many special shops. Visitors have the choice of more than 40 restaurants, serving some of the best Asian foods available anywhere in Australia. Unless a suitable solution can be found, the basic realignment of the current platforms, as proposed, will prove to be unsafe and will have a detrimental effect on the commerce in Cabramatta.</para>
<para>As I said earlier, Fairfield City Council has not heard back from the minister, and my own written requests for the minister to meet with the council have not been responded to either. I would hope that the Minister for Transport and Regional Services is not deaf to the reasonable requests of Fairfield City Council and the people of Cabramatta who are seeking to minimise the impact of this project on their comfort and amenity.</para>

<para>—Moggill Road is one of the worst traffic bottlenecks in Brisbane and in the Ryan electorate. In 2004 a RACQ survey revealed that over the last 10 years travel times on Brisbane’s major arterials have increased significantly, and the second-worst road on that RACQ list was Moggill Road. This would be of no surprise to the residents of Bellbowrie, Kenmore, Indooroopilly and Toowong. Compared with 10 years ago, average morning trips inbound on Moggill Road take an additional 14 minutes and 41 seconds.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>Recently the Queensland state Labor government put forward for consideration a proposal known as the Westgate proposal—the Westgate strategic plan. This was done without proper notification of the local residents of the western suburbs, and all four recently released Westgate options contained a bridge crossing from the Wacol development into Moggill-Bellbowrie, at either Priors Pocket Road or Weekes Road and therefore represent a significant intrusion into the community lifestyle of Ryan residents in Moggill and Bellbowrie.</para>
<para>I want to place on the record very strongly that I oppose this plan by the Queensland Labor government—that I oppose very strongly the options put forward by the Beattie Labor government. They are unacceptable and have not been thought through. To highlight how incompetent this policy has been, the Queensland government has just allowed 41 days—just over a month—for community consultation. I draw to the attention of the people of the western suburbs, in particular Indooroopilly, Kenmore, Chapel Hill, Bellbowrie and Karana Downs, that just over a month’s consultation is the sort of respect they are getting from the state Labor government.</para>
<para>Today, the member for Oxley made a personal attack on me, saying that my contribution to the Ryan community is way short of what is expected of the federal member for Ryan, but he fails to admit that I won that seat from a sitting Labor member. I remind him that he should do his homework before he attacks me. He also failed to say in this parliament whether he supports the Queensland Labor government. Does he support the four options to construct a bridge across the river from Oxley into the Ryan electorate? This is important for the people of Ryan to consider, because there are state Labor members in the Ryan electorate and they will be put on the spot to say whether they support what the Queensland government is doing or whether they support the interests of the local community. The local community is overwhelmingly against the construction of any major bridges across the river, so it is very important that the member for Oxley comes clean on this. It is very important that he comes into this chamber and either he says that he supports the Beattie Labor government or he stands shoulder to shoulder with me on this, in total disagreement with the Westgate strategic plan.</para>
<para>The Westgate proposal demonstrates the absolute policy incompetence of the Beattie government in attempting to skirt public consultation and impose on Ryan residents a river crossing into Moggill and Bellbowrie. I have made my opposition to these Westgate proposals very clear in recent days, and I want to reassure the people of the western suburbs that in the House of Representatives and in the communities of the Ryan electorate I will have no hesitation in saying very strongly that the Labor government in Queensland should put its money into the roads. I remind the people of the western suburbs that the Labor government in Queensland has been in office since 1989, bar two years of the Borbidge coalition government, and they have done nothing whatsoever to improve the state and the condition of Moggill Road. If the people of Queensland want to have continuous car parking and congestion from sun-up to sundown, vote for the Labor government in Queensland. But if they want to have reform of the roads, and if they want to have this infrastructure deficit addressed, then I strongly encourage the people of Queensland to send the Labor government a very strong message.</para>
<para>The GST provides to the Queensland government some $7.7 billion in funds, and how much have they spent on the roads in Moggill? Probably zero. Of course, this is something I think is very important for the western suburbs to bring to the attention of the member for Indooroopilly, in particular, because he has been quite useless in drawing this matter to people’s attention. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—In the lead-up to the silly season, when we all overindulge and we should be more wary of it, I want to talk about something that is really quite important: obesity. Last week the OECD reported that Australia is one of the most obese nations in the world, ranking sixth on the list. The figures reveal that 25 per cent of our nation’s children are overweight. This is very scary indeed.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>According to the Australian Medical Association, childhood obesity is rising at the rate of one per cent each year, and more than half of all young Australians will be overweight by 2025 unless serious action is taken and taken now. The consequences of obesity for the nation’s health are deadly, and the costs to deal with these consequences will be exorbitant. To me, this data sends a loud and clear message: we need to ban junk food advertising to children and we need to ban junk food in our school canteens.</para>
<para>It seems pretty obvious but, sadly, the message is still not getting through to the Howard government. The coalition’s response to the obesity epidemic has been to blame the parents. Senator Guy Barnett said that ‘we need changed attitudes among parents and guardians’. This follows the so-called Minister for Health and Ageing’s recent comments on <inline font-style="italic">Four Corners</inline>, when he said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">If the parents are foolish enough to feed their kids on a diet of Coca-Cola and lollies, well they should lift their game and lift it urgently.</para>

<para class="block">Blaming the parents is not the answer. Yes, it is important to educate parents—indeed, all Australians—on a healthy lifestyle and good nutrition, and we need to get our kids physically active, but it is vital for the government to help parents in every way possible. Let us make their lives a bit easier and regulate junk food advertising. Let us get rid of the rubbish being sold in school canteens. In an ideal world all children would take a healthy and nutritious lunch box to school. The reality is that working parents do not always have the time and, even if they do, there is no guarantee that the healthy lunch will be eaten in favour of, or in addition to, something more tempting from the school canteen.</para>
<para>The minister should realise that parents cannot always control their children’s eating habits, especially if they are not around. I do not think it would come as a surprise to anyone that a child with $2 in their hand might choose a box of Maltesers over a box of sultanas. When advertising agencies are targeting our kids, encouraging them to try the latest and coolest new chocolate bars or soft drinks, it is even harder for parents to take control. Education is integral and we need to encourage physical activity, but we also need to take the temptation away.</para>
<para>Having been on canteen duty last Friday at my child’s school, I was mortified to see what children buy at playtime and at lunch. Filling out the school orders was a bit of a shock. My child has had three takeaway orders this year. She thinks we are very neglectful, but we would rather send her to school with a lunchbox. Sadly, it sometimes comes back home with the very healthy food that we have sent intact. When we ask, ‘What went on?’ she informs us that one of her friends bought her something rather nice from the canteen. I must admit to treating several of her friends at the canteen myself the other day, and as a parent you often do not say no when you want to give them a treat. But we need to take away the temptation.</para>
<para>These days, the phrase ‘like a kid in a candy store’ is not really a very apt way to describe emotions such as happiness or excitement, because the canteen is the candy store. For some kids, lollies and sweets are no longer a rare or occasional treat to get excited about; sadly, they are the norm. A megasized chocolate chip biscuit for morning tea, a soft drink and a meat pie for lunch, and a doughnut for afternoon tea. It is possible for school children to eat these foods every day. In my view, there is nothing wrong with the occasional treat, but the problem is that junk food is so prevalent that it is now being seen by some people as an actual meal.</para>
<para>Queensland has recently announced it will phase out junk food from its schools and replace it with healthy alternatives. But the Howard government refuses to follow suit and has ignored almost all the recommendations of the National Obesity Taskforce. Similarly, it refuses to regulate junk food advertising that targets children. The advertising of cigarettes has been banned and the advertising of alcohol limited. Health professionals are now labelling obesity as a risk to our nation’s health similar to tobacco, but the government refuses to take on the advertising and marketing industry. At a recent health inquiry in Queensland, Prince Charles Hospital’s transplant services director, Keith McNeil, said:</para>
<quote>
<para class="block">Prince Charles Hospital probably wouldn’t exist if it wasn’t for smoking or obesity.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block">The rates of childhood diabetes and high blood pressure are rising. According to the AMA, new disorders presenting in obese adolescents include: type 2 diabetes; hypertension; fatty liver; sleep apnoea; asthma; orthopaedic complications, including postural imbalance and excessive weight bearing; and poorer psychological functioning and reduced self-esteem. Our hospitals are already under increased pressure as a result of obesity related illnesses in adults. Indeed, the epidemic is being linked not just to type 2 diabetes and heart disease but also to liver disease and various forms of cancer. What will it be like in 10 or 20 years time? Action needs to be taken now. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline>

<para>—I am quite unaccustomed to speaking on the adjournment in recent times but delighted to have the opportunity to do so. I would like to highlight to the House the messages that we are giving to young people about drug taking with two specific examples. In recent weeks we have had two reports handed down to the Commonwealth about the links between cannabis smoking and mental illness. For many decades there had been an assumption made by a number of generations that cannabis and alcohol were really interchangeable products that did not do you much more harm than each other. Over a very long period of time the impression has been built up amongst young people that cannabis is really no more harmful to you than alcohol or smoking and that those people who are worried about it just have not caught up with the fact that it is the heavier drugs that people are concerned about and not cannabis.</para>
</talk.start>
<para>I am not pleased to say it but I think it is important that we now hang a lantern on that problem and make it clear that cannabis smoking has been found to have direct links to mental illness, particularly amongst those who start smoking cannabis when they are very young and who smoke it over a long period of time. Certainly if you have a predisposition to a mental illness it is likely that cannabis smoking will bring that out—schizophrenia and other psychoses. If you do not have a predisposition to mental illness, there is still evidence that smoking cannabis can bring on mental illness. I am sure that most of us in this House are young enough to know of our own friends and family members who have smoked cannabis, thinking that they were safe and immune from damaging their health only to find that their personality has changed over some years and decades—in some cases, tragically, leading to mental illness.</para>
<para>For that reason, it is irresponsible for the message to continue to be given to young people that cannabis is not a serious drug. When I talk about that I am referring to state governments that continue to have decriminalised laws with respect to cannabis use—fines not much worse than traffic fines and speeding fines for people using cannabis for personal use and growing it for personal use. In my own state of South Australia you are entitled to have one plant of cannabis, which is not just a plant the size of these microphones but could be the size of a house—cannabis plants have been known to be as tall as houses in South Australia.</para>

<para>—Certainly not at my house, honourable colleague. The danger this presents to young people is that it perpetuates the myth that cannabis is not a dangerous drug. That is now irresponsible on the part of the states. The states have a responsibility to act to send a tougher message on drugs that the Commonwealth has been trying to send, particularly in relation to cannabis.</para>
</talk.start>
</continue>
<para>The second area I want to highlight to the House with respect to messages to young people is the campaign by a group called Enlighten Harm Reduction from Melbourne, from the Speaker’s own state, which seeks to test pills at so-called rave parties for young people. Many of these people are perhaps well-intentioned, but the message they are sending to young people in testing pills and giving them back to partygoers is: ‘This drug will not do you damage. We have tested it and it is safe.’ The message from the government, of course, is that none of these synthetic drugs is safe. You cannot be sure what is in a synthetic drug. No pill-testing kit can ascertain every aspect of a pill, because they are constantly changing. These pills have the capacity to do you tremendous damage. At a rave party on the weekend in South Australia called the Enchanted rave party, four of the patrons overdosed on synthetic drugs. The message should have been clear to them: if you take synthetic drugs, you do not know what is in them and you could do yourself dramatic damage.</para>
<para>The group Enlighten Harm Reduction are sending the wrong message to young people that the pills they are taking can be safe and that they can test them to make sure that they are safe. It is dangerous. I would have thought that they have established a duty of care with a person they take a pill from and test and give back to that person. They are putting themselves in tremendous danger if that person suffers some adverse reaction or even dies. I am sure my honourable friend opposite, the member for Barton, who was a solicitor before entering this place, as I was, would advise clients not to do such an action.</para>

<para>—I would like to join with other members who, earlier today in the House of Representatives, have already expressed their sadness at the loss of Peter Cook. His death is a loss to politics, to the union movement, to the Labor Party and to this country. I particularly feel that loss today because it is in this environment—an environment in which the workers of Australia face an unprecedented threat—that we need Peter Cook. Had he not been so ill, I am sure Peter would have been in the vanguard with Australian workers as they take the fight up to this government. When you look at his background, his career and his ethics, it is easy to see why Peter Cook would have been itching to do everything he could to stop this legislation. Peter Cook worked in the union movement for unions as diverse as the Federated Clerks Union, the Building Workers Industrial Union and the Western Australian Trades and Labour Council. As others have mentioned today, he served in the Hawke and Keating governments as Minister for Industrial Relations, Minister for Trade and Minister for Industry, Science and Technology.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The Labor Party owes a very significant debt of gratitude to Peter Cook for many other things, though, and I want to talk about a few of those. Australia’s strong commitment to freeing up international trade is a significant legacy. He was a genuine internationalist who rewrote Labor’s trade policy and vigorously promoted free trade. He had a particular affinity with people in our region, especially the Chinese. It was on a visit to China with him that I formed some of my strongest personal impressions of him. With the people he knew, with the connections he had formed over many years and with the important doors in the Chinese government that he was able to open, this is a man who took international trade reform very seriously indeed. He was, in turn, taken very seriously by so many foreign governments as a result.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">On a personal note, I remember giving him a poster at the end of our visit to China. It was a poster of Chairman Mao with students sitting at his feet, which to me really portrayed Peter’s role. This picture said a lot about the way Peter conceived of this visit to China, passing on to the next generation of Labor members what and whom they would need to know if they became ministers.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Peter was not one to waste any opportunity. He wanted to get value and quality out of everything that he did. He was also someone whom you could call on for advice. While I was the shadow minister for health, the South African government called on us. They wanted to make medicines to treat AIDS patients and were having a lot of difficulty with the large international drug companies, who were making it impossible for them to go down this track. The South African government had come to us and I immediately called Peter Cook. He came over and was on the phone straightaway to people in Geneva and South Africa, using his immense network of personal contacts. He knew exactly who to talk to, so we in the Labor Party in Australia were on top of the issue. Of course, we were then able to add our pressure to make sure that poorer countries in the world, including South Africa, could both produce and get access to cheaper drugs. He was that sort of person—a person you could call on at any time to use his extraordinary network of personal contacts to deliver good around the world.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Peter will also be remembered for his amazing contribution in opposition. He was at the forefront of the inquiries of the Senate Select Committee on A Certain Maritime Incident, the ‘children overboard’ affair, and the Senate Select Committee on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America, and he was also the Chair of the Senate Select Committee on a New Tax System, the GST inquiry. There have already been a number of references to Peter’s chairing of a range of different Senate committee inquiries and to the skill and capacity that he displayed in those roles. In the case of his chairing of the committee considering the free trade agreement with the United States, his chairing and his understanding of the issues were very significant for the federal parliamentary Labor Party. Peter’s extensive experience was crucial to our party’s understanding of the detail of the free trade agreement with the US. His experience and determination really fashioned the final compromise position adopted by the Labor Party that ultimately led to the Howard government, I would have to say, reluctantly having to adopt a compromise position in order to secure passage of the bill.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There has been significant mention made of Peter’s role in establishing the Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiry into treatment alternatives for patients with cancer. On this issue I want to record my complete respect for the courage and dignity with which Peter pursued this committee reference, both within our own party and also in constructive negotiations with the government, at the time of his advanced illness.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">But I particularly want to mention here today Peter’s role in chairing the ‘children overboard’ inquiry, known as the Senate Select Committee on A Certain Maritime Incident. On the one hand, his role as chair of this committee highlights Peter’s finely honed skills in chairing committees of this parliament and his extensive knowledge of the powers, capacities and limitations of those committees. I have no doubt that Peter’s substantial experience in chairing trade negotiations and meetings of the Cairns Group equipped him well for chairing the sometimes fractious hearings of the ‘children overboard’ committee. Peter understood all too well that the committee’s main task was to elicit the relevant evidence and make sense of that evidence in order to produce an accurate and useful report. But, on the other hand, the committee was being presented with evidence about which I know Peter was very passionate—he was deeply touched by this evidence. Peter was in the invidious role of having to be the dispassionate chair of a committee being presented with deeply emotional evidence, and he was profoundly committed to getting the facts of the purported ‘children overboard’ incidents accurately on the record. Peter took his role as the chair of this committee very seriously indeed—and rightly so. In tabling the report of the committee, Peter said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The values which we embrace as a nation and which define what it is to be Australian are not fulfilled by words. They are made real by deeds. This report seeks to uphold those values by telling the truth. That is what the Senate asked us to do and, within the limitations imposed by the government, that is what we have done.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">That is indeed what the committee did with great distinction, due in no small part to the skill and tenacity of Senator Peter Cook. The facts of those incidents reflect no credit at all on this government, and the government senators on the committee tried every trick in their barrister’s book to stymie the pursuit of truth. While it was the case that Senators Faulkner and Collins had free rein to forensically take up their pursuit through all of the avenues available to them, Peter Cook was charged with fairly chairing the committee. But be in no doubt that Peter had a very strong and principled determination to address the issues of integrity and of truth in government while drafting the report of the ‘children overboard’ committee, principles which were informed by decades of public service. In concluding these remarks on Peter’s dedication in undertaking his duties as chair of the ‘children overboard’ committee, I want to quote Peter’s closing words when tabling the report. They are as follows:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">As a nation, we are keen to distinguish ourselves from those types of countries that are not democratic. They do not have our good human rights records, our free media or our non-partisan defence forces. They have government owned media with totalitarian control of public information, and the military is used as a political arm of the state. What distinguishes us is that we like to believe that this could not happen here. The only thing we need to do to for it to happen here by stealth is to pretend that somehow the truth of what happened in the children overboard affair is not really important. After all, they were only asylum seekers and, anyway, the government members say it is sour grapes by us.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">But the truth matters—of course it matters. We all know it matters. This report says it matters. And if we pretend it does not matter or that the children overboard lies were just some smart political game, we do that at our own peril and the peril of our democracy, our political processes, and good government, whichever party is in power.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Peter was absolutely correct. Truth ought to matter, and truth did matter in the case of the ‘children overboard’ incidents. Truth did matter to Peter Cook, and his passion in pursuing the truth of these matters is but another part of the tremendous legacy he has left for the Labor Party and the Australian community.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I will finish by referring to Peter Cook’s own comments about himself in his valedictory speech, because it says a great deal about this man. He said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">If I have a high point of my career ... I am proud of the industrial relations reforms, but I think the proudest is sitting behind the Australian flag, as I have said, in the closing stages of the Uruguay Round and, on behalf of Australia and the Cairns Group, negotiating a successful outcome.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">It is interesting that he also cited the establishment of the National Landcare Program as one of the achievements that he was proudest of. Of his political career, he said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">Sometimes I think that I have led my career back to front. I came in with the drought-breaking Hawke avalanche in 1983. I served under the Hawke and Keating governments and as a minister for eight years. Those were the halcyon years of Labor. Now I leave with the coalition 10 years in power and my party in power in six states and two territories of Australia. ... In a way, I envy my colleagues who led their careers first in opposition and then retired on the high of government, because now I am leaving feeling that I am deserting the front at a time of some need.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">But I can tell you that that was something that Peter Cook never did. It is not a charge anyone, no matter which party they serve, could accuse him of. I am only sorry that cancer has robbed him of the chance of standing up once again for our working people.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Finally, I return to Peter’s valedictory speech so I can use his words for his wife, Barbara, who survives him. As he prepared to begin his cancer treatment, he said of her:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">She is my harshest critic but my most steadfast friend. Without her, I could not go on, and there is nothing that I can say that would do justice to her.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">We are thinking of you, Barbara, at this time.</para>

<para>—How do we in this place sum up the life of a man? How do we sum up the life of a man like Peter Cook? Whatever we say in this place about Peter will be incomplete because none of us in this place will understand the private loss that is felt by Peter’s family—his wife, Barbara, and those closest to him. Theirs is a far greater loss than we feel as a community, as a party and as a country at this time. When I think of Peter Cook I think of an intellectual, an internationalist, a passionate social democrat and someone who had not the slightest interest in being here in this parliament for the sake of being here. Peter Cook was a person who wanted to be here in order to advance the project of social justice and a strong economy.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Peter was an intellectual. He was at home in the world of ideas. He relished ideas. He saw ideas as the pathway to action. If I look back on his contribution in the battle for ideas within the great Australian labour movement, the battle which he joined most decisively was the battle within our party about the right course of action in relation to free trade. Peter joined that battle at a time when it was not popular. His conclusion was that, if working people around the world were to have their living standards lifted, the way to do it was to free up markets and to do so in a way which enabled the economies where those people lived to grow at a faster rate than they would otherwise grow through growth in the overall trade component of the global economy and their national economy. Peter argued that on the basis of the intellectual merits of the argument. He argued that at a time it was politically difficult to argue it, and particularly politically difficult within the Australian labour movement. He exhibited in his argument other personal qualities of courage, tenacity and good humour in bringing his colleagues within the movement along with him. Peter Cook was an intellectual at home within the battle and the world of ideas.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Peter was also an internationalist. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has just referred to the fact that Peter was a person who had friends, contacts and colleagues the world over. That was true. Wherever you went, you would run into people who would ask you this question: ‘How is Peter Cook?’ or, in some places, ‘How is Comrade Cook?’ He became quite justifiably, on the basis of that experience, the international secretary of our party. It was through that that I worked with Peter in developing further our relationships in China. When I was in China only a month or two ago and was being entertained by the international department of the Chinese Communist Party, their first question to me was, ‘How is Peter?’ I rang him in his hotel room in Sydney, in the place where he was at the hospital and where I had visited him not long before. One after another, I put various of our Chinese friends on the telephone to him. They all asked how he was and recommended various treatments for his condition, which he responded to knowledgeably, knowing the detail of some of them. I mention that simply for the fact that Peter did not just affect people politically as a person of substance and a person standing in our movement; Peter affected people personally. He affected people personally the world over, including in the halls of power in Beijing. He was an internationalist, a citizen of the world, the international secretary of our party and a person who had as one of his ambitions for his life ahead how to craft a new page in Australia’s relationship with China, the economy which he identified as being the economy that would become the largest in the world in the 21st century and therefore one which would be of great import to Australia’s future as well.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">He was an intellectual, an internationalist and also, as I said, a passionate social democrat. Peter Cook was a social democrat, a Labor man to his boots. Many have spoken of his background at a time when of course I did not know him. But, if you worked with him in this place, you always sensed that in him, through his veins, coursed the blood of the Australian labour movement. He had about him a passion as a Labor man, a Labor politician, the product of the labour movement, which you stood in awe of. Here was a man who, when it came to industrial relations reform, understood what it was like to get the balance right between bringing about flexibility in our labour market and at the same time not jeopardising the legitimate demands of working people for basic protections, both in the wages they earned and in the conditions they had in their workplace. Peter was always working his way through these challenges—but in a way which was rooted in his compassion and his deep orientation as a social democrat. He was an intellectual, an internationalist and a passionate social democrat.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Peter was also a total professional, and it is here that I would like to make some remarks today about his achievement in the trade portfolio. In an interview soon after he took over the trade portfolio in March 1993, Peter described himself as ‘a trade junkie’. Developing a particular interest in trade as a backbencher, including during his time as chair of the committee on trade and resources, Peter took to the portfolio with great enthusiasm, saying in an interview at the time:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">For me coming to the portfolio is in many ways an ambition that I hold. I am excited at the challenges of this portfolio. It is one that I have had an interest in for a long time.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Many of those speaking in this debate today have spoken about Peter Cook and his role in this portfolio. It was through that portfolio that he dealt with many of us.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It may come as a surprise to many members participating in the debate, as it did to me, to actually look back at the relatively short time that Peter held the portfolio. He became Minister for Trade on 24 March 1993 and remained in that portfolio until 30 January 1994. However, in a little over 10 months, Peter had the good fortune, the good timing and, above everything else, the great capacity and intellect to deal with the trade matters which were then of great importance to our country. Within a short period, Peter had mastered the brief and skilfully prosecuted Australia’s interests in the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, successfully assisting in drawing that round to a conclusion at the end of 1993.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As part of that round, Peter also played the important role of chairing the Cairns Group of free trading agriculture-producing countries that was established by Labor earlier and was successful in getting agriculture onto the international trade agenda. At the time of its conclusion, the Uruguay Round was described by the GATT, the forerunner to the WTO, as the most complex round of multilateral trade negotiations in GATT history. The round entailed item by item and formula reductions, resulting in tariff reductions by industrialised countries by one-third on average. Agriculture, textiles and clothing were finally brought into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There were new agreements on services known as GATS and on intellectual property known as trade related intellectual property, or TRIPS. This became an alphabet soup in which Peter was one of our party’s few exponents and capable of simultaneous bilingual interpretation. This was a challenge which Peter took further during his chairmanship of the Senate inquiry into the Australia-US FTA. This was a difficult task but one which, once again, Peter took to with his characteristic enthusiasm, drawing on his great trade knowledge and ultimately steering a course for the Labor Party that included the development of Labor’s amendments on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and local content on television. The Uruguay Round also agreed to establish the World Trade Organisation, an institution which greatly respected Peter’s contribution and which he continued to visit and work for in different capacities, including authoring a manual on the workings of the WTO for developing countries. If ever there is evidence of someone’s commitment as an internationalist, it lies in Peter’s work on that score.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The Uruguay Round was of major significance to Australia. In addition to reducing industrial tariffs and establishing new rules for trade in services, the Uruguay Round was particularly important for Australia’s rural industries as it finally managed to get agriculture onto the table. Notwithstanding significant resistance from protectionist forces, most notably the European Community, we nonetheless prevailed. The last few frenzied hours at Uruguay and the intransigence of the French—does anything ever change?—in particular are apparent from the following description contained in a <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> article of 18 December 2003 which reflects back on that period:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">At the stage in the exhausting proceedings when the chief American negotiator, Mr Mickey Kantor, had lost his voice, when at least one senior figure had to be held up in public for fear that he would fall over and go to sleep, and when Australia’s Trade Minister, Senator Peter Cook, was shivering with a 24 hour virus, the French were still going strong in arguing their case.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">When we consider the current difficulties of the Doha Round in the lead-up to next week’s ministerial meeting in Hong Kong, it appears that very little has changed with regard to the EU’s attitude to liberalising trade. It is always a difficult and arduous process—step by step, clause by clause, tariff by tariff.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Peter, however, took to all this with great energy, great commitment and, for Australia, great success. In Peter’s view, the EU was so caught up in the question of tradition, culture, special interests and internal wrangles that it was no more than seeking for itself to become a short-term winner at the expense of the rest of the international economy. The long-term winners would be those economies with the dynamism and the courage to seize the challenges and to restructure themselves to take full advantage of the liberalising world trade environment.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In his Senate valedictory speech in June this year, Peter said that the trade achievement he revered the most was the opportunity to serve his country and negotiate in the endgame of the Uruguay Round. In doing so, he recognised the work of the preceding ministers, who had worked for more than eight years prior to that on those negotiations. Those remarks by Peter again reflect the man’s modesty in reflecting on the contributions of others.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Again it is important to go back to the time of the conclusion of the round in December 1993. While Peter had been a part of a significant achievement, there remained a sense of frustration emanating from Peter’s great understanding of the contribution of trade liberalisation to economic growth and development. Peter told the final session of the round:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">It’s three years overdue. Had we got there sooner, the international recession might not have occurred or been as deep as it was. The truth is if we’d got there earlier many more people would have been in full employment, fewer businesses would have gone bankrupt and world growth would have been better.</para>

<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Thus spoke Australia’s Minister for Trade, Peter Cook, with characteristic Australian candour. As Minister for Trade in 1993, Peter also had the opportunity to represent Australia at the fifth APEC ministerial meeting before the first APEC leaders meeting held in Seattle. Peter understood fully the complementary and supportive role APEC played in pursuing Australia’s multilateral trade and investment objectives at the regional level throughout the Asia-Pacific. Peter continued to be a great supporter of APEC, believing it had an essential role to play in developing a more prosperous and stable network for Australia. While he chaired the Senate inquiry into the Australia-US FTA and conjured a way forward for us, Peter always remained a multilateralist at heart. After all, that is where the biggest trade and economic gains were to be had for Australia, that is where the biggest trade and economic gains were to be had for the developing world and that is where the biggest trade and economic gains were to be had for the global economy overall.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Peter cemented his beliefs in Labor’s trade policy platform—a platform which committed Australia to continuing Australia’s firm commitment to an open international economy, a commitment that recognises the importance of free trade as the means of generating the growth necessary for enhancing the living standards of every Australian. This was the intellectual battle in which Peter Cook engaged; this was the intellectual battle in which he prevailed. On trade, as the current occupant of the shadow portfolio, I have a great sense of coming after someone who has been very great indeed in the execution of their responsibilities within this portfolio. These are very big shoes to fill.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">On a personal level, I had the great privilege, as I mentioned before, to visit Peter in hospital in Sydney only several weeks ago. Visiting him in hospital, I could not but be impressed by Peter’s singular tenacity, his absolute belief in his ability to prevail despite this thing. We talked of little else but sailing. I gave him a book about sailing. I am pleased to report that he did not already have that book on sailing. Sailing was his passion, as so many have said in this debate. But, beyond sailing, you could not keep Peter down. There he was, sitting in his wheelchair, holding forth on how we should go forward in order to win. He provided me with at least three recommendations to place before the strategy group of our party when we next met. So much for Peter being burdened by the challenges he faced. His wife, Barbara, about whom the Deputy Leader of the Opposition spoke so eloquently, has been the complete living embodiment of a tower of strength—such extraordinary love, such extraordinary devotion, such extraordinary strength.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">So how do we sum up the man, Peter Cook? An intellectual, an internationalist, a passionate social democrat, a professional, a trade professional, a person whose motivation in politics was driven by his deep compassion for people who had grown up on the wrong side of the tracks and, beyond all that, a person gifted with great tenacity to see the job through. Peter Cook, we the party, the people and the parliament all salute you.</para>

<para>—Peter Cook and I met on 10 January 1984 in Old Parliament House. On that day, I had started working for the then Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Peter Walsh. I was walking along the corridor with its creaky floorboards and a dank smell about the place. I suppose that is an apt description of the Senate at times. It certainly was then, but it is vastly improved now. As I walked past a fairly young bloke—I was quite a bit younger—someone said, ‘This is Cookie.’ I thought it was good to meet a new staff member. There I was just finding my feet and I had already met another staff member, Cookie. So fondly was he regarded around the place that he was not called Senator Cook or Peter, but Cookie. Everyone from the Labor people to Senator Messner and Senator Chaney knew him as Cookie. Such people held Cookie in very high regard from those very early days onward—and he had been elected only a year earlier.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The next big memory that I have of Peter was in the uranium debate within the ALP at the 1984 conference. It was a debate which, understandably, was full of emotion. Peter himself had to make a big decision on that. He was in the Centre Left grouping, and the Centre Left would ultimately determine the position of the party on the uranium issue. There were a lot of arguments coming from the Right and from the Left. Peter was being hammered from both sides really. I remember how he agonised about that. He ultimately supported the position of the Right, but only after going through a lot of soul searching, checking his conscience and seeing whether it was the right thing to do by the people of Australia. He made that judgment. Whether the judgment was right or wrong is not a matter for debate here today. I was very taken by how committed Peter was to getting what he believed to be a good decision.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">That took us to the end of 1984. Not long after—early in 1985—we began the great tax debate. We seem to have them every 20 years or so. We certainly had a big one back then. In the 1984 election campaign, Bob Hawke had decided to say that we would have a tax summit. A lot of people who were into heavy-handed control thought that that was a particularly stupid idea, but nevertheless Bob thought that it was a way of dealing with the tax issues without having to have every detail of every possible tax change in front of the Australian people at that time.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We had the great tax debate of 1985. The GST was around then, and Treasury were very firm advocates of it. They thought it was beaut. In particular, it would have the value of being able to cut the top marginal rate of tax, a rate which many Treasury officials confronted. Along with many other ‘productive’ people in the community, they thought that that was a pretty good thing. They saw the broad based consumption tax as a way of doing that. I was a fresh economist on staff. From my training, I would ordinarily have been obliged to think that it was a good idea too, but I did not. And Peter Cook was a bit of a sceptic. I can reveal now that Cookie and I ‘cooked up’ more than one or two papers on what a dreadful thing this broad based consumption tax was. Peter bore a few scars by releasing those papers, arguing against the broad based consumption tax, on his own behalf and on behalf of others in the Centre Left.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Nevertheless, the white paper was produced. The broad based consumption tax was option (c). There was an option (a), which was ultimately adopted. No-one ever really talks about option (b), which was our option. That shows what an inspired idea option (b) turned out to be. Peter believed that a GST would be very unfair—that low-income earners could not be compensated adequately for it, that it would rise over time and that it would not bring the great benefits claimed in terms of export competitiveness and improved incentives. I think that Peter was right then and that his view is right now. Nevertheless, we have the GST. It is a $38 billion tax and no-one is seriously arguing that we should get rid of it.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Peter applied the same standards to the debate on the GST: what would this particular policy proposal do for the Australian people and, most particularly, what impact would it have on the most vulnerable in our community? On the basis of believing that a broad based consumption tax would have an adverse impact on the most vulnerable in our community, Peter opposed it.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Our next engagement was in relation to Tasmanian forests. Peter had a really hard brief here. Graham Richardson was advocating—as was I, I must say—a very expansive policy in protecting the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests of Tasmania. We held the Helsham inquiry and ended up adopting the minority position against the majority position. The minority position was to put on the World Heritage List a very large tract of land—I think 282,000 hectares give or take an inch. Peter’s job was to run the contrary case within the cabinet. He had developed a much smaller set of proposals. We were despatched by Bob Hawke to go to Tasmania and see if we could get some support for this much more modest proposal.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Someone who did have a view on forest policy in Tasmania was Lloyd Rees, a rather well-known painter. Through his son we visited Lloyd. Peter eloquently, I must say, put the strongest possible case as to why this was a responsible forest policy. It took about three hours of having cups of tea and then, at the end of it, after Lloyd had taken in all of the arguments, Peter said, ‘What do you think, Lloyd?’ Lloyd said, ‘Yes, but why do you want to cut down the trees?’ I thought that said it all. So we reported back to Bob Hawke that Lloyd had a fairly clear view that the trees should not be cut down, and probably the proposal that ultimately got up would have been unsatisfactory to Lloyd too because it did involve cutting down some trees. But it was certainly a memorable experience for all of us.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Peter was promoted to cabinet by Paul Keating when Paul became Prime Minister. The fundamental reason why Peter was promoted to cabinet was that he always ran the arguments, he ran the case. What Paul used to say about Cookie was that he would run the brief of his department. They did not necessarily have to agree with every aspect, but Paul fundamentally believed that the various portfolio ministers should come together and represent the views of their departments. They could depart from them but they should put that view into the policy debate in the cabinet room. Peter was fantastic at that. He worked tirelessly to get across those briefs and always put the best possible argument in the cabinet process. That is why Peter was promoted permanently to cabinet by Paul Keating.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I then dropped out of the scene for a fair while but, on coming back in 1998, there we were again: fighting the GST. I was again delighted to work with Peter as he chaired the Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee inquiry into the GST and a new tax system. I am sure that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would agree that Peter worked tirelessly on that, day in, day out and all around the country, again bringing forward all the arguments but with that fundamental criterion in mind: what does this proposal do to the most vulnerable people in our country? On that basis Peter was again able to say that he did not support the GST.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We then moved on to a Economics References Committee inquiry into the Fair Prices and Better Access for All (Petroleum) Bill 1999—petrol prices are in the news again—and Peter again applied that rigour. We produced what I think was a very responsible report. It was not just opportunistic, saying, ‘Oh, petrol prices are high; they ought to do something about it.’ Specific proposals came out of that report. Those proposals are still relevant today, and again there was the rigour and energy that Peter applied to it. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred to a trip to China, which I think was a real highlight of all our careers, not only for the great work and the level at which we were engaged but the camaraderie that we enjoyed as we got to know each other. It was just a fantastic time. Peter was the great helmsman. He got us around China and into all of these meetings, and he did it with great distinction, the sort of distinction that he had gained in the negotiations in which he was so deeply involved towards the end of the Uruguay Round. It was, as others have said, a highlight of his career to be able to sign off on that Uruguay Round.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I will speak a bit more about trade in a moment, but the other great achievement of Peter Cook, Cookie, was the introduction of enterprise bargaining. It seems to me that that is the fundamental reform that has led to so much productivity growth, together with the other economic reforms. In the labour market that is the reform that created genuine productivity growth, not what the government is going on with now. That is not reform; that is just brutality. Enterprise bargaining was not an easy transition. In convincing the union movement and employers that this was a good thing, but particularly the union movement, Peter had to apply all his skills, good graces and goodwill. He did that with distinction. It made me think that if you had a career and you wanted to say, ‘I did two great things. I had two great achievements in my career, which spanned the 1980s and 1990s,’ it would be hard to go past signing off on the Uruguay Round and introducing enterprise bargaining. Although it is not immediately obvious, both of those reforms did fundamentally help the poorest people in our community by creating jobs, both through enterprise bargaining and through trade liberalisation. Peter had that conviction about him and he knew that was what both of those major policy reforms could do, and they have done.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Peter Cook was a compassionate human being. He taught us all compassion. He had enormous integrity. He knew that there were many causes that he was championing that were unpopular. He was coming up against people whom he respected and liked who could not understand why Cookie was doing these things. But he did not flinch. He did not say, ‘I’d better rethink this; I am making myself unpopular.’ He was always pleasant but always determined to achieve the outcome.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In politics, honesty is a precious commodity, and Peter Cook had a very large amount of that. He was just such an honest man. If he disagreed with you, you knew absolutely. There is a lesson for all of us in that. Peter was a man of principle. I think he paid a high price for being so principled—but, in the end, he probably would not have minded. If when you are dying and you look back on your years and can say yes to the questions ‘Was I honest? Did I have compassion? Was I a person of principle? Did I have integrity?’ you have led a pretty good life. Peter Cook led a very good life.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">When Peter was diagnosed with cancer and he was leaving this place, I went around to see him and I gave him a hug because I knew that things were very bad. Cookie always said, ‘I’ll keep fighting, I can beat this,’ but I knew the prognosis was bad. Even as things worsened and through all the operations that he had in Sydney, he just kept fighting—always thinking, ‘Maybe there’s some hope; even if things are gloomy I’ll do the very best I can.’ He never flinched under pressure on the policy front and he never flinched under pressure when he was dying. Peter Cook was a great man and a great friend and I miss him very much.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The strength and love that Barbara displayed for her husband right through their lives but most particularly in that last terrible 12 months is almost indescribable. Barbara, we are thinking of you today. You have done a fantastic job.</para>

<para>—I would like to make a contribution to this condolence debate on Peter Cook, and I thank the member for Fraser for allowing me to slot in at this particular time. I probably come from a different perspective—a perspective of minister to minister. When I was Minister for Natural Resources in the Greiner government in New South Wales, which I took over in 1988, Peter Cook was the Minister for Resources in the Hawke government here in Canberra. Of course, one of the great debates at that time was the forestry debate in New South Wales. I suppose it continues, but it was a great debate at that time. In fact, it was the debate that brought me into politics in 1984, because I believed that the whole debate was distorted and dishonest and we had to get the truth across as to what was really going on in the management of forests in New South Wales. I suppose I would have to admit defeat on that issue.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">One of the issues I had to deal with at the time was the management of the south-east forests, which was to do particularly with the chip-milling at the Harris-Daishowa mill at Eden. In that instance, the Commonwealth had to give licences for the export of chips, so Peter Cook and I became entwined in that issue. To his great credit, Peter rang me up and said, ‘We have to deal with this issue. Would you mind if I came across and had a talk to you?’ I said, ‘Fine, come across.’ Peter flew to Sydney and we sat down with his staff and my staff and we decided that we should spend some time trying to come to an agreement on what areas would be needed for the timber industry—not only the chip industry but also the tablelands sawmills and the sawmill down at Nowra.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It was an extended process. Peter flew to Sydney almost weekly for nearly three months to go through the issues. Peter had to take into consideration the environmental position of the Hawke government and I had to take into consideration not only the environmental issues but also the issue of jobs. To his credit, Peter Cook acknowledged that and, not surprisingly, with his background of looking after the interests of workers, he was very much aware of the situation and uppermost in his mind were the jobs of the workers in the forest industries of New South Wales—the greatest decentralised industry we had in rural New South Wales.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It was a very serious issue that we courteously went through. We tried very hard to set aside areas that we believed were important to the environment. We also tried to set aside areas where we would have a long-term, sustainable forestry industry in New South Wales. My youth was spent in the forest industries on the North Coast of New South Wales, so I understand clearly the management that is necessary. I understand how you can maintain the resource on a very sustainable basis. From that perspective, I was able to make a contribution, with Peter Cook, on this issue.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We reached an agreement on how the area should be set aside for the environment and for the industry. The agreement was signed by Prime Minister Hawke and by Premier Greiner. To my great sadness, I have to say that, in the name of the Australian Conservation Foundation, the now member for Kingsford Smith managed to get Nick Greiner’s ear to get the agreement changed. It was not the Labor government in Canberra; it was our government in New South Wales that reneged on the agreement that Peter Cook and I had reached. I think there is a certificate to this day on the wall down at Harris Daishowa saying, ‘That’s how much you can depend on Australian governments,’ which is rather sad because the agreement was very good . It took all areas into consideration. It was a template that could have been used in forest industries across Australia. It is rather sad that it fell by the wayside.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">When Peter Cook was diagnosed with melanoma, I was a bit of a kindred spirit because I had been diagnosed with secondary melanoma some time before and I knew what he would be going through. I do not think you can explain the feeling you have when your doctor says, ‘You have secondary melanoma.’ You just go cold because you know very well what you are dealing with. Specialists are not the people who will give you a lot of hope; they tell you exactly how it is. They say, ‘You’re dealing with a monster,’ and it is a monster that is very hard to contain.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I rang Peter Cook—having had all that time with him—and gave him my assurance that I would certainly pray for him and would like to speak to him and help him along the way. We did from time to time have a discussion about these matters. I dare say he realised what he was up against; he realised the odds. Even when I had a clearance, after an operation, to say that they could find no more cancer in my body I was rather relieved and said to my specialist, ‘That’s good news, doctor.’ He looked at me and said, ‘Yes, that gives you a 50 per cent chance.’ They are very serious odds to deal with. Peter Cook and I both knew that we were fighting a big battle and the consequences were unknown.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">They say only the good die young. I have been very lucky because I am three years down the track and there is still no sign of any secondaries. Peter did not have that luck—unfortunately, secondaries showed up fairly quickly. In fact, my specialist said to me, ‘If I’m still talking to you in 12 months time, then we are part way down the track.’ That is how quickly it moves. As I was driving home from a function on Saturday—we are sending out Christmas cards at the present time—I said to my wife, ‘Remind me to send Peter Cook a Christmas card and I’ll drop him a note.’ It must have been about the time he lost the battle. I did not realise he was so low at the time.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I did not know his family but I know what they would be going through. It is a terrible tragedy to lose someone and it is a terrible tragedy to suffer with them. I have seen that type of suffering in my own family. It is very hard to deal with. I can only just imagine what his wife has gone through. She must have been stoic to go through it the way she did, from what I hear from others. My sympathies certainly go to the family. I will always remember Peter Cook. He was a very decent man to deal with and I believe that through a lot of hard work and perseverance we came to an agreement that was a very good agreement. It is just a pity that it did not stick.</para>

<para>—Peter Cook was my friend for 35 years. But you did not need to be his friend to appreciate the significance of his contribution. For example, it is highly likely that the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations would not have finished as well as it did or as early as it did without Peter Cook’s robust, skilful and intelligent leadership of the Cairns Group. There are serious, senior figures in international trade discussions who have said there probably would not have been a satisfactory outcome of the Uruguay Round at all without Peter Cook’s role. I had the privilege of succeeding him as Minister for Trade and, while I do not think any individual can be responsible for anything as substantial as the conclusion of a major round of international trade negotiations, there was nobody I met who did not conclude that the result was earlier, better and better received as a result of some extraordinary initiatives that Peter took as chair of the Cairns Group.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">He left a few bruised egos behind because he set up a subgroup in the Cairns Group, he took them to Europe, he negotiated with the Europeans, he negotiated with the Americans and he hammered out a deal. When you set up a subgroup, by definition someone gets left behind. They all felt that this was a bit presumptuous and I had to smooth some ruffled feathers afterwards. It was a very small task compared to the task of getting that agreement. The world is a better place for that agreement and Peter’s contribution was extraordinary. This is an achievement which would satisfy a lifetime’s activity. If at the end of 30 years of activity you could say that is what you achieved then you could feel very proud. But it is a mere staging post in a long and brilliant career. I have chosen to highlight it at the beginning of these remarks not just because it is so significant but because the combination of commitment, will and intellect which it displayed was the outstanding feature of his public career.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I started off by saying he had been my friend for 35 years. I read in an obituary in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> today that Peter came to Perth in 1970, and I met him within a few days of his arrival. I thought: ‘No, that’s wrong. It can’t possibly have been 1970—that’s 35 years ago.’ But sadly I remembered that it was right. That means I am 35 years older than I was then. Sometimes it feels like twice as much and sometimes only half. But it must have been so because I remember in 1971 he and I were campaigning in the streets about the South African rugby tour. I am not sure that all the obituaries have referred to this and nor do I think, of those that have, that they have all been totally accurate about it. They say Peter was not an activist outside the official political realm. I remember seeing him put in the back of a paddy wagon as a result of activities during that protest against those South African rugby tours. He was most put out because I was there with the megaphone calling out and he was in the crowd, and they picked him up and not me. He was always put out about that. I cannot say that I ever minded.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">He was very actively engaged in a wide range of activities. The ones that come to mind in hindsight—there were many others as well—were those South African rugby tour campaigns and the war in Vietnam. I heard in the Senate debate on the condolence motion Senator George Campbell talking very eloquently about Peter’s very powerful role against certain laws introduced by the Court government—the government of Sir Charles Court, not the subsequent government of Richard Court—which restricted freedom of association and led to various trade union officials being charged for holding public meetings. Incidentally, they led to me being charged on one occasion for holding a public meeting. Peter fought against those in a manner that was effective and successful.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Over those 35 years he went from—when I first met him—being a junior, organising with the Miscellaneous Workers Union, to working for the building workers union and becoming assistant secretary of the labour council and then secretary of the labour council. I was very pleased to play a role in creating the opportunity for Peter to become secretary of the labour council. His predecessor had done a fine job. It was time for him to move on and we found a decent way in which he could make a contribution elsewhere, which he did very substantially, and Peter took his place. Subsequently, I was pleased to have a role in getting a preselection for him in those tumultuous days of the double dissolution of 1983 which led him to come to the Senate.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In all those things and in the role he played in the trade union movement, as vice-president of the ACTU—he was originally involved in negotiating what became the accord from the trade union side, although he finished up implementing it from the government side, when the Labor Party was in government—he was a very distinguished figure and a very significant minister in a range of portfolios. I was very pleased to hear the remarks made by the member for Page. I thought he made a very cogent argument in a simpler way than those of us who were close to Peter in other ways could have about the quality and integrity of his negotiation and commitment. I was grateful for the remarks that he made.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Peter was Minister for Resources, Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, but he was always proudest and made his most significant contribution as Minister for Trade. It is hard to believe that, in a long career of more than 35 years, he was trade minister for only 10 months. But there was a fortuitous combination of capacity and opportunity—the skills that he had developed. Somebody described Peter in an article in a newspaper today as possibly the best negotiator they had ever met. I know at least one other person who would be a competitor for that title. But he was certainly an outstanding negotiator who had the capacity to bring people together, to come to agreement, to go to the essence of the argument that you need to find agreement and to enable people to move away from the side issues that they are finding difficult to overcome and focus on the central issue. He made an ongoing contribution to trade policy, and I want to come back to that when I comment on what he did after he left parliament.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">When I became trade minister, I found there were a substantial number of people all around Asia whose attitude to Australia, to Australians and to Australian government policy was the better for the relationship they had developed with Peter. I want to briefly mention two, and they are both very significant figures in an ongoing way. One was a very controversial figure, and was very difficult for Australian ministers, including yours truly, to deal with—the incredible Malaysian trade minister, Rafidah. I know that you, Madam Deputy Speaker Bishop, know Rafidah Aziz, as I do. She has been a very powerful, forceful and controversial advocate for the policies of her government for a very long time but has not been easy on Australia. She gave us a hard time. Peter discovered that he and Rafidah had the same birthday. They used to joke about this and he broke the ice with it. That did not mean that either of them made agreements other than by forcefully arguing the interests of their country. But he broke through the difficulties we had in building a decent working relationship with a government that at that stage we had difficulties with—the government of Dr Mahathir. When they were at their low point, one of the intermediaries was always Peter because of his relationship with Rafidah.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The other relationship—and in some ways an easier one because it was with a person much more amenable to the sorts of issues we were pushing—and one of great long-term significance, was with Dr Supachai. Dr Supachai was at the time the Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand, responsible for trade policy. He went on—and he has just concluded a term, I think—to be the Director-General of the WTO, a very important figure in that organisation. As far as I understand, he is now the head of UNCTAD. He is a distinguished international citizen, a significant player in the trade policy debates in ASEAN when we were trying to negotiate the first steps of the relationship between Australia and New Zealand through CER and ASEAN. It was Dr Supachai who was a significant factor, and his friendship with Australia was substantially built on his relationship with Peter.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I would like to move on to Peter’s role after we left government. A number of people have commented on his chairmanship of various committees, and I will mention three of them only quickly because they had been mentioned at great length by others—the GST inquiry, the ‘children overboard’ inquiry, and of course the final report he brought down on the issue of cancer. All of those were very significant, but the report that is underestimated, I think, is the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee, which he chaired, on the idea of a Pacific community. The committee brought down a unanimous report—and that sort of thing happens often on that Senate committee but it was something that Peter was very good at achieving—and made some far-reaching recommendations about the nature of our relationship with other countries in the Pacific. I think that in 10 or 20 years time the report will be looked back on as more significant than all of the others which are of contemporary political significance. I would like to think that the cancer report will be similar, that it will make a change in public policy, but I am not so optimistic. But I think that the report from that committee which Peter chaired on the idea of a Pacific community—and many other people on the committee also made a good contribution to the report—will be looked back on as another significant achievement.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Very briefly, I want to say something about how and why Peter left the parliament. In hindsight he would have left pretty soon afterwards anyway because of his health. Peter should have been endorsed for the last election. I am not commenting on the person who took his place and who was the beneficiary of issues that surrounded Peter’s preselection and who now has the opportunity to prove himself as a worthwhile successor. I certainly do not know him well enough to comment on whether he will do that or not, and I make no comment on him. I do not hold him at all responsible. He was offered the opportunity to make a contribution in the Senate, and why would he not seize it. Peter had given me a lot of support over many years politically and I tried to return the favour. I found intransigence from a group of people—and there was a roomful of them—who, if they had all combined their will, their commitment and their intellect, would not have been the equal of Peter. They conspired to pull him down to avenge years of dissatisfaction with the positive role he played in stopping them doing the things they wanted to do. He was right to stop them; they were wrong to pull him down. I do not know what they are thinking today, but I know what I am thinking. His reputation will be unsullied by their activities, but I do not think that theirs will be.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">After he left he was always amused by the idea of being an adjunct professor. He had been introduced at a function on one occasion as Professor Cook and he thought this was wonderful, having been Senator Cook for so long. He expected everyone to call him Peter or Cookie really, but to be Professor Cook was a source of great amusement and pleasure to him. Through the Curtin University and the WTO—other people have referred to his significant contributions and I will not repeat them—he produced a book to assist developing countries in taking advantage of opportunities that the WTO offered.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">What has not been commented on is the significant role he played through the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in going to parliaments in developing countries and advising parliamentarians on the role they could play in assisting in trade liberalisation in those countries. He was an advocate for trade liberalisation but also an adviser on how to go about it as a parliamentarian, to be effective, to have scrutiny and to do all those things that we would take for granted. It was just another part of his long-term commitment to trade liberalisation.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">He played a significant role in our party in the formation of the Centre Left. He played a significant role in creating it—it is not fair to say that he created it, but for many years he carried it on his back. History will probably judge that the Centre Left was a flawed concept, but his will, his intellect and his ability made it succeed and made it contribute for 20 years. He played a positive role through that and for the party in government and in opposition.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I want to conclude by saying something about Barbara. A lot of people have spoken correctly about the very significant role Barbara played in her wonderful support for Peter during his illness. Robyn and I drove down to Sydney on a few occasions to offer Barbara and Peter and bit of support and comfort, and she was always wonderfully strong. She was unbelievable in how she was able to sustain her support and good humour. She should not be underestimated as a strong and independent woman who has made a very substantial career of her own and a very substantial public policy contribution across a range of areas in Western Australia. Barbara sustained that right up until Peter’s retirement. They were going to enjoy a wonderful retirement, but it has been cruelly cut short. She rang me on Saturday, as strong as ever, to ask me to ring mutual friends overseas who did not know how ill Peter was and how imminent his death was. It was only a couple of hours before he died. That she had the thought to ring me and to be concerned about those people was, I thought, a great tribute to her. I know that, after the mourning and the grief, she will return to make a contribution of her choosing, because she is a woman of talent and strength.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Peter Cook’s death on Saturday marks the premature end of an outstanding Australian life, but Peter goes in the knowledge that he lived his life in accordance with his values. He made a substantial contribution to Australia and achieved the only real accolade any of us can hope to achieve. He can leave us knowing that the world and the nation are the better for his contribution.</para>

<para>—I rise tonight to associate myself with the condolence motion for former senator Peter Cook, or Cookie as he was known to all of us. I must say how pleased I am to follow on from the member for Fraser, because he and I, like Senator Cook, cut our teeth in the Western Australian branch of the ALP. The member for Fraser, first as a senator and then as a member of the House, and I subsequently joined Peter in the parliament.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I want to start by recording my sympathy to Barbara and to Peter’s family. I have known Peter for a long time as a Western Australian colleague—although not for quite as long as the member for Fraser. My first contact with Peter was in the mid- to late-1970s. He was about to become secretary of the TLC and I was a delegate to the state executive of the Western Australian branch of the party from the Perth Electorate Council—the seat that I now have the great fortune to represent.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">My real contact with Peter came when I became State Secretary of the Western Australian branch of the ALP in the late 1980s—by then he was a senator and was soon to become a minister—and subsequently I joined him as a colleague. I think the highlight of Peter’s public contribution—his contribution to public service, to public life—was as a minister in the Hawke and Keating governments as Minister for Resources, Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Trade. I will not go through all the details of those achievements. I have always thought his most significant contribution was in the trade portfolio where, on any measure, he can lay claim to have been one of the best trade ministers that our nation has had the benefit of having.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I also think his contribution in opposition to the parliament and to the Labor Party, following our fall from office in 1996, is underappreciated. When we fell into opposition in 1996, I think it is true to say that Peter was initially very disappointed at no longer being in government and at the role that he had in opposition. But after a very brief time he showed what I thought was very much the true application of his personal characteristics.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In Labor’s period in opposition, Peter was Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. He showed his true colours as a parliamentarian when, no longer on our executive or frontbench, he chaired a number of Senate inquiries, including the Senate Select Committee on A New Tax System, the Senate Select Committee on A Certain Maritime Incident—the ‘children overboard’ inquiry—and, most recently, the Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiry into services and treatment options for persons with cancer. All of these inquiries showed Peter’s personal characteristics. It has struck me for a long time that in many respects the best of Peter’s characteristics was his great integrity. You always knew where he stood, and he certainly let you know what he thought of where you stood. If you entered into a conversation with Peter and subsequently came to an agreement about policy or politics, it was always honoured. There was no honouring in breach, it was always honoured.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I think it is true to say that, whilst Peter had an avid interest in politics, his real passion was the politics of public policy. He was in politics not for the game of politics but for what politics could achieve—public policy outcomes and public policy contributions. Whilst, I think, far and away his most significant public policy contribution was as Minister for Trade during the Uruguay Round, his contribution as Minister for Industrial Relations, forging enterprise bargaining, was also by any measure a most significant achievement.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There are two personal anecdotes I am always left with when I think of Peter. The first is one I always threatened to tell about him when he was out of public office. I never went into the full details with Peter, and I think that from time to time he was worried about what I might say. Underappreciated in Peter’s ministerial career was his time as Minister for Resources. In our first term in opposition in 1996, I was shadow minister for resources and energy. Peter searched me out for a lunch meeting he had organised with representatives of the Western Australian minerals and petroleum resources industry. He started the lunch by saying: ‘I may or may not be in the next Labor cabinet, but Stephen Smith will be. I want him to have a complete understanding of the mineral and petroleum resources industry and I want you to show him every convenience and every support.’ He did that for three reasons: (1) his ongoing commitment to trying to ensure that the Labor Party was in government, not opposition; (2) his selfless devotion, in his own right, to advancing good public policy; and (3) wanting to advance the interests, in the national good and in the public interest, of an important industry.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I think it is true to say that, just as Peter was underappreciated as Minister for Resources, the resources industry itself has for a very long time been underappreciated; it has only been in more recent times that it has come to the fore. It has always struck me that there was no reason for Peter to do that for me personally and no personal reason for him to do that for himself. He did it because he thought it would advance the interests of a great industry and advance the interests of the Australian Labor Party.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The second anecdote is the one that I will go to my own grave remembering Peter for. It is not known by many—but known by Peter and Barbara—that Peter and Barbara have been constituents of mine. At the local level in my electorate, one of the great achievements of the Hawke and Keating governments was a Building Better Cities project known as the East Perth project, which saw the establishment of Claisebrook Cove and the revitalisation of East Perth as a thriving, modern community.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It was a week or so before it became public knowledge that Peter was suffering from the cancer and, given his and Barbara’s demeanour, I am sure it was before Peter and Barbara were aware of the advice and the diagnosis. But, as is common with me on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, I was on my own walk from my house, with Jane, along our oft-trod path to Trinity and the WACA via Claisebrook Cove. In Claisebrook Cove there are a number of restaurants and coffee shops, and one that Peter and Barbara often frequented was Lamont’s. And, as we were walking past, there were Peter and Barbara on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon. It was a beautiful Perth day. Peter was close to the water. The sun was shining. So we stopped our walk, went onto the balcony and just had a quick chat.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It was typical Peter. We had a chat about public life and politics. We were of course going through tough times and, once we analysed our tough times, he saw hope and optimism for the future. This was always Peter’s way. There were things that we could and should do to advance our cause. So we had a conversation about politics, a conversation about life, a conversation about family, and there was Peter in his element: with Barbara, chatting about politics, policy and life, and close to the water—on this occasion, the Swan, not the ocean, but nonetheless close to the water. As we walked away, I remarked to Jane just how happy he and Barbara were and how carefree and casual he seemed about life and our political predicament. And that is how I will always remember Peter and how I will always remember Peter with Barbara. I express my deepest sympathy and condolences to her and Peter’s family, and I mark my admiration for Peter Cook’s contribution to Australia’s national interest and to our public life.</para>

<para>—I join many people here today in wanting to pay my respects to Senator Peter Cook. We have heard a lot from other people about Peter’s career—people who are far more qualified than I am to talk about that—and it has been interesting and instructive to listen to the last few speakers. I did not know Peter personally at all until I arrived here in this parliament about five years ago, but I have had a number of opportunities in the last few years to get to know him. Peter always struck me right from the beginning as a man who never gave up. He always seemed to know what he was fighting for, and he took every opportunity to advance the cause.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I came to know Peter after what I guess many people would regard as the peak of his parliamentary career, but it seemed to me that he did not regard his work as anywhere near finished, and I admired him for that. His work, as far as I could work out, was the Labor Party and what it could do for Australia and for Australians. He was not interested in the machinations inside, only as much as it meant better things for our country. I admired Peter’s energy and his unflagging interest and personal commitment in continuing the fight for the things that he regarded as important. He always seemed to stay very focused on the real game and was often several jumps ahead of everybody else.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This unflagging interest and commitment to the real game was evident in how he dealt with his illness. I think the last of the many Senate inquiries that Peter chaired—many of them of great national importance—on cancer, was typical of Peter and his focus. I note his very practical response to the difficulty many people find when they are diagnosed, with a bewildering range of advice and options that people have to work their way through. I know from personal experience with members of my own family of that very bewilderment that people have to go through.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I want to put on record my thanks to Peter for his support for my own parliamentary career and for his role in its beginning. I regard my start here as a direct result of Peter’s and others’ interest in the health of the Labor Party. Peter cared very much about the Labor Party, as I said before, because he saw it as the best way of looking after the interests of Australia. I want to pass on to Barbara, Peter’s wife, my heartfelt sympathies and to wish her well as she comes to terms with Peter’s death and her loss.</para>

<para>—As chair of the Western Australian federal parliamentary Labor Party, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this condolence motion for Senator Peter Cook. But I also speak as a friend and as one who will mourn the loss of Peter—as a friend, as a colleague, as a senator whom I admired and as a senator who made a great contribution to his adopted state of Western Australia. He made a great contribution to his nation and to the party of which he was a dedicated and conscientious member and servant for so long. I do not want to speak of Peter’s enviable record since he came to this parliament back in 1983, as others have done that already. But in paying my respects to Peter I say that he will be sadly missed, as men of his ilk, dedication, professionalism, intellect, compassion and loyalty are always missed for they are men of rare character, particularly in politics.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I want to pay tribute to Peter’s wife, Barbara, who stood resolutely beside Peter as his partner, his mentor, his critic and indeed his closest friend. Barbara and Peter had a wonderful relationship. As hard as these last few months were on Peter, they were also indescribably hard on Barbara. But she never flinched or weakened in her love for him or in her resolve to stand by Peter and to fight beside him, with him and for him to the end. I just want to say to Barbara that you have our admiration, appreciation and thanks for the loving and caring way in which you looked after and nurtured Peter, our friend and colleague, during these difficult times. On behalf of myself, my wife, Noelene, and the WA parliamentary Labor Party, I wish Peter fair winds, calm seas and above all a peaceful voyage.</para>

<para>—It is really hard to encapsulate in a few words what you feel about someone who has had a real impact on your life here in federal parliament. I first met Peter when I started working for Senator Michael Tate back in 1988. I was just an electorate officer and occasionally I would wander up to Old Parliament House and be involved in what was then called the Centre Left faction. I remember going to a meeting in Melbourne and, as an electorate officer, listening to the wisdom of the so-called wise men who made up the Centre Left—and there were quite a few of them in those days. I remember then coming up and sitting in some of the committee rooms when we moved up to this place and once again seeing the men and women at the table discussing issues of national importance, taking in those gems of wisdom, thinking about them and perhaps changing my idea about what contribution I might make if I ever got up here. I well remember coming up here in 1993 as a raw backbencher and moving from the advisers’ seats up to the main desk and thinking to myself, ‘How can I contribute pearls of wisdom to these people?’ One of those people was Peter.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I know when we write the next chapter of the history of our party Peter will feature greatly because he has made a magnificent contribution to the Australian Labor Party, not just in Western Australia but nationally. He was the sort of bloke who would listen to all the various points of view put around the table and then had that wonderful capacity to sum up, point out the deficiencies in the nicest way of some of the arguments that had been put forward and then come up with what in most cases we agreed was the position we should take.</para>
<para pgwide="yes"> ‘Cookie’, as he was lovingly called, was a wonderful bloke. He was one of those mentors, one of those role models whom you meet only once or twice in your life. I consider him to be one of my mentors in the 13 years that I have been in this place. He would not dogmatically tell you what to do, how to do it and why you should do it; he was just there, as I said before, with pearls of wisdom, channelling, directing, and challenging you to think about issues.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Much has been mentioned about his wonderful wife, Barbara. There are many examples in history of two people working together in such a way that it has a dramatic impact not only on their family and their state but also on their nation and on so many other people. I have had the pleasure of enjoying their hospitality in Mandurah at that lovely house down on the beach. One of the regrets for me is that Peter never made it back to Mandurah. Rod Sawford, the member for Port Adelaide and I, with the permission of the whip, ventured up to the Mater Hospital recently to see Peter and spend a day with him in Sydney. Despite the fact that there were tubes coming out of a whole lot of orifices and there were bags hanging off him in two or three different positions, he was determined to get out of there, to feel the sun on his face and to feel the breeze. He was confident that he would get back to WA to see the sea that he loved. He was happy knowing that he had sailed his boat part of the way from Western Australia up to the Northern Territory.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is really hard, as I said at the outset, to say what is in your heart about someone who you really loved, who had an enormous impact on your life. He will always be there even though he has gone. We will send him off next week—most of our party and the former Prime Ministers who had the pleasure of serving with him in the Hawke and Keating governments. People have spoken today about the fact that he is taking the next journey. I know where he has gone. He will be happy.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We are always going to be there for Barbara. It is going to be tough. I say to his family that you have known a wonderful person whom you can remember for the rest of your lives. He has made a wonderful contribution to Western Australia and Australia and on the world stage he is held in great admiration and respect. Barb and his family have my sincere condolences for the loss of a wonderful man. Sixty-two years is far too short a lifetime but he has contributed more in those 62 years than most of us could ever contribute in several lifetimes.</para>

<para>—Peter Cook was a great friend, indeed a mate. I, along with many others in this place, am going to sorely miss him. My wife Carmen and I offer our condolences to Barbara and his family. On a number of occasions over recent years we thoroughly enjoyed the hospitality of the Cooks both in Perth and Mandurah, which the member for Franklin referred to. It is a delightful place where Peter was very much at home and full of vigour and life. Peter and Barbara were and are amazing people. Peter’s superb political and policy skills were very much complemented by this very great zest for life. He was a man who loved the outdoors and had a particular passion for the sea and sailing. It was my privilege over recent years to have shared in a number of aspects of both his professional life here as a politician and also some of his outdoor sea based pursuits.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Others have referred to Peter’s achievements both as a minister and as a parliamentarian. In a number of crucial areas, particularly in committee work in this parliament, Peter made a very considerable mark. Others have referred to the role he played on the Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee on the GST and a new tax system inquiry, on the Senate Select Committee on A Certain Maritime Incident, the ‘children overboard’ inquiry, and so on. From my point of view, given my role as a shadow minister with a particular interest in Pacific affairs, Peter made a very substantial contribution. In 2003, Peter chaired the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee inquiry into Australia’s relations with Papua New Guinea and the island states of the South Pacific. The committee report <inline font-style="italic">A Pacific engaged: Australia’s relationship with Papua New Guinea and the island states of the south-west Pacific</inline>, very much underpinned Peter Cook’s leadership, direction and chairmanship of that committee and made some extraordinarily powerful recommendations about taking forward Australia’s relationships within the South Pacific region. A key aspect of the report was the proposal for a Pacific political and economic community. It is an absolutely seminal idea which, in my capacity as a shadow minister and always noting Peter’s role as the author, I have taken forward, producing an ALP discussion paper on Pacific islands policy. It picks up this concept, which originated very much with Peter Cook.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In the course of preparing that report, Peter travelled extensively through the Pacific. I know from my subsequent travel there that he has an unsurpassed reputation in that region among leaders—political, social and economic—for the creative ideas that he drove very much through that Senate report. I was always intrigued after the production of that report to have accompanied Peter to a number of seminars at places like the ANU where his ideas were developed and reinforced. He certainly had a very substantial impact on thinking within Australia, both in the policy and academic areas and among Pacific islands leaders.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Peter never shied away from the tough ideas or the crucial issues. For example, one of the very interesting ideas that Peter pushed through the report <inline font-style="italic">A Pacific engaged</inline>, on a bipartisan basis, was the notion of trialling temporary short-term access for limited numbers of Pacific islanders to work in Australia, typically in seasonal employment. Given Peter’s own background, this was a tough area for him to address, but he understood the crucial and unavoidable nature of the proposal, emanating from Pacific communities. He was prepared to give very strong credibility to that proposal in the context of his thinking about the development of a Pacific community, so crucial to Australia, given our geographic proximity to that region. Tough ideas like that need considerable selling in the Australian community. He was never one to shy away from taking tough decisions when they were needed. Peter was a role model for many people in this place, including me, and a role model for people elsewhere. His life was far too short but it was a wonderful life. He has left his mark on many of us forever.</para>

<para>—I rise to support the condolence motion. I was deeply saddened when I heard of the death of my friend and colleague Peter Cook on Saturday. I extend to his wife, Barbara, and his family my deepest sympathy on his passing. He will be sorely missed among friends and members of this great parliament. It is fitting that this parliament pay such a tribute to Peter Cook because he was a parliamentarian of great intellectual substance and public stature, and had consummate political skill—personal and professional attributes that have been acknowledged by both sides of the House in this condolence motion.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Much has been said already about Peter Cook’s industrial and political career—a career that spanned decades and brought him to great service on behalf of all Australians in this parliament. In government he served in many ministerial capacities: as Minister for Resources, Minister for Industrial Relations, Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Minister for Trade, Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Science and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters. He had an enormous range of portfolios and he equipped himself very well in everything that he tackled. He was a great contributor to the life of the Senate in various capacities, both in debate and on committees, and was widely regarded for his capacity for political detail and his strategic political thinking, be that in the Labor Party itself or for Australia generally.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">He grew up in the industrial movement, a tough operator who, down through the years, made many friends as well as many enemies—as we all do in this place. But there was one thing both friend and foe shared in their view of Peter Cook: they respected his knowledge and his skill in not only handling people but managing the wider political task.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I entered the parliament in 1993 and I had three years in government when I was able to observe Peter Cook in his role as a government minister and as a senior member of the federal parliamentary Labor caucus. My first impressions of Peter were of a serious and very credible minister who was, as many have termed it, a workhorse for the government. I came to know him more intimately in opposition when the internal realignments of groups within the Labor caucus brought us into close orbit and personal contact.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Peter Cook possessed political skills that were honed in many years of active service in the industrial wing of the Labor movement and later in the political wing. He possessed an encyclopaedic knowledge of the history and personalities of the Labor movement. He was a gifted strategic thinker, borne of hard years of policy development and the execution of it in government. He was a very practical man, always dealing with the art of the possible. He was a brilliant negotiator—another skill honed on the way through his political life, and which was eventually brought to bear with consummate effect for the benefit of all Australians in the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. He was a true Australian patriot, never surrendering the independence of this nation as a minister or as a senator in those negotiations that he conducted on Australia’s behalf. He was politically tough but very patient with rookies like me when we entered this parliament.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">When we look at his party and union involvements, once again we can understand the stature that Peter had within the Labor movement. He rose to become Secretary of the Western Australian Trades and Labour Council and Vice-President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The party positions? Well, he occupied almost all of them: Convenor, State Industrial Relations Committee; Delegate, ALP Federal Conference; Member, ALP National Executive; and Member, ALP National Executive Committee. He was also a member of the Western Australian state executive.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It was an extraordinary breadth of experience and he really brought to bear a unique insight into the political process because he was master of the machinations that took place in the union movement. There were very few politicians within the Labor Party who understood the various machinations of the senior executive levels of the party. It was in that role that he became a force for moderation, balance and strategic thinking when others were going about pursuing their own political ambitions at the expense of the party.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Here in the parliament, he was a great strategic planner and thinker for Labor both in government and in opposition. I believe it was that unique combination that made Peter Cook one of the most outstanding parliamentary contributors and performers over the past two decades in this place. It was only in the later years that I came to know him in a personal sense.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">For those who understand the machinations of the Labor Party, we have two rather large groupings. In the middle of those two large groupings are some independents and other people from various groups that have existed historically in the party. Those groups came together to form an independent group, a balancing group, within the Labor Party’s caucus. It was in this role that Peter played an extraordinary part in counselling and guiding members such as me in the art of staying alive in the ALP. He also brought these great skills to bear for the benefit of the caucus in moderating the excesses that sometimes occur with the concentrations of power and the massive egos that often dominate the political stage. He recognised the importance of a centre balancing group within the caucus and the party structure. He gave great guidance and wise counsel. He was a mentor to us all.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I never got to sail on his ocean yacht. I happen to have an interest in yachting. When Peter found that out, he issued an invitation to visit him in Perth once he had left the parliament, to spend a weekend there and to take me sailing. I looked forward to that because it was an opportunity to get to know a man whom I had not got to know completely in the years that I had spent with him here in the parliament. My eternal regret is that I never got to Western Australia to join him on the yacht, to drink a few reds out on the ocean and to chew the fat on what was going on in the Labor Party and the nation.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">He was a person whom I think everybody around this House respected for his wise counsel. It will be in that capacity politically that he will be sorely missed. He knew the realities of political life. When the challenge came to his preselection he fought hard, but he knew the realities of the Labor Party and it was to our crowning disappointment in the Centre group that Peter was defeated. We knew in that defeat that the caucus had lost a very valuable contributor to political debate and to the management of egos and other matters in the caucus.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It was the same tenacity that he brought to his struggle against cancer. Indeed, I think his struggle for preselection became a metaphor for his later struggle against cancer. I had the good fortune to speak with Peter about his illness and, like many others, I preferred to him a person who I believe might have been able to help him on that journey. It was a very difficult journey, but I know from people who were closely associated with his struggle that he brought all the magnificent qualities to bear on it and gave great dignity and indeed great hope to those around him.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As Peter Cook could only do, his latter days were spent in the service of other Australians—that is, politically bringing a focus to the issue of cancer and the impact it has on families and bringing a focus to possible treatments that people might be able to avail themselves of in facing this terrible disease.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Most of all, he joined this struggle with Barbara. What a wonderful person we have all come to know in the Labor movement. This was a couple who were loved dearly by their fellow parliamentarians and associates. That love now extends to Barbara in Peter’s spirit to support her through a most difficult time.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In concluding my comments, the Labor Party has lost a great friend and a great warrior for the cause. To Barbara let me simply say this: as sure as night turns into day, as the sun has set on Peter’s life the sadness of this moment will gradually be replaced by warm memories of a great political life and a great life together.</para>

<para>—I rise to speak on this condolence motion in respect of the Hon. Peter Cook. I first met Peter Cook when I came to this parliament as a backbencher in 1998. I first worked with him on the GST inquiry, which was referred to in the condolence speeches by the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Hotham today. It was an opportunity to get to know Peter and to see his formidable political skills in operation.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">I also had the opportunity to work with him in that period, as I was deputy chair of our caucus committee on national security and trade and he, as shadow minister at that time, held the trade portfolio. As people may recall, one of the biggest political debates we had at that national conference in that period of opposition was the debate about free trade versus fair trade, as it was stylised. I got to see once again Peter’s great political skills at work in resolving that issue for the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">But it was in the last parliament—not my first parliament but my second parliament—that Peter and I became friends. I believe that we became friends because of a common understanding about the kind of values that one should bring to one’s life in politics. Peter understood the value of loyalty, the need for originality and the need to have the courage of your convictions. It is because of our shared belief in those things—the value of loyalty, the need for originality and the need to have the courage of your convictions—that we came to be personal friends in the last parliament.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I also had the opportunity to meet his family. I met not only his wife Barbara, about which much has rightfully been said—she is a truly amazing woman and every attribute of her strength and her character has been displayed in the way in which she has cared for Peter in this most tragic period—but also other members of his family, and it was my very great honour to launch the painting and drawing exhibition of Peter’s brother. Bill Cook is an artist and he had created an exhibition called <inline font-style="italic">The Presence of Absence—a Greek Odyssey</inline>. It was a painting and drawing exhibition in honour of his wife and his wife’s family, who were Greek migrants to this nation. So in the last parliament I had the opportunity not only to get to know Peter but to share events like that with Peter, his brother Bill and his extended family who were all gathered together. That will always be a very special memory for me.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In the period since Peter was diagnosed with the illness which tragically has taken his life, I have had the opportunity to meet and deal with him on a number of occasions. I have had the opportunity to dine with him in Canberra and to visit him in hospital. I have had the opportunity to share some social time with Barb, who was in Sydney caring for him for such an extended period. But, beyond this, I had the opportunity to work with him on the cancer policy, about which so much has been said in this condolence debate. I think it says something very special about Peter Cook that, having been given the worst possible news about the state of his health, he did not withdraw and turn inwards but dedicated much of his remaining strength to publicly raising the issue of cancer care on behalf of all cancer patients. He did this within this parliament before his term as senator expired, but he also did it beyond this parliament.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Once again, a very special memory for me is the launch of Labor’s cancer prevention policy, which I devised with Peter Cook in Perth in my capacity as shadow minister for health during the last election campaign. At that stage Peter was very unwell, but he was prepared to take part in a public discussion of his health, partly because he wanted to do what he could within the confines of his strength at that time to support Labor’s election to government. Obviously, the cause of Labor was something in which he passionately believed.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">He also wanted to use some of his strength to raise clearly with Australians the cancer prevention message. Peter’s illness started off as a melanoma. He was exposed to the harsh WA sun for long periods as a young man, particularly because of his love of water sports and yachting at a time when it was not clear to us and certainly not understood in a public health way that the sun was so dangerous. We have seen a revolution in community understanding and community attitudes to sun exposure in the last 10 or 15 years. But when Peter Cook was a young man, out there on the yacht and undertaking a variety of sports in the harsh and unforgiving sun of South Australia and Western Australia, where he grew up and where he spent most of his life, that was not someone not heeding health messages; at that stage the health messages were not known. He has paid such a terrible price for that. He wanted, in the course of advocating a cancer prevention message in the last campaign, to make sure it was clearly understood by young Australians, who can often feel bulletproof—particularly young men, who never think anything is ever going to happen to them—that there is a terrible price to be paid for not understanding how dangerous sun exposure can be.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">He not only undertook that activity but, as has been said by others, he spent much of his remaining time post diagnosis, when he was still in this parliament, raising the issue of cancer care through a bipartisan inquiry conducted by the Senate Community Affairs References Committee. When the report of the Senate inquiry was released, Peter said this, and I think it stands as a testament to what he was trying to achieve through that inquiry:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">… in my experience people diagnosed with cancer often have to make life affecting decisions at short notice, in a traumatised state of mind with very little information about the range of options available to them.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Specialist health care in Australia is among the best in the world but there is a bewildering number of adjuvant therapies and less conventional approaches which offer varying degrees of help, some over stated some not, which can be significant, if not decisive in aiding the healing process.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Patients often need assistance in assessing how these stack up and which of them might provide help.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">…         …         …</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The health debate is understandably dominated by Doctors, health care professionals, health bureaucrats and academics all with the apparent needs of the patients at heart but with transparent self interests of their own.</para>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">If this Inquiry can stand in the shoes of patients, and unambiguously take their point of view it will be a breath of fresh air.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The report, entitled <inline font-style="italic">The cancer journey: informing choice</inline>, was filed on 23 June 2005, just before Peter left the Senate. It received 105 submissions and conducted seven hearings. The report makes a number of very sensible recommendations and it is my hope that we can work together in a bipartisan fashion to make sure that these are implemented as Peter’s lasting legacy. I raised this matter with the Minister for Health and Ageing personally on Friday and through text messaging during the weekend. I believe that the minister is seriously looking at this matter and is considering adopting some or all of the recommendations of the report in memory of Peter.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I would particularly stress the need to adopt a Medicare item to ensure multidisciplinary case conferencing, because it was Peter’s experience that when a patient is trying to coordinate the vast array of advice into a treatment plan it is the patient who ends up navigating between the doctors. It is really the doctors who should get together and navigate a pathway for the patient, and if doctors could be paid to do that it could revolutionise the way in which cancer care is provided so that people find out all of their options far more easily, without having to struggle through it the way Peter struggled through it. As Peter would so often say, he is a man who brought to that task every advantage. He was an intelligent man, an experienced man, a man who had been in public policy all his life and a man who had contacts all around the country. And if he found it difficult to navigate that pathway, then clearly this is almost impossible for someone who comes without those advantages. We will miss Peter Cook. We will miss him dreadfully. If we can, in his memory, initiate that kind of change for cancer care, then that will be a lasting testament to his life’s journey.</para>

</talker>
<para>—It is interesting that the member for Lalor spoke about the values of Peter Cook. That is where I am going to start: where those values actually came from. We were both children of waterside workers in Port Adelaide and we were such stunning individuals as young 10- and 11-year-olds we did not recognise each other at the wharfies’ picnics that were held at Largs Bay beach each year. We both embellished the stories about who won the sprint races. I won them; he swore he won them. But I do remember one year when a girl beat both of us. She was not allowed to be in the race, so she raced outside the lanes and beat both of us.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">The context of the 1950s established Peter’s values, and for us in Port Adelaide they were times of strikes and poverty. People have talked about Peter’s stoicism. Let me tell a story about what happened at that time. Some of the strikes lasted for three and four months. There was no income. I remember my father sitting in a rocking chair, reading a book and smoking a roll-your-own cigarette. I said to him, ‘There’s no food in the house,’ and he looked down over his glasses at me and said, ‘It won’t kill you,’ and continued reading. A couple of days later we walked the five miles to Port Adelaide from where we lived in Largs North to collect our rations—sugar, flour, bread, a pound of meat and some butter, soup vegetables and maybe a few apples. That lasted our family of three for a week. Peter’s family would have been the same. Poverty was part of the life that we lived. But stoicism was part of that Midlands and Scottish heritage that we shared, and I will come back to that stoicism a little later.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This was also a period of great change. Peter was a great advocate of trying to deal with change. As kids we would not have understood it at the time, but Port Adelaide was going through a tremendous change. There were 3,000 wharf labourers and 1,000 casual labourers. I can remember my father saying to me that within a short period of time—he did not call it containerisation; he did not use the term—there will only be 300 wharfies in Port Adelaide. In fact it turned out to be 100. It was a time of dramatic change. I remember the debates within our families—they were always about politics. There were strong arguments, and in our family we talked about religion. We had very strong religious views—Protestant, Catholic and nonaligned. I remember on one occasion when I was about 12 years old saying to my grandfather, sick of the arguments about politics and religion, ‘How come we never have any sensible conversations about sex?’ I remember the backhander coming very quickly and I never mentioned that again.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Peter’s family was similar. Politics was always spoken about, argued about and valued. The commitment that Peter always had to change, and that change can benefit people, came from when we were young men. We played football together—not on the same side. Although he was the son of a Port Adelaide wharfie, he actually played senior Colts for North Adelaide—we always used to regard them as a B-grade Labor club but, nevertheless, a Labor club.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I suppose the next time I met Peter was in the context of factional politics within the Australian Labor Party and the formation of the Centre Left. I was not a founding member of the Centre Left; I was Mick Young’s campaign director at the time. I thought the Centre Left was just as silly as the other two factions, to be quite honest, and I was not a member. But eventually I did join that group and watched Peter’s contribution. He was a heavy hitter, and he was an original thinker.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">From 1996 I actually shared accommodation with Peter at Kingston. In the first couple of years, we shared with David Beddall, the former member for Rankin, and then with Harry Quick, the member for Franklin. Later, Peter and I shifted out of Kingston and moved to Palmerston, that terrible place out there on the highway—it would take us about an hour to get in in the morning. We argued about the formation of the independents and, with Michael Duffy of the non-aligned group, we actually formed the independents in 1996-97. Gavan O’Connor, the member for Corio, and I were the first co-chairs of that.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">When we lived together, there were not many people in the Senate other than from your own state that you developed a close relationship with. We seemed to operate at different hours. We both had a couple of agenda items: I was trying to give up smoking in 1996; he was trying to give up eating. We all talked about the ‘push away’ technique, which of course is the only technique to stop smoking or eating too much. You can see I gave up smoking for eight years, but I have not managed the ‘give up eating’ part. We used to have nightly briefings at the end, at 11 or 12 o’clock at night, and we ate toast and tea and fruit loaf and tea—far too much. We talked personally, politically, professionally and procedurally. We would talk about our beginnings. We talked about the waterfront in Port Adelaide and how things had changed. We talked about change, strikes, football, sailing, horseracing, religion, poverty, race and gender.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">We talked about our heritage in terms of a special humour that we enjoyed coming from port cities, a Midlands humour in which you juxtapose one given against another and you just drive in a punchline. They tell stories of your childhood, your first job, falling in love, getting married, difficulties in marriage and death. Maybe I should give a couple of examples of these sorts of silly folksy stories, because they epitomise that stoic sort of view that we both enjoyed and both had imbued in us. There is a little kid crying on the corner of Dale Street in Port Adelaide in the middle of the Depression. The vicar comes past and he says, ‘Why are you crying?’ The kid says, ‘My parents are fighting.’ The vicar says, ‘Who’s your father?’ He says, ‘That’s what they’re fightin’ about.’</para>
<para pgwide="yes">There are stories about death as well: there is a death in the family and no-one has dealt with a funeral before. Mum calls in all the family and she says to everybody, ‘Well, Mum’s left no instructions as to whether Grandma is to be embalmed, cremated, buried or whatever.’ And the husband pipes up, ‘Take no chances: do all three.’ That was the humour. Some people do not understand it; others do.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">He had a great thrill also in learning and knowledge. It is interesting that the debates on education in this country often focus on a knowledge economy and knowledge in education, which, for someone from my background, is a load of nonsense in many ways. Knowledge is a lowly intellectual skill. Peter came to a much more pragmatic view about what education could do and how it could change. He understood it was a lowly intellectual skill. His skills were in being able to expose a point, to translate, to interpret, to predict, to summarise, to identify the attributes in an issue and to categorise. He had insight, intuition and analysis skills. He was very methodical; he was innovative; he was original. He could find a way through a problem. That is why he was so successful in negotiation and so hard-nosed, so determined and so strong an advocate of the issues that he stood for. But, as Julia Gillard mentioned, those skills were softened also, because he had a particular courage, loyalty, integrity and honesty, and he respected other people who had those skills and reciprocated them.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">He was not averse to publicity though—he loved a bit of publicity. I remember the competitive efforts put in by his staff, in particular a tall, gangly New Zealander called Don McKay who was a press secretary to Peter. The competition was with Gareth Evans’s office as to who would get the serious stories in the serious press—not the tabloid nonsense, the real stories. It was funny to watch and funny to listen to him retelling those stories, particularly late at night, when he could be self-deprecating in a way that other people perhaps did not see. But I also enjoyed bringing him back to earth in those nightly meetings. He would always start off resolutely defending the position that he took. It did not last too long before he burst out laughing and came back to earth.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Since Peter and I lived together for a number of years from 1996, our wives got to know each other very well. We shared a lot of family stories. Barbara—what an amazing woman. She connected with Peter intellectually, emotionally, physically and spiritually. That latter element in particular will never die. That goes on eternally, ethereally. It is in the ether; it remains; it continues on with all the people that he has affected and mentored and appointed and befriended. When things were not going too well—and there were times before his illness when things were not going too well for our group and we were getting dudded all the time—we used to console each and say, ‘We weren’t too bad for sons of Port Adelaide wharfies, after all. When it is all said and done, it isn’t too bad.’ Well, Peter, it was not too bad at all.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">As I said, Peter Cook was a heavy hitter, but that does not mean he could not be wounded. All of us can be wounded in this game, and wounded he was—by treachery and betrayal that so dominated his last attempt at securing a further term in the Senate. It should not have been that way, but it was. We do terrible things to each other in this game of politics, and terrible things were done to Peter’s reputation at that time. We shall never know its true impact on his health. It may have been considerable; it may not have been. But if it was considerable, we should take his passing and that of other people in this place as some cause for reflection and regret. Peter had dreams like all of us—the Mandurah house on the ocean where we shared accommodation, meals, a few drinks and a few laughs with other colleagues, such as Harry Quick, Bob Sercombe, the late Jane Gerick and many others. And there was the yacht. They no longer will carry any earthly domain, but they will carry Peter’s spirit forever.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I suppose that, when is all said and done, the pawn and the king finish up in the same box. But Peter Cook, I think, was a giant of the labour movement. Even that is reduced to other things. When all is said and done, in this place, on this earth, it is the friendships and the quality of the relationships that you develop throughout your life that continue to mark your life far more than anything else. The friendships that Barbara and Peter developed, maintained and cherished throughout their life will remain. Hopefully, they will sustain Barbara in this difficult time of grief.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Peter Cook’s was a life cut short but a life well lived and a life to celebrate in the quiet pride that his heritage will determine. Vale Peter Cook. Bye. See you some time later.</para>

<para>—I join in the debate on the condolence motion commenced earlier today with the contribution made by the Prime Minister in the House of Representatives. I mourn the passing of Peter Cook, as do many people across this nation. He was a good man, a man of deep conviction and principle, a man of integrity, a man of formidable intellect and a charismatic personality.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Cookie was a friend of many years, dating back to our days together in the union movement and more recently when our paths crossed as colleagues in parliament. He was always a person of good sense—a person of good sense but also one with a great sense of humour. He was generous in spirit and optimistic by nature. This morning he was described by our leader, Kim Beazley, as a man of ‘ordered passion’. I have certainly seen the passion in Peter, but it is true to say that he never just wore his heart on his sleeve: as committed as he was to a range of social justice causes, he was a great strategic thinker, a good negotiator and a man, as I say, who always had integrity in his dealings with people.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It was his optimism that gave him the strength and the courage to face the battle against the cancer which took his life all too soon, at the age of 62. Glancing at many of the obituaries written this morning, I was struck by a particular headline which read ‘Political life a labour of love’. It is true. Peter Cook loved the labour movement and served it with great distinction in both its industrial and political wings. He never lost sight of his roots and was always a staunch defender of working people and their families.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It is not surprising that his working class background helped to shape the nature of the man and his convictions. His grandfather was a Broken Hill miner blacklisted for his union activities who died from consumption at the age of 26. His father—as Rod Sawford, the member for Port Adelaide, has commented—was a waterside worker. The Sawford family and the Cook family shared many attributes.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Peter left school at a very young age—15. But that was never a barrier to the immense contribution he made throughout his working life. His union involvement began in the clerks union in South Australia, working then as a clerk in an abattoir. He moved to Western Australia with his young family in 1970. By force of personality and hard work, by 1975 he had risen through the ranks to become Secretary of the Western Australia Trades and Labour Council.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">It was during this period that I came to know him well as a friend and colleague. I well remember the election in 1981 in Sydney at the town hall when he was elected as Vice-President of the ACTU. I hope in some small way I assisted in that outcome, which saw his rightful elevation to a position of prominence in the national union movement.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Peter and I had cause to reflect on that experience in 1981 when, as a relatively young woman in the union movement, I ended up on a ticket with Peter Cook and John Halfpenny and I was in the third spot. I spent a whole day going around telling my colleagues from the teachers union that it was very important that they did not put me as No. 1 on that ticket and that, in order for Peter to be elected, it was vital that I had no first preferences in the ballot. The teachers were somewhat perplexed about this, never having been part of a broader union movement or understanding the importance of tickets, but, as it was, they did the right thing: they voted for Peter and Peter was elected to the position of Vice-President of the ACTU.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In total, he served the trade union movement with distinction for some 17 years before he decided to move to the federal political arena. In 1983 he was elected to the Senate and gave 22 years of dedicated public service in that chamber until his retirement in 2005. Peter was always an effective team player. He was never one to just sing about his own contribution. As others have commented, he served the Hawke and Keating governments in a range of portfolios, including industrial relations and trade and as Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. He was a cabinet minister for six of those years and also served with distinction as Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. In his departing speech in the Senate, Peter Cook had this to say about his career:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">If I have a high point of my career, I am proud of … the industrial relations reforms, but I think the proudest is sitting behind the Australian flag … in the closing stages of the Uruguay Round and, on behalf of Australia and the Cairns Group, negotiating a successful outcome.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I remember very well Peter’s position as minister in the IR portfolio. By that time I had also advanced in my career in the union movement and I had cause to deal with Peter on a range of industrial relations issues. He held the portfolio of industrial relations longer than any other portfolio and was rightly proud of his achievements. I again quote from his Senate speech. He said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para pgwide="yes">Industrial relations was a portfolio that I held longer than any other. In that, we wrote a new industrial relations act—the first new industrial relations act since 1904. We took the first steps towards a decentralised wage-fixing system. We introduced the best practice program in which we went to workplaces and encouraged cooperation rather than conflict. Under the guidance of John Prescott, then the general manager of BHP, we created reform in the workplace by having an emphasis on skill and training and by managers flattening the hierarchy down to one or two and relying on the workers’ knowledge of how best to run their plant. That program succeeded in increasing productivity quite dramatically. The brains of the work force was harnessed rather than alienated in the exercise of the push by particular companies to achieve success. I think that was a great scheme.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I concur with those comments. I think one of Peter’s lasting legacies will be his key role in moving to a more deregulated industrial relations system, one which nevertheless protected all working people, as was his commitment, by enshrining the award system as the industrial safety net. He always cared about those with the least bargaining capacity.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">This morning I read Cookie’s first speech in the Senate, a speech he made on 4 May 1983. That speech covered some of Peter’s long-held commitments and principles. In that speech, as a newly elected member of the Senate, he reflected on the national economic summit that tried to bring people together rather than on the conflict and the division that we had seen in the lead-up to the summit. He talked about the positive aspects of the prices and incomes policy approach that, as we know, underpinned the historic accord agreement between Labor and the union movement. He talked about the issue of taxes and, with a classic quote that is so much Peter, he said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">The essential problem is not to make the rich pay higher rates of tax than the poor. It is to make the rich pay any income tax at all.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Those comments were prophetic and still as true today as they were when he said them in 1983.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">He talked in his first speech about the importance of the union movement and its importance particularly to maintaining the living standards of all Australians. He talked with some conviction about the issue of job security, an issue that is still very much with us today. He ended his speech with his pledge to work hard to ensure world peace and nuclear disarmament—issues that he carried with him throughout his life.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The last thing that I did pick up in his speech—and I had not been aware of the comments he made then, but it says something about the man back in 1983 when the promotion of women in public life was not so much a mainstream issue as it is today—was his comments on the then recent state election that had been held in Western Australia and the federal election. He was really proud of the fact that a number of women had won seats with huge swings—seats that had never been held by Labor before. He commented also on the achievements of his colleague Wendy Fatin, in the federal seat of Canning, who came to the House with a 13 per cent swing. I would just like to read some extracts from that speech. About the increased representation of women, Peter said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Some observations can be made about those figures. Firstly, the figures indicate that the affirmative action program of the Australian Labor Party in selecting women candidates is successful. Secondly, the result removes completely and, I believe, for all time any suggestion that women candidates cannot succeed in being elected to office. Thirdly, it may even open the question that women candidates are a positive advantage to the political party they represent.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">As I say, those comments were made at a time when the issue of women’s representation in political life was not part of the mainstream agenda and were certainly made before Labor instituted constitutional changes to ensure that this parliament better reflected the community that we are here to represent.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">When Peter was diagnosed with cancer he explained then that his dominant emotion was one of shock and numbing disbelief. He said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">Most of my time in politics, I’d been in economic portfolios. I’d spent virtually zero time worrying about health issues. I found myself naked and alone at the bottom of a very steep learning curve, wondering: how do I deal with a problem that I know very little about?</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">As we all know, Peter, in his formidable manner, tenaciously turned adversity to advantage. They were the words used by the member for Hotham in his contribution this morning in the House, and I thought those comments ‘adversity to advantage’ were so true. In his last months as a senator, as we know, he was instrumental in setting up an inquiry which looked at the myriad treatment options for cancer patients and encouraged politicians to work to help people find more effective ways of fighting the disease—a disease that ultimately claimed his life. As Peter presented the report of the inquiry on his final day in the Senate, he said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">When I was diagnosed I knew nothing about the disease. Initially it was a frightening and frustrating experience. With little or no knowledge I had to make life-critical decisions in an urgent time frame. Faced with that immense task it is very easy to despair and give up.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">And so it would be, but not for Peter Cook. He said:</para>
<quote pgwide="yes">
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">I have learnt that there is no such thing as a silver bullet here—no single, one solution—and that the answer, if there is one, lies in integrating a number of treatments.</para>
</quote>
<para class="block" pgwide="yes">He commented in that speech that he had sat on numerous inquiries—very important inquiries dealing with the GST and the issue of the ‘children overboard’—but that this inquiry may ‘well be the most important inquiry I have sat on.’ I trust the government will respond promptly and comprehensively to the recommendations of the report and, in doing so, provide a lasting legacy to the years of devoted public service given to the people of this nation by Senator Peter Cook.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">In concluding, I join with all earlier speakers in paying tribute to Peter’s wife, Barbara. She was his tower of strength, and I know from my personal conversations with Peter how indebted he was to her, not just in their dreadful struggle with his cancer and through those dark, black days but in their loving and productive personal and political relationship that helped ensure that Senator Peter Cook was able to make a very significant contribution to public life in this country.</para>

<para>—I feel somewhat humbled following the excellent contribution of the honourable member for Throsby. I wish I could stand before you and say that I knew Peter Cook very well. Although I had served in the caucus for many years with him, I cannot make that claim, but there are a number of claims I can make. The late Senator Peter Cook was very much a product of the labour movement and the trade union arena, where he served in the highest positions—as the Secretary of the Western Australia Trades and Labour Council and as Vice-President of the ACTU. Never once did Peter deny his involvement with the trade union movement. On the contrary, he was always proud of it. He started off life as a fitter and turner—in crude working class language, we would say a ‘titter and feeler’—but he added to that by undertaking a university course.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">He served in the parliament for so long. It was only on 1 July this year that he retired. He had such a short retirement. The member for Throsby mentioned his period as the Minister for Industrial Relations. It was a period of great change. It was not one where we tried to divide the bosses from the workers; in fact, it was quite the reverse. We got rid of so many demarcation disputes. The one statistic that I would like to quote is that in the automotive industry there were 304 separate awards that impacted on it. In Peter’s time, we reduced them to nine. In fact, I am fond of quoting the words of a union delegate in Tasmania. When trying to describe the breadth of the changes that Peter had initiated in industrial relations he said, ‘Prior to these changes when I clocked on at work, I was expected to leave my brains behind; but with these changes, when I clocked on at work, I was expected to bring my brains with me.’</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Peter worked so hard at collapsing that traditional divide between management and the work force and at involving the work force. I have always thought that involving the work force in key decisions was the most sensible management practice. If I think of Peter, the changes he wrought in the industrial relations system will always stay with me. It is such a contrast with what is being done today where there is almost zealotry to separate workers from management, to re-introduce the gulf, to not make workers part of the productive process. Peter was an outstanding Minister for Trade. People have talked about all he did with the Uruguay Round and establishing the Cairns Group and what a force for change that was. Indeed, it was significant. In a number of areas, the Hawke-Keating years gave to Australia a sense that we are a country capable of punching above our weight and, in trade, Peter was no exception.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Of all Peter’s contributions, the thing that should stay with us is that he was prepared to so publicly share what was a tragedy. Notwithstanding all his contributions—as a relatively young man he had given long service to the trade union movement and then to the parliament as a very senior minister and Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate—we should remember that he so generously shared with us the calamity of his own disease and diagnosis. What courage he showed. Would I have the same courage? I am not sure. I do not want to reflect on you, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, but would you have the courage? I am not sure. But the thing I can say about Peter Cook is that he did have the courage. Like the member for Hotham and the Leader of the Opposition, I commend Peter’s wife, Barbara, for the services she performed. The term ‘in sickness and in health’ now has a new meaning for what Barbara did over the weeks and months of Peter’s illness. It is, I think, a renewal of the inspiration of the relationship between a man and a woman. I express my condolences to Barbara and to Peter’s four children. I think Australia is the better for the life of Senator Peter Cook. I mourn his passing.</para>

<para>—As I recall it, I first met Peter Cook in the early eighties when I became active in the organisation of the Australian Labor Party. He was someone on the move and subsequently became a senator for my state of Western Australia. He was very impressive and persuasive even then. I joined the group to which he belonged in the Western Australian Labor Party. If people look at Peter’s career, they will see a ministerial and parliamentary career of great substance—indeed, a career which many of us envy and seek to emulate. With his selfless service, Peter has provided a great role model for future parliamentarians. He diligently discharged his duties as a minister and a senator. He was always a flexible thinker as well—curious and well informed. Peter always had a book in his bag and was willing to ask people their opinion. He read extremely widely. Perhaps because his own education was initially curtailed, he informed himself and continued his education every day of his life. Peter Cook was intelligent and articulate—sometimes to a fault—and always a great advocate for the causes he embraced. He had a great respect for evidence; he would always test ideas against the facts. He was not doctrinaire, although he held his values strongly. He was always able to argue from first principles and make a very persuasive case.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">One of the things that always struck me about Peter was his unflagging energy. You have to have that to be a senator from Western Australia. The travel alone would defeat most people, but I do not think I ever heard Peter complain about that. In fact, I think he was most distressed not to continue as a senator. But, as he had always done, he made the necessary adjustments and got on with the rest of his life. Sadly, the rest of his life was not to be much longer.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">A lot of people have already spoken eloquently and in detail about the areas of public service for which Peter was best known—his contribution to the economic life of this nation and, in particular, industrial relations, resources and trade. He was responsible for very significant reforms, working with other ministers in the Hawke and Keating governments to transform the nation’s economy and industrial relations. But these are matters that have been well canvassed by others. I simply want to say that the contribution he has made is peerless, and I hope his family will be comforted by the fact that so many people recognise that contribution. But something that has perhaps not been made much of is the fact that Peter was always very alert to the social consequences of these reforms. He was not hard-nosed or careless about it. He understood the need to compensate those people who might have lost from the reforms and the need to support those in the community who are without power.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The other thing that perhaps has not been much remarked on is the fact that he was a true internationalist, whether in relation to trade or to disarmament. He understood the need to spread the globe’s wealth. He was acutely aware of poverty and the suffering of others. I remember having a discussion with him about HIV, retrovirals and the fact that a lot of the big pharmaceutical companies were very reluctant to allow their intellectual property to be diminished by providing such drugs to the Third World. He argued very strongly in favour of that move. As we have heard, he was also a strong supporter of international disarmament.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Something that I discovered in making some inquiries today, as I was not aware of it, is that he understood the problems of resource depletion. As Minister for Resources he really did come to terms with the fact that there are limited resources. He also understood the problems of environmental degradation. The initiatives on salinity that he was responsible for and the attempt to reverse the damage to the Murray-Darling Basin are the basis for the work being done today; indeed, I think he was impatient with the fact that not nearly enough progress was being made.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">He made an unparalleled contribution to the ‘children overboard’ inquiry, as it has become known, conducted by the Senate Select Committee on A Certain Maritime Incident. We have also heard about his recent contribution to cancer support in the inquiry by the Senate Community Affairs References Committee that was to mark the end of his parliamentary career. I do hope that those responsible take up many of the recommendations of that committee. I for one have seen far too many people struggle with cancer.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I simply want to say, rather than going through the details of his career, that Peter was always a man of unfailing good humour and considerable wit. He was someone with whom you would always enjoy having a conversation. He was a generous, unassuming man. He never measured his friendship. He was not the sort of person to look over your shoulder to see who in the room might be more important. He was generous to a fault, and I certainly had reason to notice that when I had difficulties of my own. I want to pass on my sincere condolences to Barbara, to his children and to their extended family. I know how difficult this period has been for them with Peter’s extended and very painful illness. I know that they will miss him in ways that we cannot imagine, but I hope that they will be somewhat comforted by the fact that so many people had so much regard for him and his work.</para>

<para>—Serving 22 years in the national parliament is a long, long time by any measure and in anyone’s language, but for those who travel from the west and back again on a regular basis I think it is an enormous period of time. The pressure it puts on the physical wellbeing and on the family unit is something that can only really be contemplated by those who have endured that trek backwards and forwards. So Peter Cook’s commitment to public life in Canberra was very much a physical one but, more important than that, it was an intellectual one. As so many speakers before me have said, few people could match the intellectual contribution in this place of one former senator: Peter Cook.</para>
</talk.start>
<para pgwide="yes">Peter and I probably had more in common than he realised, and I regret in a sense that I had not ever at any time discussed that with him. You think of these things too late. Like Peter, I was a tradesman, someone who left school at a relatively young age, keen to do a trade and to work with my hands. Like Peter, I know that it is an experience that I would never relinquish. I remain proud of my time in my trade and the real life experiences it delivered to me and the way in which that contributed to the development of my being and personality. I know that Peter would say the same thing of his own experiences. Peter was a rebel in a sense, and I consider myself a nonconformist from time to time. Peter always stood up for what he believed in, which were always those things that conformed with Labor principles, and I like to think that I do the same thing. At the same time, like me, he understood that times change and that the way in which Labor ceased to successfully implement its principles changed, as the world changes. I am sure that Peter would agree that he saw it that way as well. His strict adherence to Labor tradition and Labor Party policy and principles will, of course, go unchallenged.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I would like tonight to briefly speak for a few people who are not here that I know would like to make a contribution to this condolence debate—all of them colleagues of Peter Cook and two of them former cabinet colleagues. The first is Paul Keating, who I know had a very high regard for Peter Cook and considered him a valued part of his government. The second is Laurie Brereton, who of course also shared a time in the cabinet with Peter Cook and who I know valued his friendship very strongly. I know they have their own opportunities to express their sympathies to Peter’s family, but I know that they would appreciate being acknowledged as people who were very close to Peter Cook over those many years.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">The third is Mark Latham, the former Leader of the Opposition, who again, I know, like me and so many in this place, developed a very high regard and respect for Peter Cook in the period in which he was in this place. I know the feelings were mutual, and I know that Peter Cook saw in Mark Latham great potential and that he was very supportive of Mark’s work in this place. I know that Mark would want to acknowledge Peter Cook’s wise counsel, advice and guidance in the period when Mark Latham was leader of the party in this place.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Peter Cook spent most of his life working in the interests of others not only in this place but, prior to that, as an active member of the trade union movement. Ironic is not the right word, but it is typical of Peter Cook that he spent his last months with us working for those who would follow him, working in support of those who will face the challenges posed by that terrible disease we have not really come to terms with and which, in a generic form, we describe as cancer.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">Like so many other people in this place, I feel very pleased to have known Peter Cook, to have been a colleague of Peter Cook and to have been a friend of Peter Cook. I was speaking at a local ALP branch meeting just yesterday when I moved a motion asking the branch to acknowledge the great contribution of Peter Cook and to express its sympathy on the occasion of his passing. I made the point there that you meet many people in politics, many and varied in their personalities and many and varied in their depth of contribution to public debate, but that those that really stand out are those who demand silence when they speak. Everyone knew that when Peter Cook wanted to say something he indeed had something to say and all would quickly listen very carefully. I think that is a very important measure of the regard in which he was held in this place and in wider circles, and we will miss him very dearly.</para>
<para pgwide="yes">I regret the way in which he departed this place. I thought it was unfortunate, given the contribution he had made. In many senses I know that that was retribution for certain actions he took out of a determination to achieve the wider good of the Australian Labor Party. In many senses, that will stand for a long time as a dark mark against my own party, but we move on from that. He will be much more remembered for the wonderful things he did for the party and the wonderful things he did for his wider community, and we will miss him dearly.</para>
