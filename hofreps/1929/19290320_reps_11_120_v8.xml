            <para>- I ask the Minister for Works whether anything is being done towards the construction of the proposed new road between Goulburn and Canberra, for which a sum of &#163;150,000 was voted by the last Parliament. Has the attention of the Minister been called to the state of the existing road? The section to Tarago was placed in a tolerable condition some time ago, but it has deteriorated very much. Between Tarago and Bungendore the condition of the surface is such as cannot be described in parliamentary language. Will the Minister say what the Government has done, or is doing, or contemplates doing, to improve that highway? </para>

            <para>- A sum of money was voted by this Parliament for the making of a new road between Canberra and Goulburn, and that vote was supplemented by a sum of money made available by the Government of New South Wales. A contract has already been let for &#163;29,000. The Federal Capital Commission has, I understand, arranged to standardize that portion of the road which is within the Federal Territory. </para>

I see little possibility of the matter receiving the attention of Cabinet before the approaching adjournment. However, it will be dealt with by the Government as early as possible and made available to the public. A copy of the report has been sent to the Premier of South Australia on the understanding that he is to treat it as confidential, and not disclose any information in regard to it until this Government has made it available to the public. </para>

        <para>Sydney, Friday</para>
        <para>In an official statement to-day the Miners&#39; Federation claim that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brace&#39;s</inline> offers that they should select an accountant from three nominated by the Institute of Chartered Accountants is very much loaded. The miners&#39; officials claim that their investigation has resulted in the discovery that 47 accountants who are members of the Chartered Institute are shareholders in coal companies. One of these accountants holds 1,700 shares in coal mines. </para>
        <para>If that statement is correct, will the Prime Minister nominate an accountant from the Auditor-General&#39;s department, to work in conjunction with the accountant which the miners would select, in conducting an inquiry into the alleged excessive profits of the coal-owners and the private railway and shipping companies, with a view to bringing about the resumption of work in the coal industry at an early date? If not, will the right honorable gentleman inform the House if he intends to permit Parliament to go into recess whilst the coalowners continue their illegal lockout, which has brought so much misery and starvation upon those engaged on the coalfields? </para>

            <para>- I understand from the question that the honorable member is anxious to know if the Government will adopt an entirely new basis for the appointment of a firm of chartered accountants to investigate the figures submitted to the conference at Canberra. The Government is not prepared to do that. As to the appointment of a member of the Auditor-General&#39;s staff to co-operate in an investigation concerning the profits of the coal-owners and private railway and shipping companies, my reply is that the whole matter will be investigated by a royal commission, with the assistance, not merely of the Auditor-General&#39;s department and of any firm of accountants that may be selected by the miners&#39; representatives, but also with that of any firm or individual that the commission may think necessary to call to its aid. The inquiry to be conducted by a firm of accountants to be nominated by the representatives of the miners was only to investigate the figures supplied to the Premier of New South Wales, in order to ascertain whether they were correct. </para>

If the honorable member is able to give an undertaking to that effect, he is in a different position from that of the representatives  of  the miners, who were not prepared to give such an assurance. </para>

              <para>- I think it extremely improbable that any firm would be nominated if it, or any of its partners, held shares in a colliery company, though I cannot give any guarantee  as to that. But in the event of a firm of chartered accountants of the highest possible reputation being selected, some of whose members held shares in a colliery, the honorable member, I presume, is not so unreasonably prejudiced that he would suggest that it should be precluded from conducting an investigation. </para>

              <para>- The proposal made to the representatives of the miners was that three - the number was subsequently increased to six - firms of chartered accountants should be nominated by the head of their profession - the  president  of the Institute of Chartered Accountants - and that the miners should select one of them. If it were impossible to place reliance upon the work of a firm so selected by the representatives of the men, it would be impossible to carry out any inquiry with confidence. The proposal originally made should ensure the confidence of the whole people, and I am not prepared to depart from it. </para>

            <para>- A deputation which waited upon the Minister for Public Works in South Australia some months ago, in connexion with the Port Augusta water supply, urged that, as the population of that town was largely composed of Commonwealth employees, and as South Australia was not able to do anything in improving the water supply, representations be made to the Commonwealth Government for assistance. Since then, with the honorable member for Boothby and representatives of South Australia in another place, I have waited on the Minister, but have not yet received a reply to the request made to him. I have now received a telegram from Port Augusta, the purport of which is that consideration has been given to the request, and that it has been definitely re-jected. I ask the Minister whether the proposal has been rejected, and, if not, what is the position? The matter is urgent, as the residents of Port Augusta are experiencing a water famine. </para>

The Prime Minister replied that it was not in the public interest that such information should be given. I now ask the right honorable gentleman if he does not consider that there has been a grave evasion of duty and that, in the public interest, the people should have all the facts ? Does he not also think that it is not in the public interest for the Commonwealth Oil Refinery to enter into trade combinations with other oil companies? </para>

            <para>- In replying to questions I cannot express opinions; but if that were permitted, I would not do so unless all the facts were before me. The first fact to be ascertained is whether the sale involved an evasion of duty. As to the suggestion that the Commonwealth Oil Refinery Company is entering into a combination with other oil companies, there is no ground for suggesting that it has done anything of the sort. If, in the ordinary course of its business it has sold a portion of its product to any other company, that is a matter upon which one should know the facts before expressing an opinion. </para>

Will the Minister see that the practice which prevails in other civilized communities, of placing a name upon each office is adopted in this case? </para>

          <para>. - I have a motion on the notice-paper for the appointment of a select committee to inquire into and report upon the fruit and hop industries. This is of the utmost importance to the small fruit industry of Tasmania, which is at present being butchered. Our fruit-growers are being compelled to sign contracts which are positively vicious if not actually dishonest, and unless something is done before the House rises to have the whole matter inquired into, it will be impossible to do anything effective in relation to it this year, and the small fruit-growers of Tasmania and, to some extent, of Victoria will find themselves in the same unfortunate position next season as they are in at present. Some honorable members regard certain items of private business which appear on the notice-paper as of more importance than certain items of Government business. If the motion is carried, shall we be given an opportunity to discuss private members&#39; business before the House rises? </para>

        <para>With regard to the question of the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coleman),</inline> I point out that I notified the Leader of the Opposition the other night of the measures with which it is proposed to deal before the Easter adjournment. They are the Economic Research Bill, the Income Tax Assessment Bill, the Seat of Government Acceptance Bill, the War </para>
        <para class="block">Service Homes Bill, and the Australian Soldiers&#39; Repatriation Bill. Other matters with which we shall deal, if time permits, are the charges in connexion with the boards set up to control the export of dried and canned fruits. The Government, while not keen to deal with those matters before Easter, will probably avail itself of any opportunity to do so, as, for instance, periods when this chamber is waiting to deal with measures from another place. The honorable member for Reid suggested that there had been some delay in connexion with the Australian Soldiers&#39; Repatriation Bill. That is not so. The Government is carrying out what almost amounted to a pledge, namely, that it would allow a reasonable interval between the introduction of the measure and its discussion, in order to permit the returned soldiers&#39; organizations in the several States to examine it. As soon as the other matters which stand ahead of it on the notice-paper have been dealt with, that measure will be brought forward for discussion. </para>

        <para class="block">One honorable member said that he regarded without hope the vast array of bureaux, boards and commissions created by this Government. I, at any rate, am not entirely hopeless of anything, except, perhaps, the present Government. But when one surveys the long and imposing list of boards and commissions, the creatures of the Government, and the subject of such frequent comment and criticism, one is entitled to say that, sooner or later, the time must come for assessing the net results of their establishment and for asking, in the spirit of that elementary economy which it is our job to understand, &#34; Do they pay &#34; ? My view is that some of them have already proved that their existence is not justified, while the theories of others have not been exploited sufficiently far to enable us to say finally what they are capable of achieving. So far as I can understand the bill, it involves the exploration of the whole field of knowledge. Take, for example, the reference to primary industries. Economic research relating to primary industries involves meteorology, astronomy, chemistry, physics, and a great deal more besides; while as to research into secondary industries, tariffs, bounties , and industrial matters, the Parliamentary Library is gorged with treatises on all these subjects, which, in their turn, open up further vistas of abstruse inquiries. Experts abound on every hand - in the streets as well as in the universities. I myself have the pleasure of knowing many of them, although they do not always meet me if I should have the good fortune to see them first. The some remarks may be made regarding taxation, finance, and currency - our job is to consider them from a practical, rather than a theorectical, point of view. There are, we must acknowledge, abundant avenues and opportunities for inquiry and research. Alas, that we can assimilate so little of the pabulum offering! Alas, that life should be so short! The waste paper basket of each of us is filled with the net result of the midnight toil of many industrious and inquiring men. Scarcely a day passes but I, with considerable regret, have to commit to that fatal repository so much useful matter that I fain would read and study, but which time does not permit me to more than bury decently. One is led to ask how much of the net result of these inquiries is translated into useful legislation. Some of us, including myself, long for leisure to devote to reading and research; but, unfortunately, the opportunities are too few. The painful thought then presents itself that, if we gave more time to reading and research, and spent a greater part of our leisure in laboratories and libraries, probably some other persons of a practical turn of mind would occupy our seats in this chamber. In the course of his parliamentary duties a member must devote himself to a multitude of details. Many of the tasks which honorable members have to perform are heavy, some are petty while others are purely personal. If that be taken as an argument for remitting these questions to experts, my answer is that, sooner or later, knowledge, to be useful in the parliamentary sense, must be assimilated by the representatives of the people who in Parliament act as their spokesmen. The alternative to that is a parliament of theorists fresh from the laboratories or university chairs. Even were a parliament so proposed - a dangerous innovation - the practical difficulty is that popular assemblies are not so constituted, and, indeed, from the very nature of things cannot be. I remember once hearing the present Chief Justice of Victoria say that training was required for every trade and profession except that of a member of Parliament. The learned judge was only repeating a well-known saw; but he did repeat it. The Chief Justice of Victoria is a man of erudition and wide reading, yet a sufficient comment upon his statement is that he has been associated with legislation and opinions which have been rejected emphatically by the great majority of the people of the State over which he presides as Chief Justice. It is idle to say that the crowd necessarily comprises fools, and that he is a wise man, because, unfortunately, it is the crowd, not the individual, who has to be served aud, if possible, satisfied by legislation. Colour has been lent to the suggestion of sinister political motives behind this legislation by some observations made yesterday by the honorable member for &#34;Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parkhill),</inline> who spoke of the immutable law of supply and demand. It may be that that law is eternal, but that it is immutable I venture to deny. There is a law of supply and demand, and there is a law of buying in the cheapest and selling in the dearest market, and of freedom of contract. But they are laws that have been directed or rejected by men. Honorable members opposite pay members on this side the compliment of saying that we are like Ajax defying the lightning. That is true ; instead of bowing to the forces of nature we seek to control and direct them. There is, for instance, the eternal, though not immutable law of gravitation. If a man thoughtlessly throws himself from the top of a steeple, he will be inevitably killed; but, notwithstanding that, the air is being traversed by men in aeroplanes defying gravitation. Natural phenomena are frequently destructive to man, and need to be harnessed for his use. The greatest phenomena of all is man himself, but his greatness is not founded on natural laws; it is based on ethics and idealism. He is fashioned in the likeness of the greatest iconoclast of all, who &#34; led captivity captive &#34; and built a new world on the ashes of the old. We frequently defy natural laws. Arbitration is a defiance of these laws, and so is the tariff, but our policy with respect to those matters is inspired by motives of service to mau - of sacrifice by the few in the interests of the many. We welcome knowledge, at all events, and I realize how painfully little knowledge we possess, and how dangerous a little of it is. But at least we have sufficient of it to appreciate the fact that men cannot be made wise by acts of Parliament. Therefore, we conclude that, if this bill has not that sinister political significance to which I have referred, it is a mere academical waste of time in a Parliament whose duty it is to solve the practical political problems of the present day. </para>

        <para class="block">I should like to see it more broadly based, so that there could be found a place for that great band of economic enthusiasts who require no payment for their services, but who are prepared to place at the disposal of their country the valuable knowledge that they have acquired as the result of a lifetime spent in research - in the wide field referred to in clause 11. The honorable member who has just resumed his seat, has referred to the limitlessness of that wide field. Of course, it must be wide, because everything that this continent contains in the way of the amenities of civilization is the result of continuous and unremitting research by the wisest, most prudent and most ambitious of its citizens. If it cannot be done under this measure, I hope that an opportunity will be found to bring about co-operation between that band of eminent men and the bureau. In the Old Country, men of outstanding ability are only too pleased to place their knowledge at the disposal of the nation. A striking characteristic of those men is, that, having the. advantage of great intellects, they are prepared to place at their country&#39;s door the benefit of their life&#39;s work. I hope that, if not now, the Government will, at a later stage, amend the bill so that a place may be found for that enthusiastic band. It should be given a logical status in connexion with this national effort at research work. By adopting the practice followed in the Old Country, we could take advantage of the great field of voluntary scientific endeavour. </para>

But the bill does not fix the salary to be paid to the director, nor does it inform us how many officers he is to have around him. We are supposed to swallow the pill without ascertaining the nature of its contents; it is not even sugar-coated, in order that it may be made palatable. Evidently this bureau will go the way of all other boards and commissions, and bodies of that kind, which this Government has appointed. </para>

            <para>- The Prime Minister has challenged my statement. If he will consult the reply which he himself made to a question asked in this House, he will find the number of boards, commissions and other bodies which have been appointed. The cost of those bodies has been more than &#163;650,000 since 1923. During the year 1926-27 the cost of the Development and Migration Commission in London and </para>

        <para class="block">Australia was &#163;124,000, making a total for that year of &#163;350,000. Within the last couple of weeks, two more bodies have been established, and if the House does not rise shortly, there will be a further addition to the number at present in existence. One cannot help inquiring how this bureau is likely to develop. The Development and Migration Commission started in a very humble way. Certainly the  chairman  was paid a big salary, amounting to about &#163;100 a week. If that commission had covered the field and done good work for Australia, its members would not have been overpaid. My complaint is that Australia has not received a return commensurate with the amount that has been spent on boards and commissions. The Prime Minister has declared that only a small proportion of the Murrumbidgee Valley has benefited from the Murrumbidgee irrigation scheme. Surely that is a work which should be taken in hand by the Development and Migration Commission! We have just had placed in our hands the journal of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research for February, 1929. A perusal of its pages will show that that council has been dealing with the very matters to which the Prime Minister made reference in his second-reading speech. I find that it has investigated soils in the Murray and Murrumbidgee valleys. At page 60 of the journal, the following reference is made to soils investigations :  - </para>

          <para>In the Murrumbidgee area of New South Wales the expenditure to the 30th June, 1927, was, in round figures, &#163;9,000,000. Unfortunately, up to the present, only one-third of the irrigable land there is being used, and the returns from that area are sufficient only to pay part of the interest upon capital expenditure. It might reasonably be argued that we should have looked ahead and considered the probable economic effects <inline font-style="italic">oi</inline> that vast expenditure of public money on land development.

            <para>- According to the honorable member for Wannon, we were going to have two blades of grass where only one blade originally grew. Honorable members opposite predicted great things as the result of the work of the Development and Migration Commission. The members of the Corner party in their weekly bulletin referred to the wonderful work that this body was doing and would do. Notwithstanding that, there are to-day 53,000 fewer people engaged in pastoral and agricultural pursuits in Australia than there were in 1922, when the composite Government took office. That  is progressing backwards with a vengeance. How can any sane person support the establishment of another of these bodies ? We can estimate the possibilities of this bureau only by our experience of other similar bodies. The Development and Migration Commission has become a laughing-stock to the people of Australia. One of its recommendations was that the work on the Murray water scheme, which is to provide for a storage of  2,000,000  acre feet, should cease. Its report was full of despair, and I have seen no other publication like it in the world. The reason given by the commission for its recommendation was that it would be impossible to find a market for the fruit grown in the Murray valley. </para>

            <para>- Few, if any, people are paying much attention to the findings of the Big Four. The whole delegation was a farce from beginning to end, and its advice is not worth anything. We all know the immense possibilities of the Murray water scheme when it is completed, yet the Development and Migration Commission recommended that the work on that scheme should be stopped because a market could not be found for the fruit produced in the Murray valley. It did not dream that anything else but fruit could be grown there. When that scheme is completed, there will be immense opportunities for mixed farming and the growing of lucerne and other products besides fruit. For the reasons that I have given, I do not intend to give the Government what is virtually a blank cheque in regard to the establishment of a Bureau of Economic Research. </para>

          <para>. -  In rising to reply very briefly to certain statements made by the honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney)</inline> I would remind him that I could, at the time, have raised the point of order that under the Standing Orders it was not permissible for him to quote from my speech in moving the second reading of this bill. I refrained, however, from doing so. The honorable member said that in my second-reading speech I indicated that the Bureau of Economic Research, proposed to be established under this bill, would deal with soil surveys. He then produced a considerable amount of evidence to show that the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research is already doing most admirable service in that direction and he used that as an argument against the duplication of this work. I agree entirely with honorable members opposite that in the course of my speech I did refer to soil surveys, but I certainly did not say that soil surveys were to be part of the work of the Bureau of Economic Research. I can only assume that the honorable member had not read what I said, because if he had he could not have gained the impression that he attempted to convey to the committee. He has, inadvertently, grossly misled honorable members as to the functions of the Bureau of Economic Research. After referring to soil surveys, I said - </para>

        <para class="block">In the same speech I also said that we would call in an expert to deal with an engineering or any other problem; that we recognized that research was necessary in medicine and surgery and yet would not recognize that research was necessary with regard to economic matters. I want to make this perfectly clear, because it is really fantastic to suggest, as the honorable member for Hume did, that in my second-reading  speech I indicated that this new Bureau of Economic Research would deal with such a subject as soil surveys, or that it could possibly duplicate or overlap the functions of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. If the honorable member for Hume will read my speech, he will recognize that he, inadvertently, grossly misrepresented what I said. </para>

        <para>The honorable member also repeated the old story that the Government, since coming into office, has appointed various boards and commissions. It is not enough for the honorable member to say that these boards have been established; what is necessary is that he should analyse them and ascertain the value of their work to the community. In enumerating the various boards and commissions which he claimed had all been appointed by this Government the honorable member slipped into a trap and immediately attempted to get out of it. Some of these boards were in existence long before this Government took office and they are boards which no honorable member would challenge for a moment. Does any honorable member object, for instance, to the Public Service Board? We all recognize that that board is necessary and yet it is quoted amongst others by the honorable member. We must analyse the work of each individual board and see whether it is good or bad. The honorable member for Hume then proceeded to deal with the Development and Migration Commission. He is perfectly entitled to his own views about that commission, but I, personally, cannot share in them at all.  He was on legitimate ground in referring to that board individually but it was utter nonsense for him, when talking about the number of boards that had been appointed by this Government to drag in the Naval Board and every other board that has been in existence for years. In doing so he showed no desire to present his case in a fair and reasonable way. The honorable member referred to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and the expense that it has been to this country. I cannot believe that he has any real objection to that board, because it is generally recognized by the community that it is doing invaluable work for Australia. Yet the honorable member has included this council in the list of boards and commissions which the Opposition claims should not have been appointed. </para>

The honorable member for Hume said that it had cost this country &#163;45,000. The honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> immediately interjected that that was only one year&#39;s expenditure. That is certainly an implication that the establishment of that council has been a waste of money, and it forms part of the Opposition&#39;s general condemnation of the Government&#39;s policy in the establishment of boards and commissions. Having condemned, as a whole, the Government&#39;s policy in that respect and having quoted their amazing figures - I think &#163;600,000 was the amount mentioned, and, incidentally, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has had the greatest amount placed at its disposal - honorable members opposite cannot now single out a particular board and say &#34; Our remarks did not apply to that body. &#34; </para>

I do not offer the slightest objection to criticism of any board which this Government has appointed. For instance, if honorable members do not believe in having a development and migration commission, they are at liberty to condemn the Government for having  created one. It would, of course, be unfair for honorable members to attack the members of that or any other commission or board, because they are not in a position to reply; but they are at liberty to attack any individual activity of the Government. Lest, however, they fall into the trap that awaits them, I remind them that among the royal commissions appointed by the present Government was the Royal Commission on Child Endowment. </para>

            <para>- Yes, and the other day the honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Price)</inline> asked me a question relating to the cost of the commission. The stage is evidently being prepared for presenting this royal commission as another example of the Government&#39;s alleged extragance. I advise honorable members opposite to be careful. If they include the Royal Commission on Child Endowment in their sweeping condemnation of the Government, they will not be on very good ground. That particular commission was not the Commonwealth Government&#39;s pet. It was appointed at the request of the States. The representative of Queensland at a conference with State Premiers moved for its appointment, and his proposal was supported by all the Labour Premiers present. All that the Commonwealth Government did was to acquiesce in the proposal and bear the cost of the investigation. I suggest, therefore, that the Opposition would do well not to include the Royal Commission on Child Endowment in their sweeping condemnation of the Government&#39;s policy of appointing boards and commissions. </para>

        <para>The moral to be drawn from the arguments advanced by the honorable member for Hume was that in view of the cost of these boards and commissions it is not advisable to set up another body no matter whether it be necessary or not, or whether the circumstances of Australia warrant it or not. In my opinion it is essential that we should move towards economic research in this country. The bureau proposed to be established under this bill will not duplicate anything which is already being done. The statement made by the honorable member for Hume that it would duplicate work already being done by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in the matter of soil surveys and so forth, is absolutely ridiculous and has not the slightest foundation in fact. </para>

Already there are highly-paid experts appointed to find out things about statistics, about migration, about the tariff, and about scientific research. It is hard to understand how yet another inquiring body can bo needed. Nor does it seem necessary to give responsibility to Ministers if they are to decide nothing for themselves.  </para>

        <para class="block">One wonders how past Governments managed to get along without the assistance of a multitude of boards and commissions. The bill provides that the board may be constituted by proclamation. I ask that no such proclamation be made before Parliament meets again. A special committee of inquiry, we have been told, is considering the matter of this bureau, and its report will be in the hands of the Government when Parliament meets again. Let us have the benefit of that report before any definite action is taken. This measure is being rushed through today without members being given an opportunity to consider it fully. In the course of an. optimistic  speeech  delivered on Saturday, the Prime Minister said that Australia had no problems. It is true that we have no racial problems such as confront some other countries, but we have problems of our own, none the less. The Prime Minister, while thus belittling the difficulties with which Australia is faced, yet continues to appoint commission after commission, and bureau after bureau, to inquire into this or that national problem. Perhaps honorable members opposite have had this fully explained to them in the party room; but honorable members on this side have not had that opportunity of learning just what is in the mind of the Government. It is reducing Parliament to a farce when members on one side are prevented from speaking by the party whip, and those on the other side are kept silent by the guillotine. The public are becoming so alarmed over the multiplicity of boards and commissions that they speak in whispers now lest <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> should hear them, and appoint a board to inquire into the subject of their discourse. Every time one turns a corner there is a risk of bumping into a member of some board &#34;or other. The Government is seeking to conduct the business of Parliament in a disgraceful manner, and the sooner the present practice is ended the better. </para>

          <para>All honorable members are agreed as to the desirability of research work being undertaken in the interests of our primary industries.

        <para class="block">I considered that passage from the Prime Minister&#39;s speech in conjunction with the purposes of the Bureau of Economic Research as set out in clause 11 of this bill. That clause says that the powers and functions of the bureau shall be to carry out investigations in respect of a number of matters. Primary industry is the first of a fairly long list. The Prime Minister spoke of the desirability of investigating the quality of soils; and seeing that the bureau is to deal with primary industries, I naturally supposed that he was referring in his speech to the functions of this bureau. How the bureau can deal with primary industries without touching on the nature of soils and their productivity passes my comprehension. If the Prime Minister meant something other than what I quoted from his speech. I am prepared to accept his statement as the true explanation of his remarks. .If I misrepresented him I can only say that the meaning I drew from his words was the natural one. If a fault lies with any one, it was his for not making his meaning sufficiently clear. </para>

          <para>.- It is rather amusing to hear honorable members of the Opposition complaining of the little time at their disposal for the consideration of the bill, when they do not use what time they have in addressing themselves to the matter before the committee. The speech of the honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney),</inline> afforded a striking illustration of the need for such a bureau as is proposed. One of the greatest dangers to which we are liable in our legislative work is that which arises from partial knowledge. We bring to the consideration of most subjects only incomplete information; although we may be possessed of some facts, we do not understand their relationship to other facts. The honorable member for Hume extracted one little passage from the speech of the Prime Minister and used it in such a way as to show clearly that he had not the faintest idea of its relation to the remainder of the speech. The honorable member cannot be accused of obtuseness; he is not intellectually dull, and I cannot believe  that he had read through the whole of the Prime Minister&#39;s speech. But he saw one brief passage and, instead of relating it to the rest of the speech, he isolated it and used it for the purposes of his own argument. That is what we are constantly doing. The argument of the Prime Minister was, in effect, u We call science to our aid in various spheres - in agriculture, for instance, we ask the scientists to analyse the soils and tell us for what they are suited. In considering a land settlement scheme, the question that would arise is: is it likely to prove economically sound? A scientist is called in who has made an exhaustive examination of the soil, the physical characteristics of the area to be settled, its possibilities of production and its relation to markets. And his expert knowledge is of value in framing a policy. If we utilize the knowledge of experts in the realms of pure science, why in the name of common sense do we not call to our aid in the legislative sphere, economic experts who can place us in possession of the knowledge essential to the sound performance of our task. &#34; We are constantly in danger of having ip our legislation, the maximum of politics and the minimum of science. This bill is designed to reverse that order and to ensure that our legislation shall be as far as possible in conformity with economic laws. For that reason I welcome it. To illustrate the value of scientific knowledge as opposed to ignorance, I shall relate an incident that was told to me by the matron of one of the Melbourne public hospitals. A young fellow was just convalescing after a severe bout of typhoid fever. One of the characteristics of convalescence after typhoid is that the patient suffers acutely the pangs of hunger. This boy had made piteous complaints to his mother that he was being starved. On one of her visits she was noticed to be carrying a suspicious looking parcel and she was told that she must not take it into the ward. When she insisted on doing so, the nurse examined it and- found inside a large slice of a very substantial plum pudding! No doubt it would have appeased the pangs of hunger, but it would probably have killed the patient. One of Australia&#39;s dangers is that it has too many plum-pudding politicians, who are&#39; willing to give the political patient anything for which he asks. Various parties and party politicians are vying with each other in satisfying the  demands  of the  patient. Alongside the politician, who represents the fond but ignorant mother, stands the scientist, who points out that what is intended to be a kindness to the patient, will probably cause his death. By the establishment of the Bureau of Economic Research we are seeking to bring the maximum of science into the work of legislation. Will any honorable member seriously contend that that is unwise. The honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan)</inline> said that the economic laws are not immutable. I differ from him. Every law is immutable, but its effects may be changed by bringing to bear other laws. For instance, when the law of supply and demand is operating we seek to make it subservient to a higher law. But as legislators we must recognize that law &#39;is absolutely universal, and it is our business to ascertain what laws operate in any sphere of activity which we propose to enter. The establishment of a Bureau of Economic Research is a step in the right direction, for it will introduce the maximum of science into our  legislation and eliminate as far as possible the vicious political clement. </para>

          <para>.- The honorable member for Fawkner illustrated a learned lecture on economic law by a reference to hospital matrons and plum puddings. If we apply his analogy to the bill, we shall find that we have already too little plum pudding, and too much theory. Between 52 and 58 boards and commissions are already in existence. The Prime Minister referred to my inquiring turn of mind, and said that I was on wrong lines when I sought information in regard to the various hoards, commissions, and committees. The answers to my inquiries have certainly been very illuminating, and have served to bring to the notice of the House the extravagant system that this Government has introduced. I had the audacity to ask the Prime Minister whether, having delegated to these extra-parliamentary bodies so much of the work that should be done by Ministers, he did not think it advisable to reduce his Cabinet. The Government spends money recklessly. It seems . to have no regard for the public funds of which it is the trustee. </para>

          <para>If I thought that this measure would be effective, I would have no hesitation in supporting it; but in view of my experience since I have been a member of this Parliament, I am of the opinion that the recommendations of this bureau would not be adopted by the Government unless it suited the Ministers to accept them. This Government and members supporting it seem to overlook the fact that gold-mining was a most important factor in Australia&#39;s early development, and was responsible for bridging a most important gap early in our history. Unfortunately, of the representatives of the electorates in which this important industry is carried on, only one is a supporter of the Government, and consequently the industry itself receives scant consideration in this Parliament. Although representatives of the gold-mining industry in Western Australia and Queensland have made continual representations to the Commonwealth Government for assistance, it has evaded its responsibility by referring the subject to one of its multitudinous boards and to commissions and committees which have been appointed from time to time. Included in these, I may mention the Western Australia Disabilities Commission and the Development and Migration Commission, each of which has made certain recommendations which have been set aside by the Government. If the industry were better represented in this Parliament, it would receive the same consideration as the wine, grape-growing, canned fruits, cotton, sugar and other industries. </para>

              <para>- I am directing attention, sir, to the fact that, notwithstanding numerous investigations into the claims of the gold-mining industry for assistance, when the recommendations have been made for the giving of that assistance, they have not been acted on by the Government. If I thought that the proposed Bureau of Economic Research, after inquiring into the gold-mining industry, would recommend a bounty on gold, and that recommendation would be accepted by the Government, I should feel inclined to support the bill. But as the recommendation of the  chairman  of the Western Australia Disabilities Commission for the payment of a bounty to stimulate the production of gold was not acted on, I do not think that any similar recommendation by the proposed bureau would have any effect on this Administration. I regard the proposed bureau as a useless institution, and one whose recommendations would be followed only if they were in accordance with the policy of the Government. The Prime Minister has suggested that the payment of a bounty on gold would be uneconomic, but it would not be more so than a large number of the things for which this Government and the State Governments have been responsible. Strictly speaking political action is often uneconomic from a purely academic point of view. Very many of the great economists of the past, including Adam Smith, have, for example, declared protection to be uneconomic. Japan has for a number of years been paying a bounty of 25 per cent. on gold produced in that country. </para>

              <para>- I am endeavouring to show that it would be futile for the proposed bureau of economic research to make recommendations to this Government in respect of the payment of a bounty on gold, because the Government would only disregard them, and in these circumstances, I have no option but to oppose the measure. For a number of years - I have not time to go into the matter in detail, but I shall supply the Prime Minister with particulars later - the payment of a bounty on the output of gold in Japan was responsible for an increase of 33 per cent. in production. The position in Australia is that since 1903 the number of persons engaged in the gold-mining industry has decreased from 19,000 to 4,000. It is interesting to note that the value of the metals produced in Australia up to 1926 was &#163;1,129,000,000. Of these, gold tops the list with a production valued at &#163;624,000,000, over half of the value of total metals production. The production of silver and lead is valued at &#163;124,000,000, and of copper &#163;191,000,000, tin, zinc and wolfram making up the rest. The decline in the gold-mining industry is not entirely due to the fact that mining has now to be carried on at greater depths, but is occasioned by enormously increased post-war costs now surrounding the mining of gold, and the fact that the price of gold has remained stationary. In that respect, the industry  is  unique Those engaged in the production of gold have to pay their share of the assistance afforded to other industries under our protective policy, with which I do not quarrel; but they should at least be entitled to the same consideration in the way of bounties as the other primary industries to which I have referred. As we have to provide a gold reserve to be held  as  security against our note issue, we must either produce sufficient in this country, under white labour conditions - which is what  is  insisted on in regard to the sugar industry - or import our requirements from Africa, where gold is produced by cheap coloured labour. As the taxpayers of Western Australia are substantially assisting the sugar and other industries, they rightly believe that assistance in the form of a bounty on gold should also be given to the gold-mining industry in their State. </para>

            <para>.- This may be a convenient opportunity to make a few observations upon  the  main principles of the bill. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green)</inline> has for a number of years been a very consistent supporter of the gold-mining industry of Western Australia. As a broad-minded Australian, with more than Australian experience and patriotism, and with a wide knowledge of the subject, he has never missed an opportunity to bring the claims of that industry before this Parliament. But it is to be deplored that while he has been here, he has been compelled to face a Government which has been persistently hostile to the claims of that industry.  Whilst  it is true that the Government is amenable to argument in some things which fall within its narrow limits, it has shown no sympathy with the claims of the gold-mining industry.

That the introduction of the measure has been found necessary is a reflection on the legislation passed by this Parliament.

            <para>Owing to the patchwork character of successive amendments of the act it is very difficult, if not impossible, to discover one consistent, harmonious scheme throughout the act. The practice seems to be to stuff up every hole in the act as it appears. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is a scathing indictment of the work of Parliament. This bill is designed to mend another hole which has been discovered in the act. We amended the troublesome section 21 of the act last year with the object of fixing an accounting period for companies which had a different accounting period from that of the Commonwealth. This was done to meet the convenience of these companies ; but some of them are all too ready to forget our efforts to meet their convenience if they can drive a coach and four through the act. By the amendment last year we made another loophole in the act which might endanger the revenues of the Commonwealth to the extent of &#163;150,000 or &#163;200,000. Section 21 of the act is really a cross word puzzle. It has been amended five times in the last five years. The trouble caused by the amendment we made last year was due to the fact that we gave it a retrospective effect; in fixing an accounting period for the year which would not synchronise with the financial year of the Commonwealth, we failed to define the accounting periods of previous years. Consequently, there is a danger that the assessments made for previous years may be declared invalid. The risk of this is so great that the Government deemed it necessary to introduce this bill. I think it was wise to do so. </para>

Practically every alteration we have made to the act recently has left an opening for the companies which are prepared to indulge in sharp practices against the Commonwealth revenues to do so. </para>

            </list>
          </quote>
          <para>Measures of this kind give an incentive to these companies to do their utmost to defraud the Commonwealth revenues, because the basis upon which this taxation is levied is wrong. Unjust taxation legislation is always an incentive to the evasion of taxation. No doubt some honorable members &#39;regard me as a person who would do his utmost to wring the last shilling of taxation out of people, because I take every opportunity that presents itself to call attention to the cases of taxation evasion which come under my notice; but in that they do me a wrong. I believe that we should endeavour to govern the country with the least possible taxation, although 1 do not hold with a policy of drift. We should impose the minimum taxation necessary to govern the country properly. But I have always affirmed that when Parliament decides what taxation should be imposed to meet the requirements of the Government, and which each class of taxable citizens should pay, we should see that its decisions are honoured. All persons receiving the same income from similar sources should pay the same taxation. </para>
          <para>Unfortunately, Parliament has differentiated in its treatment of taxpayers, and that is the basis of my attack upon our past legislation. By differentiating in this way We offer an incentive to law breaking. We have treated with very much more leniency the evaders of our taxation laws than the evaders of other laws. While we persevere with our present unjust taxation system we shall probably always have trouble. I do mot see how we can remedy the trouble in this bill, but I feel it my duty to submit my views on the subject at every opportunity in the hope that some day the reasonableness of my argument will penetrate the understanding of those who occupy the Treasury bench. </para>
          <para>The people should be called upon to pay taxation according to their ability to pay, and the rate of taxation should increase with the volume of income. We should also affirm the principle that when two men in Australia are in receipt of, say, &#163;1,000 per annum from the same source, they should pay the. same amount of taxation, except, of course, for certain deductions which are allowed on account of family conditions- and so on. But that principle is not being observed. </para>
          <para>The bill now before us takes us back to 1923, when there was imposed a flat rate of ls. in the &#163;1 upon the profits of companies. It was provided that when such profits were distributed the income should be followed to the individual shareholders, and that they should pay the specified rate upon it according to their personal income. But unfortunately companies are permitted to put into a reserve fund one-third of their profits. This imposes a distinct hardship upon persons with small incomes, and confers a distinct advantage upon persons with large incomes, which is not just. In support of my statement I quote the following sentence from the 11th report of the Commissioner of Taxation - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Individual and partnership owners of businesses are compelled to pay income tax upon the whole of the profits at the rates applicable thereto (4d. to 5s. 5d. ). </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Companies pay ls. in the &#163;1 on the profits they distribute, whereas ordinary taxpayers pay the rate applicable to their individual incomes. The commissioner goes on to say - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>These companies have received a distinct advantage over the ordinary taxpayer by being permitted to escape additional tax on one-third of their taxable income. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I do not wish to mislead honorable members. The commissioner has not made these statements with the object of supporting the argument I am advancing, or of asking the Government to amend the act. It is not his function to do that. His statements were made in reply to certain companies which, seeking still further concessions, had asked that section 21 of the act should be repealed. To-day certain shareholders in companies are receiving a distinct advantage over ordinary taxpayers, and I contend that all taxpayers deriving income from the same source should be placed upon the same footing. </para>
          <para>Let me give some examples to illustrate my point. These are, of course, suppositious cases, for I have not access to actual income tax returns. Let us assume that two shareholders with an equal interest in a company have in a given year &#163;100 each as their share of the profits. Shareholder &#34;A&#34; has no other income. The company has paid a tax of ls. in the &#163;1 upon his &#163;100 and hands him &#163;95, so that he has to pay a tax of &#163;5. I do not think that any one would suggest for a moment that it was ever the intention of Parliament that a person with an income of only &#163;100 should be obliged to pay a tax of &#163;5. As a matter of fact our legislation specifically provides that incomes of less than &#163;300 shall be exempt from  taxation.  Shareholder &#34; B &#34; would also receive &#163;95 from the company; but we will assume that he has an income from other sources of &#163;1,000 per annum. In that case he would be granted a rebate of the &#163;5 taxation imposed upon the income received as a shareholder in the company. </para>

              <para>- Not at all. It is not done under every law, and it was not always done under this law. The rebate is given to every shareholder under the British law; everybody who receives dividends in the Old Country obtains a rebate from the Treasury of his share of all the income tax that has been paid by a company. Our system is manifestly unjust. The report of the Royal Commission on Taxation pointed out that about 200,000 persons who were paying income tax were in receipt of incomes that should not render them liable to taxation at all. They are paying company tax to-day, because they are drawing small dividends from companies, and they are paying it to relieve taxpayers who have large incomes. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Let me give another illustration of a different character. Suppose there is a company with 200 shareholders, in which group A, consisting of 100 shareholders, holds one-fourth of the shares, and group B owns the remaining three-fourths of the shares. Suppose the profits of the company are &#163;120,000. The company tax amounts to &#163;6,000. The company tax on group A, who each receive &#163;300 out of the profits, amounts to &#163;15 each, and the tax payable by group B, who each receive &#163;900 in profits, will be &#163;45, each, the tax being at the rate of ls. in the &#163;1. But the members of group A have no other income than the &#163;300 received from the company, and when they have been paid their share of the profit in the form of dividends, they receive no rebate ; but group B, having high incomes from other sources, gets the full rebate of &#163;45 each. Although they are in receipt of large incomes, we hand back to the latter group the company tax on their dividends. But we hand back nothing to those shareholders whose incomes are below the taxable amount. Let me give a further illustration, which shows probably the most unfair feature of this class of legislation. Take group B again. Having large incomes, they may, and sometimes do, decide that no dividends shall be declared; they are in such a position that they do not require the dividends. They want the money to go back into the company for re-investment. Group A, of course, would be anxious to have dividends. We have made provision in the act to prevent companies in such a case from escaping taxation entirely. The Commissioner goes to a company like that, and says, &#34;You have not distributed any of your profits &#34;. His officers examine the books and report that the company could have reasonably distributed two-thirds of its profits. The Commissioner has power under the act to demand that two-thirds of the profits be distributed. He follows that two-thirds, that nominally goes into the hands of the individual shareholders, and strikes the rate of income tax. He says, &#34;If you had received that dividend, you would have paid extra tax.&#34; But who pays the extra tax? It is collected, not from the individual that the Commissioner declares should have received it, but from the company. The tax is paid by the whole of the shareholders, although only a group of them would have been liable to pay the extra tax. There are shareholders in. companies to-day who have small incomes, and are called upon to pay, not only the company tax, but also a share of the individual tax of the larger shareholders in the same company. That is an outrage on all sense of fairness and justice. Take an illustration. &#34;A&#34; group&#39;s share of the profits of a company is &#163;200 each, or &#163;20,000; B group, which holds three-fourths of the interests would receive &#163;600 each, or &#163;60,000. Let us assume that the average tax on B group would be 4s. in the &#163;1. They would receive a rebate of ls. company tax, and the tax that the commissioner would collect would amount to&#39; &#163;9,000. That amount is paid by the company, and, although the average income of A group is only &#163;200 a year, they would have to pay one-fourth of  the  &#163;9,000, that is, &#163;2,500, or &#163;22 10s. each, which the larger group should have paid by way of individual tax. If honorable members approve of that, they would attempt to justify daylight robbery. Group A has no other income, but it pays not only that &#163;22 10s. each, but also &#163;15 each, the amount of the company tax, which works out at &#163;37 10s. a year each. That amount has to be paid by shareholders who are in receipt of only &#163;200 a year. </para>
          <para class="block">Will the Treasurer deny that that is the position under the present legislation ? </para>
          <para>Section 19 provides that an income shall be deemed to have been derived by a person, although it is not actually paid over to him, if it is re-invested, capitalized, or carried to a reserve fund. One-third of a company&#39;s profits can be carried to reserves, and only the company rate paid. If it were not a company, but an individual concern or business, the whole of the profits would be taxed according to the rate that applies to the amount of them. Then the company that puts one-third of its profits to reserves, and capitalizes them, may issue them to the shareholders in the form of bonus shares, and no income tax apart from the company tax need be paid in respect of them. If an individual desires to invest his income, he has first to pay the tax on the whole of it before he can do anything else with it. Then he can invest it, and he pays tax on whatever income it yields. If a man on the land has an income of &#163;3,000 or &#163;4,000 a year, and does not wish to use it, he can invest it. But before doing so, he has to pay income tax on that amount ; but, if a man is a shareholder in a company, one-third of his share of the profits are exempted from any tax in addition to the company rate of1s. in the &#163;1. I suggest that that is not fair. This legislation has had two very serious effects on the financial and commercial life of this country. It has caused a number of family companies to be formed, involving a good deal of legal expense, and the adoption of various expedients to evade this share of tax. It has also led to much watering of stock by encouraging the issue of bonus shares. </para>

              <para>- One of the arguments is that a company must retain approximately one-third of its profits for expansion of capital and extension of business. That is a very legitimate argument, but my answer is that an individual requires the same amount of reserve as a company does, if he is in the same class of business. Nevertheless, the individual is not treated in the same way as the company. It is true that section 30 of the act allows 15 per cent, of income, to which the company tax of1s. in the &#163;1 applies, to be taken from any business. But I draw attention to the distinction there. The company is allowed to take 33 per cent. Suppose there are two businesses being carried on with similar capital, and they have similar profits. One forms itself into a family company, while the other retains its old name. Why should any distinction be made in taxing the profits of those two concerns? Each will require the same amount of reserves for replacement of plant, &#38;c., but the business that forms itself into a company has one-third of its profits exempted from any additional tax over the company rate, while only 15 per cent. of the profits of the proprietary concern are so exempt. The company, in defiance of any opinion of the commissioner, can demand that allowance as a statutory right. But the individual business concern can claim only 15 per cent. for reserves, if he can show that it is essential for that portion of the profits to be <inline font-style="italic">retained in the</inline> business to enable it to be carried on. I believe that, in every case, unless taxpayers can show that, the commissioner declares that they are not entitled even to the 15 per cent. The company, however, has the absolute right to reserve one-third of its profits. This distinction has been made deliberately in order that the law will be favorable to companies as against individuals. There can be no other explanation. </para>

          <para>I have frequently stressed the need for a general overhaul of the act to remedy these anomalies, and to prevent evasion of tax. Considering the advantages that companies get by distributing as little of their profits as possible, it is obvious that they have an incentive not to distribute them. Seeing a flaw in the act, the companies distributed only one-third of their profits in dividends, distributing another one-third in bonus shares, and paying additional tax only on the remaining one-third that was in the hands of the individual shareholders. Advantage was eagerly taken of that loophole in the legislation, and it shows how keen companies are not to distribute their profits, in order to evade the payment of the tax. That flaw was remedied last year. When one remembers that one company tax runs up to 5s. in the &#163;1, one sees that it is distinctly  advantageous to shareholders if they can keep as much as possible of their profits on the rate of ls. in the &#163;1. </para>

              <para>- But the individual is not given that opportunity. If he wishes to obtain such an advantage he must break the law and take the consequences. Should we hold out an incentive to people to form themselves into companies so as to evade taxation? It is not possible for all persons to form themselves into companies. The other day I heard of a rather shrewd move that was made by an accountant. He endeavoured to convince the taxation authorities that he and his wife were partners in his business. Doubtless she was a partner in the sense that she helped him to spend his income. The Commissioner, of course, did not uphold his contention. I am quite sure that it would not have been possible for the Attorney-General, even if he had so desired, to form himself and his family into a company during the time that he practised privately at the bar. He had to return the whole of his earnings from his profession, and pay upon those earnings the taxation assessed by the Commissioner - which, I have no doubt, amounted to a very large sum. The individual who is engaged in business today is paying far more taxation than a company which is engaged in the same line of business, with a similar turnover and an equal income. That is manifestly unfair. I conceive it to be my duty to place these facts before the House. Some day this wrong will be righted. </para>

          <para>I draw the attention of honorable members to another paragraph in the eleventh report of the Commissioner of Taxation, which conveys to this House a very broad hint that it ought to take action in a certain direction. Under our existing law, the power is not vested in the Commissioner to amend an assessment after three years have elapsed, unless fraud is disclosed. Under our ordinary laws, a debt is recoverable at any time within a period of six years. I admit that there must be some limitation upon the time that is allowed to the Commissioner for the collection of taxation ; he should not be allowed to go back into the dim past, unless there has been fraudulent practice. But I believe that he has made a very reasonable suggestion, and I commend it to the Treasurer. The following paragraph will be found on page 22 of his report: - </para>

              <para>- If the honorable member is prepared to say that the commissioner is so stupid as to regard 3s. 6d. as a large amount, he ought to be prepared to allege that that officer is not fit for his job. That is not my opinion. I believe that this officer is very capable and that he does his work conscientiously. The honorable member probably has in mind the fact that he represents persons with large incomes, and that in an effort to protect them he is entitled to canvass the justice of the commissioner&#39;s suggestion. I hope that, to some extent at least, I represent the whole of the people of Australia. I should be the last to say that a man should be treated unfairly or unjustly, whether he has a large or  a  small income. The fact remains, however, that under the law as it exists today, the commissioner has very wide powers. I have frequently expressed regret that that has been necessary. In saying that, I do not cast a reflection  upon any individual. We should avoid, as far as possible, the setting up of a dictatorship. But I point out that we can exercise a certain measure of control over the commissioner; and if we wish to have the taxation law administered properly we must give to him very much greater discretionary power than is given to any other public officer who comes under our control. This would be comparatively a very slight addition to his powers, and I believe that it is necessary. </para>

            <para>.- It is regrettable that we should again have to be asked to amend the Income Tax Act and to make the alteration retrospective. If there is one thing I dislike, it is retrospective legislation. It was only the peculiar circumstances which rendered it necessary to amend the act retrospectively last year, that induced me to vote for that measure. I felt, with the Leader of the Opposition, that it was essential to prevent certain people from evading taxation because of a technicality. That technicality, however, was known to the drafting authorities, and the amendment should have been so framed as to obviate the necessity for again introducing retrospective legislation this year. All sorts of injury can be done by legislation of that description. One never knows what its effect is likely to be. On the present occasion, however, I must assist the Government to pass this bill. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that there is a pressing need for a complete revision of our taxation laws. If, as the honorable gentleman said, the shareholders of companies are receiving consideration which is withheld from those who trade as individuals, the practice should be stopped as speedily as possible. The shareholders of companies have special rights quite apart from those that relate to taxation. What is most needed is a simplification of the law.

We do not want an injustice to be done to any section of the community.

The Leader of the Opposition has criticized our present methods of taxation, and I think that his speech should be examined by every honorable member. I do not think that many years will pass before we shall insist that there must be a thorough revision of income taxation to try to get rid of anomalies and to simplify our legislation so that it may be understandable to the layman. </para>

            <para>. - I commend the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> for again calling attention to the various defects of our Income Tax Assessment Act. Quite a number of amendments have, at his instigation, been made to the original act, and because of this the revenues of this country have been considerably increased. Practically every day one can take up a newspaper and read a list of registrations of new companies, many of which are evidently formed for no other purpose than to evade individual income taxation. I have with me a copy of the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> of 19th March, and I notice from its columns that two persons of the same name, a man and his wife, have registered a company with a capital of &#163;12,050. Another company, consisting of two persons, with a capital of &#163;50,000, is also mentioned. This practice  of evading  income taxation is evidently becoming common. These companies - they are almost bogus companies - are being formed in every capital city of Australia. The Treasurer has only to glance at the newspapers to ascertain that this is so. Action should be taken by the Government to stop this leakage of our revenue. We keep on patching up our legislation, and leaving loopholes in it. This cannot be stopped until we have a full discussion on the revision of our taxation legislation. I object at all times to rush legislation, especially when we are dealing with finance. </para>

            <para>. - I say quite frankly that I am obliged to the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> for the very clear and analytical speech that he delivered this afternoon in respect of income taxation generally. With a great deal of what he said I agree, whilst I also disagree with some of his views. The position of the taxpayer and that of the tax-gatherer are as wide apart as the poles, and when Parliament passes legislation which permits the taxpayer to avoid payment of taxes, he is not breaking the law when he takes full advantage of what the law permits, and his actions in this regard should not be characterized as evasion or given other opprobrious terms. The remedy for this is to make the taxation legislation of such a nature that advantage cannot be taken of it. These constant amendments of the law are making it so intricate that no one can undersand it; except taxation experts and members of the legal profession.  day no layman possessed of even a reasonable income dares to make up his own income returns. He i3 driven to the employment of experts, who make it their business to show him ways in which he can avoid taxation. As the courts deliver decisions on income taxation, legislation is brought down to counteract them. Even when the board of review gives a decision which is unsatisfactory to the Taxation Commissioner, Parliament is asked to amend the law as the Commissioner thinks fit. I join with other honorable members in regretting that the order of leave in connexion with this amending measure does not permit of a full discussion of the various aspects of taxation, and that such legislation is almost invariably brought down at a period when it is impossible to deal adequately with it. We should in the near future be given an opportunity to discussion the revision of income taxation with a view to its simplification and amendment in a number of directions. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>. - I have no intention to deal with the whole question of our taxation policy, upon which the Leader of the Opposition has delivered a most interesting speech this afternoon. Most of the complexity in taxation has arisen from the attempts- at equity which have been made by the various governments administering this law, and those governments have been drawn, not from one side, but from both sides of the House. The principle underlying the taxation law of the Commonwealth in regard to companies is to impose the taxation on the individual shareholder. It was introduced by the . Labour party in 1915, and undoubtedly tends to great complexity. The attempts to get more and more equity in connexion with the treatment of individuals and companies have led to loopholes being formed whereby many tax evasions became possible. The efforts to close these up have led to many amendments of the original act. In addition, the drafting of amendments to secure the desired result is a difficult task, and when these drafts are brought down to the House we find that honorable members, many of whom have not had legal training - I admit that I have not - have altered the wording, with the result that the law when it comes into operation does not mean exactly what Parliament intended. That has to be considered in dealing with this bill. In connexion with section 21, it is only fair in answer to the Leader of the Opposition to say that originally there was discretion to the Taxation Commissioner to deem two-thirds of the incomes of companies to have been distributed among shareholders. But, before there was a statutory obligation upon the Commissioner limiting him to two-thirds of the company&#39;s taxable income distributed and to take into account only one-third, he had actually followed that practice because he felt that it was necessary that companies should be permitted to make provision for more or less doubtful contingencies. It was felt that there should be a certain measure of encouragement given to the formation of companies, and especially to the establishment of reserves in connexion with companies. Consequently when the Prime Minister consolidated the act of 1922, the law, for the first time, incorporated the provision known as section 21, which permitted one-third of the income to remain in the hands of a company without being liable to additional tax at shareholders&#39; rates. To give a certain measure of justice to the private individual and to put him in a position somewhat similar to that of a company, section 30 was in 1923 incorporated in the act. It provides that in the case of such persons there may be a rebate of tax on 15 per cent, of the total income, so that it would be charged at the rate of ls. in the &#163;1. </para>

              <para>- There is no direction in the statute that the Commissioner may define what business may be covered by this particular section.  His  decision is subject to appeal. There are many private taxpayers who are able to take advantage of this concession, and many more would do so if they knew the provisions of the act as well as do the taxation experts. I do not think that it is possible to remove the disability under which small shareholders suffer, unless we alter the whole basis of the Income Tax Assessment Act and instead of taxing individuals, tax income at the source. In that case it would be necessary, as it is in England, to give rebates. That would completely reverse the system of the Income Tax Assessment Act, and such a proposal would require mature consideration. We should have to consider whether abuses would arise as the result of the alteration, and whether the new system would be more equitable than the present. I suggest that this subject should be dealt with during a general discussion of finance rather than on this particular measure which amends only one section of a previous measure which was fully considered and unanimously adopted by this Parliament as containing a reasonable provision, but, because of au unfortunate error in drafting, must now be re-submitted to Parliament for correction. In those circumstances, I am sure that honorable members will assist in passing the bill through its various stages. </para>

          <para class="block">The object of the bill is to validate the grants of the Supreme Court of New South Wales of probate and letters of administration in the estates of persons who have died in the Territory of the Seat of Government. It is sought to do that by amending the Seat of Government Acceptance Act 1909, which laid the foundation of the system of law and legal administration in the Territory. Ever since the Federal Capital Territory was surrendered to the Commonwealth, the Supreme Court of New South Wales has granted probate of the wills of persons who have died within the Territory or, in cases of intestacy, letters of administration. Doubts have arisen whether those grants are valid, and it is to put an end to such doubts that this legislation has been introduced. Section 6 of the Seat of Government Acceptance Act 1909, provides that - </para>

          </quote>
          <para>The 1st January, 1911-  shall, so far as applicable, continue in force until other provision is made. </para>
          <para class="block">Thus the laws of New South &#34;Wales were continued in force in the Federal Capital Territory until other provision should be made. <inline font-style="italic">By</inline> the Seat of Government Administration Act of 1910, power was conferred on the Governor-General to make ordinances having the force of law in the Territory. Section 4 of that act provides that the laws of New South Wales shall, subject to any ordinances made, continue to have .effect in the Federal Capital Territory. An ordinance was made pursuant to those powers, which provided that where, by virtue of the statute to which I have referred, any law of a State, not being a law imposing duties on the estates of deceased persons, continues in force in the Territory, it should, while this section remained in force, have effect in the Territory, and continue to be administered by the authorities of the State as if the Territory continued to form part of the State. The Supreme Court of New South Wales has been acting under that legislation in the belief that the administration and probate legislation of New South Wales continues to have effect in the Territory, and is to be administered by the authorities of the State. There is, however, another section, in the Seat of Government Acceptance Act 1909, which provides that - </para>

          <para class="block">Therefore although our legislation confers on the Supreme Court of New South Wales full power to grant probates and letters of administration, there is a provision apparently conferring jurisdic-tion in these matters on the High Court. The question has been raised whether the conferring of jurisdiction on the High Court does not oust the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. There is nothing to be gained by any one in allowing any uncertainty to be thrown upon the titles to property within the Federal Capital Territory, and the passing of this bill will make the law quite certain and clear. The measure provides for the validation of the probates and letters of administration to which I have referred. </para>

I do not think that the Supreme Court of New South Wales has been, in truth and in fact, exercising any other jurisdiction. The bill contemplates the issuing of a general ordinance dealing with probate and letters of administration. That ordinance is practically complete, and should be issued at a very early date. When that is done all prior grants will have been validated, and future grants will be ruled by the provisions of the ordinance. </para>

            <para>.- I do not propose to offer any opposition to the passage of this short measure, the purpose of which is set out in clause 3, namely, the validating of grants of probate or letters of administration under the law of New South Wales made, or thought to be made, applicable to the Territory. I am interested to learn from the Attorney-General that the bill is designed to precede an ordinance dealing in general terms with the granting of letters of administration and probate in the estates of deceased persons; but it provokes the comment that we are legislating very largely - I think too largely - by means of ordinances for the extended Territories of the Commonwealth. When we open our parliamentary papers we frequently find therein an ordinance drawn by the legal authorities of the Government, which, as a general rule, is adopted as a matter of course, without discussion in Parliament. </para>

              <para>- He has, which he uses in the interests of the constituents of the vast territory which he represents. The fact remains that government by ordinance is an irregular and unsatisfactory way to deal with so great a territory. The same thing happens in connexion with the Federal Capital Territory. Legislation relative to this Territory does not come before Parliament, but is provided by ordinances administered by a commission appointed by this Parliament. The bill does not touch the wider problem with which Parliament will have to grapple at an early date. I offer no objection to this validating legislation. It would be disastrous if any of the titles which have been created under the laws of New South Wales, thought to be made applicable to this Territory, were prejudiced. That would result in a state of confusion bordering on chaos, and would be a most undesirable thing. Therefore, we must cordially agree to the validating of these grants. </para>

            <para>.- The Minister in moving the second reading of the bill said that some of the amendments contained in it were formal, others were of a minor character, and one was of real importance to the occupants of war service homes, and constituted the main reason for the introduction of the bill. One might be misled by those remarks to believe that the bill was innocent and non-contentious. But an examination of its provisions shows that one at least is of a highly debatable character. Clause 6 provides that interest received in respect of war service homes shall in future be paid into the Consolidated Revenue instead of into the trust fund, as has been the practice since the act was placed on the statute-book in 1918. It is not difficult to find reasons for this proposed departure from established practice. The Treasurer is in a desperate plight. Last year&#39;s operations resulted in a deficit of &#163;2,600,000, which the honorable gentleman has placed in suspense. When he confessed that deficit to the House, he realized that, with a general election imminent, the time was not opportune for increasing the taxation of the wealthy supporters of the Government. Yet he cannot allow the deficit to continue indefinitely. Therefore, he is seeking ways and means to balance his ledger. The honorable gentleman has been described by his present colleague <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> as the most tragic Treasurer the Commonwealth has had, and he was criticized by the Auditor-General for the manner in which he presented his accounts. Behind this bill one can see the influence of the Treasurer, anxious to rake in money from each and every source. If he is able to divert these payments from the trust fund to the Consolidated Revenue, he will be able to swell the revenue for the current year by nearly &#163;1,000,000. The interest payments in 1925-26 amounted to &#163;757,248 ; in 1926-27, to &#163;794,613 ; and in 1927-28, to &#163;823,548. It will be seen that they are increasing annually, and it is not surprising that the Treasurer covets them. Here is a ripe and luscious plum that a hungry Treasurer is anxious to pick. With the aid of this and a few more such prizes he will he able to wipe out the deficit. But I hope that the House will not allow him to rob the trust fund for the benefit of the Consolidated Revenue These interest receipts should be used primarily for the payment of the administrative expenses of the commission, and any balance should be applied to the reduction of the national debt. This bill proposes a departure from the method usually adopted in regard to receipts connected with war services.

            <para>The Government considers the time has arrived when the interest and rent on war service homos should properly be credited to revenue and set off against the interest payable by the Commonwealth on loans raised for war service homes purposes. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Although the honorable gentleman called attention to that phase of the bill, he endeavoured to lead the House to believe that the only important clause was that which deals with the right of occupants of war service homes to sell to civilians. Clause 6 is the most important in the bill. The payment into revenue account of money that should be credited to the loan account is wrong in principle, and besides bolstering up the revenue for the current year encourages the Government in its policy of reckless expenditure. The whole of the receipts, representing interest on the accumulated expenditure from loan during the last ten years, will appear in revenue, and in comparison with them, the advances during the year for the construction and purchase of war service homes will be infinitesimal. There might be some justification for the Treasurer crediting to revenue the interest payments in respect of the advances during the current year; but he is not entitled to swell the year&#39;s receipts by seizing the interest payments on the accumulated expenditure of previous years. </para>
          <para>I regret that the Government has not included in this bill a provision for increasing the maximum amount to be advanced for the building of homes. The limit is now &#163;800, and, in special cases, &#163;950. The last report of the War Service </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">It is evident that the commission is cramped by the present limitations, and that applicants are not able to get the type of home to which they are entitled. The exorbitant charges for bricks and timber prevent the soldiers from getting a suitable home with the money available. A comparison with the advances obtainable under the Commonwealth housing scheme and from State home-building organizations shows that the amount obtainable by returned soldiers under the war service homes scheme is quite inadequate, and I urge the Government earnestly to consider the advisability of increasing it. </para>
          <para>I offer no objection to the other proposals in the bill.

            <para>.- I appreciate the action of the Government in introducing this bill at this stage of the session. I cannot agree with the criticism of the honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. C. Riley)</inline> in relation to clause 6. I regard the action of the Government in altering the existing arrangement in regard to the trust fund as overdue. Hitherto, the Treasurer has had to meet out of general revenue, the interest on loans raised for War Service Homes. He has had to pay at the rate of 5&#188; per cent. and up to 6 per cent. for much of the money raised to construct these homes, but is requiring only 5 per cent. to be repaid by the soldiers. The excess of assets over liabilities in respect of War Service Homes Trust Fund is now over &#163;4,000,000. The taxpayers&#39; money should be handle with the utmost care. There is no justification for leaving a huge excess in this fund while we have to meet the interest bill in respect of war service homes loans out of general revenue. I welcome this long-delayed alteration in procedure. </para>

          <para class="block">The effects of that provision is that if a returned soldier finds it necessary on personal grounds, or because his place of occupation has changed, to dispose of his war service home, he may do so under the conditions specified for a person other than returned soldier. Hitherto, if he has not been able to discover a returned soldier willing to take over his home, he has been obliged to find a cash purchaser before he could dispose of it. This has meant that many ex-service men have had to sacrifice their homes. I know of one soldier who had to sell his home for &#163;200 less than he could have got for it had he not been restricted to a cash purchaser. The alteration now proposed will be greatly appreciated by returned soldiers. </para>

            <para>. -Clause 6 contains the only controversial feature of the bill and it can probably be better discussed in committee. Apart from that 1 congratulate the Government, although I am not in the habit of doing so, upon having at last recognized the right of a returned soldier to re-sell his house on liberal terms. In the past considerable hardship has been inflicted upon occupants of war service homes who have been compelled, through adversity or other reasons, to sell their homes, because the field of purchasers has been limited to their comrades or to cash buyers. The proposed amendment of the act in this respect will be much appreciated. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I regret that the Government still appears to be reluctant to increase the advance obtainable under the act. This is fixed at &#163;800, although in special circumstances &#163;950 may be granted. I understand that in these days the department treats the great majority of applications as special cases, for it realizes that the cost of building has increased from 20 per cent. to 25 per cent. during the last five or six years. That the advance obtainable under the act is inadequate is shown by the fact that the Government provided that an advance not exceeding &#163;1,800 might be granted under the Commonwealth Housing Act to other applicants. I suggest that the advance obtainable under the War Service Homes Act should be increased to at least &#163;1,200. I know in certain districts where land values are high that it is impossible to erect even a five-roomed hardwood dwelling today for &#163;800 or even &#163;950. The average returned soldier has three or four children, and requires more than one bedroom. I hope the Minister will make some reference to this point in his reply. The returned soldiers&#39; organizations have, from time to time, requested the Government to increase the advance obtainable under the act. An examination of the returns published from time to time by the War Service Homes Department, reveals that a large number of applicants have to supplement the advances they receive from the department. There would be no risk involved in increasing the advance, for the money is repayable. I should like the Minister to inform me whether the operations of the War Service Homes Commission are being conducted on a profitable basis at present. This information would be valuable to honorable members, and interesting to the community in general. </para>

              <para>- I should like the Minister to submit a complete financial statement to show whether the department has sustained any real losses in recent years. We all know that for a considerable time the administration of the department was bad. When I first entered this House, the stench of its maladministration offended the nostrils of every honorable member. But that has been remedied. To-day, war service homes are being erected economically and efficiently. I have availed myself of the benefits of the scheme and have not hesitated to recommend other returned soldiers to do so. The administration of the New South Wales department under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> C. Morell, the former  Deputy  Commissioner, was undoubtedly excellent, and I regret the retirement of that gentleman from his position. He showed every sympathy with the returned soldiers, and his administration was the subject of favorable comment by the Public Works Committee and other authorities which have reviewed the operations of the department in New South Wales. The circumstances of his retirement call for a searching investigation. It is regrettable that within recent months a good deal of internal discord has occurred in the department in Now South Wales. This is at present a subject of departmental inquiry. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Morell</inline> has been poorly rewarded for the splendid service he rendered to the Commonwealth, although I believe that, for his own part, he is quite prepared to let the matter rest. </para>

          <para>There is still a good deal of dissatisfaction with the system of valuing war service homes which was arbitrarily fixed some years ago. I refer particularly to the valuation of weather-board buildings. I brought the whole matter under the notice of the Minister for Works and Railways in 1923, by moving the adjournment of the House, and he ultimately wrote down all costs in excess of &#163;800, the amount remitted exceeding &#163;200,000. That did not remedy the grievance of men who had secured loans of less than &#163;S00. I merely mention the matter to indicate to the Minister that there is still a measure of dissatisfaction with the valuations made in 1923. The clause, giving to ex-soldiers an opportunity to re-sell their homes, will remedy a long-standing injustice. </para>

We may sympathize with the Treasurer to a certain extent in his financial embarrassment, but it should be remembered that for many years the Commonwealth has enjoyed buoyant revenues, and provision should have been made for the rainy day. It is proposed to pay into the Consolidated Revenue large sums that have been paid in interest by returned soldiers on the money expended in the construction of their homes. The sums expended in this way were &#163;700,000 in 1025-20; &#163;794,000 in 1926-27; and &#163;823,000 in 1927-28. This shows that the amount is ever increasing, and that, by this method of manipulation, the Treasurer will in his next budget statement take credit for a sum approaching &#163;1,000,000 that has accrued in this way.

            <para>. -  There are two separate accounts, and this does not appear to he quite understood by some honorable members. First of all, there is the amount that is repaid by the soldiers in connexion with their homes. A house costs, say,  &#163;800,  and the occupant pays a certain sum every year to the commission, which represents interest at the rate of 5 per rent., and a certain sum for the amortization of the  &#163;800.  The money that will gradually wipe out the cost of the house will continue to be paid into the sinking fund; it always has been and it will be in future so paid. It is, however, a matter for argument whether that is the wisest way in which to deal with such repayments. The States are using their money as a circulating fund for the purpose of lessening the amount of borrowing for housing purposes. Apart from the amount being paid off the principal, there is also the interest on the sum that has been advanced to the soldier. This money has been raised chiefly by means of loans floated by the Commonwealth, and the interest upon those loans has to be provided out of the Consolidated Revenue. The interest paid by the soldiers is to be transferred to the Consolidated Revenue for the purpose of meeting the interest on loans, so far as it is sufficient for that purpose. The rate of interest charged to the soldiers is only 5 per cent., while some of the money borrowed by the Government to make advances to them has cost up to 6 per cent. In the past the receipts from interest have been paid into the war service homes trust fund, with the definite object of keeping the whole scheme absolutely solvent, and providing against possible loss. A reserve of practically  &#163;4,000,000  has been built up from that source. It is now felt that an undue burden would be imposed upon the people if we continued to use the interest received in that way. It is quite evident that, as the applications for homes become fewer, we shall eventually receive in interest a greater amount than will be required to build them, and the course now being adopted will be inevitable. </para>

            <para>.- The Treasurer has given a correct explanation ; but there is one point that is worth drawing attention to. From the commencement of the operation of the War Service Homes Act the money required to pay the interest on the loans raised to build homes has been taken from revenue account, and none of the receipts on account of either interest or rent have been paid into that account. It may bo argued that that is unfair to our revenue account. It is now proposed to depart from that practice. Whether it is sound or unsound is not the point. The purpose of this amendment is to apply towards the reduction of the deficit the  &#163;800,000  per annum which hitherto has been paid into a trust fund. The Treasurer will claim that he has reduced the deficit to that extent; whereas every other Treasurer has had to find the interest on the loans raised for the building of war service homes without getting the advantage of that rebate. This has a very important bearing upon the financial position of Australia. This House should be given the fullest details so that it may know to what extent our finances are drifting. Whatever deficit is returned at the end of this financial year, it cannot be denied that the amount would have been  &#163;800,000  more but for the passing of this bill. That accentuates the seriousness of our position. When the Treasurer estimated that the financial year would close with a surplus of  &#163;13,000  he took into account the fact that this  &#163;800,000  would be taken into the revenue account. I believe that he will find that, even so, his estimate is an optimistic one. If he had followed the practice of previous years, he would have been on the wrong side by an amount  &#163;800,000  greater than that which will be returned. The honorable gentleman has said that if the present practice were continued we should eventually find that the trust fund would have in it a sum greater than was needed for the provision of new homes. That is probably true, because each year the number of applications will become fewer. Can it be said, however, that it would be a calamitous policy to utilize those receipts towards extinguishing the debt at an earlier date than is provided for under the Sinking Fund provisions? Houses are a good asset, but they are not everlasting. The original act contemplated two things; first, that the receipts on account of interest and rent would be  used to supplement the loans that were floated for the provision of homes; and secondly, that when the peak period had passed, we should liquidate our indebtedness at an increasing rate. The adoption of the policy which underlies this measure will mean the liquidation of the debt by the slow process of a sinking fund and not at the accelerated rate that would be possible if the interest and rent payments were used for that purpose. </para>

          <para class="block">I agree with the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coleman)</inline> and other honorable members who have commended the  Deputy  Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Morrel,</inline> for the manner in which he has conducted the affairs of the commission. I rose, however, to direct attention to what I consider is a very serious defect in the act. It relates to civilians who have purchased homes from the commission. If a house is so unsatisfactory that no soldier will take it, the commission is empowered to sell it to a civilian. That policy has been carried out in connexion with certain homes at West mead that were condemned after construction, because they were found to be in a very unsatisfactory condition. I have in mind the case of a man named Roberts, who purchased a cottage from the commission for &#163;500, on a &#163;25 deposit. He expended an additional &#163;300 in making the cottage habitable. He subsequently lost his job, but obtained another in Geelong with a firm by whom he had previously been employed. Clause 19 of the War Service Homes contract reads - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The purchaser shall not assign his interest under this memorandum of agreement, or agree to sell the subject property so long as any moneys thereunder are owing to the vendor without the vendor&#39;s consent being first obtained in writing. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This is a familiar provision, but is more frequently found in leases than in contracts of sale. Sometimes there are additional limitations, such as that no bonus shall be demanded, and that consent shall not be refused to a bona fide lessee or purchaser. The general public have come to regard it merely as a protection of the vendor or the lessee, as the case may be, so as to ensure that the person who leases or buys the property shall not dispose of it to any one who does not commend himself to the original vendor. Roberts found a purchaser for &#163;750. That purchaser was prepared to refund to him the amount that he had paid out, and to pay to the War Service Homes Commission an additional &#163;250 in reduction of the amount due. Under this contract Roberts would lose &#163;50 of the money he had invested. When the matter was placed before the commission, Roberts was astounded to find that it refused to give its consent. He was told that it could not consent to the assignment of the property to other than a returned soldier, and that if he could not discharge his liability, the sale would have to go by the board. The terms offered were an attraction to Roberts when he bought, and an equal attraction to the man who wished to purchase from him. The latter refused to go on with the contract, unless the consent of the commission was obtained to the assignment. When I came into the matter, the explanation furnished to me was that under the War Service Homes Act the Commission had no power to consent to the assignment to other than a returned soldier, no matter how much it might wish to do so. The letter from the Minister which conveyed that intimation went on to say that the purchaser had a common law right to assign his contract, and that if he acted in accordance with that right he would be perfectly safe. Everybody knows that there is a common law right to assign a contract; but it is outrageous to suggest to a man who has deliberately contracted himself out of his common law right, by agreeing not to assign without first obtaining the consent of the vendor, that he can exercise that right. So far as I understand it, that isa misrepresentation of the law. A man contracting himself out of it cannot exercise a common law right, and if he did he would be liable to have the original contract cancelled by the War Service Homes Commission. I am not discussing whether this is a good or bad policy; but whether such a clause should be inserted in the contract. It is unfortunate that Roberts has lost, not only the original &#163;50, but also some &#163;30 or &#163;40 representing the difference between the interest rate of7&#189; per cent. obtained outside and that of 6 per cent. obtained from the War Service Homes Commission. It is unfair and misleading to put in the contract a clause affecting the civilian purchaser, which the commission cannot carry out under the act. It would be much fairer to state definitely that the contract can only be transferred to a returned soldier. </para>

          <para>Mr.TULLY (Barton) &#91;5.17&#93;.- Like the honorable member for Parramatta <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bowden),</inline> I wish to put before the Minister a specific case in connexion with the war service homes which came under my notice recently. In the committee stage I shall move an amendment which, I hope, will be acceptable to the Minister, because it is designed to overcome a disability which arises now and again in the administration of the War Service Homes Act. This case is not general, and, according to the act, does not come under the control of the commission. I have in mind the case of a returned soldier who purchased a home from the War Service Homes Commission. Shortly after moving into the house he discovered that it was too small for his requirements, so, with the consent of the commission, he sold it, through the agency of the Government Savings Bank, to another buyer. He then found that he was not able to get a further advance from the commission. He had purchased a suitable house from an outside builder, and on the money outstanding he had to pay interest at the rate of 8 per cent. That man made an application to the commission for an advance of &#163;600, at 5 per cent., to wipe out his indebtedness to the outside builder. The act, as it stands, prevents the commission from helping that man. The commissioner in New South Wales says that it is not the policy of the Government or of the War Service Homes Commission to assist a returned soldier to obtain a home more than once, unless under special circumstances, and he refused to make a favorable recommendation to the Minister. I submit that there are special circumstances in this case. In committee I intend to move this new clause - </para>

            <para>.- There are one or two matters which I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister. The first relates to the re-valuation of war service homes. Some little time ago I had an opportunity of inspecting some of the war service homes that were built in the suburbs of Hobart, and they are a standing disgrace to those who supervised or were responsible for their erection. Some of these homes have been built for about ten years. A few weeks ago, when passing one of these homes, I noticed that repairs were being effected. I made an inspection and I found that the floor of one room was being replaced. It was the third time that the floor had been taken up, the reason being that the joists had rotted. </para>

              <para>- Yes. The returned soldier occupying that house has to pay by instalments some &#163;800 or &#163;900 before it becomes his property. To-day that house is not worth more than &#163;450 or &#163;500, and as time goes on it will depreciate. This unfortunate returned soldier has now to pay for the upkeep of and repairs to a jerry-built house that was supplied to him by the War Service Homes Department, and it is only fair that he should receive a refund of money commensurate with the defects in and repairs to the house. The fault lies, not with the returned soldier occupiers, but with the clerks of works who were employed by the Commonwealth Government to supervize the erection of the buildings. I claim to have some knowledge of the building trade, because at one time I was employed as a builder&#39;s labourer. I know from my experience that the foundations of many of the war service homes were far from satisfactory. In some instances a strip of earth was excavated, and instead of the excavation being filled with concrete, it was filled with gravel, which was whitewashed on top to give the foundation some appearance of stability. The returned soldier occupants have no redress. In many cases, the returned soldier, because of the dampness of the walls and the consequent illhealth of his family, has had to leave his home and go elsewhere. No one else has been prepared to occupy the untenanted house and, therefore, the returned soldier is obliged to continue the payment of his instalments. No person is likely to buy a house when he can wipe the dampness from its walls with his hands. A revaluation of soldiers&#39; homes was made some years ago, and the time is ripe for another revaluation. A portion of the charge against returned soldiers who have purchased jerry-built homes under the War Service Homes Act should be written off. A number of brick dwelling have been erected for soldiers at a place called Derwent Park, which is near Hobart, and the men living in those houses will always have a vivid recollection of their experiences in Flanders and France, because in the winter they have to resort to the use of  duckboards  to get about the yards belonging to their homes. Those houses are an absolute disgrace, and reveal strikingly the inefficiency of those who supervised their erection. The returned soldiers are left with those places on their hands, and the department should be prepared to sacrifice something by making a re-valuation. If that is not done, it will probably be landed with a complete loss. I am pleased that this amending bill provides more liberal allowances and concessions to the returned men. I hope that the Minister will give consideration to other matters which are constantly brought before his notice. Too often those in control of the War Service Homes Department in various districts become callous when carrying out their duties. The present is a difficult time for many men to obtain work, and all who try should receive due consideration. Many returned soldiers who have purchased homes are unemployed and unable to meet their instalments. The officer in control of a branch of the War Service Homes Departmentmight grant such a man an extension of one or even of two months, and then, if he failed to pay his rent, hav, him evicted. That is not right, as consideration should be given to those who are playing the game. I hope that the Minister will make a note of all these matters and make an endeavour to bring about a re-valuation, particularly of those properties which were purchased from ten to twelve years ago. </para>

            <para>.- The Government proposes in this amending bill to let up on a provision that was deliberately inserted in all legislation connected with soldier land settlement and housing. It was a fundamental principle of the original scheme that returned soldiers were to obtain their land and houses at cost-price, and that nobody was to obtain a profit from the transaction. That was a very sound principle, which gave to men who had done the country a great service a footing on a sound financial basis. Now the Government has to meet the difficulty that also confronts the administration of soldier land settlement, and has to deal with the cases of men who, from different causes, are compelled to relinquish their properties. The difficulty is to prevent trafficking. The proposal contained in this measure must inevitably open the door to a certain amount of trafficking, as it will give to persons who have in no&#39; way entitled themselves to the privilege, the benefit of acquiring war service homes practically under the original terms, which were made at the expense of the country. I recognize that the department may vary the conditions slightly, but a civilian purchaser will be able to obtain an advance up to 90 per cent, of the purchase money. He really obtains the home under the provisions of the War Service Homes Act. </para>

            <para>. - In connexion with the past administration of the war service homes, many mistakes have been made. The cost of the buildings has been excessive, and soldier occupants still labour under many disabilities. In 1923, largely owing to the representations of the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coleman),</inline> who moved the adjournment of the House on this subject, Parliament decided to write off about &#163;250,000 of excessive costs ; but that action, which applied only to houses costing more than &#163;800, did not remedy the grievances of many occupants of wooden homes in Queensland which had cost from, say, &#163;600 to &#163;790. They have continued under the disability of having to pay an excessive price for their homes. I do not share the view of the honorable member for Wannon that the Minister is making a mistake in proposing to allow a soldier occupant to sell to a civilian. </para>

              <para>- That is true. The much-vaunted housing scheme is a myth. Although the Government promised that  &#163;20,000,000 would be expended in the provision, of homes for the people, not one has yet been built, and in only three State Parliaments has amending legislation been introduced to enable their people to take advantage of the Commonwealth scheme. They realize that it was brought forward to save the face of the Government, by making the electors believe that a prominent election pledge had been honoured. I agree that when there is no soldier purchaser available, the occupant of a war service home should be able to transfer to a civilian on terms acceptable to the Commissioner. A soldier public servant well known to me was transferred some time ago from one centre in Queensland to another. But, because no soldier buyer was forthcoming, he has not been able to sell his home, and has experienced great difficulty in getting a home in the town in which he now resides. I hope that if the bill is agreed to, the Minister will grant the necessary authority to him to sell his old home and get a new one. </para>

              <para>- Yes. The honorable member for Barton has suggested that section 19b of the principal act should be amended to empower the Commissioner, with the approval of the Minister, to permit a returned soldier to sell his present home and have another built, provided that the sale is necessary for a reasonable purpose. Every  Deputy  Commissioner is not ready to recommend that approval be given to such transfers. The honorable member for Barton referred to one soldier whose increase of family has made a larger home necessary, but he cannot get permission from the department to sell the old one and have another built. </para>

              <para>- That is commendable. The native born is the best migrant, and soldiers who accept the responsibility of rearing large families should not be penalized. If they want larger homes, every facility should be granted by the commission for the disposal of the old ones and the erection of others. The Minister says that he has power to grant approval in such cases, but we know that frequently applicants are told that the commission will only grant this concession reluctantly, and many are discouraged from endeavoring further to get larger homes. Sometimes the locality in which the soldier&#39;s home is situated is prejudicial to the health of himself, his wife or his family, and it becomes necessary for him to dispose of his house and acquire another elsewhere. Many are not aware that the Minister has power to approve of sales of homes in such special circumstances; but if the amendment suggested by the honorable member for Barton be accepted, it will placard the information for the benefit of soldiers that in future they will be entitled to dispose of their old homes for satisfactory reasons, and have new ones built. The honorable member is to be commended for having brought forward this proposal, and I hope that the House will give favorable consideration to it. </para>

          <para>Clause 6 is obviously designed to relieve the Treasurer. Last year&#39;s operations ended with a deficit, which will probably be increased this year, and the honorable gentleman finds himself, after six years of wanton extravagance, in impecunious circumstances. He is looking round for every available shilling that can be raked into the Consolidated Revenue in order to reduce the amount of the deficit. No doubt his expert officers were told to search for means of brightening the financial outlook, and as a result of their investigations the Treasurer in August last indicated that the estimated revenue for this year included &#163;800,000 of interest and rents in respect of war service homes, which would be paid into Consolidated Revenue instead of into a trust fund. </para>

Actions of this kind caused the Auditor-General last year to comment severely upon the methods adopted by the Treasurer to make his expenditure appear hundreds of thousands of pounds less than it actually was. The honorable member has a convenient knack of &#34; cooking &#34; figures to suit his. own ends, and the honorable members  for Cook and Maribyrnong were justified in drawing attention to his latest ruse. All past proposals to improve the War Service Homes Act have received the support and encouragement of honorable members on this side of the House, who will welcome any amendments submitted in committee, such as that suggested by the honorable member for Barton, to better the conditions under which the returned soldiers are provided with homes. We should also increase the maximum amount of loan from &#163;800 to &#163;1,200. </para>

            <para>. - The honorable member for Cook said that when moving the second reading of the bill I stated that there was one clause of real importance in the bill. He suggested that I had endeavoured in that way to hide the importance of clause 6. What I said was, &#34; One clause is of real importance to the occupants of war service homes.&#34; I did not say or imply that only one clause was of real importance. In criticizing clause 6 the honorable member said that by diverting interest and rent payments from the Trust Fund the Consolidated Revenue will be advantaged to the amount of nearly &#163;1,000,000 a year. He hinted that there was something improper in this proposal, and the honorable member for Maribyrnong went so far as to say that it amounts to deliberate manipulation of the finances. The administrative expenses of the War Service Homes Department are paid out of Consolidated Revenue. The Treasurer has to find the interest on loans raised for building war service homes. Hitherto the interest and rent payments in respect of these homes has been paid into the trust fund, and so did not recoup the Treasurer for his expenditure. It was probably a good thing that we commenced operations on this basis, for it has enabled us to build up a reserve fund of over &#163;4,000,000. But we can no longer afford to continue this practice, nor is it necessary to do so. I point out that, under the new arrangement, the reserve fund of &#163;4,000,000, which is, to a large extent, invested in homes, will not be touched. It will remain a reserve fund. The Treasurer has had to pay about 5$ per cent, for the money he has raised for the War Service Homes Commission to construct soldiers&#39; homes, whereas the soldiers pay interest at the rate of only 5 per cent. Consequently, the nation has been meeting a proportion of the cost of this scheme. The Treasurer has been unable, however, to use these interest payments as an offset against the amount he requires to find as interest on the loans, and so all interest payments on such loans have had to be provided from general revenue, an unnecessary drain on our resources. </para>

          <para>I was glad to hear the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coleman)</inline> acknowledge that the administration of the department had been improved. It will interest honorable members to learn that the amount of arrears now outstanding is less than 1 per cent. </para>
          <para>It has been suggested that provision should be made for the granting of a second advance to soldiers under certain conditions, and the honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tully)</inline> has intimated that he proposes to move an amendment to allow of that being done. I point out to him that that course is not necessary, as the Minister has that power already. I suppose that, on the average, I approve of three or four second advances a week. Practically every application that has been submitted to me has been granted. </para>
          <para>Regarding the profits and losses referred to by the honorable member for Reid, I point out that the loss on any abandoned home taken over by the commission is added to the administrative expenses; but, on the other hand, any profit made in respect of the re-sale of such a home is applied to reduce costs of administration. Such profits have never been sufficient to offset administrative expenses. </para>
          <para>Something has been said respecting payments into the National Debt Sinking Fund. The practice adopted in that regard has been in accordance with the provisions of the act. </para>
          <para>The honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> asked for a definition of rent. This really amounts to interest. Cases have arisen in which the commission has been unable to sell a property that has come into its hands, and the house has been leased temporarily. The  income from such transactions is regarded as rent. I point out that it is not proposed that the repayments of capital shall go into Consolidated Revenue, hut only the payments of interest and rent, which latter is really interest. </para>
          <para>Some honorable members have requested that provision shall he made to increase the amount that may be advanced to soldiers under the act. They have said that the present maximum of &#163;950 is not sufficient. I propose to move an amendment at the committee stage to enable the &#34;War Service Homes Com-mission to become a prescribed authority under the Commonwealth Housing Act. This will enable the commission to make advances up to &#163;1,800. Some honorable members opposite have criticized the Commonwealth Housing Act and said that it is nebulous; yet they have regarded it as sufficiently substantial to be used as an argument for increasing the amount that may be advanced under the War Service Homes Act. They cannot, with consistency, argue that the Commonwealth Housing Act is little more than a figment of the imagination, and yet use it as an argument to support their case on this point. The effect of prescribing the War Service Homes Commission as an authority under the Commonwealth Housing Act will be that the commission will be able to advance the maximum amount under the War Service Homes Act at 5 per cent, and any additional advance up to a total of &#163;1,800 under the Commonwealth Housing Act, from 6 per cent, to 6&#163; per cent. </para>

              <para>- Certainly. One of the important provisions in the Commonwealth Housing Act enables a prescribed authority to make an advance for the purpose of discharging a second mortgage which may have been given at a high rate of interest. I point out that the Commonwealth Parliament instituted its war service homes scheme to enable an ex-service man to obtain at a low rate of interest advances to purchase homes suitable for his actual needs. If a man desires something better than the ordinary, it is hardly just that the Government should provide the additional amount on the special terms applicable to the first &#163;800 or &#163;950. Under the new provision an ex-soldier will be able to obtain an advance up to &#163;800 or in special circumstances, up to &#163;950, under the War Service Homes Act at the low rate of interest, and an advance under the Commonwealth Housing Act at a somewhat high rate of interest to meet the cost of his house in excess of the advance granted under the War Service Homes Act. </para>

          <para>The honorable member for Wannon rather suggested that if a civilian takes over a war service homes house under the provisions of this bill, he will receive the advantage of the very easy terms that have been provided specially for soldiers, but the honorable member may take it as certain that the War Service Homes Commission will provide that war service homes may be taken over by civilians only on conditions similar to those laid down in the Commonwealth Housing Act. The rate of interest, therefore, will be from 6 per cent, to 6$ per cent., as against 5 per cent. Under the war service homes scheme, the period of repayment is 20 years as against 37 years, and the amount of deposit at least 10 per cent, as against 5 per cent., or an even lower amount. </para>

            <para>. - This clause will provide that, insofar as any addition to the amount of &#163;800 or &#163;950, as the case may be, is concerned, the extra sum advanced shall be provided out of funds in the hands of the Commonwealth Savings Bank, and loaned to the War Service Homes Commission, which will be proclaimed an authority under the Commonwealth Housing Scheme. The effect of that will be that the interest payable on advances of &#163;800 or of &#163;950 will remain at 5 per cent., the rate charged at the present time. But, for any sum advanced above that, it will be 5&#163; per cent., 6 per cent, or 6$ per cent, according to the ruling rate at the time the advance is made.

          <para class="block">Hughes), and other members, asked this afternoon whether provision would be made for the taking over of second mortgages. Provision for this is made under the Commonwealth Housing Scheme, and the War Service Homes Commission will provide for such a procedure. If the funds available are insufficient to accomplish all that is desired, they will be devoted, first of all, to the building of new homes, and, after that, advances on additions and only then will second mortgages be dealt with. That is the policy of the War Service Homes Commission, and of all the State Savings Banks. It will be generally agreed that it is imperative that new homes should be provided for those who have not been housed up to the present time, but provision will be made for the taking over of second mortgages as occasion arises and funds permit. The War Service Homes Commission will be the sole authority to deal with the ex-soldiers; but it will derive funds from two sources. First, it will obtain them from the Treasury which will have raised loans for the purpose of providing the money, and that will be advanced to the commission at the present rate of 5 per cent. There will also be the money advanced by the Commonwealth Savings Bank to the commission, and that will bear interest at such rate as is agreed upon by the bank and the commissioner. I understand that the bank is now lending money to the various authorities at <inline font-style="italic">5$</inline> per cent., but provision is made in sub-clause 2 of the new clause for the interest on that portion of the money that is borrowed from the Commonwealth Savings Bank, to be returned to the War Service Homes Commission, and it will be repaid of course to the Commonwealth Savings Bank. It will not be dealt with in the same way as the interest paid into the Consolidated Revenue to meet interest on the loans. </para>

            <para>.- I understand that, up to the present time, only three of the States have accepted the Commonwealth housing scheme. Will that affect the position? The Victorian State Savings Bank is doing practically all the building of war service homes in that State. I believe that in Western Australia, also, a local authority is doing the work. In New South Wales and Queensland, it is still under the direct control of the War Service Homes Commission. Will the new clause apply only to those States in which the homes are being built under the direct control of the commission? I understand that in Victoria no legislation has been passed by the State Parliament to bring that State under the Commonwealth housing scheme. </para>

            <para>. - The advance under the War Service Homes Act will be independent of any arrangement as regards the Commonwealth housing scheme, but it will be dependent on the making of arrangements with such authorities as have agreements with the commission with regard to the type of houses to be built. For instance, there is an arrangement, at the present time, with the Victorian State Savings Bank to build houses up to a certain value. There will have to be a new agreement under this bill to provide for advances in the way now suggested. Two or three days ago, I noticed a statement in the Victorian press that the Premier of that State, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> McPherson, had indicated his intention to accept the Commonwealth housing scheme; but quite apart from that, the War Service Homes will be independent of that scheme. </para>

When the housing bill was before us on the 20th October, 1927, I moved that it should embrace the authority controlling war service homes. The motion was defeated on a parliamentary division, and strong opposition was expressed to extension of the advances to the occupants of war service homes. I am glad to know that the Treasurer has &#34; seen the light. &#34; </para>

            <para>.- It is some days since this bill was introduced, yet the amendments have been flung upon the table only within the last ten minutes. That is not the way to handle legislation. Earlier in the day we were asked to amend the Income Tax Act because of a mistake which was caused  by  these rush methods. The honorable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. C. Riley)</inline> is  in  charge of this measure for the Opposition, but he is not being given the opportunity to even read the amendments until they have been moved. This may be a purely machinery provision, but on the other hand it may have very far-reaching effects. Probably not two honorable members have grasped its significance. </para>

Under the latter part it is proposed that the full amount of interest received shall be paid into the War Service Homes Trust account, and such part as is required to pay interest on the amount loaned to the Commissioner in his capacity as a prescribed authority under the Commonwealth Housing Act, may be taken out of that account. </para>

            <para>.- I gather that a returned soldier will be eligible for an advance up to ?950 under the War Service Homes Act, a condition of that advance being that he shall pay a deposit of 5 per cent. and interest at a similar rate. Then, if he should desire a very much larger or more expensive home, he may receive, under the provisions of the Housing Act, the difference between the amount advanced to him under the War Service Homes Act and any amount up to ?1,800, with respect to which he will be obliged to pay a deposit of 10 per cent. and whatever interest is fixed. </para>

            <para>.- The objections that the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> foresees are not apparent to me. The safeguards provided under the Commonwealth Housing Act will apply in the case of returned soldier applicants equally with ordinary applicants. It would be impracticable to merge war service homes advances with those made under the Commonwealth housing scheme in New South Wales and Queensland, where the War Service Homes scheme is conducted very satisfactorily indeed by a Commonwealth department. </para>

              <para>- That will be the case in every State except New South Wales and Queensland, where the War Service Homes Commissioner will be the only prescribed authority. The Government would be acting wrongly if it closed down the departments in New South Wales and Queensland, because they have been conducted with a greater measure of economy and success than has the scheme of advances through the banks in the other States. I think that the great majority of returned soldiers in New South Wales and Queensland appreciate the assistance, supervision and economy that are features of the administration of war service homes in those States. The Minister has advised me that second advances can be made on the approval of the Minister. For a long time I have been handling hundreds of cases relating to war service homes, and I have been unaware of that power. I should like the Minister to indicate the conditions under which second advances may be made, and whether they are governed by regulations, or does the legislation which we are now considering in any way affect the position? Can the Minister also indicate whether the construction of war service homes will be accelerated during the next financial year? The Minister and his predecessor have from time to time received complaints from returned soldiers&#39; organizations about the delay in dealing with applications. In New South Wales periods of from eleven to twelve months have elapsed from the time that an application has been lodged until it has been actually dealt with. I myself lodged an application ten months ago, and it is only now being considered. These are matters of sufficient public importance to warrant a statement from the Minister. </para>

              <para>- The Minister says that members on this side cannot have it both ways ; that when the Commonwealth housing scheme was before us we complained that the Government was not prepared to do for the soldiers what it was prepared to do for civilians, because the maximum grant to civilians was &#163;1,800 and to soldiers about one-half of that amount. It is now proposed to increase the advance for war service homes by giving the commissioner power to borrow money under the Commonwealth Housing Scheme through the Commonwealth Bank. This so-called Commonwealth Housing Scheme has been of little use up to the present, and it is an exceedingly adroit move on the part of the Government to bolster it up with the War Service Homes scheme. I am pleased indeed that an increased advance can be obtained for war service homes. I understood the Treasurer to say that the returned soldiers, who in the early stages of the scheme obtained four or five-roomed houses, and because of a subsequent increase in family are somewhat cramped for space, will be able now to obtain advances for the addition of one, two, or three rooms to their houses. This legislation is too important to rush through in the closing hours of the session, and I suppose that when we meet again we shall be engaged in correcting some of the mistakes that we are now making. </para>

            <para>.- I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister an anomaly in the administration of the War Service Homes Act. In South Australia a form of dual control is exercised. Originally the construction of war service homes there was under the supervision of the Commonwealth Bank, and the payments on many of the houses are still being made to that bank. Recently the construction of war .service homes in South Australia was entrusted to the State Bank authorities. Any one who wishes to make representations to the War Service Homes Department on behalf of the returned soldiers who are in occupation of homes constructed by the Commonwealth Bank, finds it more difficult to obtain satisfaction, because the representations have to be conducted by correspondence with the central office in Melbourne. The State Bank, of course, has some discretionary power, and there is little difficulty in making representations to that authority. I ask whether there could not be some co-operation between the Commonwealth Bank and the State Bank, or, preferably, the transfer of the whole business to one authority or the other. That, I am sure, would be a more satisfactory arrangement than that which exists at present. </para>

              <para>- If a returned soldier can show a substantial reason for wishing to dispose of his home and to get another, he is given a second advance. For example, if the exigencies of a man&#39;s employment takes him to another town or State and it is essential that he should dispose of his home, or if a man&#39;s wife is suffering ill health and it is necessary for her to leave the locality in which she is residing, those will be good reasons for second assistance. That really disposes of the amendment suggested by the honorable member for Barton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Tully).</inline> The honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers)</inline> has stated that this new clause which provides for a maximum  advance of &#163;1,800, will probably bring about an enormous increase in our commitments for war service homes. I do not believe that the returned soldier will apply for an advance which will embarrass him when he is called upon to meet his liabilities. In all probability the great majority of applications will be for advances of say &#163;1,200. There are many men who perhaps are prepared to pay a little more than &#163;950 to enable their families to live in comfort. Even if a man wishes to obtain an advance larger than perhaps his circumstances warrant, the Commissioner has discretionary authority under the Commonwealth Housing Act to say whether or not he will make the full advance. Before authorizing the transaction the Commissioner would have to be satisfied that, the applicant was in a sufficiently good position to be able to meet his obligations. </para>

            <para>.- I do not wish to deprive returned soldiers of the benefits conferred upon them by any legislation. But years ago the government of the day carefully measured out the standard of the houses that it intended to build for returned soldiers. As most of those men were young and settling down in life, that standard was moderate and was reconsidered from time to time by Parliament. Viewed from the financial stand-point, it is remarkable that the Government should seek to pass through this chamber as if it were a formal little resolution, a proposal for a phenomenal rise in the standard which makes available to a returned soldier a maximum of &#163;1,850. </para>

              <para>- I am aware of that. The Minister appears to think that I spent my time in a kindergarten. I remind him that I administered the War Service Homes Department for a time. So far as I can see from a study of the position, real estate is rapidly declining in value. There was a time, mainly due to the cessation of building activities during and immediately after the war, when it was almost impossible to buy or rent a house. Then a phenomenal building programme began in Australia, and it has continued for the last ten years, with the result that houses may now be found for sale and to let in nearly every centre. I warn the Minister to consider carefully before making available for what might become a re-modelled building scheme, substantial fresh advances which may tempt returned soldiers to go beyond their means. The Minister stated that a man will obtain only what he can pay for. We are ail supposed to live within our means, hut in time-payment days the tendency on the part of many is to acquire more than they can pay for. The amended act will need to be very carefully administered. It is an alarming financial proposition suddenly to double practically the maximum advance, and I do not know why it is proposed to rush it through in this way. It is of great magnitude and may  involve Australia in another gigantic building boom similar to that which, as the Minister knows, distorted real property values and so tremendously inflated the price of materials. </para>

A promise was made by this Government to the various States that, on the passage of the Financial Agreement and the formation of a combined Sinking Fund to wipe out the Commonwealth and State debts, provision would be made to give the States representation on the National Debt Commission. This bill provides for that representation. Its contents have been submitted to and unanimously approved by the various State Premiers.

          <para>.- I desire to bring before the House a matter of urgent public importance, and if the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> will pay attention to what I have to say to-night the Opposition will be spared the responsibility of submitting a formal motion to-morrow for the adjournment of the House. I desire the Government to take some action before Parliament adjourns over Easter to give adequate protection to the cotton industry. It is not necessary for me to go into -full details, because the Government already has them in the form of a report from the Tariff Board. But I impress upon the Minister that this matter is urgent and that the growers of Queensland, and the manufactures of cotton yarns, want some action taken immediately. I speak on this matter with some authority, because 85 per cent. of the cotton-growers in Australia are in my electorate. I know them personally, and their hardships are well known to me. Over nine and a half months ago the matter of protecting the cotton industry was referred to the Tariff Board for investigation and report. More than a fortnight ago the board&#39;s report was submitted to the Minister. He has already had two weekends in which to consider it. </para>

        <para>Mr.FORDE. - I do not say the Minister has nothing else to do. It is true that Parliament has been sitting every day; but a Minister is in this chamber only when matters pertaining to his department are under discussion. I assume that in the last fortnight the officers of the Customs Department have had an opportunity to peruse the report of the Tariff Board, and make recommendations to the Minister, and there is no excuse for putting the matter off again. On the eve of the general election the Prime Minister and Government candidates made definite promises to the cotton-growers of Queensland. They told them that the Government could be trusted to take action immediately after Parliament met. Every Nationalist candidate gave that assurance. In my electorate some Nationalist speakers, including my opponent, went so far as to declare that Parliament would meet at the end of January, and on the first day of meeting a tariff schedule could be brought down. I frankly recognized that as an exaggeration, But I certainly expected that something would be done long before this in view of the promises made. A fact to be borne in mind by the Minister is that, when his predecessor, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pratten,</inline> refused to adopt the board&#39;s recommendation of a bounty of 2d. a lb. on seed cotton for a period of five years, and substituted a bounty of l&#189;d., plus a small bounty on cotton yarn, he stated that the yarn manufacturers would be protected to such an extent that they would be able to purchase the whole of the locally-grown cotton. The growers would thus, he said, be compensated by an Australian market for the reduction of the bounty recommended by the board from 2d. to l&#189;d. per lb. To-day the growers cannot sell their raw cotton on the Australian market; they have to export it, and in so doing lose at least 2d. per lb. The Queensland Cotton Pool Board, when submitting evidence to the Tariff Board, made the following statement, which shows the assurances that were given by the Government in regard to the protection of the Australian industry :  - </para>

        <para class="block">Cotton-growing is a great employing industry. We have been looking for new avenues for the employment of our people and particularly for opportunities to settle them on the land, where they can grow something for which there is a market. The cotton industry fills the bill. Chiefly owing to the initiative and enterprise of the honorable member for Dalley, when Premier of Queensland, the Northern Burnett Lands, comprising 3,000,000 acres, were thrown open for settlement, and railways were built into the area, which is eminently suitable for cotton cultivation. A railway was built, through the Callide Valley and hundreds of settlers from all parts of Australia have selected there and are engaged chiefly in growing cotton. Many of them have cleared farms out of dense scrub. Each man has a few cows and crops from 10 to 200 acres of cotton. </para>

            <para>- Usually in April, May and June, and probably July. In some districts picking starts in March. It is a seasonal industry, but if men can get employment in it for three months they can probably get work at cane cutting or other field jobs in the sugar industry for another three or four months. If this industry is to prosper it must be given the same measure of protection as is given to the secondary industries. We cannot expect primary producers to go into the bush, spend their lives in clearing the scrub and cultivating the land for the cultivation of cotton if we continue to allow 2,000,000 lbs. of cotton to be imported annually from India, South Africa, New Caledonia, China, and other coloured-labour countries to compete with the local product on the Australian market. </para>

            <para>- A small bounty, but practically no yarn is being made because local manufacturers cannot compete with the product of Japanese and other foreign spinners. Imported yarns are being landed at such prices that the Australian factories must close down. It is true that they purchased 4,824 bales of cotton of the 1926-27 crop, but only 1,200 bales were used. The others are still on hand, and the manufacturers will not be able to purchase any more Australian-grown cotton unless they are given protection against the importations from other countries. I was present at a deputation which waited upon the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> in Sydney about a month ago at which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McLean,</inline> of Messrs. Bond and Co., said that he would at once sign a contract for the purchase of the whole of the Queensland cotton crop, provided that the Minister would give an assurance that adequate protection would be given to the industry. </para>

            <para>- That is not so. The Queensland Cotton Pool Board entered into an agreement in 1926-1927 which they did not depart from, and are prepared to enter into another agreement to-day to pay the equivalent of Liverpool parity price, plus freight and handling charges to Australia for the whole of the Queensland cotton crop to be used in the Australian factories. This was considered a satisfactory arrangement by the growers and the manufacturers. Since the Queensland Government guaranteed the price of cotton, our production has increased as follows: - </para>

        <para>I appreciate the assistance which the Government has granted to this industry. It has been frequently said by certain honorable members opposite that the Commonwealth Government granted a bounty to this industry because the Queensland Government discontinued the aid it had been giving to it, but that is not so. The Queensland cotton-growers were assisted by the Queensland Government lip to 1925-26, and then asked that the industry should be treated on a national basis, and a bounty paid on locally grown cotton. The Queensland Government supported that request, and the Commonwealth Parliament acceded to it. An amount of &#163;120,000 a year was provided for the two years that have just passed, but in that period only &#163;120,000 was actually paid. This is a mere bagatelle compared with the amount of bounty paid to other industries. In 1927-28 the amount paid in bounty to the cotton-growing industry was &#163;81,454, whilst the amount paid in bounties to other industries was &#163;895,498. It will be seen, therefore, that I am not making a special plea for Queensland. </para>

Our importations of cotton yarn into Australia in the last two years have been equivalent to 1S,000 bales of cotton lint annually.

Japanese, American and British yarns are coming into Australia in large quantities while Australian spinning plants rest idle, and all plans for extending the cotton spinning industry naturally hang fire. </para>

        <para class="block">It is with a full knowledge of all these things that we ask that the Government will give effect to the recommendations of the Tariff Board in relation to this industry without further delay. If the industry is encouraged a great deal of employment will be provided for our people; our large holdings can be subdivided for the settlement of additional people, and a most valuable industry will be established. The Prime Minister recognizes the importance of the industry, and realizes that it is impossible for our producers to compete without protection against raw cotton grown in China, India and New Caledonia. The manufacturers of cotton yarn require additional protection. The only way to develop the primary industry satisfactorily in Australia, is to encourage simultaneously the secondary industry. We must make it possible for the local manufacturers to convert our raw cotton into yarn in this country. I trust that the Government will heed the appeal that I am making, and grant additional protection to this great industry so that the development of Queensland may not be hindered, and I want action taken before the House rises. </para>

The present unsatisfactory condition of the Queensland cotton industry is due largely to the maladministra-tion of the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> while he was Premier of the State.  His  policy was to place a ban on ratoon and acquire all cotton under a penalty of &#163;1,000 and twelve months&#39; gaol on any grower refusing to deliver. Because the cotton-growers suffered so severely under the administration of the honorable gentleman, they turned to the Commonwealth Government and asked that the industry should be removed from State control and developed as a national project. They desired to be absolutely freed from the conditions which the honorable member for Dalley imposed upon them when he was Premier of Queensland. </para>

The Tariff Board was requested to recommend, among other requirements, a duty on yarn and an increased duty on cotton. It is felt that reasonable assistance in these directions would enable the Australian cotton manufacturers to establish their industry on a firm footing. It is essential that something shall be done in this regard during the present picking season. The Prime Minister is aware of the urgency of the case for in a letter which he addressed to the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J.

        <para class="block">Unfortunately the report of the board was not in the hands of the Government by the end of the year. I am glad to say, however, that the Minister for Trade and Customs informed a deputation, which I had the honour of introducing to him recently in Sydney, that he would do everything possible to get the board to present its report without delay to permit of him taking whatever action was possible during this session. This  industry is absolutely dependent upon th granting of adequate and prompt assistance by the Government. The cotton-growers applied in the first place for a bounty on raw cotton. The Tariff Board recommended that a bounty of 2d. a lb. should be paid. The Government granted a bounty of 1&#189;d. per lb. on seed cotton, which was equal to  4&#189;d.  per lb. on lint. The growers were somewhat disappointed with this; but as the Government also provided a bounty equal to 6d. per lb. and upwards on yarn in which 50 per cent, of Australian cotton was used all interested in the industry hoped that development would not be hindered. It must be remembered, however, that a percentage of wool or a percentage of silk may be used in yarn. Some yarn may be manufactured comprising 100 per cent, of Australian cotton. The Government has been asked, therefore, to amend the conditions under which assistance is at present granted to this industry, so that a bounty may be paid upon all yarn in which  Australian  cotton is used. At present cotton is being grown on only a limited area. If sufficient assistance is afforded to the growers, the area under cultivation may be extended enormously. We feel that it is only reasonable to ask the Government to do its best to stabilize the industry, and to make possible further extensions of it. It is surely not too much to ask that, conditions shall be provided which will make it possible for us to grow the whole of the raw cotton that wo require. When the Commonwealth Government granted the assistance to which I have already referred, one prominent Labour member of the Queensland Parliament expressed his satisfaction with what had been done. He hoped, as did the cotton-growers and cotton-manufacturers, that this assistance would be adequate. I believe that the Commonwealth Government also honestly believed that it had done all that was necessary. But experience has since shown that this is not so and that further protection is essential. The millers have refused to purchase the cotton crop this year, for they say that it is impossible for them to use Australian cotton and compete with cotton manufacturers overseas. The growers were thus placed in the position of having to sell Australian cotton in Great Britain instead of in the local market. I sincerely hope, therefore, that the Minister, after giving full consideration to the report, will not disappoint the growers, who have plan led cotton this season in the belief that t.&#60;c Commonwealth Government would do the fair thing by them. I hope that the action to be taken will be announced before the House rises, so that it will benefit the industry during the coming picking season. This is essential. </para>

            <para>- It is most extraordinary that an. honorable member should ask the Minister to give effect to a recommendation, when he does not know what it will be. The honorable member for Capricornia is one of the most persistent members of the House, and, for the last nine months, has urged that something should be done to expedite the presentation of the report, in order that the industry may be adequately . protected. He quoted remarks that I made last year to the effect that the Opposition would assist in the passage of a tariff schedule that would achieve the desired object. I remind the Prime Minister that the cotton industry, and also other industries, are urgently in need of protection. I suggest that this House should re-assemble shortly after Easter to give close consideration to tariff matters. Members of the Opposition are willing to do all they can to help to draw up a tariff that will be sufficient for the needs of those industries that have not yet been adequately protected. </para>

        <para>We have been looking forward to the discovery of new primary industries. In most of our present primary industries,  except the production of wool and wheat, the producers find it difficult to dispose of their surplus on other than the Australian market. Cotton is imported in large quantities, and this opens up opportunities for the establishment of a new primary industry. I support the request that immediate attention be given to it. </para>
        <para>I also invite the Minister for Trade and Customs to consider the encouragement of another new primary industry - the growing of rice. I shall give a brief epitome of the case presented to me by representatives of that industry. I am not prepared to verify their statements absolutely, because I have had no opportunity of investigating them ; but the case presented by them has impressed me, and I shall be glad to hear the Minister&#39;s version of the statements that hav: been made. I understand that he is familiar with the claims of those now engaged in rice-growing in Australia. This industry is practically only two years old, so far as the production of rice in large quantities is concerned. and one of- its most gratifying features is that Australia can produce rice of a quality that cannot be excelled, and, perhaps, is hardly equalled in any part of the world. It is grown by white men, many of whom are returned soldiers. The rice that we formerly consumed was grown and harvested by black labour. The price paid for Australian rice on the open market, before the duty was imposed, was &#163;10 10s. a ton. The Tariff Board investigated the conditions of the industry, and found that the cost of production was such that it recommended a duty, and the House imposed one equivalent to &#163;3 lis. 8d. a ton. This clearly indicated that, in the opinion of Parliament, these producers should receive protection to the extent of &#163;3 14s. 8d. a ton on top of the market price of &#163;10 10s. a ton. What the growers really asked for was a return of &#163;13 a ton, which was below the market price plus the duty. But the difficulty, they state, is that the decision of this Parliament has been defeated, and is likely to be defeated in future, by the action of a combine. That is a serious charge, and they have made it in a written statement to the Minister. They say that there is practically only one buyer of rice in Australia. Four or five large mill-owners purchase the whole of the rice crop at practically their own price. In 1927, they gave &#163;12 a ton for locally-grown rice, and last year they paid &#163;11 a ton. The price in the open market was &#163;10 10s. a ton, and they are now receiving 10s. a ton more than that, after having had a duty of &#163;3 14s. 8d. a ton imposed to protect them. Their position to-day is serious. They have 4,000 tons of last year&#39;s crop on their hands unsold, and they will harvest this year&#39;s crop in April, May and June, which will increase the supply on hand by about 18,000 or 20,000 tons. The consumption in Australia of  uncleaned  rice is about 20,000 tons a year. In 1927, the local production was 4,000 tons of uncleaned rice, and the imports in that year amounted to 14,000 tons. In 1928, the local production increased to 1S,000 tons, and the imports dropped to 3,000 tons. Cleaned rice, to the extent of 6,000 tons, was also imported; but 3,000 tons of that was subsequently exported. Owing to the importation of 3,000 tons of uncleaned rice, and a net importation of 3,000 tons of cleaned rice, this 6,000 tons caused a surplus in Australia and left the growers at the mercy of the combine. It is asserted that it cost &#163;13 a ton to import this commodity. Notwithstanding that fact, a certain quantity of it is imported in order to keep a surplus in this country, and enable the local product to be purchased at &#163;11 a ton. That is the definite implication contained in the statements of the representatives of the industry, and, if they are true, the position is a serious one. We may ask how the small importations of 3,000 or 4,000 tons can affect the Australian market when the consumption is 20,000 tons, but, if that importation is sufficient to bring about a surplus, the mill-owners are able to buy the local rice at a reduced price. This makes the position critical, and many growers may have to go out of the industry, because they cannot carry on at a loss. They declare that the price of &#163;11 a ton, which they are now receiving, is considerably lower than the cost of production, when they take into consideration all the charges. The growers have made a practical suggestion that, by means of a licence, or other machinery that the Minister may choose to employ, permission to import rice should be given only when there is no locally-grown rice on the market, or when the growers decline to sell at a reasonable price. They are prepared to have the price fixed and sold through the Rice Marketing Board at &#163;12 12s. a ton, or &#163;2 2s. a ton above the open market price without duty. This Parliament gave the growers the benefit of a duty of &#163;3 14s. 8d. a ton, and they are merely asking to be permitted to take advantage of that to the extent of &#163;2 2s. a ton. Therefore, their request is eminently reasonable. A large number of these growers are returned soldiers, who have been repatriated. It is estimated that the value of their crop is &#163;250,000 a year. As I have said, they produced an article of the best quality, and it is grown by white labour. Hitherto, we have had to eat rice grown and harvested by black labour. &#34;We ought to be thankful that rice second to none can be produced in our own country. We should not allow this new industry to be strangled by any combine. I am not alleging that this combine is acting in the way suggested; but that is the definite statement of the growers who have had that experience. It is the duty of this Parliament to see that the protection given to this new industry is real, and is not filched from it by anybody. </para>

          <para>. - In view of the fact that a motion standing in my name on the business-paper for to-morrow is not to be considered, I am taking this opportunity of bringing under the notice of the House the important matter of the report of the royal commission appointed to inquire into the need for amendments to the Constitution. That commission was appointed about two years ago, before the Seat of Government was transferred from Melbourne to Canberra. It has been perambulating over Australia for most of the intervening period. We all admit that an enormous task has been undertaken by it. I had an opportunity of seeing it at work, and studying its methods, and I realize that it is engaged on, perhaps, the greatest problem that has ever been re-ferred to a commission since the inception of federation, by being asked to overhaul the Constitution in the light of the experience of the last 28 years. The  chairman  of the commission is Professor Peden, an eminent constitutional lawyer. All the other members, some of whom are members of this Parliament, are specially qualified for their work. The commission completed the taking of evidence some time ago, and we have five massive volumes of it. But at least six months have elapsed, I understand, since the commission last sat. I am aware that the worthy  chairman  suffered a grave bereavement in the death of his wife some months ago, and one can easily understand that that would throw back the important task he has in hand. Nevertheless, I think that the procedure has been unnecessarily slow. I gave a considerable amount of evidence before the commission, and was cross-examined by counsel and all the members for a whole day. I placed before the commission the complete case for the creation of new States in Australia. I was quite satisfied that the commission was rather too painstaking. I do not suggest that such a complicated task should be rushed; but I believe that the report should have been in the hands of the Government some months ago. It is practically completed, yet we are still unaware of its recommendations. The references embraced industrial powers, company laws, new States, and every other major question that has been the subject of controversy since the inauguration of the Commonwealth. This will be the biggest task that has been undertaken by the Commonwealth Parliament since the beginning of federation. The commission was entrusted with the duty of completely overhauling the Constitution. All of its recommendations will be very important, and some of them, perhaps, surprising. We have been given to understand that we shall practically constitute ourselves a convention to decide what amendments, if any, shall be placed before the people for their ratification. We shall probably decide that it is necessary to have a complete overhaul of the Constitution, and that will involve the greatest and most strenuous campaign that has ever been under- taken by any government in Australia. It is only fair to those honorable members who have interested themselves in this question that as little delay as possible should take place before we are asked to apply ourselves to the task. During the last election campaign&#39; the Prime Minister stated most definitely in his policy speech that when the report of the commission was received Parliament would be given the opportunity to consider its recommendations and to decide what questions should be submitted to the people. I feel sure that the right honorable gentleman still adheres to that intention. Parliament is about to adjourn for four or five months, and if the Government does not come to a decision before we re-assemble the matter may have to stand over until the latter part of next year, because it is generally accepted that in future we shall hold our sittings in the second half of the year. Although the Government has not actually received the report, it knows that the commission will make certain important recommendations, and it must realize that the promise made by the Prime Minister will have to be redeemed. If it will make up its mind that at least the first portion of the constitutional session shall be held at the conclusion of the ordinary business this year, we shall know where we stand. It will have the report before the commencement of the next session. A little under two years ago a very important referendum dealing with the transfer from the States to the Commonwealth of comprehensive industrial powers was carried in the States of New South Wales and Queensland. Experience has shown us that if the whole of the States had agreed to the transfer of those power3, many of the industrial troubles through which we have since passed, would, probably, have been avoided. It is the opinion of honorable members on both sides that one of the causes which contributed to the defeat of that referendum was the lack of sufficient time in which to place the case before the people. Only three or four weeks were allowed for the education of the whole of the electors upon that complicated matter. If it is found necessary to submit to the people a comprehensive series of amendments designed to alter the whole character of the federal scheme, we shall merely be courting disaster if we rush the matter through in a few weeks. It will be necessary to go through a long process of education of not only the people, but also the Parliaments of Australia. The majority of honorable members have virgin minds on the subject of constitutional amendments. They are waiting to see what recommendations are made before they consider what amendments are necessary. If the Government seriously intends to make this a separate issue, apart from a general election, we must know without delay where we stand. In my opinion, it will take us at least twelve months to arrive at a decision. If sufficient time is not allowed there is a likelihood of action being delayed for another decade. It is everywhere recognized that the question of amending the Constitution is more urgent to-day than it has ever been before. The people are anxious for some drastic change, not only in the character of our national Parliament, but also in regard to the functions of the States. I urge the Prime Minister to obtain from Cabinet during the recess the decision that this Parliament shall have the opportunity to deal with at least a portion of the recommendations not later than this year. </para>

          <para>.- This is an appropriate occasion to raise again a question that has previously occupied the attention of honorable members, in the hope that the Prime Minister may make a statement and possibly give satisfaction to the persons concerned. It relates to the employees and the staff at Cockatoo Island dockyard. They have before the Prime Minister, whose department controls the Shipping Board, which administers the dockyard, a number of outstanding matters. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>In the first place, there are claims for compensation for accidents suffered at various times by employees at the island. A number of these claims have been outstanding for many years. Some have been adjusted, but others which ought to have been settled are still outstanding. </para>
        <para>There are also outstanding claims for furlough, or payment in lieu thereof, to employees who have given many years of service. In some cases there the question has been raised whether that service had been unbroken. The department has taken up the attitude that because there is no proof of continuous service during the period when the island was under the control of the Government of New South Wales, it cannot recognize the claim for payment in lieu of furlough, or acknowledge that a sufficient period of service stands to the credit of the claimant. These individuals have endeavoured, to the best of their ability, to show that they were continuously employed by the State Government at Cockatoo Island dockyard. In some cases they were seconded for duty for a few weeks to other State departments, such as the Harbours and Rivers Department, and according to the State records there would appear to be a break in their service. As a matter of fact, there was no such break; but, because there is no proof of continuity of service, they are obliged to suffer a loss. There are cases also of employees who completed twenty years service subsequent to the passing of the dockyard to the control of the Shipping Board. These employees are deprived of furlough concessions because their twenty-year period was not completed prior to  1923. </para>
        <para>A more serious matter has arisen in consequence of the proposal to lease the dockyard to a private firm. It affects the rights, if there are any, of the employees and the staff who are at present or who were until recently engaged at the Island. Those who are more particularly concerned are the members of the clerical, drafting and professional staffs. because they have been regarded as permanent employees. When the dockyard was under State control, they had certain definite rights, such as that to long service leave, and continuity of employment. When the dockyard was transferred to the Commonwealth, I think that it was understood by all parties concerned that those rights would be preserved. When the dockyard was taken over by the Common wealth it was placed under the control of the Naval Board or authorities in charge of the navy at that time. It was later transferred to the control of the Prime Minister&#39;s Department in  1921.  An act was then passed by the Commonwealth Par-liament setting up a shipping board, and in  1923  Cockatoo Island Dockyard was transferred to that authority. At that time it was stated, I believe, that the employees would be treated in the same manner as the employees or staff of an ordinary private enterprise and not as employees of a government department. Now the Prime Minister, judging from his answer to a deputation which waited upon him a few weeks ago in Canberra, seems to take up the attitude that, because of the dock having been transferred from the Prime Ministers&#39; Department to the Shipping Board in  1923,  the Government cannot recognize these employees as permanent employees of the Commonwealth, and that there is no obligation on the part of the Commonwealth to pay them compensation in the event of the termination of their services. The Government also refuses to extend to these men the rights that normally apply to public servants in the matter of long service. The Government took the stand that any rights that had been established and were due to the employees would be liquidated as from  1923,  and that no new rights would accrue as from that date. A large number of clerks and others are concerned, and they cannot see that just treatment has been given to them. Some of them have had continuous service for many years under the State authority and the various authorities of the Commonwealth which have had control of the island. Indeed, one of the clerks who received notice of dismissal a few weeks ago, has had  39  years&#39; continuous service in that establishment. He has no doubt had furlough, or payment in lieu of furlough, accruing to him as the result of his first twenty years&#39; service, but he is now dismissed arbitrarily upon one month&#39;s notice, not because he has reached the retiring age, but at the caprice really of the controllers of the island and without any compensation for the loss of employment. This is one of the worst cases, but there are quite a number of clerks and draftsmen who have had from ten to thirty years&#39; continuous service. This island is, I suppose, to be leased, if a satisfactory tender is received, and when the island has been leased, the employees can no longer look to the Government for the recognition of their rights. </para>
        <para class="block">They cannot look for compensation unless these rights are established and admitted by the Government before it divests itself of the control of the island. The date for the closing of tenders for the leasing of Cockatoo Island is to-day, the 20th March, and I do not know whether that date has been extended, but I have not seen any notice to that effect. </para>

          <para>Cockatoo Naval Dockyard may become the property shortly of a big British shipbuilding firm. Vickers Ltd. and Harland and Woolf arc mentioned as being the possible new owners. Tenders have been called, and it is understood that those two big firms from overseas have tendered for the site and plant on terms which will lead to one or the other obtaining the lease of the Commonwealth Shipping Yards. The yards will bo a subsidiary naval base to Singapore. It was stated yesterday that the British Government, in the event of either firms mentioned being successful, would probably subsidize the undertaking to ensure that the yard would be equipped as a subsidiary naval base to Singapore, so that Australia would be prepared from a naval point of view in the event of war breaking out in the Pacific. </para>

        <para class="block">That paragraph bears&#39; the mark of authenticity; but whether it has been authorized or is justified I do not know. If the Government has made up its mind to rid itself of Cockatoo Island Dockyard I can only hope that the paragraph is true, and that this establishment will be controlled by a shipbuilding firm supported by the British Government, because that would ensure continuity of activities at the dockyard, and would give the staff already there some hope of employment, although it is poor consolation to those members of the staff who have been dismissed and may not be re-engaged. Indeed their chances of re-employment have been considerably prejudiced by the fact that they have been dismissed. The staff at the Island has formulated a memorandum, which I think, has been communicated to the Prime Minister. In it the following paragraph appears: - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The whole of the Prime Minister&#39;s answer is based upon the following premises: - </para>

        <para>The staff&#39;s reply is - </para>

            <para>That Cockatoo Island is not a Government department is a position, we would respectively point out, which was always seriously open to question, and which was definitely negative by the High Court judgment in a matter of the Bunnerong power plant contract. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para class="block">The employees at Cockatoo Island claim that that establishment is a Commonwealth instrumentality, and that the Commonwealth cannot divest itself of its obligations in respect of compensation for dismissals merely because it handed over the control of the establishment to the Shiping Board. The High Court itself in. a similar case decided that the establishment in question was a Government instrumentality. The Government&#39;s claim that it owes no obligation whatever in respect to the dockyard, simply because the Shipping Board has been nominally in charge of it, has little or no foundation. The Prime Minister has said that there is no analogy between the position of the employees of the Australian Commonwealth Shipping Line, who were compensated, and that of the employees at the dockyard, because the Line has passed from the control of the Commonwealth, and there can be no opportunity of continuity of employment, because the head office of the new owners of the line is in England, and consequently the employees here would be dispersed. But actual experience is to the contrary. Many of the men who were employed by the Australian Commonwealth Shipping Line when it was under government control, and were compensated by the Government for the loss of employment, are being employed by the new owners of the line. Few of them indeed are not now being employed. The manager of the line, the accountant and many of the senior clerks and trade and passenger clerks in the various ports of Australia are still being employed. Yet the Government acted very generously towards those men. According to the Auditor-General&#39;s report, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eva,</inline> the manager, received eleven months&#39; compensation, equivalent to &#163;1,833. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> H.

            <para>- I am merely showing how generous the Commonwealth Government has been in respect of the staff of the Australian Commonwealth Shipping Line, and yet it has not exhibited the slightest degree of generosity towards the staff of the Cockatoo Island dockyard. It has not recognized any claim on their part for compensation, although their services will be as definitely terminated as were the services of the staff of the Australian Commonwealth Shipping Line when it was sold. I cannot understand the discrimination that has been made between the two staffs. Captain E. A. Innes, the Marine Superintendent of the Australian Commonwealth Shipping Line received, in fares to London, repatriation, allowance for furniture, ten months&#39; compensation and two months in lieu of notice, &#163;1,522. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> C. Smith received in various ways &#163;1,294. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> Perryman received &#163;1,140. About twelve other officers received sums of &#163;797 or over. All those officers were members of the shore staff. I am not sure whether compensation was given to the members of the personnel of the vessels, but I believe it was paid in some cases. The shore staff received compensation because of the termination of their employment as the result of the sale of the Line. The leasing of Cockatoo Island will definitely divest the Government of the control of that establishment for at least 30 years if the lessee exercises his option. To all intents and purposes that will have the effect of terminating the employment by the Government of the staff at Cockatoo Island Dockyard. Surely the Government should recognize some of its obligations to these officers, who have to their credit many years of faithful and continuous service. In the interests of the Commonwealth the Government should recognize its obligations. It should give these men some compensation, and not turn them adrift practically penniless. The Prime Minister should bear in mind that many of the members of the staff, on the clerical as well as the technical and professional side, are men who cannot easily find employment suited to their capacities. Their experience has largely been in shipbuilding and work connected with it. The clerks explained to the Prime Minister that they had been engaged on special clerical duties, and that in consequence they had little hope of getting a position of equivalent value outside the Commonwealth service. I urge the Government at this late hour to give these men more generous treatment. </para>

The proceeds from the sale of the fittings and other material taken from the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney</inline> were to be devoted towards keeping the dock-yard going until something was decided about the lease. However, as a result of the way in which the material was disposed of, much money has been lost, and further unemployment has resulted. Much of the material taken off the ship was not sold to the best advantage. It should have been properly scheduled and advertised; but I do not think that was done with any .of it. Those interested as buyers simply went to the island, and made an offer for what they wanted. </para>

            <para>- No doubt it could, but more of it, I have no doubt, was simply junk, and was sold as such. A large capstan, electrically controlled, which if new would cost &#163;1,000 - and that estimate is based on what it has cost to put similar capstans on the seaplane carrier - was sold for &#163;22. It may be that not many persons require electrically-controlled capstans, and this one might have been bought merely as  a  speculation. Nevertheless, material of that kind should be advertised, and tenders called for. I make no charge, except that bad business methods were adopted in connexion with the sale or disposal of material. Some of the tubing and pipes taken off the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney</inline> was sold to outside purchasers, and subsequently bought back by the dock-yard and taken into stock. That is certainly bad business management. I trust that the Prime Minister will reply to the points I have raised. </para>

          <para>.- I wish to bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General a number of points relating to better telephone and telegraph communications between the islands in Bass Strait and Tasmania, and between those islands and the mainland. There is at present on foot a proposal to link up Tasmania by wireless telephone with the mainland. I understand that arrangements are being made for this, and i hope that no undue delay will occur. I should like the Postmaster-General to inform me whether it is also possible to link up Flinders Island in the Furneaux group. The honorable member for Darwin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bell)</inline> is also interested in better communications with King Island, and I arn sure that he and the other Tasmanian members support me in this. About 1,000 people live in the Furneaux group, and they have a very inadequate shipping service. There are occasions during bad weather when they get no mail for a month at a time. Sometimes they have gone without their mails for an even longer period than that, and during such times the only means they have of doing their business is by wireless telegraphy, for which the minimum charge is 2s. 8d. for sixteen words. It is hardly fair that they -should have to pay a minimum charge of 2s. Sd. for a radiogram, when I, as a citizen of Launceston, can send a telegram of sixteen words from there to Broome, in Western Australia, for ls. 4d. My telegram would have to bc relayed four or five times between the post office at Launceston and Broome. It surely cannot be more costly for the department to handle a radiogram from Flinders Island to Tasmania, or to the mainland, than to send a telegram from Tasmania to Broome. I do not think that there should be differential rates as between Flinders Island and the rest of Australia. Other parts of Australia have the advantage of being able to send telegrams any distance within the Commonwealth for ls. 4d., while they can also send night lettergrams containing 30 words for a minimum charge of ls. 3d. I urge the Postmaster-General to give serious consideration to this matter, with a view to bringing about a reduction in charges. I ask him also to consider establishing wireless telephone communication between these islands and Tasmania, and the mainland. I have previously brought this matter under the notice of the Postmaster-General, and I again urge upon him the desirability of installing small wireless sets on the smaller islands. The Australian Inland Mission, which is run by the Presbyterian Church, has been experimenting with small sets which can send out messages,&#39; and receive the ordinary broadcast matter. The Rev. John Flynn has stated that such sets can be made for &#163;50. They are fitted with hand generators, and have been giving good results, and can be used to receive ordinary broadcasting as well. &#39;There are many people living on Cape Barren Island, and such wireless sets would he a great boom to them. Every year 130 or 140 people go to Babel Island for the mutton-bird season, and are cut off from all communication there for several months. The installation of a small wireless set of the kind suggested would give them much greater confidence, and would be of great service to them. </para>

          <para>. -  I desire to support the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in his statements regarding the Cockatoo Island Dockyard, and his suggestion regarding compensation for the men whose services have already been dispensed with, or who are likely to be discharged. When the dockyard was taken over by the Commonwealth Government from the State of New South Wales in 3013, many of the clerical and drawing office staff felt that they had rights regarding furlough and long-service leave which should be protected. When the Navy Board took control, naval regulations were passed which recognized the long-service rights of the men. Subsequently, various claims were made from time to time by officers who had completed twenty years&#39; service, and payments in these cases were made by the Commonwealth. The rights of these men were discussed in 1923, when the dockyard was transferred to the Shipping Board. Speaking on the second reading of the Commonwealth Shipping Bill, I said - </para>

          <para>There is no provision in the bill for the protection of the employees. In 1913, when the Commonwealth Government took over the State dockyard, the employees had certain rights and privileges. The new board should recognize those privileges and honour them in their entirety. </para>

        <para class="block">The Prime Minister nodded his head as if in agreement with that statement- Undoubtedly, the Commonwealth has an obligation to the employees at Cockatoo Island. Tenders have been invited for the leasing of the dockyard, and probably within a short time it will  be  controlled from, overseas. Representatives, of the staff have waited upon the Prime Minister and made certain representations regarding the payment of compensation. Their views were not very favourably received, and I hope that the door is still open for further negotiation, and that the Prime Minister will be more sympathetic. I realize that, owing  to  the state of the finances, the  Government  would be glad to evade the payment of compensation, but this consideration should not be allowed to stand in the way of justice. In the past, the Commonwealth has honoured its obligations to public servants whose services have been dispensed with. After the war, &#163;346,410 was paid in compensation to surplus officers of the Defence Department, and, following the amalgamation of Commonwealth and State Taxation Departments, &#163;35.899 was paid to compensate officers whose services were no longer required. One competent authority has estimated that the amount required to compensate the officers at Cockatoo Island would not exceed &#163;30,000. As the Commonwealth has paid much larger sums for similar purposes in the past. I can see no justification for its refusal to acknowledge the claims of the dockyard employees. We should remember gratefully the good service, they have rendered since 1913 in the construction  of torpedo-boat  destroyers and cruisers, and also the valuable part played  by  them in fitting out troopships during the war period. They are about to be placed at a great disadvantage because there is little likelihood of their services being required by any private organization that leases the dockyard, and the labour market is not at all favorable to their re-employment. Many of the men have had from 20 to 30 years&#39; service  in  a rather isolated environment, and it will be difficult for them to get other employment. We must take into account the change in industrial conditions since these men first entered the service of the dockyard. At that time the employment of women in clerical positions was not common, but in the interval they have practically supplanted men in offices. The Commonwealth Shipping Board acknowledged its responsibility by paying com-pensation  to mon who were displaced through the sale of the line, and some of those who were treated very generously by the Government have been appointed to responsible posts under the new organization. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eva,</inline> who was general manager in London, received about &#163;1,800 in compensation and his return fare to Australia, where he immediately took up the position of general manager in Australia of the new privately-owned line. If the Shipping Board was justified in paying heavy compensation to men who have been in receipt of high salaries for many years, there is even greater justification for compensating the men at Cockatoo Island, especially as many of thom have been in the service of the Commonwealth for a longer period than the employees of the Shipping Line, the Defence Department, and the Taxation Department, all of whom received substantial payments. I ask the Prime Minister to give sympathetic consideration to the claims that have been put before him. </para>

          <para>.- The Leader of the Opposition correctly described the conditions of the rice-growers in the Murrumbidgee irrigation area, which is in my electorate, and it i.s unnecessary for me to repeat the facts which he placed before the House. These men are occupying about 15,000 acres of the worst land in the area. Tt is suitable only for the growing of rice or for grazing on a large holding. It is at present producing &#163;250,000 worth of rice a year. If it were used for grazing it could not produce any more than &#163;25,000 worth of wool and mutton. As rice-producing land it is giving employment to at least ten times as many people as it would if it were used for grazing purposes. I have been in close touch with the Government on this subject for some time, and I have every confidence that it realizes the necessity of the situation, and will grant to these rice-growers the assistance that they need. </para>

The people of the Riverina and of the northern parts of New South Wales are impatient to learn the findings of the commission in this regard. We have been agitating for the creation of new States for a long while. For many years successive governments have talked about the advisableness  of adopting a policy of decentralization. We realize the seriousness to the country of the drift of population to the cities.

            <para>- I do not think so. I advocate the creation of new States because I believe that it will result in decentralization and economy in government. The United States of America provides us with an illuminating example of the value of sub-dividing a large territory into States of a reasonable size. No country in the world is so progressive as the United States of America. As the creation of small States has been so successful there, we have every reason to believe that it will be successful here. We have an example nearer home of the wisdom of constituting States of a reasonable area. I have lived in the Riverina for 35 years. Fifteen years of that time was spent within 20 miles of the Victorian border. Consequently I had a great opportunity to study the development of those parts of Victoria and New South Wales. The country on the Victorian side of the Murray is no better than the country on the New South Wales side of it, but because the Seat of Government in Victoria was fairly handy, the development of that part of the State to which I have referred was much more rapid than the development of the Riverina. As the Seat of Government in New South Wales is from 400 to 600 miles distant from the Riverina, we can hardly expect its rapid development. It is interesting to note that the population in that part of Victoria to which I have referred is six times greater than the population on the New South Wales side of the river. I was greatly surprised to hear the honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> advocate, a day or two ago, the adoption of the policy of unification for Australia. Unification is the direct antithesis of decentralization, and the honorable member would realize that if he studied the question closely. If we had only one government for Australia our plight would be far worse than it is to-day. The mismanagement of the Northern Territory by the Commonwealth Government shows how unwise it is to have the Seat of Government far-removed from the people to be governed. I do not think that under the existing conditions any government could have managed the affairs of the Northern Territory better than this Government has done. As the Seat of Government is so far from the centre of operations and the members of the Government have no knowledge of what is necessary to develop the Territory, it appears that some system of local government must be provided if the outlying portions of the Commonwealth are to be populated. It is absurd to suggest that this Parliament can effectively legislate for and administer an area so far away as the Northern Territory. </para>

          <para>.- I direct the attention of the  Prime  Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> to the unsatisfactory condition of the tobacco industry. In answer to a question yesterday the right honorable gentleman said he was unaware that any dissatisfaction existed; but press reports published from time to time show that because of the low prices realized by the growers and other difficulties with which they have had to contend they should receive some assistance.  The  honorable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Killen)</inline> said that the royal commission which inquired into the new State movement submitted an adverse report; but the Tariff Board which investigated the tobacco industry reported in favour of a reduction, of the excise on locally-grown tobacco. Although the Tariff Board submitted a recommendation favorable to the tobacco-growers, that recommendation has not been adopted by the Government. There are great possibilities of developing the tobacco-growing industry in Australia and much can be said in favour of the locally-grown product. For the information of honorable members I quote the following figures showing the quantity of tobacco grown in Australia and the quantity imported during recent years : - </para>

The total net customs and excise revenue obtained from the importation of tobacco for 1925-26 was &#163;5,533,003 ; for 1926-27, &#163;5,733,370; and for 1927-28, &#163;5,915,860.

The Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act provides that before making a new award the court shall take into account its economic effect upon the community and upon the industry or industries concerned. As the price of tobacco is fixed, the economic effect upon the community should be taken into account by the Government. At present, one firm, which is making a profit of about &#163;1,000,000 a year, is buying the great bulk of the Australian leaf, and is practically in complete control of the industry. The growers are complaining of the prices they are paid, and there is room for a thorough investigation into the whole industry, which could possibly be undertaken by the Bureau of Economic Research which the Government proposes to appoint. </para>

          <para>The prices paid by the British-Australian Tobacco Company for the respective grades of Australian leaf are not conducive to the growing of the better grades of leaf, but has the effect of encouraging the growing of inferior grades. There is a monopoly in the tobacco manufacturing industry in Australia, and consequently there is no competition in the purchase of leaf. </para>

        <para class="block">That is the point I wish to make. I now quote a letter from a firm of manufacturers in another State, which reads - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The tobacco plant has been grown in Australia from the earliest days, and for many years its culture was a progressive industry. But it scorns astounding that, for some years past, despite the magnificent market for the manufactured product, the output of leaf has been diminishing, until now the industry is in a moribund state. Excellent leaf has been produced all over Australia, and the decrease in the quantity grown is certainly not attributable to the apathy of growers, who are well aware that, given decent prices, the growing of tobacco is highly payable, and that few other crops can compare with it. What are the conditions that have brought this about? </para>
          <para>For many years the only buyer of note of locally-grown leaf has been the BritishAustralian Tobacco Company, and from what I am told it would appear that the prices offered by this company have for many years been absurdly inadequate, and this, to my way of thinking, has been the chief paralysing influence in the restriction of output of leaf. It is not to be expected that men will grow a crop from which they cannot get a fair return, which is justified by the prices the public pay for the manufactured article. </para>
          <para>Last season I had letters from growers in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria offering their leaf to my factory, and the writers made no secret, of their disgust at the prices which had been fixed by the combine buyers, and which the growers refused to accept. Pertinent evidence could be obtained from many growers, and I feel sure that much light could be thrown on the methods of the buyers, who have had the market to themselves, and consequently were in the position to tell growers : &#34; Take our price or leave it. &#34; </para>
          <para>I know that it may be urged that the leaf was worth only what was offered by the combine. But one may reasonably allow that growers are expert enough to have a good idea of leaf values and to know that what they were offered fell sadly below what they expected to realize. Nor can it be advanced that the low prices offered were the outcome of a glut of leaf on the market. The importations of leaf from abroad confute that. </para>
          <para>I know that the chief obstacle for the establishment of cigarette and tobacco factories in Australia is the large quantity of leaf required to be kept for a considerable time for maturation purposes before being put into use. This requires a big outlay (in our case nearly &#163;20.000 capital is devoted for this purpose). If tobacco was produced locally, this obstacle will not exist and the manufacture of tobacco goods would be popularized. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why big wealthy organizations do not favour the grow ing of the raw material in this country. </para>

        <para>When the tobacco-growers of Victoria met recently at Myrtleford, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Temple</inline> Smith, the Victorian expert, stated - </para>

          <para>The disclosed profits of the BritishAustralasian Tobacco Company last year amounted to &#163;910,000. Disaster awaited the growers if the company failed to increase the figure it paid for Australian leaf. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>Another grievance against the company is that, three years ago, the growers were encouraged to cultivate what is called No. 2 dark leaf tobacco; but the company now tells them that this leaf is not in such demand as it formerly was, and it will not be able to take the same quantity as before. Therefore, the growers are in a quandary as to what to do. A request was made to the Tariff Board for the payment of bounty on tobacco leaf grown in Australia, or, alternatively, a reduction in the excise duty in respect of tobacco made from leaf produced in Australia. The board made the following recommendation : - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>That the excise duty payable on all lemon-coloured and bright mahogany and dark mahogany tobacco leaf supplied by a grower to a manufacturer for use in the manufacture Of tobacco be reduced by (Id. per lb. It is estimated on the present figures that this reduction in excise  would  amount to about &#163;20,000 per annum. </para>
          <para>The board recommends that the Minister Obtain a guarantee from the Tobacco Companies that if the reduction in excise suggested is made, the companies will undertake to pass the fid. per lb. on to the suppliers of the three grades of tobacco mentioned, and that such payment will be made in addition to the present payments, including bonuses given by the companies. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">As I have already said, effect has not been given to that recommendation. The industry is still in a depressed state, and the time is ripe to consider the adoption of the recommendation. In view of the huge profits made by the company, which is practically the only buyer of tobacco in Australia, this matter might well be referred to the Bureau of Economic Research, which is shortly to be established. In the dried fruits, canned fruits, and wine industries we have overproduction, but we do not produce anything approaching sufficient tobacco to meet local requirements, and, therefore, if a bounty is not granted, the excise duty should be reduced, as recommended by the Tariff Board. </para>

          <para>.- I desire, if possible, to induce the Prime Minister to agree to the suggestion of the honorable member for Dalley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore),</inline> that the Government should compensate the men who have received notice of dismissal from the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. Within the last few days, the claims of the men have been resubmitted to me, and I have handed them to the Prime Minister. I think that the right honorable gentleman will agree that the case presented makes one think that after all, there is something in it. I thank the Prime Minister, on behalf of the men, for the courteous manner in which he received them, and for the terms of the reply to their request that was read in the other branch, of the legislature. The reply can. be boiled down to one point - that the Government practically has cut itself off from any control of Cockatoo Island Dockyard by handing it over to a board of control. If the contention of the Government is correct, how is it that the advertisements calling for tenders for the leasing of the dockyard were issued from tie Prime Minister&#39;s Department? The Government cannot divorce itself from a business undertaking, and yet have something to do with it. But what appeals to me most is the moral aspect of the case. One cannot help sympathizing with men who have spent up to 39 years of their lives&#39; in the service of their country, and are now suddenly faced with notices of dismissal. They stuck to their country in time of war, and helped us to despatch transports containing everything that the troops required at the front. Are these nien now to be thrown into the gutter? Surely this is a matter that affects us all. They built ships like our seaplane carrier <inline font-style="italic">Albatross,</inline> and other naval and commercial ships; they are an expert staff. Among the men affected are the foremen who were responsible for the work put into those vessels. They are getting on in years, and they can take up no avocation other than that in which they have spent the best part of their lives. I admit that money is not too plentiful, and the Government has to scrutinize closely all its expenditure; but are those men to be cut off altogether? They have come to my office, I have been impressed by their smart appearance, and I have listened to their story. Their only  hope is that &#34;they may get work in the yard if it is taken over by some firm or company. There still seems to be a chance of the re-consideration of their case. .1. gather that from a perusal of the reply made to them by the Prime Minister. Having been handling this matter for them with the honorable member for Dalley for some time, I make a sincere appeal to the Government. If there is any possibility of recognizing the valuable work they have done, the Government should strain a point in their favour, and grant them some compensation. These men worked many hours&#39; overtime for which they received no payment. </para>

        <para>I desire also to refer to the training of boys for the Navy. It is impossible to train a torpedo gunner&#39;s mate in three months. Boys for the Navy should commence their training while they are still young; it is useless getting them at  17  or  18  years of age. On behalf of the Navy League of Australia, I appeal to the Prime Minister that in framing next year&#39;s Estimates the Government will seriously consider the desirability of altering the present system of training. </para>
        <para>Some time ago <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Neville</inline> Howse said that some thousands of pounds had been placed on the Estimates for the charting of the Australian coast. &#34;When I asked him how far that money would go, he said that it would provide for one ship for two years. Commander Bennett says that the work would take four ships  100  years. Captain Cayley, while not so emphatic, spoke in a similar strain. If more money can be made available, I suggest that two ships be employed. I ask the Government to consider this matter when framing next year&#39;s Estimates, as by providing more vessels valuable lives may be saved. </para>

          <para>.- I desire to refer to the practice of the County party in trying to discredit those who are opposed to its policy. Recently there appeared in the local press the report of an .interview alleged to have been given by the honorable member for Maranoa <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hunter)</inline> relating to the motive of honorable members in voting for an amendment to a measure then before this House. The article purported to be written by a pressman, but in reality it was supplied by the Country party. It was typical of that party&#39;s propaganda, and apparently was written by its publicity officer, although the honorable member for Maranoa took the blame for it and offered an apology to the House. On that occasion it was shown clearly that the article was issued deliberately by the Country party as a part of its propaganda. From two sources in W Western Australia and one in Queensland similar press notices have been forwarded to me. The one from Queensland I have answered, but I have not as yet replied to the two from Western Australia. I shall do so now from my place in this House. I have before me an article taken from a Western Australian newspaper, but which it is I am not certain. </para>

If they do not make farming operations comparatively easy, what is the effect of their use?

            <para>- I am sorry that I have not by me the report of a speech which was made at this time by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robinson.</inline> He said that, whereas at one time his father reaped from 7 to 8 bushels to the acre, the return was now from 30 to 35 bushels. That was on Werocata,  near Balaclava, in the Wakefield district. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robinson</inline> also said that, in 1901, 106,000,000 sheep produced approximately 5,000,000 lb. of wool, and that, at the present time, a fewer number of sheep produce a greater quantity of wool, owing to the scientific methods that are adopted. I do not claim to have a practical knowledge of, and experience in, farming; but I do not go about with my eyes shut. The other night I challenged the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Collins),</inline> when he said that men were leaving the Wakefield district on account of the drought-stricken conditions which prevail there, and going to Western Australia. You cannot buy a farm in Wakefield to-day. I can tell the honorable member for Riverina that, not long ago, the estate of the last member for Boothby, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. DuncanHughes,</inline> realized an average price of &#163;12 5s. an acre, and the Canowie estate an average price of &#163;11 5s. an acre. People do not pay those sums for farms which adjoin their holdings, if they are a losing proposition. </para>

        <para>My reason for rising, however, was not to compare farming to-day with what it was years ago. I merely wished to draw attention to the specious propaganda methods that are adopted by the Country party. Had I been quoted fully I should not have said a word; but when two sentences are taken from their context without any explanation, and I am attacked on their account, it is time for me to protect myself. I leave it to the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. R. Green)</inline> to justify such despicable methods before the electors of his constituency and the electors generally throughout Australia. In all probability the attack served its purpose among the farmers during the last election campaign. </para>

          <para>When I  whs  a commercial traveller, I went one Wednesday afternoon to a town in the Murray flats area. The shops were closed, it was cold, and there was a drizzling rain. In the commercial room of the hotel I found a man sitting by the fire, and, addressing him, 1 asked him if he was a farmer in that district. He was  afflicted  with an impediment of speech, and with some difficulty and hesitation, he replied, &#34;Yes.&#34; I asked him if he was  having  a day off on account of the rain, and he said, &#34; Oh, no ; 1 don&#39;t work now,&#34; and told me that he paid to have his farming done for him. I hazarded the opinion that farming was pretty arduous, especially in such weather, but he replied &#34;Not at all.&#34; I said that I had always thought that farmers worked very hard, and he declared, speaking slowly, and stuttering, &#34;Not now.

As a matter of fact, some farmers are as opulent as some of the big merchants in Rundle-street, Adelaide.

        <para class="block">The time for closing the tenders was also so limited that it was impossible for the Queensland manufacturers to tender. If specifications and drawings could have been inspected at the Victoria Barracks, Brisbane, as well as at the places mentioned in the conditions I have just read, it would have been possible for them to do so. I am. sure that the Queensland manufacturers could do as good work as tenderers in the other States. I am informed that if they had taken the precaution to wire to Sydney, and pay the necessary deposit to have the specifications and drawings sent to Brisbane, it would have been fully a week before they could have been made available, and by that time it would have been too late to submit tenders. I hope that this matter will be investigated during the recess, and that Queensland manufacturers will be supplied with specifications and printed forms so that they may have the same opportunity that manufacturers in other States have to tender for Defence work. </para>

          <para>. - A number of matters of considerable importance have been raised during the discussion on the adjournment, but before I refer to them I should like to give the House some information respecting the gold-mining industry, and the course which the Government proposes to adopt in connexion with the recommendations of the Development and Migration Commission. Stated broadly, these were, first, that an attempt should be made to assist the industry by giving it relief from taxation, and a conference of the heads of the Taxation Departments throughout Australia, was held in Canberra some four or five weeks ago, when certain proposals were made for bringing the laws of the States into line with that of the Commonwealth with regard to the taxation of gold-mining and the treatment of prospectors. A second recommendation of the Development and Migration Commission was that the mining laws of the States and those of the Commonwealth should be made uniform, and a conference has also been held on that subject, the results achieved having been submitted to the States. Another recommendation of the Development and Migration Commission was that the sum of &#163;250,000 should be provided over a period of years to give relief to the industry in connexion with plant and machinery; that amounts should be given to gold-mining companies out of this sum in respect of machinery on which, in the case of imported machinery, customs duties had to be paid, or in the case of locally manufactured machinery excessive prices had to be paid. The Government is not prepared to accept that recommendation. We propose, however, to make an amount of &#163;25,000 available; but whether other amounts will be found subsequently will depend upon the state of the Commonwealth finances. </para>

        <para>The honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson)</inline> drew attention to the investigation of the Royal Commission on the Amendment of the Constitution. He admitted that the problem which the commission has to consider is probably as important and as difficult as any that has ever been under the consideration of a royal commission in Australia before. Yet he seemed to suggest that there had been undue delay in the presentation of the commission&#39;s report. Notwithstanding the length of the timer during which this commission has been sitting, I do not think that we are justified in concluding that it is excessive; but the matter can be better judged when we see the commission&#39;s report, and know what has been involved in the commission&#39;s deliberations. The honorable member asked what is to be done with the report when received. In 1925 I said that it was proposed to hold a constitutional session, during which this Parliament could consider the Constitution and make such suggestions for its alteration as it might think fit. I admit frankly that in studying the matter the Government came definitely to the conclusion that Parliament would never get anywhere, even if it sat continuously for twelve months considering alterations to the Constitution, and, accordingly, we appointed a royal commission to clear the ground for it. When we receive the commission&#39;s report the subjects dealt with in it will, it seems to me, divide themselves into sections. Those in one section will cause little differences of opinion as to the need for giving the Commonwealth full and complete powers regarding them. An outstanding example of such a subject is the control of aviation. I do not think there is any difference of opinion regarding the absolute necessity for the Commonwealth to have complete control of aviation. Some other matters will fall into the same category, and regarding them we shall experence little difficulty in coming to definite conclusions, which are almost certain to be endorsed by the people when they are consulted by referendum. The second group will consist of matters that are mildly controversial, but are not likely to create much feeling. In the third class will be those more complex matters regarding the control of which by the Commonwealth there are fundamental differences of opinion among various sections of the community. When we have the Royal Commission&#39;s report before us we shall be better qualified to arrive at a practical basis for the consideration of these matters, but I agree with the honor-able member for New England that the revision of the Constitution is of paramount importance, and that Parliament should have an opportunity at the earliest possible date to at least make a start upon this difficult task. At the present moment I can give the honorable member no assurance concerning how and when the Government will recommend Parliament to deal with this matter; but it is almost certain that during the next session some phases of the problem of constitutional revision will be before us for consideration. As a result of the deliberation which will then take place, we shall be able to decide what will be the most effective and practical way of approaching this important and difficult task. I trust that it will be possible to take some of the preliminary steps at an early date. The subject in which the honorable member for New England is particularly interested is the creation of new States. </para>

            <para>- I cannot, be expected to make an announcement of policy during a debate of this character. One suggestion that has been put forward is that the method of referring matters to the people by referendum shall be altered. It is quite possible that this matter can be dealt with rapidly and easily; but the recommendations of the commission may go much further and cause a wide divergence of opinion. The only assurance I can give the honorable member for New England is that the Government proposes to afford Parliament at as early a date as possible an opportunity to debate the report of the royal commission, and take some practical steps towards effecting the necessary alterations of the Constitution. </para>

        <para>The honorable member for Dalley and other honorable members raised the subject of the treatment to be meted out to the employees of Cockatoo Island Dockyard in the event of it passing from the control of the Commonwealth. I do not hesitate to admit that it will remain a semi-government instrumentality up to the date when it is leased, but before discussing the compensation of employees for displacement I shall &#39;dispose of two other points raised by the honorable member for Dalley. He referred to outstanding claims for compensation for accident. I regret to learn that some of the claims are still unpaid, but I shall personally look into them and endeavour to have them completed. I was under the impression that all of them had been settled. The claims in respect of furlough have been under consideration for a long time, and have presented very great difficulties. We attempted to apply one broad principle in dealing with all claims, but before we had proceeded far we found it impossible to deal with the matter in that way, because of the varying circumstances of each individual case. Eventually we appointed a subcommittee of Cabinet to investigate each individual claim and make a recommendation to Cabinet. The sub-committee is still at work and is doing its best to have these claims cleared up. </para>
        <para>The major point to which the honorable member for Dalley addressed himself, was the compensation to be paid to officers upon the transfer of the dockyard to a lessee. A deputation representing the employees waited upon me about a month ago, when I dealt with the matter fully. For the information of the House, I shall briefly outline the position as the Government views it. Cockatoo Island Dockyard was under the control of the State of New South Wales until 1913, when it was taken over by the Commonwealth Navy Department. It remained under the control of that department throughout the war period, but in 1921 was transferred to the Shipbuilding Board which was controlled by the Prime Minister&#39;s Department. It continued to be administered by that board until 1923, when it was handed over to the board established under the Commonwealth Shipping Act. The honorable member for Dalley stated that amongst the employees of the dockyard are men with periods of service ranging from ten years to 39 years, who are about to lose their employment without receiving any compensation. The impression left upon the minds of honorable members was that men who had served the Commonwealth and the State faithfully for very many years, are about to be cast out of employment without receiving any compensation or consideration. That is not a true representation of the facts. The transfer of the dockyard to the Commonwealth Shipping Board in 1923. marked the end of one period and the commencement of another. The intention was that whether or not the dockyard remained a semi-government enterprise, it must be conducted on the same commercial basis as the private enterprises with which it would have to compete. Indeed, the Commonwealth Shipping Act includes a provision deliberately designed to place the dockyard in the position of an ordinary trading activity; and in order that we might know definitely the results of its operations we required that it should take into account income tax and every other charge which an equivalent private firm would be required to meet. It was definitely laid down also that with its transfer to the Commonwealth Shipping Board, the employees passed into a service equivalent to that of Mort&#39;s Dock or any similar private enterprise. But there was a recognition of the long period of service of these men, for at the time the dockyard passed from the direct control of the Government, the permanent employees received furlough in respect of their service up to the 31st August, 1923, and the temporary employees received it in respect of their service up to the 29 th June, 1921. </para>

        <para>The latest memorandum submitted to the Government on this subject bases the claim for recognition of the services of the dockyard staff upon the fact that these men are now terminating their employment with the Commonwealth and not upon the fact that they are terminating all employment, although, unhappily, some of them will lose their employment. If the Government has granted compensation to any of its employees in respect of the termination of their public service there is some justification for similar consideration in this case. But compensation has been granted in respect of the termination of employment by the Commonwealth in only three cases. These were the retrenchment in the Defence Department in 1923, the retrenchment in the Taxation Department in 1924, and the termination of  the employment of the shore staff of the Commonwealth Shipping Line. The reason for the granting of compensation in those cases was that the employees whose services were dispensed with were justified in expecting continuity of employment, or that the employment had been of an exclusive character such as might not be obtainable elsewhere. In the case of the Defence Department, the financial position of the Commonwealth made it necessary in 1923 to reduce the defence vote drastically. A number of men who had been in the employment of the department for a number of years, and who had every reason to expect continuous employment, lost their positions, and were paid compensation. In the case of the Taxation Department an agreement was reached between the Commonwealth and the States by which five States undertook to collect income taxation for the Commonwealth. In the other State an arrangement existed which was continued under which the Commonwealth collected the taxation for itself and the State concerned. The effect of the rearrangement was that one tax-collecting authority operated where there had formerly been two. This rendered unnecessary the continued employment of a number of taxation officers. These, like the officers of the Defence Department to whom I referred, had every right to expect permanent employment, and therefore were paid compensation. The third case relates to the shore staff of the Commonwealth Line. The management of the line was handed over to the Shipping Board in 1923, but when the sale of the vessels was agreed upon last year, the Shipping Board submitted certain proposals to the Government for the compensation of the shore staff in consideration of the fact that as the head office of the company which purchased the line was in Great Britain, it would not be necessary to continue the whole of the existing organization in Australia. Consequently, the avenues of employment of certain individuals would disappear. After obtaining legal advice on the subject, the Government acquiesced in the views expressed by the Shipping Board and compensation, was paid by the board to the men concerned. These are the only cases in which compensation has been paid for the loss of employment. </para>

        <para class="block">Honorable members opposite have mentioned that certain individuals employed by the Australian Commonwealth Shipping Line are now employed by the company that took it over and yet are receiving a pension for loss of employment. That was not the basis upon which proposals for compensation were submitted for approval by the Government. Compensation was to be payable to those who actually lost their employment, and it was limited to the members of the shore staff whose avenues of employment would disappear. </para>
        <para>I have mentioned the three cases in which compensation has been paid. We have now to consider whether the principle applied in those cases can be applied to the employees of Cockatoo Island  Dockyard.  The Government, while having the greatest sympathy with the men who have lost their employment, cannot admit that that principle can be applied to them. We have to consider first, whether these people lost their employment in consequence of the action of the Government. The Cockatoo Island Dockyard has been in Operation for many years, and it is likely that when the dockyard is leased, it will continue to carry on the same work it has undertaken in the past. It is, indeed, hoped that its operations may expand. The decision of the High Court in the Bunnerong Power case was that the Constitution placed a definite limitation on the work which could be carried out at Cockatoo Island under the control of the Shipping Board, but when it passes to the control of a private firm there will be no such limitation. Therefore, instead of employment decreasing, there is every prospect of it expanding. The services of a number of men have recently been dispensed with, not because the Government proposes to lease the dock-yard, but because of the economic conditions now prevailing in Australia. These may alter within twelve months, when employment may be plentiful again. The Government cannot in such circumstances compensate men for loss of employment now, since they may be reinstated within the period I have mentioned. The present position is not due to the action of the Government in proposing to transfer the dock-yard from the Commonwealth Shipping Board to a private lessee. </para>

But I definitely challenge the statement&#39; of the honorable member for Dalley that the Government&#39;s announcement affected the position.

              <para>- Probably if Cockatoo Island were a private concern - an old family undertaking - and was sold, some recognition would be given to those who had been employed there during the time in which its owners had grown prosperous ; but the Government is the trustee for the taxpayers&#39; money, and cannot use it as one could use his private capital. The Government can consider this question only from the standpoint of what is just, honorable and right, and can give to these people only treatment similar to that meted out to other servants of the public. We could not give to these men better conditions than are given to other members of the Public Service. Even public servants who have been apparently firmly entrenched, sometimes come to be redundant officers and have to go out of the service because there is no position open to them. If the Government were to grant compensation to the men at the dockyard, they would be receiving preferential treatment over other public servants. We have examined this matter very carefully, and with every desire to assist the men, but we cannot accede to the request which has been put forward by the individuals concerned. It is with regret that we feel that we must adhere to the decision which I gave to the deputation the other day. </para>

          <para>The honorable member for Wentworth referred to the training of boys for the navy, and the need for a proper survey of the coast of Australia. I am afraid that, while the Government has the greatest possible sympathy with the honorable member in connexion with both those matters, the financial position, unfortunately, will not permit of action being taken with regard to either of them. The Government realizes that the training of boys for the navy and a full survey of the coast of Australia are most desirable. But there is a limit to the sum that can be found for defence purposes, and the Government has to accept the- advice of its experts on land, air and naval defence in  determining how the money available can be best allotted. Unhappily, in that allocation, curtailment of the sum devoted to the training of boys has been found necessary, and the work of charting the coast is also limited by our financial resources. . </para>

            <para>.- I intend to refer briefly to rice and cotton, and I take them in that order, not because of their relative importance, but as a matter of convenience. The subject of rice production in Australia was referred to by the Leader of the Opposition and the honorable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Killen).</inline> They both pleaded for what would be, in effect, an embargo against imported rice. I have no objection to their statement of the case, or to that which the growers have put to me. But there is another side to it, and one that I desire to submit to the House. It is only two years ago, this month, since the rice-growers in the Murrumbidgee Valley made representations to this Parliament, and we granted all that they asked. &#34;We imposed a duty equivalent to  &#163;3  14s. 8d. a ton on imported rice. Since then, the growers have harvested only one crop, and I suggest that their trouble appears to be due largely to the dimensions of that crop. This points to the fact that it is far more difficult to foster a primary than a secondary industry, because of the problem of regulating production. The 1928 crop exceeded the growers&#39; anticipations by about 50 per cent., and, owing to that- surplus, the present problem has arisen. Soon after I came into office, I was approached by the growers, and I have been seen by their representatives on a number of subsequent occasions. They have not through me asked that the matter be referred to the Tariff Board, nor have they requested an increased duty from me. They have narrowed their demand down to an embargo, and have refused to discuss anything else. They have represented all the time that they have not received a square deal from the millers. They have protested strongly that a combine is operating against them, that the price given is not a fair one, and that they want absolute prohibition of the imported article. </para>

              <para>- I hope that I have not misunderstood the honorable member. The rates of freight, of course, affect world parity. The millers buy at Leeton, and they have to add to the purchase price the cost of transport to Sydney or Melbourne. Then after the rice has been husked, there is the cost of freight to other parts of Australia. But, when rice is imported, the freight is practically the same whether the commodity is landed at Sydney, Brisbane, or Fremantle. On the representations made to me, I took the matter up with the millers. Some four or five months ago the growers elected a Rice Marketing Board, and they declare that they have not had a fair deal from the millers. J point out to the House that the board has been at work for four or five months, but, until last week, had not approached the millers with regard to the disposal of this season&#39;s crop. They have been haunting this House, and worrying the Government for an embargo; but I have suggested again and again that they should interview the millers. Finally. I  saw the millers myself. I do not think that the growers have been fair, either to themselves or to this Parliament, which gave them all that they demanded two years ago. Although I saw the representatives of the millers in Melbourne, I am not taking up their ease. I shall state the claims of both sides as they have been submitted to me. The representative of the millers, a man of Australian repute outside the industry altogether, said that they were prepared to pay import parity for all Australian-grown rice. He gave a definite assurance that they would regulate imports accordingly up to the capacity of the Australian market. He added that they had at all times been prepared to do that. I raised the question of the disparity in price, to which the Leader of the Opposition referred, and he replied that rice, like all other primary products, was subject to violent fluctuations both in production and in parity from season to season. Some of the members of the Rice Marketing Board went to Melbourne last week ; but, according to their local representative, who has interviewed me a number of times, they could not make progress with their  negotiations  with the millers. They again complained that they were being ill-treated by an alleged combine. </para>

              <para>- I do not know the terms on which they offered it. A newspaper published in the Riverina - I think it was the <inline font-style="italic">Mumimbidgee Irrigator</inline> - contained a report of a meeting of rice-growers in which it was publicly stated that a gentleman who had interviewed me on several occasions on behalf of the rice-growers had been wagered &#163;1,000 to nothing that he could not secure an embargo on rice. When he interviewed me yesterday I asked him if that were a fact. He said that the report was not exactly correct, but that he was paid a retaining fee for his &#34; political work,&#34; which would be increased if he succeeded in his mission. I submit that that form of negotiation between the Rice Marketing Board and the responsible Minister is not only highly undesirable, but is also calculated to prejudice the interests of the growers. In my opinion it gives colour to my belief that the growers at Leeton have concentrated on making the most of their troubles with the millers in the hope that thereby they would secure an absolute embargo on the importation of rice. I informed this representative of the rice-growers that I would have no further negotiations with him, and that in future I would deal directly with the Rice Marketing Board. The Leader of the Opposition, in advocating an embargo on the importation of rice, appeared to think that if we gave the local growers the whole of the Australian market we should be able to control the output. </para>

              <para>- I turn now to the subject of the cotton industry, to which several honorable members have made reference. First, I desire to emphasize that there has been no undue delay in dealing with this matter. On the contrary, everything practicable has been done to expedite the inquiry, to prepare the report, and to have it considered by the Government. I remind the House that the promise of my predecessor, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> E. Pratten, that this matter would be referred to the Tariff Board was made on the 7th May, 1928, in reply to a deputation which waited on him at the Sydney Customs House. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pratten</inline> promised reference to the Tariff Board in June, but actually it reached that body in May, 192S. I point out that it is neither customary nor desirable for the Minister to request the Tariff Board to give priority to particular cases unless the circumstances are exceptional. All cases are regarded as of supreme importance by those directly interested. The hands of the board have been very full, and there has been no delay in dealing with this matter. Since I have been administering the department I have done everything I decently could do to secure the report of the board at the earliest possible moment. </para>

              <para>- This is a case which demands the particular deliberation and care of the responsible Minister. I do not intend to disclose, at this stage, the nature of the Tariff Board&#39;s report. It must be obvious, however, that any decision to commit this country to the manufacture of the whole of its cotton goods from white-grown Queensland cotton must be a progressive one, and must lead within a few years to the manufacture of all our cotton requirements in this country. It must also be obvious that any such decision must mean the adoption of a very high measure of protection. That is unavoidable, because Australian cotton is the product of white labour. I go so far as to say that, of all Australian commodities which might be increased in price by tariff legislation, none could bear more definitely than cotton on the cost of living. I need scarcely say that cotton plays a very large part in the clothing of the workers and generally those who have low incomes. In the clothing of the children of the workers, it plays a very large part practically from their socks to their caps. Any increase in the cost of living, due to a higher price being paid for cotton goods, would fall relatively much more heavily on the workers than on the rich, who because of the incomes they  reecive,  are able to purchase to a much greater extent silk and woollen goods. The present value of the imports of cotton yarn and cotton goods of all kinds is estimated at something like &#163;10,000,000 annually. I very much doubt if we could manufacture all the cotton goods we require, or even the main portion of them, with a duty, inclusive of bounty, of less than 50 per cent, or 60 per cent. A special feature of the application which was made to the Tariff Board is that it was a  three-barralled  application. The request was for a bounty on seed cotton, a bounty on yarn, and a duty on imported yarn. I do not intend at this stage to even indicate the Government&#39;s ultimate intention, because its deliberations are not yet concluded; but I do suggest to the House that as, in a sense, I am the custodian of the manufacturing interests of this country so far as they are affected by this Parliament, it is imperative that I should proceed in this ease with the most meticulous care. I frankly admit that when we make a move we must move a very long way. Before I make a progressive recommendation to the Government I must be absolutely satisfied that the promised advantages to labour, and to Australia&#39;s interests generally, as a result of an extension of the industry, will greatly outweigh the impost of an increased cost to the workers of this country in connexion with their purchases of cotton goods. If a mistake should be made in regard to the establishment of cotton manufacturing on a grand scale, a new charge would be added to the cost of living, and, being reflected in the general cost of production, would be very embarrassing in a material way to the whole of our secondary industries. I do not believe that there has ever been a more voluminous report than that which the Tariff Board has submitted in this instance. I am certain that no previous report has been so complex. All I am pleading for is that more time shall be given to its consideration than has been available within the last fortnight, and than will be available before the end of this week. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>I shall deal now with the position of the two interests concerned. As I see it, the plight of the cotton-growers of Queensland is in no sense desperate. If they have to export this year&#39;s crop, they will not be nearly so badly off as a great number of producers in other classes of primary industry that I could mention. Furthermore, they are not solely dependent on cotton. There are exceptions, of course, but the average crop grown by each individual is about 10 acres. A great many of them are dairy-farmers, and I think a number of them are engaged in one or two other branches of agriculture. They are not solely dependent on cotton. That 1b an important aspect to take into consideration. Even if the cotton-growers are not provided with an Australian market for the whole or the bulk of this year&#39;s crop they will be better off than they were last year when 80 per cent, of the crop had to be exported. Although they had no absolute guarantee of any change in this year&#39;s conditions, they have gone on with their cropping and I believe have increased their area. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Webster,</inline> manager of the Queensland Cotton Board, speaking at the deputation which waited on the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pratten</inline> on the 7th May, 1928, said - </para>

          <para class="block">I do not say that the cotton-growers flourished through, but they did get through all right. The price at that time in New York and Liverpool was about 20 cents. It is slightly better than that today, and futures for May and right up to&#39; October are even better than that. The Queensland cotton-growers are, therefore, assured of better prices overseas for this year&#39;s crop than they obtained for last year&#39;s crop. If we require further evidence of the fact that their dependence on cotton is a limited one we can take the extraordinary fluctuations in the crop during the last seven or eight years. We find that they have swung off cotton-growing more than once, but they have not smashed or gone off the land or required great advances from the State Government as the Mallee farmers have required. Despite fluctuations they have carried on, and I submit that if they are obliged by the circumstances to carry on over the harvesting of the crop now maturing, they will still survive and be very much better off than many other classes of our primary producers. Another small thing which shows the fairly solid condition of the cotton-growing industry on its lid. bounty and its safety for another year, is that the Queensland Cotton Board has recently sold in Australia, and for Australian consumption, the greater part of the coming season&#39;s low-grade cotton. The board has already increased its first financial advances against thiB year&#39;s crop over the advances it deemed desirable at this time last year, and the step it has taken has been based not on any expectation of help from, the Commonwealth Parliament, but solely on the export parity price of cotton. </para>
          <para>I come now to the other interested party or parties  in  this Tariff Board application. There are two big manufacturers concerned  in  the cotton industry- Bonds,  of  Sydney, and the Austral Silk Company, a branch of the Lincoln Mills. If we propose to establish the cotton industry on a grand scale, and I have already said we cannot stand where we are, there is upon us an absolute obligation to the taxpayers to be sure  of  the foundations upon which we are building, and  of  the financial stability  of  the two firms we are going to so heavily support with the taxpayers&#39; money. We must be thoroughly satisfied that they have sufficient capital, that there is  no  watering of capital, and that they are not over-capitalized. We have to see that they are making use  of  the most modern machinery and that their management  is  highly efficient. I emphasize these matters because Bond&#39;s company is actually  in  liquidation today, and as the result of my investigations 1 do not feel justified  in  recommending the Government to give an increased measure  of  support to a company in the chaotic state of Bonds at the present time. If we are to put these two firms in possession  of  the cotton manufacture and cotton business  of  the Commonwealth, they must come to us in the frankest way and satisfy us that their position is financially and satisfactorily correct and promising  in  every feature. </para>
          <para>Since the report  of  the Tariff Board has come to hand the Government has not had time to consider the problem. Therefore, in view  of  all the circumstances, the magnitude of the problem and the certain addition which cotton manufacture  on  a grand scale here would make to the cost of living - because of the unknown indirect effects, and the very limited time at its disposal - the Government has decided to take  no  definite steps based  on  the report  of  the Tariff Board during the remainder of this session. I can give the House, however, a definite assurance that the matter will be comprehensively and exhaustively considered during the recess, and that a further statement upon the whole subject will be made early next session. </para>
