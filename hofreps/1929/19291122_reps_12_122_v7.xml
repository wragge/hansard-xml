                        <para>- I have invited representatives of the coal-mine owners and of The combined unions to attend the conference, and I have read in the press that it is not the intention of the Federated Engine Drivers Association to be represented there; but I have not received an official notification to that effect. I have also noticed, however, that it has been stated that the Federated Engine Drivers are prepared to give every support to the Commonwealth Government in its efforts to end the dispute which now exists. That decision is very satisfactory. </para>

                    <para>- Yesterday I asked the Treasurer a question with the object of ascertaining whether the total amount sought to be borrowed by the Commonwealth was &#163;10,000,000 or &#163;15,000,000. The honorable gentleman replied that treasury bills were being issued in London with a currency of about seven months, to tide over a period of temporary stringency on the London market pending the raising of a further loan in Great Britain. That was not in any sense a reply to my question, but merely implied that there was to be further borrowing. I again ask the Treasurer whether it is a fact that the &#163;5,000,000 which the Government is raising in Great Britain by the issue of short-dated treasury-bills is in addition to the &#163;10,000,000 that is being raised in Australia? </para>

A loan of &#163;10,000,000 has been placed upon the Australian market. The &#163;5,000,000 to be raised by the issue of treasury-bills on the London market will be used to the full extent in reducing current overdrafts in London. </para>

The Tariff Board is a law unto itself, and unfortunately it has recently been engaged in considering what might be termed extraneous matters, and has thus been precluded from considering many other important matters that otherwise would have been investigated with greater expedition. </para>

Since then, however, Parliament has authorized the making of an agreement on this matter between the Commonwealth and the States. This agreement has been duly signed and ratified, and can only be altered by the unanimous consent of the parties. The financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States, and the agreement entered into between them will, when opportunity arises, be further discussed between representatives of the State and of the Commonwealth Governments. </para>

                        <para>- The circumstances surrounding the problem of unemployment in the Northern Territory are peculiar to that area, and are the direct result of the action of the previous Government, which put a works policy into operation and then failed to carry it out. After inducing hundreds of unfortunate men to travel to the north, they suddenly closed down the works; hence the want and distress of a great many families in Darwin, and the obligation upon this Government to afford them some relief. As to whether the principle of free fares for unemployed is to be adopted throughout the whole of Australia, the answer is &#34; No.&#34; </para>

                    <para>- There are certain overdrafts in London which tend to increase as further drafts are made on banks by the respective governments responsible. The drafts are made for payments in London, chiefly in regard to interest falling due, and for goods bought on Government account. The overdrafts tend to increase in proportion to the need for funds in London, and to the extent that &#34;we are unable to transmit money to England. This issue of treasury-bills is to provide for Australia&#39;s immediate requirements pending the raising of a loan. </para>

                        <para>- I have received a considerable amount of documentary and verbal information on this subject from various ports, and in association with the Assistant Minister for Industry have given some attention to it. I do not know that the documents are suitable to be laid upon the table of the House. They are in the nature  of  information for the consideration of the Government. We are acquiring all possible information on this subject, and hope to formulate a policy regarding the terms and. conditions of work on the waterfront which will result in pacification. </para>

Paragraph 7 of the protocol refers to propaganda, and states that the Governments concerned will reciprocally confirm the pledge contained in Article 16 of the Anglo-Russian Treaty signed on 8th August, 1924.

                        <para>- The improvement of the roads of access to the Federal Territory has been the subject of negotiation during the last two years between the Federal and the State authorities as a result of which definite programmes in respect of the following roads have been adopted: - (1) Goulburn to Canberra; (2) Yass to Canberra; (3) Canberra to Jervis Bay, via Braid wood; (4) Canberra, via Cooma, Nimmitabel, Bombala to the Victorian border. In regard to the road, Goulburn to Canberra, a definite scheme of improvement of that section between Collector and Canberra is now in active progress. The Commonwealth Government made available in respect of that section between Collector and the Federal Territory boundary a sum of &#163;200,000, in addition to which the State Government is providing &#163;100,000. A sum of &#163;50,000 has been made available by the Commonwealth Government for the construction of the section in continuation of this road within the Federal Territory. This section of the road is also in active progress. Attention is being given to the other roads referred to above by the State Government, either under the Federal Aid Roads Agreement or from purely State funds. The State Government has also made available to the local authorities coniderable sums of money for such maintenance of existing roads as is considered necessary to keep them in trafficable condition, pending consideration of the question of their reconstruction. </para>

                        <para>- Quite recently all recorded cases of group food poisoning which had occurred within recent years were reviewed in collaboration with the State Departments of Health. While evidence of definitely positive or negative nature was somewhat limited, it can bc said that there was nothing to suggest the association of aluminium vessels with the food poisoning. It is not known actually whether aluminium vessels were &#39;used in the preparation or cooking. </para>

                <para>I am indebted to the House for enabling me to move the second reading of this measure, which is in the nature of a temporary machinery bill for the purpose  of  continuing arbitration in the Public Service under exceptional circumstances, until the Government has had an opportunity to formulate its policy, possibly as  to  arbitration generally, and at all events,  as to  arbitration in the Public Service.  It  will be remembered that in the last Parliament a bill was introduced in another place for the purpose of radically altering, if not revolutionising, the practice  of  arbitration in the service as it had  been  administered over a number  of  years.  I  have good reason to believe that the  proposals  in that bill by no means commended themselves to the Public Service  as a  whole, and I venture to express  the  opinion that the result of the recent election, which was fought mainly, though not solely, on the issue of arbitration, goes to show that the policy  of  the late Government in this matter  was  not more popular with the general public than with the members  of  the Public Service themselves. </para>
                <para>The Arbitration Public Service Act of 1920 provided for the appointment  of  a Public Service Arbitrator for  a  period of seven years, and following on the passing of that act an appointment was made as arbitrator  of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Atlee Hunt, a gentleman who, over a long period of years, has rendered valuable service to the community.  He  was appointed in February, 1921, and it was provided that his appointment should take effect from the date of his commencing duties. As that appointment expired in 1928, the Government of the day thought fit to introduce a measure that  enabled him to be re-appointed for a period that would expire on his attaining the age of 65 years. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt</inline> attained that age on the 7th November of the present year, but by reason, no doubt, of the fact that the policy of the late Government was entirely different from that of the present administration, no provision was made for the appointment of a successor upon the termination of his period of office. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt</inline> having already attained the age of 65 years, and this Government not yet having had reasonable opportunity &#187; I think it will be generally conceded, to obtain all the necessary information and guidance from proper sources as to new legislation, it is imperative now to make provision for the carrying on of the office until a decision has been reached by the Government, and later by the House, on the general subject of Public Service arbitration. In the meantime, in order that the Public Service may not be without an arbitrator, and that the court may continue to operate, it is proposed to extend <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt&#39;s</inline> term of office for a brief period, namely, until the 30th September, 1930. I do not know how far <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt,</inline> in the meantime, may think fit to enter upon the consideration of fresh cases, but I am. a ware that that gentleman has before him at present certain matters in respect of which a final decision has not yet been given, and that, naturally, a little time is required to conclude those cases that have been heard before him, and in a general way to terminate the work of the office so far as he personally is concerned. This extension will allow the present arbitrator to complete the investigations upon which he is engaged, and enable the Government to take action either to make a re-appointment on similar lines or to institute a new scheme of arbitration. The Government, as honorable members are well aware, is committed to a policy of arbitration, both in regard to the Public Service and generally. The bill will effect no vital changes, and in the meantime the Government will have full opportunity to adumbrate its new policy, and, if possible, will present it early in the forthcoming year. It is highly improbable that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Atlee</inline> Hunt will, during his extended term, take up any new cases. </para>

                    <para>- It is competent for Ministers to lay papers on the table at any stage of the business of the House. Generally it might, perhaps, be more convenient if all papers were laid on the table at one time, early in the day&#39;s proceedings; but there is nothing in the Standing Orders to prevent a Minister from laying papers on the table at any time while the House is sitting, and other business is not before it. </para>

                            <para>- There is an alteration in respect of some spirit items. These are being brought into conformity with those set out in the schedule of August last. A full explanation will be given by me when the tariff is under discussion by honorable members. I understand that the schedule which was tabled yesterday was not published in this morning&#39;s issue of the newspapers of some of the States. The committee will remember that when I rose to lay the schedule upon the table of the House it was as late as 10.10 p.m., which made it practically impossible, in one State at least, to release the schedule in time for press publication this morning. On the sudden cessation of the Address-in-Reply debate, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> delivered his budget, and it was after that that I rose to lay the schedule upon the table of the House. I regret the incident, but it was unavoidable. </para>

Take for instance blended brandy. Under the schedule introduced last night the rates were 30s. and 35s. Under this schedule the rates are 29s. and 34s. This alteration is necessary to bring the tariff into conformity with that tabled last August. </para>

It, therefore, has a retrospective effect, and I wish to know whether that is not in contravention to our customs legislation. This amended schedule has been laid upon the table of the House several hours after the schedule introduced yesterday commenced to operate. There has been no discussion on the items affected, and row for some obscure reason the Minister is laying on the table an amending schedule which has a retrospective effect. </para>

                    <para>The application of South Australia to the Commonwealth for financial assistance on account of the special disabilities under which it claims to be labouring as a consequence of federation, was under the consideration of the previous Government, and for the first time a grant to that State is now proposed. The State Government applied for an annual grant of &#163;750,000, because of the adverse condition of its finances during the last two or three years. An examination of the finances of the State during the last five years gives this result :  - </para>

                        <graphic href="122331192911222_15_0.jpg" />
                    </para>
                    <para class="block">The estimate for the current financial year does not take into account the proposed Commonwealth grant. These recurring and increasing deficits reveal an alarming situation. The last Government appointed a royal commission to report on the financial disabilities, if any, which affected South Australia as a result of federation, and to recommend what steps should be taken by the Commonwealth or the State to remedy the existing state of affairs. The disabilities of the State were alleged to extend over a wide range, and to include the adverse operation of the Customs Tariff and certain Commonwealth laws, the Murray River Waters Agreement, and other factors. The royal commission reported, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia,</inline> that - it is apparent that the present unsatisfactory financial position has gradually evolved over a series of years, and that the serious deficits in the last two years are due chiefly to losses on the railways, and on works of a developmental character. </para>
                    <para class="block">Whether that statement fully explains the causes of the recurring deficits in South Australia or not, the fact remains that heavy losses have been sustained on the operation of the railways. In the first thirteen years of federation the railways earned surpluses, but in those affluent years no provision was made for depreciation. In recent years the railways have sustained heavy losses, and for the two years 1926-27 and 1927-28 these losses totalled &#163;2,070,000. In the last five years &#163;11,000,000 has been spent on the rehabilitation of the system, and in consequence, the annual interest charges increased by &#163;526,000. The principal increases in loan expenditure during the last nine years have been- railways, &#163;12,262,000; developmental, &#163;11,497,000; loans and securities, &#163;12,946,000. The royal commission questioned the wisdom of the huge developmental expenditure which in the last nine years exceeded by &#163;2,000,000 the developmental expenditure during the whole previous history of the State. Special mention was made of the cost of soldier land settlement. This subject has since been dealt with in the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Pike and is being treated by the Government separately in the manner indicated in my Budget Speech. South Australia&#39;s public debt has increased 116 per cent, during the last nine years, rising from &#163;91 0s. 3d. per head of population in 1919 to &#163;159 12s. 5d. in 1928. The average increase in all States during the same period was 82 per cent. The greater portion of that increase in South Australia occurred while a Nationalist government was in office. </para>

                            <para>- The fact remains that the greatest aggregate expenditure in any two years was during the regime of a Nationalist government. The heavy expenditure that was incurred by the Gunn Government was the result of commitments entered into by previous Nationalist governments, especially upon the rehabilitation of the railways. Perhaps it is unwise to introduce State party politics into the consideration of this matter. We have to decide whether the proposed grant to South Australia is warranted having regard to the interests of the Commonwealth as a whole. Undoubtedly, that State has suffered some disabilities as a result of federation, and if the financial assistance proposed to be rendered by the Commonwealth is justified, this Parliament should give it at once, and allow the South Australian people to settle their own domestic political differences. I merely mentioned certain facts regarding loan expenditure in order to throw additional light on the financial position of the State. Public debt charges, such as interest and sinking fund, are equivalent to 37 per cent, of the expenditure from consolidated revenue, a larger percentage than in most of the other States. During the last fourteen years the public debt charges have increased by 242 per cent., while other charges against consolidated revenue have increased by approximately 120 per cent. The royal commission recommended a special grant of &#163;500,000 per annum for two years and a modification of the conditions of the Federal Aid Roads contribution in favour of South Australia. It also recommended that its finding should be reviewed in the light of- </para>

                    <para class="block">The royal commission stated that an exact calculation of the monetary disabilities under which South Australia was suffering was impracticable, but it expressed the opinion that South Australia was worthy of sympathetic treatment such us had been extended to Western Australia and Tasmania. The last Commonwealth Government, after considering the report of the royal commission, proposed to make a grant of &#163;1,000,000 to be spread over three years instead of two years as recommended by the commission. In the first year there was to be an unconditional cash payment of &#163;300,000, and South Australia was to transfer to the Commonwealth the control of the Red Hill to Salisbury railway. According to the last Treasurer, the State would thus be relieved of an annual liability in respect of interest and sinking fund amounting to &#163;60,000. The Government of South Australia objected to the condition governing that &#163;60,000, and the present Commonwealth Government having carefully reviewed the position, considers that insistence upon that condition would be unwise. </para>
                    <para>An amount of &#163;360,000 has been made available as a grant in this year&#39;s Estimates, and in each of the next two years an amount of &#163;320,000 will be made available, the total sum given thus being &#163;1,000,000, spread over a period of three years. From some remarks that were made by the Premier of South Australia I understand that his government objected to the conditions that were attached to &#163;60,000 of the amount that the previous Commonwealth Government proposed to make available, and would have resisted those conditions strenuously had they been persisted with. </para>

                            <para>- I have not the figures that would enable me to make a comparison, but it can be said that the. rate of direct taxation in South Australia is as high as that in any State. When considering whether the grant provided for by the bill is as generous as that recommended by the royal commission, it must be borne in mind that the royal commission made reference to other benefits that South Australia might obtain in connexion with the reduction of its loan indebtedness with respect to soldier land settlement, possible re-adjustments in connexion with the River Murray Waters scheme, and a concession under the Federal Aid Roads agreement. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Pike has made certain recommendations, and South Australia will gain a proportionate advantage with the other States of the Commonwealth under that proposal. At the present timeI do not know of any proposed variation of the River Murray Waters agreement, so that I am unable to say whether South Australia is likely to derive any advantage in that direction. </para>

                            <para>- We have made provision for an additional &#163;25,000 to meet a possible contingency. An application was made by, I think, the constructing authority - the commission - for &#163;100,000 in addition to the amount provided on the loan programme. I consulted the Loan Council and advised the members of the contracting States that the Commonwealth Government was prepared to bear its share of the additional &#163;100,000 if the provision of that sum were approved, but proposed that the amount should be saved in some other direction so that the total loan programme for the year would not be exceeded. Therefore the amount of &#163;25,000 has been placed upon the loan estimates for this year. Whether it will be needed or not depends upon whether the other contracting parties make similar provision. That has not yet been arranged, but it is the subject of correspondence at the present time. This is not an appropriate time to discuss the Federal Aid Roads agreement; but I believe that it will come up for review shortly. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> may call a conference of the Commonwealth and State authorities to discuss the reconstruction of that agreement and the making of, perhaps, more adequate provision. If the matter is discussed, the result may he to benefit South Australia still further, in common with the other States. The commission recommended that the grant should be reviewed in the light of the three factors previously mentioned. Under the recommendations of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Pike, South Australia&#39;s soldier settlement debt would be decreased by an amount of &#163;804,988, and its yearly interest bill by an amount of over &#163;40,000. It must be borne in mind that that assistance is in addition to the total grant of &#163;1,000,000. </para>

                    <para class="block">This bill is one of minor importance, the purpose of it being to obtain authority to exceed the limit of expenditure on the work of constructing the Grafton to South Brisbane railway line beyond that contemplated in the 1926 act, which authorized the expenditure of &#163;4,000,000. 1 presume that it will not be necessary for me to give an historical review of this undertaking. The work was undertaken, as a result of the recommendations of the royal commission which inquired into proposals for the unification of the railway gauges throughout Australia. An agreement was entered into by the Commonwealth Government with those of New South Wales and Queensland for the construction of this railway. The work is under the control of a railway council, consisting of the Commissioner  of Railways for the Commonwealth as  chairman,  and the Chief Railways Commissioners of Queensland and New South Wales. A portion of the work was done by day labour, and the balance is being done by contractors, who are the Railways Commissioners for Queensland and New South Wales. The Chief Commissioner in New South Wales is the contractor for that section from Kyogle to the Queensland border, while die Queensland Railways Commissioner is contractor for the section from the horder to South Brisbane. Under the terms of the contract provision is made for the payment of greater than the stipulated amount to the contractors in the event of certain conditions arising which would make for increased costs. It is set out in a memorandum submitted to me by the railway council that the additional amount asked for, and the expenditure which this bill proposes to authorize, is &#163;350,000, bringing the total authorization up to &#163;4,350,000. A summary of the principal causes of increase, and the amount of the increases, is as follows: - </para>

                            <para>- The improvements in industrial conditions are responsible for an increase of &#163;164,000. Although it is not stated in the memorandum, I take it that in every case higher rates of pay have been brought about as a result of the making of new awards or the variation of old ones. Under the conditions of contract with the Governments of New South Wales and Queensland, provision was made for an adjustment for or against the contractor in the event, during the currency of the contract, of an increase or decrease in wages or a decrease or increase in hours of work as fixed by an award of the Arbitration Court or other industrial tribunal approved by the council. When the estimate of &#163;4,000,000 was prepared, a sum was included to meet improved industrial conditions, but it was thought that, generally, these conditions had reached the peak, and if there was any change during the currency of the contract it would be in .a downward direction. Instead of that, however, wages are still increasing, and industrial conditions are being improved. On the New South Wales contract section alone it was estimated by the railway council that no less than &#163;88,000 extra would have to be paid under the arrangement referred to, but it is now found that this figure will be largely exceeded, and a sum considerably beyond &#163;122,000 will be expended on this account. Also, there was a large number of land resumptions in both States, but especially in Queensland, near South Brisbane, and it must be obvious that it was practically impossible accurately to estimate what the cost of those resumptions would be. </para>

                            <para>- The railway council dealt with that aspect of the matter, and I am sure, would treat them fairly. The resumptions were  effected under the State, act dealing with the resumption of land for public purposes. The cost of surveys can only be estimated approximately. In this case there was considerable difficulty in locating the route of the railway, and the expenditure was considerably beyond that provided in the estimates. As regards the sum of &#163;190,900 for additional quantities to those provided in the schedule of quantities in the contract specification, the conditions of contract provide for payment on a quantity basis according to measurement at the rate shown in the schedule of quantities and the prices of the tender, and the total amount of the contract increased or decreased according to the actual measurements of the earthworks, brick foundations, &#38;c, required to be undertaken- The railway passes through mountainous and broken country where there is a very heavy rainfall, and on account of landslides, considerable quantities of earth works had to be undertaken beyond the estimated amount on which tenders were called. Additional bridges had to be provided on account of landslides, &#38;c, and excavations for foundations of bridges, concrete works, &#38;c, proved to be more expensive than the estimate provided for. It was also necessary to provide for watering stations, trucking facilities, &#38;c, beyond those provided for on the estimates. The works on the contract section in Queensland are just about completed, but it will be some months before the works in New South Wales are in readiness, the delay on that section being due primarily to the difficulty in getting through a very long tunnel at the border. This work took longer than was expected, despite the fact that work was proceeding simultaneously at both ends. The bridge over the Clarence river will not be completed, I believe, for some time yet. </para>

The State quotas were settled on that basis, but because some of the States which would have been contracting parties under the scheme were not willing to come in on the first stage of the work, the Commonwealth Government agreed to bear that portion of the expense which normally would fall upon Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>. - On the first item in these Estimates, which provides &#163;3,274 for alterations and additions to the ventilation and cooling plant of Parliament House, it may meet the convenience of honorable members if I say that the figures now before them have been altered in only one particular from those submitted by the Treasurer of the previous Government. That alteration is in the proposed vote for the Department of Trade and Customs. I am informed that a building for shelter is required on the waterfront atFremantle. For some reason, probably through inadvertence, no amount wasprovided for this urgent work in the Estimates prepared by the previous Treasurer. There has not been much time to revise the Estimates carefully, as honorable members will realize. I understand that the previous  Speaker  and the  President  of the Senate strongly recommended that alterations and additions to the ventilation and cooling plant of this House should be put in hand without delay. </para>

                        <para>.- All honorable members are aware that in some respects the accommodation in Parliament House is inadequate. I have found in the short time that I have occupied the position of Leader of the Opposition, that insufficient accommodation is available to enable certain officers to do their work properly. As the Prime Minister will realize, he having recently been Leader of the Opposition, the room set apart for my use is also used by the secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, who operates a typewriter in it. I feel sure that I shall have the sympathy of the Prime Minister in asking that provision be made for separate accommodation for the Secretary to the Leader of the Opposition in a conveniently situated room. It will be appreciated that this is hardly a personal matter. It frequently happens that honorable members desire to consult the Leader or  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition on important matters, and they should be able to do so in proper circumstances. I would be very grateful if the Government, probably after the matter has been considered by the House Committee, would make some improvement of the present arrangement. </para>

                        <para>. - I have every sympathy with the Leader of the Opposition on this matter. I frequently had to work in the room which he now occupies while my secretary was operating a typewriter in it. I suggest to the honorable gentleman that he should make some representations on the matter to the  Speaker.  If anything can be done without incurring great expense, the Governwill be prepared to do it. But we must bear in mind that this is not the time to incur large expenditure on this building. </para>

                    <para>The position of the Country party has been difficult, because this building was constructed, apparently, on the assumption that the Country party would always be a Ministerial party, and its rooms were grouped with the rooms on the Ministerial side. It is mutually agreed that in the present circumstances this is undesirable. The Country party has now found accommodation on the Senate side. The building was designed so that as much accommodation was provided on the Senate side as on the House of Representatives side, although the Senate has only half the number of members of this House. One result of this is that certain Ministers, who are members of the House of Representatives, have had to accept accommodation on the </para>
                    <para>Senate side because there were no rooms for them on this side. I am afraid that we cannot consider making any expensive structural alterations to the building, but it is probable that further consideration of the situation by the House Committee may make it possible to improve existing conditions. </para>

I am glad to say that during this week satisfactory provision has been made for us. This building was designed without full consideration of the possible needs of the situation. It would be wise to appoint a sub-committee of the House to make an investigation with a view to putting the available space to the best possible use in the light of an experience of its use. </para>

                    <para>It was interesting to me to hear the Treasurer remark that only one small alteration had been made in the Estimates for additions, new works, buildings, &#38;c. Yesterday, when delivering his budget speech, the honorable gentleman suggested that in other respects some very great alterations had been made in the Estimates submitted by the previous Government. He referred to certain increases that have taken place in the actual expenditure compared with the Estimates for last year; but he did not make any reference to decreases that sometimes occur. If the honorable gentleman had examined the position for the last three years he would have ascertained that while every year there had been certain increases, there had also been considerable decreases. The expenditure last year on additions, new works and buildings, was &#163;47,000 less than the Estimates, and in the previous year there was a decrease of &#163;91,000. The Treasurer&#39;s statement would have been fairer had he set the increases and decreases side by side. I do not intend on this occasion to enlarge on this aspect of the subject; I shall deal with it more fully at the appropriate time. </para>

                            <para>- It is regrettable that the decreases were not indicated. In 1928-29 actual expenditure in various items showed an increase over the Estimates of &#163;315,000, but there were decreases in other items of &#163;133,800, which made a net increase of only &#163;181,000 in a total expenditure of &#163;78,000,000, or a variation of less than&#188; per cent. It would appear, therefore, that the statement made by the Treasurer yesterday that the previous Government had grossly miscalculated the definite commitments of the departments, was not justified. I venture to suggest that the Estimates of last year, in their approximation to the actual expenditure, challenge comparison with those brought forward in any parliament in which the English tongue is spoken. In the previous year there was a decrease in the actual expenditure, compared with the Estimates, in respect of additions, new works, buildings, &#38;c, of &#163;91,000. In the ordinary votes of the department in 1928-29, &#163;38,000 less was spent than was anticipated. In 1927- 28 the difference between the actual and the estimated expenditure was less than¾ per cent. In 1928-29, the difference between the actual and estimated expenditure was less than&#188; per cent. In 1923-24, in his last budget as Treasurer of Queensland, the honorable member for Dalley underestimated his expenditure to the extent of &#163;358,000 in a budget of &#163;13,000,000, which was an increase of about 2¾ per cent., as compared with the &#188; per cent, miscalculation of which I have been accused. If I am to be charged with having grossly misjudged the financial position because of an increase in expenditure of&#188; per cent, or even¾ per cent., what language should be used to describe the miscalculation of the present Treasurer in 1923-24 to the extent of 2¾ per cent.? I suggest that, as the budget statement of the Commonwealth is sent practically all over the world,such incomplete and partisan remarks as it contains are likely to have an injurious effect upon the credit of this country. If honorable members wish to cast aspersions upon one another let it be done in debate. Damaging statements to Australia of the nature to which I have taken exception should not be incorporated in an official and widely circulated document such as the budget speech. I have received a great deal of criticism in the past from men who have had no experience as treasurers, and I have always expected such criticism; but I have found that men with treasury experience are usually most careful in attacking other treasurers, because they realize their difficulties in varying seasons in closely estimating public expenditure. I now ask whether any saving in connexion with the vote under consideration is anticipated because in previous years this has always taken place. </para>

                        <para>. - I took exception last year to the authorization of the proposed expenditure on the War Memorial at Canberra, and at the same time I claimed that no man in Australia had a higher appreciation than I had of the services of the men in whose honour the memorial was to be erected. I questioned, however, the wisdom of the expenditure of public money in placing a memorial at the foot of Mount Ainslie in honour of those who made the great sacrifice in the late war. This memorial is intended to be a reminder to the present generation and to posterity of the splendid heroism of the fallen, and of the way in. which Australia discharged its responsibilities as part of the British Empire. It is also proposed to use the building for the accommodation of war relics. In my opinion it should be erected in a place where at least a considerable number of the people of the nation could see it. It will be not only a tragedy, but a reflection on our intelligence to erect the memorial at Canberra. </para>

                            <para>- I am not upset, nor am I leg-roped. I have been accused of a desire to prevent the carrying out of this undertaking, which will provide employment for workless men. If anybody will submit a practical scheme for the purpose of relieving unemployment I shall give it my wholehearted support. I walked across to Ainslie and inspected the site of the memorial before I made my last attack regarding it; but I was not told the truth. All that I found was an outline of the foundations of the building; the trial holes had been filled in. Yet &#163;30,000 odd was supposed to have been spent in providing employment there. That was back in August. Can anybody tell me how many men have been employed on that work up to date? I desire to see the people employed, and I do not wish to be informed that we have to borrow money to enable work to be provided for them. This country was never more wealthy, the people have neverworked harder, and never has machinery for mass production been more up to date than at the present time. Yet never has Australia been in such an unfortunate position as she finds herself in to-day.I fail to see that the proposals outlined in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech will find a job for one man. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and the unemployed should now he given work. If this obligation is not discharged by the Government, I cannot go back to my constituents and face those whom I promised that work would be found for them. Honorable members opposite smile ; but if I gave them practical suggestions as to how this promise could be honored, they would probably inform me that I was an idiot. If the Government is prepared to formulate a practical scheme, so that the working people who are now unemployed may enjoy a decent Christmas, I shall say nomore. But I cannot accept the Governor-General&#39;s Speech as giving promise of the slightest relief to those who have returned the Ministry to power. Although two months or more have elapsed since a large sum of money was placed on the Estimates for the specific purpose of erecting a war memorial, how much work has been done there? Who has fallen down on the job? Who is going slow? I should be informed in no uncertain terms that so much cement and gravel has been ordered. No shipping strike is in progress, and I am not aware that the coal position affects the work. I cannot anticipate what the reply will be; but it must be more truthful than that received by me from the late Minister for Home Affairs, if I am to be satisfied. I appreciate the difficulty of Ministers through their being new to their offices; but now that the Labour party has got into power &#91; expect results. It should be prepared to do essential work, and face the consequences. Even if it made a mistake, the end would justify the means. For the men in my electorate who are living on the banks of the Torrens, in structures no better than aborigines&#39; wurlies, &#91; cannot see one ray of hope in the Governor-General&#39;s Speech. How much has been spent since August last of the money voted for the purpose of erecting r.he soldiers&#39; memorial? </para>

                        <para>.- Like the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates),</inline> I am surprised to find that uo effort has been made by the Government to carry out its election promises. From every platform we heard the cry that there would be work and more work for all if a Labour Government were given power, and no one would be unemployed, yet the present Ministry has made no attempt to do any more than was done by the previous government. No provision is made for any new works except for a sum of &#163;250 for a shelter shed at Fremantle. Ministers cannot advance the excuse that works cannot be carried out until they have been referred to the Public Works Committee, because a considerable number of works have been approved by the committee; but no provision has yet been made by the Government to provide work for the unemployed by proceeding with these works. Some time ago, the Works Committee recommended the erection of Commonwealth offices in Brisbane, where unemployment is rife, and if that work were put in hand the position there would be considerably relieved by the provision of work for the unemployed before Christmas. I understand that the erection of Commonwealth offices in Sydney has been approved by the Public Works Committee, and yet this Government has done nothing to put the work in hand. Recently a number of automatic telephone exchanges in and around Sydney and Melbourne were approved by that committee, and if this Government were sincere in its desire to provide work for the unemployed, it certainly should have gone ahead with those proposals. Unfortunately, it refuses to give relief to the unemployed, and excuses itself by saying that the Estimates that it is submitting to this Parliament are the Estimates of the late Government with the exception of one item relating to a building in Fremantle, which was accidentally omitted from the Estimates by the late Treasurer. The small sum of &#163;250 is provided for that work. The members of the Labour party told the people from every platform that if they were returned to power work would be found for the unemployed. I ask honorable&#39; members behind the Government how is it possible for the workless of Australia to subsist on promises? The Government stands condemned for its lack of action. So far it has been an &#34; all-talkie &#34; government. So far members of the Ministry have done nothing but talk, and the talk they have indulged in has been in a destructive vein. First of all they talked about destroying our defence system. Now they are talking about abolishing the Development and Migration Commission, which the previous Government established in its effort to develop this country and to find work for the unemployed by creating new development works with money borrowed at a very low rate of interest. Even the Migration Agreement, which enables us to obtain cheap money from Great Britain for developmental purposes, is likely to be interfered with. I join with the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates)</inline> in saying that the Government, even in the first days of its administration, has fallen down on its job. I had hoped that, with the advent of the Labour Government with its election, promises, works such as the repair and prevision of post offices, would be carried out in my electorate, so as to give employment to the workless there, but the Estimates disclose no proposals of that character. </para>

                        <para>. - The honorable member who has just resumed his seat would like us to believe that he is a great champion of the workers of Australia. For seven successive years his party held the reins of office, and during that period the worker&#39;s lot became worse and worse, until to-day the worker is in a more deplorable position than ever before in the history of Australia. It is true that I am not satisfied with the present position; but I quite realize that if the members of the Opposition had had a heart for the industrialists of this country our finances would not be in the awful mess that they are in to-day. The inactivity of the late Government is responsible for the unemployment that exists in the community, but that is no justification for this Government&#39;s adopting a similar attitude. Now that the Labour party is in power, as the honorable. member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates)</inline> has said, it is up to us to show by our actions that our promises to the electors were sincere. I am concerned about the north of Australia, and the people who are starving there. Whatever this Government or any other government may say about the responsibility of the States, the Commonwealth cannot shirk its responsibilities in North Australia.  I have had little time to glance through the Estimates; but I find that an item of &#163;200 is set down for the development of the mining industry in an area three times the size of New South Wales. In addition, a sura of &#163;43 is provided for the sustenance of children of destitute persons. That is surely an insult to the intelligence of our people. We find that a sum of &#163;133,414 is being paid to the big mcn who administer this country, but not one penny is being spent on reproductive works. At a later stage I shall have an opportunity to join with Other honorable members in insisting on a revision of the Estimates, so tha&#39;t Australia may be better developed. </para>

                        <para>.- When the item of the War Memorial was before this chain bar las t session and previously, I, like the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates),</inline> protested against this expenditure. I now repeat my protest, because there is a greater reason to-day for objecting to that expense than there was before. My objection is that money for this work cannot be raised spontaneously among the people and loan money has to be made available for it. Imagine any government borrowing money to provide a memorial to Australia&#39;s fallen heroes ! Such a proposal is distasteful to me. The money would be better spent on reproductive works. 1 understand that the sum already expended on this project is &#163;30,000. I have looked at the site, and I venture to say that 1 could get twenty good workmen from my electorate to do in a mouth all the work that has been done there to date. In reply to a question last session, the late Minister for Home Affairs informed the House that the expenditure on the War Memorial up to that time was &#163;16,000; yet the amount shown in the Estimate* then was &#163;30,000. I should like to know which is the correct figure. The excuse given for the abandonment of compulsory training is that a saving of &#163;150,000 will be thereby effected, but what will  be the use of a handsome war memorial erected in honour of those who fell at the last war if this country is to be at the mercy of invaders in a few years&#39; timet In such circumstances it is nothing short of folly to continue the expenditure of money on the erection of a war memorial at the present time. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.. Theodore)</inline> seems to have considered nearly every item of the Estimates submitted by the late Treasurer, but I wonder whether he has investigated &#34;this particular item. If not, I ask him to postpone it until he has done so. </para>

                            <para>- These Estimates were prepared by the late Government, and the present Government has had little or no time to revise them. Before criticizing its actions we should give it an opportunity of preparing a list of developmental works to be carried out for the relief of the unemployed. There has been much talk about money being scarce in Australia, but money does not disappear. This country is wealthy enough to find work for every inhabitant who is w illing to work.We have expended about &#163;8,000,000 in the Federal Capital Territory, which has an area of 900 square miles.Now we are told by honorable members opposite that money is not available for works in the Territory. That is an absurd statement. Why should not the banks supply the needs of the Government ? </para>

                    <para>Naturally, as a member of the late Government which was responsible for these Estimates, I am flattered that the new Government should have adopted them almost to the last shilling. Were the late Government in charge of these Estimates to-day not a member now on that side of the chamber would have failed to charge us with indifference and callousness towards the unemployed of this country. We cut these Estimates to the bone, and rightly so. In view of all the Labour party&#39;s promises of work to the workless of this country, upon which the swing of the election largely depended, it is to me a remarkable spectacle, this afternoon, to see every supporter of the Government quietly accepting these close-cut Estimates. It is a remarkable proof of the discipline which prevails upon the Government side. During the last two or three years the last Government was attacked again and again for its alleged lack of sympathy with the workers. Yet the new Government has adopted almost <inline font-style="italic">en bloc</inline> the Estimates prepared by its predecessors, and the only additional relief proposed is the offer of the Minister for Home Affairs to pay the  fares  of the unemployed in the Northern Territory to the south where, apparently, they will be dumped amongst the numerous unemployed already here. I ask the Minister for Home Affairs to let the committee know what work has been done to date in. connexion with the national war memorial. Unlike the honorable member for Darwin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bell),</inline> I am an enthusiastic supporter of that project. I am glad that the Government has allowed to remain on the Estimates the amount provided for it by the last Treasurer, and I offer to Ministers my support in any steps they may take towards the completion of the memorial. </para>

                        <para>.- We have passed beyond the stage when we can profitably discuss the desirability of establishing a national war memorial in Canberra; the Government is committed to that project. It has been debated in this chamber many times, and was the subject of a favourable report by the Public Works Committee. Therefore, it ill becomes honorable members who are now in opposition to criticize a proposal which emanated from the Government of which they were supporters. </para>

It is true that the honorable member for Darwin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bell)</inline> opposed the proposal in the last Parliament, but he knew that the. Government had sufficient numbers to carry the item if it were taken to a division. I am surprised at the nascent concern of the members of the Opposition for the unemployed. Only a couple of months ago we, who were then in opposition,  were repeatedly urging the last Ministry ro do something to relieve the unemployed. </para>

                            <para>- The Government has not had an opportunity to do so, but it has done an extraordinary amount of work during the few weeks that Ministers have been in. office. At all times I shall be prepared to criticize the Government if I see any evidence that it is going slow. But so fa.r Ministers have been working overtime in an endeavour to find means of relieving the unemployed. The Estimates now before the committee, which were prepared by the former Treasurer, show that &#163;30,113 has been already spent on the war memorial. I was a member of the Works Committee that inquired into the project, and having recently re-visited the site, I make bold to say that nothing like that amount has been spent there. Therefore, I ask the Minister for Home Affairs to explain to the committee why the Estimates of the late Treasurer show that &#163;30,113 has been already expended. The Government has not had time, in the brief period for which it has been in office, to inquire into all the projects that would help to absorb the unemployed, but one of its first duties will be to look for works of a reproductive character so that some at least of the vast army of unemployed may be provided with work. If Ministers can, during the next twelve months, minimize the existing evil of unemployment they will have done something to earn the thanks of the community; if they prove lax in this regard they will deserve the same condemnation as was. passed upon their predecessors who brought about the existing state of affairs. I make that statement frankly, because we on this side of the House were elected to do something for the relief of the unemployed. </para>

                        <para>. - In the last Parliament I supported the proposal to construct a national war memorial, and I do so again now because it will have a sentimental value that cannot be assessed in terms of money. I understand that the memorial is to cost ultimately about &#163;250,000, of which only about &#163;30,000 has been expended. But, in view of the statements made by honorable members opposite, the Government should call a halt pending an investigation of the expenditure to date. I have not inspected the site; but the statements made by honorable members who have done so suggest that something in the nature of a scandal has occurred. Foi the last fifteen years this federal city has been a sink for the people&#39;s money, and there is very little to show for the &#163;12,000,000 already spent in and. about Canberra. For that amount of money we could buy at least half a dozen cities of the size of Canberra. I estimate that, fully one-third of the money expended here has been wasted, and in no captious spirit I urge the Government to suspend expenditure in Canberra, to investigate closely the causes of previous waste, and to devise some system by which the taxpayers may get at least 17s. of value for every &#163;1 that is spent. The work so far done in connexion with the war memorial is typical of the crass stupidity shown by the authorities who have been engaged in the construction of the Federal Capital. According to the statements of ministerial supporters, practically nothing has been done for the money  already  spent on the war memorial. </para>

                            <para>- This is an extraordinary instance of the ineptitude of the administration of the Federal Capital. Although the National Parliament has been sitting in Canberra for the last two and a half years, honorable members do not know what amount has been expended on the war memorial. The former Minister for Trade and Customs says that &#163;30,000 has not been expended : other honorable members say that it has been expended, but that there is nothing to show for it. The Government would be justified in not proceeding further with the scheme until Parliament knows whether the money so far voted has been expended, &#39;what work has been done for the amount, and also whether it is worth while in the interest of the nation to incur further cost. The Government&#39; would be doing a national service if it made a thorough inquiry into this latest instance of the mismanagement and muddle that has characterized works in Canberra ever since the first foundation stone was laid in this wilderness. </para>

                    <para>In regard to unemployment, I join issue with my colleagues of the Opposition. They are unreasonable in expecting the Government, which has been in office for only one month, to do something that has never been done by any other government in the world&#39;s history. In twelve months of office the Labour Government in Great Britain has not solved the problem of unemployment; indeed, the number of unemployed has increased owing to causes over which the Government has no control. And I shall not be surprised if the Commonwealth Government discovers before it has been in office for a year that unemployment has increased in Australia also. If that does happen, Ministers will not necessarily be blameworthy, because no government can overcome, in a night, the consequences of generations of excessive borrowing. Unemployment, and all the other troubles from which Australia is suffering, have been caused primarily by the excessive borrowing in which different governments have indulged for decade after decade. It is because borrowing must cease that the Government to-day is unable to put in hand on a sufficiently large scale public works for the absorption of the unemployed. I hope it will not be contended in this Parliament that it is the duty of the Commonwealth to absorb all the unemployed; that would be impossible. During the seven years that I supported the late Government it was always argued that the absorption of the unemployed was primarily a State and not a Commonwealth function, and that the Commonwealth&#39;s inability to encroach upon the spheres of the States prevented it from putting in hand large public work3. There are some honorable members on both sides whose outlook is not purely national. They talk as though the  expenditure of a paltry &#163;30,000 on a National War Memorial would solve the problem of unemployment. Such a contention is utterly illogical and absurd. The late Government found it necessary to restrict considerably the expenditure upon works such as the River Murray Waters scheme and the North-South Railway, and the present Government will be faced with a similar necessity. Therefore, the only avenue which remains open is Canberra, and for years that has been&#39; a sink for the people&#39;s money. It is the desire of all members that no further money shall be spent in Canberra unless full value is obtained for the expenditure incurred. This question should provide; an absolute test of the business ability of the Government. Matters in connexion with the National War Memorial have obviously been completely muddled. The Minister should say that there shall be no further expenditure upon it until there is definite information as to what has been done with the money that has already been expended and a decision has been come to as to whether it is worth while to persist with the proposal. </para>

                        <para>.- 1 support the plea that the further  consideration  of this item should be deferred until every aspect of it has been reconsidered. I do not agree with the contention that because it has appeared previously on the Estimates this Government and this Parliament are necessarily bound to complete the work. It might be better to lose the &#163;16,000 which, according to a Minister in the last administration, has so far been expended, than to proceed with a proposal that will cost a very great, deal of money and will not make any keener the remembrance of the nation of the sacrifices that were made on its behalf. </para>

                    <para>I cannot see any close connexion between this item and the general question of unemployment, and I marvel at. the hardihood of the former Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett),</inline> who would impeach the present Government for not having coped in some dramatic way with the grievous position that exists throughout the Commonwealth. The economic marasmus by which this country is afflicted is largely due to the ill nurture and undernourishment from which for seven years its industries have suffered, and for which the previous Government was to a very large extent responsible. The momentum of that economic policy persists; and it cannot be arrested by some dramatic action by the Minister for Home Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Blakeley)</inline> in connexion with the construction of a war memorial, or diminished to any extent by increasing the expenditure of any department. Honorable members opposite who suggest that it is practicable for the administration to ease greatly the difficulties of those who are now out of work, ignore two important factors; first, that the previous administration left the Treasury empty; and, secondly, that the financing of the first five months of the present financial year prevented this administration from propounding a policy for the whole year, and compelled it to bridge the gap between the date of the election and the end of the financial year according to the general principles of Estimates that a previous Treasurer had already submitted to Parliament. I agree with those members on this side who would be prepared to disregard for the most part the Estimates formulated by the previous Government. So heartily was I opposed to the. policy of that Government that I should be happy to remove from the Estimates every vestige of that policy. But the wheel of Australian depression is still revolving, and the best that can be done at present is to put a brake upon it. I understand that, although Ministers are now being attacked because they are not increasing the number of employees who are engaged in activities promoted by the Government, they have suspended certain notices of dismissal which were issued by Ministers in the last administration. It appears to be characteristic of honorable members opposite to say one thing and to do another. When in power they threatened that there would be a considerable reduction in the volume of employment given by the Commonwealth to the people of Australia; yet they now attack their successors on the ground that the number of employees in the services of the Commonwealth has not been enormously increased ! There is an obvious contradiction between their attitude then and now, and I feel confident that that will be obvious to the people, and that they will not be misled by speeches such as those of the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> and the honorable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J. Francis).</inline> The recuperation of Australian industry, which would provide the remedy for unemployment will take sometime. It will not be an easy matter for industry to recover from the sickness that was brought upon it and developed by <inline font-weight="bold">&#34;Dr. Bruce&#34;</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">&#34;Dr. Gullett,&#34;</inline> because not only is industry still suffering from the general condition of ill health that characterises industries in other countries, but the extraordinary prescriptions, which my honorable friends opposite compounded for relief, only added to the. misfortune of those most intimately concerned. Still the obligation upon this Government is not in any way lessened, because of the extraordinarily grave situation which it has inherited. I feel confident that we shall have light on the subject when an opportunity has been given for that complete investigation which the honorable member for New England- <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson)</inline> regards as essential concerning the expenditure &#39; on the war memorial. A similar examination of the expenditure of several other departments is also required. This item suggests that &#163;30,000 was expended last year, whereas a former minister assures us that the expenditure was only &#163;16,000. A discrepancy of nearly 50 per cent, between the amount stated, and the actual expenditure is so extraordinary that it makes one wonder to what extent reliance can be placed upon the Estimates generally prepared by the former Treasurer. </para>

                            <para>- We ought to have more information about the proposed vote. If the work on the site represents an expenditure of &#163;20,000, and if we are asked now to vote another &#163;30,000 this year, with the possibility that the total expenditure may be &#163;50,000, including the unexpended balance of &#163;20,000 from last year&#39;s vote, it appears to me that control of the public purse by this committee has become extremely difficult. I object to the manner in which the item has been presented. It is impossible for honorable members to understand the transaction, and I protest against the perplexities with which we are confronted when we are endeavouring to unravel the financial administration of the Commonwealth. This, I suggest, is a matter of the first importance to the people. If, because of the manner in which the finances are presented, honorable members are unable to ascertain what is being done with the revenues of the Commonwealth, how can there be an effective check by this Parliament on the administration? I hope that iti view of what has been said, the Minister will withdraw the item for the present, unless he is in a position to make a statement clearly setting out the position with regard to expenditure on the memorial. We should not pass the item until the situation has been explained. </para>

                        <para>. - It is somewhat amusing to hear honorable members opposite entreating the Government to do something for the unemployed. This Government has been in office just one month and the Treasurer, in his financial statement, has informed- the people of the position of the finances when we took over control. The Nationalist administration was in office for thirteen years, and honorable members opposite expect this Government to clear up, in one month, all the financial and other difficulties that were bequeathed to us. Without being unduly optimistic, I am confident that, as the result&#34; of Labour government, the people of the Commonwealth will be more prosperous in six months than they have been in the thirteen years of Nationalist administration. </para>

                            <para>- The Leader of the Opposition and his party had thirteen years of office and they left the affairs of this country in a scandalous condition. We cannot be expected immediately to straighten out the difficulties. Any government taken from the electorates could have administered the affairs of the Commonwealth infinitely better than our friends on the Opposition benches did during their long term in office. Throughout Australia there are monuments to their incompetence and wanton wastefulness. </para>

                    <para>It will take time to clear up these matters, but this Government is determined to do so, and to give some hope to the unfortunate persons who are unemployed in Australia. With regard to the subject before the Chair, the Australian War Memorial at Canberra is estimated to cost &#163;270,000. Accessory services estimated to cost &#163;99,000 increase the cost to &#163;369,000, while further accessory services chargeable to commission amount to &#163;43,000, making a grand total cost of &#163;412,000. A sum of &#163;20,000 has been put into a trust fund for expenditure on the war memorial. This sum is still usable, but is definitely allocated for the purposes of the war memorial. An amount of &#163;5,000 has been advanced to the Federal Capital Commission, an architectural competition involved an  expendi- ture of &#163;2,582, while architects&#39; fees amounted to &#163;2,401. Miscellaneous expenditure added a further &#163;130, making a total of &#163;30,113. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member to whom the answer was given says not. The financial position of Australia has been outlined by the Treasurer, and honorable members can appre ciate from that statement that the position is particularly bad. The Government is confronted with the question whether it can go on with the construction of the National War Memorial at the present time, and has come to the conclusion that it is impossible to find the necessary money to proceed immediately with the work. Therefore, expenditure on this work will have to be postponed for the time being. </para>

In view of the great importance of this matter to every honorable member of the House, I am anxious to know what the intentions of the Prime Minister are regarding it. </para>

                    <para>. - I desire to bring under the notice of the Minister for Markets and Transport a news bulletin that has been circulated among honorable members this afternoon. It is a type-written documentof a kind which has frequently been sent round to honorable members, and now that, the Government is seeking for means of effecting economies, will he institute inquiries as to the circulation and usefulness of such publications with a view to determining whether the issue of them might not properly be discontinued? In my opinion the only valuable form of publicity for marketing purposes is printed matter disseminated among those engaged in the industry concerned. The class of publicity represented by this document is, in my opinion, practically valueless. The subjects embraced in this document include the statement that the Canadian Government provides seedcleaning plants and news about silage temperatures, peanut production, America&#39;s farm relief measures, liver-rot diseases in sheep, Australia&#39;s export of sandalwood, killing whales by electricity, and Great Britain&#39;s wine exports. Perhaps the Minister can give the House some information on the matter. </para>

I agree with the honorable member that this bulletin contains some information that is not likely to be of much use to Australian producers; but, on the other hand, there is a good deal in it that has proved beneficial to them. During the short time I have been in office I have made an effort to increase its usefulness. I understand that it is despatched to honorable members, and also to the principal newspaper proprietors of Australia, who have intimated from time to time that its contents are of value to sections of their readers. </para>
