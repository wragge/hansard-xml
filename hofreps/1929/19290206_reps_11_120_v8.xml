        <para class="block">To those who have previously been members of this House no words of mine are needed to commend the honorable member to them. To those who have recently entered this Parliament I would say that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom has been a member of the Federal Parliament since the inception of federation, and has given some of the best years of his life to the service of this country. He has held many high and responsible public positions, and has earned the respect and esteem of us all for his ability, his untiring energy, and his lofty ideals. Not very long ago lie represented the Commonwealth Government with distinction at the conference of the League of Nations at Geneva. As  Speaker  in the last Parliament, he commended himself to honorable members by his knowledge of parliamentary practice and procedure and his intimate acquaintance with the Standing Orders of this House. I understand that the Standing Orders Committee may, during this session, be engaged in the revision of the Standing Orders, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom who, as  Speaker,  would be <inline font-style="italic">ex officio</inline><inline font-weight="bold">chairman</inline> of the committee, would be in a position to render yeoman service in that capacity. In the last Parliament he was, as  Speaker,  the  Chairman  of the Library Committee and controlled the transfer of the library from Melbourne in a most satisfactory manner during that very difficult time. I have much pleasure in submitting the motion. </para>

Our procedure is largely governed by <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> which contains precedents taking us back to past centuries; but the rules of debate in this Parliament should be brought up to date ; we should not be governed by rules and standing orders many years old, and of another parliament. </para>

        <para>It is difficult for me to find language strong enough to express the loathing and contempt which I feel for one of our Arbitration Court judges; I allude to Judge Lukin. Old man as I am, I hope to see the day when the referendum, the initiative, and recall shall have become part of our parliamentary institutions. The people of Australia will then be in a position to prevent the operation of such an abominable and infernal law as that passed in this Parliament last session in relation to the waterside workers. If this Parliament will not pass an amending measure such as I consider necessary, I shall appeal to the people outside this chamber. The galleries to-day are filled with citizens of the Commonwealth, and I urge them not to vote on future occasions for any man unless he undertakes unequivocably to give them complete legislative control by means of the referendum, initiative and recall. </para>

          <para>.- As you have merely pointed to me, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parkes,</inline> without giving me my name, am I to take it that you do not now know me ? I have been acquainted with you for a long time, and have always treated you with courtesy. At times, too, in the chamber and in the lobbies, you have condescended to notice me. I have been a member of this House so long that it should be unnecessary for you to have to indicate me in the way in which you have done. I can understand that you may have felt under some difficulty, for lack of knowledge of their antecedents, concerning the honorable members at whom you had already pointed your finger, as if in scorn. For your information, therefore, I say that the mover of the motion was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bowden,</inline> who represents the division of Parramatta, a learned and distinguished lawyer who was formerly a member of the Government, but lost his job for reasons essentially connected with the welfare of the Commonwealth and the Empire. The honorable member at whom you next pointed your finger was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Prowse.</inline> He represents an electoral division in Western Australia. If you do not know him let me introduce him to you as a fairly decent person. Who I am I shall tell you later. </para>

I knew the father of the honorable member for Darling as plain <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Groom.</inline> Littleton with Groom gave aristocratic distinction, which was increased by the bestowal of the title <inline font-weight="bold">Sir.

        <para class="block">Those words, I remind honorable members, refer not to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> but to me. My imperial sentiments are sound. I understand, as the right honorable gentleman does, how much the safety of the Empire depends upon having as  Speaker  one who will uphold the traditions of the Empire, and give fair decisions - except when the fate of the Empire, or the party to which he belongs, demands otherwise. The Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> goes on to say - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The question of the integrity of Empire is paramount. This question must arise when the appointment of  Speaker  for the new Parliament takes place. The person who is appointed to the exalted position must be a man whose loyalty to Empire is beyond doubt. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom has been suggested. Left to himself <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom is a mild, moderate safe man; but he must be judged by the company he keeps. </para>

          <para>Hia association with men who accept red money for Australian wool to the detriment of the Empire and his association with a political party which permits red agents to enter our country to buy our wool in competition with the Empire is not only a grave reflection upon our patriotism, but is a matter for severe censure. So for <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> has not made one word of protest or repudiated his evil associates. Until he does he is a proper subject of patriotic suspicion, and upon him the dignity of  Speaker  cannot be safely conferred. </para>

        <para class="block">I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom, when he accepts the honour which this House will unanimously bestow upon him, to do something in the way of repudiation of the Red Menace, which others have been called upon to do. </para>
        <para>I notice that the Prime Minister did not sponsor the motion before the House. Is there anything between <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom and the Prime Minister to account for that? Let me read what the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> once said about the Prime Minister - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>There was once a Premier of New South Wales who had a subject for eloquence to which he could turn in each and every embarrassment. When he was met with a particularly awkward question of local interest he began to denounce the Commonwealth Government and point to the grievous injustice suffered by Sydney. Thus he hoped to stifle all other grievances and bring the malcontents into cordial agreement. When placed in a similar position a more recent type of politician produces a flag and calls for three cheers for the Empire. To his not wholly disinterested view, enthusiasm for what he is sometimes pleased to call the "eeeempiah" excuses every political delinquency and answers all arguments. </para>

        <para class="block">Because I do not make frequent use of the word " Empire " I have been accused by the Prime Minister of not being sufficiently loyal to this country. I am prepared to support the motion, because I believe that in spite of everything that has been said against the Honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom by his associates, he will carry out his duties to the best of his ability. I ask him when in the chair to keep one eye on other honorable members, and one eye on me. Despite what my enemies have said about me, I am a believer in the Empire; but, unlike this coalition Government, I do not believe that we can solve all our difficulties merely by the frequent mention of the word "Empire". This Government is led by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. The Treasurer calls it the Bruce-Page Government, and the Prime Minister refers to it as "My Government".

        <para class="block">The Prime Minister has made the Public Service Commission a thing of clay that can be moulded to his hand. When he wished to have Julian Simpson placed in the Public Service, he violated all rules, regulations, and principles of the Service to put him there over the heads of thousands. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Simpson</inline> left the Public Service to uphold the cause of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> and the Empire against the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. West).</inline> The Public Service Commissioners, when appointed, were supposed to be free from political influence. But the Prime Minister has made the commission his creature. He said to the Commissioners, "Put Simpson back in the Public Service." <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Skewes,</inline> trembling before the Prime Minister, asked, "Yes, but what position shall I give him and what salary?" The Prime Minister replied, " Give him the job that he had before and the same salary." That was done in defiance of the rules of the Public Service and of every code of honour, decency and loyalty. When any objection is made to this kind of thing, the person objecting is accused of disloyalty and failure to support his country. The Prime Minister waves the flag and says, " Three cheers for the Empire," vainly imagining that to be a sufficient answer to criticism.

The honorable member for Parkes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Marr),</inline> who some say is the Prime Minister's left hand, has been overlooked. He has been left hanging in the air. Other Ministers have been dropped. But to all critics the Prime Minister replies, " You do not love your Empire." The Prime Minister is supposed to be Australia's greatest statesman and the upholder of the honour of this country. This is the man who claims to understand the psychology of the working class. During the election campaign the Prime Minister decided that something had to be done to gain votes, so it was arranged that a man had to be put out at every meeting. When the poor old lady in the green bonnet appeared the Prime Minister would say, " Ah, there she is again." That poor woman could change her dress and wear any colour, blue, green or yellow, but her bonnet had to be green, so that the Prime Minister could, at every meeting, pointing his finger at her, say, " There is that woman in the green bonnet."

          <para>Amongst decent citizens there are certain things that can be taken for granted. The challenges on the score of Empire so often issued in Parliament and on the platform create the assumption that in this country there is a considerable section of people who are anxious to break the imperial connexions - that there is an immediate danger of this section becoming a majority and gaining the power to fulfil its dastardly intentions. Were that idea to get abroad, can anybody imagine anything more mischievous to Australia or more prejudicial to the very interests of the Empire about which this voluble imperialist is jealous. The assumption is false. Of all the communities within the Empire, Australia, with its 97 per cent. of British stock, is the most British. Were every Dominion and dependency under the Crown as sound in its allegiance as is the Commonwealth, it would be folly to speak of danger  . . Putting aside the cant of imperialism and anti-imperialism can they not think the thoughts of Australia. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anstey</inline>had a strenuous day yesterday. He commenced at Pascoe Vale at 10.30 in a dark brown suit, dark brown hat, tie to match. Before arrival at Merlyston he retired behind a pillar box, disrobed, and in three minutes emerged in a blue suit, blue felt hat, tie to match. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anstey</inline> then caught the Brunswick-Coburg express. On the way he disrobed behind a newspaper and emerged in a grey suit, grey felt hat, grey top boots, soft grey shirt, tie to match. The majority of passengers who landed at Albion were tired, dusty and perspiring. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anstey</inline> landed calm, cool and composed. It is this ready adaptability to every change of climate or of circumstance which distinguishes this honorable gentleman from the common herd. </para>

        <para class="block">This boosting of my clothes was not vanity. It was done to divert public attention from matters of public policy. One might think this a description of the proceedings of the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> not of myself ; but it is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anstey</inline> who was always perfectly groomed, perfectly polished, perfectly mannered, a perfect figure against a perfect background. Now you know me. Here is the end of a perfect day -a strenuous day, yet not too strenuous for such a perfect man under such perfect conditions. Attention has been directed to my clothes to distract public attention from public matters of importance. In my speeches I have stated that we must have loyalty to the Throne, to the King and to the Empire. We must have co-operation, co-ordination, and collaboration without which we cannot help to solve the threefold problems of men, money and markets. In addition to that we must have love of the King and of Empire. </para>

            <para>- That, too, is essential. This glorious Empire must be maintained and the different portions of the Empire must work side by side in perfect harmony. In the cultured tones in which the Prime Minister said of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> " He is an honorable man but he keeps dishonorable company," I should like to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom, "Are you loyal? Have you made your threefold genuflexions before the altar of the Empire?". I have not noticed it. Before you are elected to the speakership, we should have some exhibition of your loyalty. We want to know where you stand in connexion with the Reds. Are you going to be associated with the Reds, who are spending five millions of Russian money in purchasing Queensland wool? If you are, you should not occupy the position to which you are about to be elected. I said at Stanthorpe, where I met those who are conversant with the problems facing us, that we have to explain that problems have their angles and that we must educate the people concerning all these angles, and when these are understood the problems will be settled. That is what I, as a statesman, told the people. I am a man of vision and wisdom. I am not an ordinary tripy politician. At Bendigo I said that the Leader of the Opposition would not say one word against the Empire, and that he who did not love his Empire was a wretched, dishonorable scoundrel. I then went to Eaglehawk and said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> would not say a word about the Empire. He was afraid; he was a coward and would not denounce the Reds. I went to Kyneton and said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> had no courage, as he would not fight these Communist wretches. He was not doing what the Prime Minister would not do. All the right honorable gentleman did was to talk against them and then subsidize them under the lap. At Colac, I said he was a coward, a cur and afraid to do anything. At Colac, I said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> was a very honorable man but for the company he kept, and I would say it now but the elections are over, and I do not want too much criticism to be brought against me. We know the old assumption was that people who are poor must also be dishonorable. I would not say that when charges were made against me. I would say, "What an absurdity to charge me with being associated with anything that is wrong." I have so much money that there is no need for me to do anything dishonest - just like the Abraham brothers. I am a polite gentleman, a polished gentleman; but I say of others "You are ignorant, you are crude, you display too much pretence, you get down into the gutter. You are a political profligate; a man of low moral calibre." We are told that Labour is not trustworthy, that it is not represented by men of the right calibre, that its activities are inspired by Moscow and that it is infected with the virus of Communism. As a statesman and as an upright, honorable man, I now ask those of whom I have said they were the enemies of their country to get together and endeavour to secure peace in industry. You might think therefore that I was a liar before the elections, but no, I was only adapting myself to the circumstances of the hour. Certain persons were evil and malign creatures before the election; they were honorable men afterwards. </para>

            <para>- I might be dead tomorrow, and I would not then have the opportunity. I am pleased that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom is about to be appointed  Speaker.  I believe that he will discharge his duties with fairness. I presume that when elected <inline font-style="italic">he</inline> will regard himself, not as the custodian of the rights of one side only, but know no party, that he will apply the law and will hold the scales of justice fairly. </para>

        <para>I take it that when he sits in the Speaker's chair, and listens to men who lie to the discredit of the country, he will regard it as his duty to tell them that they are doing so. I hope that when he hears members say that the Government sold the Commonwealth Woollen Mills for the country's good, he will remind them that that same Government is now buying the products of those mills at prices from  25  per cent, to  40  per cent, higher than they paid previously. Referring to the Peace in Industry Conference, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> said that there was an idea among the workmen that the employers were getting too much, and the workmen too little. Let <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom remind the Prime Minister that he also said: "I want to be fair; I do not wish to express an opinion one way or another; I merely wish to say that, in my opinion, the workers are getting a fair deal." Apparently all this getting-together business was merely for the purpose of explaining to the workmen that they .were already receiving enough. </para>
        <para>I also hope that when honorable members speak in this House about the malcontents in the coal-mining industry, and the go-slow policy of the workers, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom will remind them that the miners are paid only for what they produce. I hope that he will point out also that in the centre of the Empire itself there are more than  300,000  miners practically starving, and living under conditions so horrible that even the Prince of Wales was horror stricken at the sight of them. I hope that he will point out to honorable members that, many of the miners are working  16  hours a day in an endeavour to keep body and soul together; that they are producing coal which is imported into this country at one-third of the freight rates charged on ordinary cargo, thus lowering the standard of living in Australia. I hope that the  Speaker  will make it clear that the Government, by its appointments to the </para>
        <para class="block">Arbitration Court, is seeking to degrade the workers in Australia, and to drag them down to the same low level at which the miners are struggling in England; that he will point out that the employers in England sought, by reducing their workers to a condition of semi-starvation, to reconquer the markets of the world, but that they were unable to do so. </para>
        <para>I believe that the party which sits on this side of the chamber will abide loyally by the decisions of the Chair even though these may be against them, and that they will support him in every way they can. </para>
        <para>Members of the House then unanimously calling <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom to the chair, he was taken out of his place by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bowden</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Prowse</inline> and conducted to the chair. </para>
        <para>Then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. SPEAKER-ELECT,</inline> standing on the upper step, said - I thank honorable members for the honour which they have conferred upon me. It will be my endeavour in the future, as it has been in the past, to administer my office with impartiality, and to preserve the rights, privileges and dignity of Parliament. </para>

          <para>-  In thanking the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition for their congratulations upon my re-election to the high office of Speaker, I accept most readily their assurances that they will assist me in carrying out the practice, procedure, and the rules of the House, and in maintaining its dignity. In the past that assistance has been given to me not only by the leaders, but by all members of the chamber, and without such willing assistance the difficulties of the position would be exceedingly great. I realize that the office of Speaker is the highest gift that honorable members of this House have at their disposal. It is an office which is distinctly judicial in character, and as such must be administered with impartiality. It is impossible, of course, for any human being to be perfect - one can but strive to do his best - but I assure honorable members that it will be my earnest endeavour to preserve the best traditions of this House. I believe that this Parliament compares favorably with any other in the Empire in the manner in which it conducts its business, and so long as the people of this country can take a pride in their Parliament, which is the organ for the supreme expression of the opinion of the nation, they need not fear. </para>

          <para>. -  Subsequent to the dissolution of the last Parliament, the people of Australia learned with much concern of the serious illness of His Majesty the King. Throughout the Empire and, indeed, the world, his condition evoked the deepest sympathy and anxiety, and was for many weeks so serious that his life was almost despaired of. I think, therefore, that on this the first day of the meeting of a new Parliament, it will be the wish of every honorable member to express, on behalf of the people of Australia, our sympathy with His Majesty and with  Her  Majesty the Queen and the members of the Royal Family; our sincere gratification at the improvement which has been noted in the condition of His Majesty during the last few weeks, and our profound hope, as loyal citizens of the Empire, that he may be fully restored to health in the near future.

          <para>.-I also desire to express my sorrow at the illness of  His  Majesty the King, and my hope that he may speedily recover. I wish, also, to extend my sympathy to  Her  Majesty the Queen. It seems to me, however, that the terms of the motion submitted by the Prime Minister do not go far enough. I should like to add to it an expression of the gratification of the House at the courage of  His  Royal Highness the Prince of Wales in visiting the people of the poverty-stricken coal areas of Northumberland and Durham; and of its regret at the sorrow and misery, want, desolation and death from starvation of British subjects in those areas with which  His  Royal Highness the Prince of Wales was confronted. May I move to add words to the motion which would do this? </para>

        <para class="block">Although some years have elapsed since the late right honorable gentleman was actively identified with public life, no member of this House is unaware, and indeed very few people in Australia, are without knowledge of his distinguished career and of the monumental service which he rendered to the Commonwealth. He arrived in Australia in  1885  and settled in Queensland. Eight years later he entered the Parliament of that State, and in  1899  became a Minister of the Crown in a Queensland administration. He was elected a member of the first Federal Parliament in  1901,  and represented the constituency of Wide Bay continuously until his retirement from Federal politics in  1915.  He was Minister for Trade and Customs in the Watson administration, Prime Minister and Treasurer from November,  1908,  to June,  1909,  from April,  1910,  to June,  1913,  and from September,  1914,  to October,  1915.  As Prime Minister he represented the Commonwealth at the opening of the Union Parliament of South Africa in  1910,  and attended the Imperial Conference in  1911,  and in that year was made a privy councillor by His Majesty the King. The conference of  1911,  as honorable members will recall, largely concerned itself with Empire defence, and as the representative of Australia at that gathering, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> played a very important part. The supreme value of the work done by the conference was realized when the Empire was plunged into the cataclysm of the world's war in  1914.  As Prime Minister of the Commonwealth at the outbreak of the war, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> proved himself to be a true statesman, fully alive to the responsibilities of his high office. All honorable members will recall the great service which he rendered to the Empire in the early days of the war by his wholehearted support of the cause of the allies.  His  attitude was embodied in, and he will be long remembered for, his notable utterance that Australia was in the war to the last man and the last shilling. </para>
        <para>The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> resigned his seat in this Parliament in  1915  to assume the office of High Commissioner for Australia in London, a position which he held until  1921.  During that time, and especially in the later days of the war, he rendered great service to this country. But whilst he was a great Prime Minister, I think he will be better remembered for the man he was, for the ideals which he upheld, and for his fervent patriotism and love of this, his adopted country. He was a man of great and wide sympathies, lofty ideals, great dignity, and a most striking personality. I think that everybody in Australia, irrespective of political belief, recognizes the great service that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> rendered to this country, and would desire that I should publicly express regret at his death. He has left behind him a name that will be honored throughout our history. To <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Fisher</inline> and the members of her family, honorable members, I am sure, offer their sincerest sympathy. </para>

          <para>.-I second the motion of the Prime Minister, and desire to express my regret, and I believe the regret of every honorable member of this House, at the death of one of the greatest men that ever rose to a public position in Australia. I can recall my early entry to the Federal Parliament at the time <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> became Prime Minister of Australia. The admiration that I then conceived for him as a great man grew with the knowledge that I subsequently gained of him. I think probably that the most striking illustration I can recall of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher's</inline> career and capabilities was a cartoon that appeared in the press on the day he became Prime Minister of Australia. That cartoon depicted a figure representing Australia speaking down the mouth of a mine and calling to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> "Andy, come up, your country wants you." That was an incident in the wonderful career of a great man who came to Australia from Scotland, and started to win his way in Queensland. He worked in the bowels of the earth in coal and gold mines, entered the public life of both State and Commonwealth, and was raised to the highest position that a public man can achieve. In those memorable years when he ruled the destinies of Australia, he laid foundations upon which we have built to some extent. In those foundations he left monuments of work which has helped this country in many a dark hour. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>That is a short history of the life of this man. Those who were privileged to know him are aware that his personality was lovable in the extreme. He had a deep affection for what was good and those who were good, but a strong detestation for what he believed to be wrong. I well remember, how when we sat in Melbourne, the chamber would resound with his denunciation, spoken with a rich Scottish accent, of the things which he believed to be wrong, and of the wrongs which he wanted to be righted in the interests of the people of Australia. He aroused hostility amongst many, but he never lost the respect of any person whose opinion was worth having. I have received word that there is to be erected in the heart of the Empire a monument to his memory, because of the great services that he rendered to the British family of nations. I cannot help remembering that when he was Prime Minister of Australia, and returning from a memorable mission abroad, from a thousand platforms and by hundreds of newspapers he was denounced as one who would smash the Empire, as one who was against the Empire, and would cut the painter, to separate Australia from the rest of the British nation. But he lived down such abuse and went on his way unconcerned. He hardly paused to refute those slanders, and, for his life's work as a citizen of Australia and a member of the British Empire, we are proud of him and revere his memory. I join with the Prime Minister in expressing our deepest sympathy with <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Fisher</inline> and her family in the loss of a good father and husband and a great Australian. </para>

          <para>. - I join with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in paying a tribute to the memory of a man whose name will live in the history of this country. He was for very many years my colleague and my friend. Of the work that he did for Australia there is no need to speak now. The Leader of the Opposition has well epitomized his character. He was above all a man of the people. He understood, if any man did, the feelings of the people of Australia. He saw life from their angle, he voiced their aspirations, he fought their battles. He led them firmly and unfalteringly along the path that he conceived they should tread. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Of what he did as a builder of the Empire I let others Speak; what he did for Australia speaks for itself. For many years he laboured diligently to advance its interests. He did great things. In the first place, he helped to build up an Australian democracy. No one did more for the Australian Labour movement than Andrew Fisher; no man led it more successfully. He was the very incarnation of the ideals of Labour. He was a man at whom no one could cast a stone; his character was unsmirched by the faintest breath of suspicion. He was not a brilliant, but rather a sterling and honorable man. He was incapable of intrigue, and was loyal to his friends, party, and country. The Leader of the Opposition said something about what Andrew Fisher did for Australia, and the Prime Minister has spoken of what he did at the 1911 Conference. He did two things that stand out. He established the Commonwealth Bank, without which, in my opinion, it would have been impossible for us to finance the war. It was the lead which that bank gave to the other financial institutions that enabled us to do what many of the financial experts of this country thought to be impossible. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> led the movement for an Australian Navy. Those are two great monuments to his memory. What monument it is intended to erect in the heart of the Empire I do not know, but these two will endure for generations. On the foundation stone of the Commonwealth Bank is inscribed the name of Andrew Fisher; but it is inscribed still more indelibly in the hearts of the people. </para>
        <para>This occasion affords us an opportunity of reminding a later generation of what manner of man he was and the work he did for democracy, for Australia, and for the Empire. </para>
        <para>I was his colleague for very many years; "my associations with him were intimate. I have never had a more loyal colleague nor a more faithful friend. We disagreed on occasions, for he was a man who formed strong opinions, which he held with tremendous tenacity ; but in all the years we never had a cross word. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that Andrew Fisher never lost the respect of any man whose respect was worth having. He never had a personal enemy. Men differed from him, but they never ceased to respect him and to regard him as a friend. </para>
        <para>He was a very manly man; his ideals were lofty; his ideas broad. He was incapable of stooping to mean things, and he was above everything petty. </para>
        <para>Now he has gone, and <inline font-style="italic">we</inline> are left to carry on the work to which he devoted his life. He leaves a widow and family. How they are circumstanced I do not know. Andrew Fisher did great things for Australia, and I would suggest to this Parliament and to the Prime Minister that the responsibility rests upon us to see that his widow and family are placed in circumstances worthy of the man we honour to-day and of the country he served so faithfully and so well. </para>

          <para>.- As one who acted as his Whip when the late Honorable Andrew Fisher was Prime Minister of this country and, consequently, one of his most trusted colleagues, I should like to associate myself with all that has been said regarding his character and career. I shall not recapitulate those things which the deceased gentleman did for Australia and for the Empire generally, as they are too well known. I shall content myself with saying that of all the men that I have ever known in the political life of this country I do not think that there is one who understood human nature better than the late Andrew Fisher, nor was there one who had a more profound trust in his colleagues and in the Parliament generally. He was a man possessing firm convictions as to what was right and wrong and he was, as the right honorable member for North Sydney said, a good man. Perhaps he was not a brilliant orator, but he was firm of purpose, of a kindly nature and trustful of every one until he found him to be wrong. I join with those who have eulogized his work and, with the right honorable member for North. Sydney, I trust that the Prime Minister will cause some inquiry to be made concerning the circumstances of his widow and family, because I do not think this nation should allow the widow and children of any Prime Minister or responsible member of this House, whether resident in Great Britain or in Australia, to live in a state of poverty. </para>

          <para>.- If it is true that the widow and family of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Andrew</inline> Fisher are in need, I am sure the House will unanimously agree to make some provision so that the rest of their lives may be spent iri comfort. We very often say kind words of the dead, and, perhaps, to return in spirit and hear kind words said that were never heard during one's life is. one of the pleasures and consolations of being deceased. Yet I remember many years ago the honorable member for Ballarat and myself hearing a conversation in the gardens of Parliament House, when a certain gentleman, speaking of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher,</inline> said: "What can one do with him? Of course, he is honest, sincere and upright, but his brain is of the smallest, and his conceit immense." He did great work for his party. An outstanding characteristic was a grave and dignified appearance, which is a great asset. I should like to possess it myself. He had honesty of purpose; I would like that, too. I can admire in others what I do not possess myself, as I do when I look upon the gentlemen who sit upon the Government benches. They have assets which I do not possess. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I have before me a few notes to remind me of the difficulties against which the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> and the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> had to fight. It has been said that he was an honest and upright man, with clear and definite principles, who worked for the good of the country, which time has verified; but others have said of him, as of the right honorable member  for  North  Sydney, that he "waa a tergiversator;  was a mountebank; a teetotum, a thing spun upon the fingers of the caucus. Of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> it was said that, "If he be as honest as his followers believe, it is clear that he is a very crude and a very ignorant man, who without knowing it promises things impossible of performance." But the things he performed were of great value to this country. The right honorable member for North Sydney has already referred to what he did in connexion with the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank. That is only one of his achievements. </para>
        <para>In 1910, when the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> was in office, one great newspaper said: " On three points - the proposed land tax, note issue, and banking scheme - the Labour party stands condemned in the mind of every reasonable thinking man." Yet it was these things that were established and which are at this hour monuments of his great work in this country. They have stood through all the years, and even our political opponents have not dared to interfere with them. It is true, as the right honorable member for North Sydney has said with regard to the Commonwealth Bank and the note issue, that this country was the only part of the English speaking world that was able to keep its banking institutions open at the outbreak of war. The Commonwealth Bank was the only financial institution in Australia that did not close its doors. Even the Bank of England closed its doors in order that it might make the necessary financial arrangements to prepare the way in a great national crisis, and bring into existence a national note issue which this party had established years before for the purpose of peaceful production, and not for destruction. It was said at the time that the Labour party leaders were weak, pusillanimous men; that they were the victims of foreign doctrines. That is not a quotation of the honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> speaking to-day. It was also said that the Labour party leaders were the political jumping jacks of revolutionary wire pullers in the background. At the same time it was said that, if the Labour party won at the elections, religion and home life would be destroyed, marriage defiled, the country left defenceless, industries ruined, and iniquity and depravity would prevail. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> said in 1910- "If the Labour party succeeds under Andrew Fisher, then God help Australia! All I ask for is time to get out of it." Yet the Labour party won that election, and the policy which we put into effect contained measures which have since remained impregnable. The party remained three years in office, and then attacks were made on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> on the ground that he was crude and ignorant, and unfit to represent this country as Prime Minister. It was stated that Labour, in its term of office, had abused every democratic principle. To-day the same persons say that Labour, in 1913, was an honest and decent party. One might think that they were talking about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce.</inline> On May 26th, 1913, it was stated - </para>

No matter what a man's party may have been, so long as he has served his country according to his lights, we should see that those who were dependent upon him are looked after just as if they were the dependants of a civil servant. They are entitled to such treatment. Andrew Fisher has gone; God rest his soul.  His  vices and his virtues will soon be forgotten; but the work which he did will remain long after he himself has ceased to be remembered. </para>

          <para>.- One of the most loving friendships I have ever had in my life was that which existed between Andrew Fisher and myself. He was all that those who have praised him have said of him. One thing particularly will stand to his honour. Every old-age pensioner in Australia will remember that the pensioners' home was secured to him by Andrew Fisher, not by a direct act, but by regulations for which he was responsible. The present Government is now allowing those old-age pensioners to be embarrassed by having to answer a series of 68 questions, reminiscent of the old workhouse system in England. I trust that the Government will abolish this practice. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Australia gives most of the credit for the establishment of the Commonwealth Bank to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> O'Malley, and rightly so, also credit belongs to the caucus of the party and to members of the Labour party outside, who made it a part of the platform, on the motion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> O'Malley. Had it not been for that support, the institution would never have been established. It took some time and much argument to persuade Andrew Fisher to see the need for the bank, but once he was seised of the fact that the Commonwealth Bank was necessary, and that the establishment of a single note issue department for the whole of Australia would be for the benefit of the country, he was unflinching in his determination to carry the measures into effect. I know that if the spirit of Andrew Fisher were here he would like me to apportion the praise for this work to the proper quarter. </para>
        <para>The time for calling names has gone, I hope, for ever. I hope that honorable members on both sides will give credit wherever they find it for honesty of purpose and sincerity in the advocacy of a great cause. It would be better if we could give greater praise to men when they are living, instead of praising them when they are dead. I am convinced that members of both sides of the House desire to see the family of Andrew Fisher properly provided for. If they are in want, let something be done to help them. I should be pleased to contribute a month's salary for such a purpose, and I am sure there are many others who would do the same. If, however, he left behind him a competence for his family, Parliament will be relieved of obligation. I have pleasure in seconding every kind thought expressed regarding my beloved friend Andrew Fisher. </para>

          <para>That this House places on record its profound regret at the death of the Honorable Henry Bournes Higgins, late Justice of the High Court of Australia, and places on record its appreciation of the notable services rendered by him, and tenders its deep sympathy to his widow in her bereavement. </para>

        <para class="block">The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins was associated with the early efforts to bring about the federation of the Australian colonies, and was a member of the Federal Convention of 1898. He played a considerable part in the drafting of the Commonwealth Constitution, which is recognized as one of the greatest instruments of government yet known. He was a member of the Parliament of Victoria, and, later, of the first and second Parliaments of the Commonwealth, holding the portfolio of Attorney-General in 1904 in the first Labor Government. In 1906 he retired from Parliament upon his appointment as a Justice of the High Court of Australia. He held that high office until his death at the end of last year. During a considerable part of the time for which he occupied a seat on the High Court Bench he acted as  President  of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, and I believe that by his work as  President  of that Court his name will be best remembered. He brought to the discharge of his duties a real sincerity, and an enthusiasm for the task which he had undertaken which, with his marked ability, enabled him to become one of the greatest authorities in the world upon the very difficult and complicated problems associated with compulsory industrial arbitration.  His  death will be mourned by the people of Australia, who had the greatest admiration for him because of his sincerity of purpose and his great devotion to his public duties. On behalf of all the members of the House, 1 express deep sympathy with his widow in her great bereavement. </para>

          <para>.-I joh, with the Prime Minister in expressing our deep regret at the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins.  His  Honor played many important parts in the life of Australia and invariably displayed, not only great ability, but great courage. I can remember many instances in his life, which I shall not now recall in detail, when it would have been much easier and pleasanter for him to follow the current of public opinion than to battle against it, but he always took the course his conscience dictated, irrespective of the consequences. Because of this, he has left behind him a name which the people honour. Although, as the Prime Minister has said, he rendered important public service in connexion with the framing of the Constitution, and subsequently, as a member of this Parliament and of the High Court Bench, his name will be remembered amongst us most of all for the great and enduring work he performed as  President  of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. I believe that he made industrial arbitration possible in Australia, and I trust that there will follow in his steps others who will help to retain it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins was eminently fitted for the high and distinguished part thai he played in the public life of Australia in pre-federation days and also for his membership of the Commonwealth High Court, because he was a great democrat.  His  record as  President  of the Arbitration Court showed that he was a man of humane instincts and of marked impartiality. I believe that every decision that he gave was arrived at honestly. He was a great and a just man, and his place on our High Court Bench will be hard to fill. We sympathize with his widow in her great loss. </para>

        <para class="block">The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins followed in the footsteps of a great, though not a greater predecessor, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higinbotham. He was a very able lawyer, and an equally able and honoured parliamentarian. My admiration for him rests chiefly upon his great and unshakable courage in holding and expressing unpopular opinions. For many years he was, as has been stated,  President  of the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration established by this Parliament. In discharging the duties of that high office, he naturally and necessarily had many critics. Sometimes these were to be found in the ranks of the employers and their representatives in Parliament, and sometimes in the ranks of the employees; but none of his critics had the temerity to challenge either his honesty or ability.  His  life has been, and will be, a source of inspiration to those who are ambitious to follow along the lines that be laid down, and his honesty, integrity and fearlessness will be a source of encouragement to many. He taught one lesson in particular to which I would invite the attention of the Government, and that is that there is a tremendous responsibility resting upon those who have the duty of making appointments to high public positions, and especially to judicial offices.

            <inline font-weight="bold">.- Mr. Justice</inline>Higgins was a man who was fearless in his opinions. He was a vice-President of the Peace Society at the time when the Reverend Laurence Rentoul was  president.  During the Boer war, John Murray, who was later Premier of Victoria, was also a vice-President. This was a small society in comparison with the numbers opposed to it, but it fought for the rights of the Boer farmers in the Transvaal with vigour and courage. No truer men ever fought for what they considered right. The Reverend <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Strong,</inline> of the Australian Church, who, I am happy to say is still alive, was also a strong force in that society, and his association there with the late <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Laurence</inline> Rentoul, of the Presbyterian Church, terminated the long and bitter quarrel which had existed between them, and cemented their lasting friendship. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins followed well in the footsteps of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higinbotham; it may be truly said that upon his shoulders fell the mantle of his distinguished and humane predecessor. I well remember the ovation that was given to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins when he attended at the Trades Hall, Melbourne, to witness the unveiling of a painting of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higinbotham. No greater testimony was ever paid to any man than was then paid to that upright and just judge. So widespread was his good fame that when I toured South Africa many Boer members of Parliament spoke with loving appreciation of what he, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Strong</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Rentoul,</inline> had done to assist them. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Higgins was fearless in the expression of his views and in upholding what he considered to be right, and' I think the electors of Geelong were unjust when they deprived him of his seat in the State legislature. He is gone; peace to his ashes, God rest his soul. I hope that the judges of to-day and those of the future may regulate their conduct by his example. </para>

            <para>- I ask the honorable member to resume his seat, and I remind him that the only business proposed to be transacted this afternoon is the passage of certain resolutions of sympathy relating to distinguished Australians who have passed away. In such circumstances, it is not usual for the House to transact ordinary business. </para>

        <para class="block">All honorable members must have learned with sorrow of the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Andrew</inline> at Bendigo in November last.  His  decease followed very closely that of his wife, and was the culmination of an illness that had lasted for a considerable time. He had intended to stand for re-election to the Senate, but because of the state of his health found it impossible to face the ardours of an election campaign, and just prior to nomination day found it necessary to announce that he would not be a candidate.  His  death shortly after the elections was not altogether unexpected. He had been a member of this Parliament since 1925, when he was elected a senator for Victoria, and his genial disposition and lovable personality made for him many good friends, who mourn sincerely his departure. He leaves behind him a record of meritorious public service; he was ever active in promoting and assisting all charitable efforts in the district in which he resided, and his death is deeply regretted by many people throughout Victoria. </para>

          <para>.- Honorable members of this chamber were not privileged to come into close contact with the late honorable senator, sitting as he did in another chamber, but those who had opportunities to meet him outside, whilst travelling or in other ways, always found him a congenial companion, and a very fine personality. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Andrew</inline> was highly esteemed in the district in which he lived in Victoria. As a private citizen he did very good work, and, as a member of the Senate, he carried out his duties faithfully and well. I am sure we all join in expressing our deep sympathy with his family in their sad loss. </para>
