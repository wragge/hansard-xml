                        <para>.- (By <inline font-style="italic">leave)</inline> - The Prime Minister has made a very important announcement. This Parliament is but 10 months old. The right honorable gentleman has accepted a grave responsibility in advising the Governor-General to dissolve it, andHis  Excellency  a grave responsibility in accepting that advice. I do not criticize the action of  His Excellency,  nor am I perturbed by the acceptance of the advice tendered to him, but through this House I tell the country that the responsibility for the cost and turmoil of a general election will rest entirely upon the Government. It could have obeyed the mandate it received from the people ten months ago to proceed with the fed- eral arbitration system and make it effective. Had that pledge to the electors not been broken, Parliament would not have insisted upon the Government going again before its masters. Parliament has vindicated itself as the guardian of the people's rights. It has told the Government that, notwithstanding its majority, it cannot flout the will of the people, and that irrespective of -the consequences to any party it must go back to. the electors and get a new mandate, or abandon the measure which was introduced in defiance of the will of the people. The grave responsibility of precipitating a general election so soon after the last one rests entirely upon the advisers of the Governor-General, and that will be made clear to the people. The Government disobeyed its mandate.  This  House, in definite terms, has told it to halt, and proceed no further without consulting the electors. I make no complaint for having to face a general election. The Labour party is prepared to meet the Government forces at the polls, and to abide by  the  judgment of the people. </para>

                            <para>- It is the intention of the Government to give publicity to the report and to make it available for distribution as soon as it is received. The Government has not yet received it. I under stand that it is being printed, but there has been some delay at the Government Printing Office owing to the rush of Parliamentary work. So far as I know, the statements which have appeared in the press respecting the contents of the report have not been authorized by the Royal Commission. </para>

In view of the impending dissolution, the only business with which the Government can proceed is the provision of the necessary supply to carry on the services of Government until after the election, the provision of moneys to meet commitments in respect of old-age and war pensions, and the passing of the measures necessary for the protection of the revenue.

                        <para>- No new proposal in the Estimates is included in the bill. In addition, provision has been made for "Refunds of Revenue", £100,000, and "Advance to the Treasurer", £1,500,000. The latter sura is required mainly to enable loan works and services in progress to be continued until the Loan Bill has been approved by Parliament. The average monthly expenditure on those services is about £450,000. It has also been necessary to make provision out of Treasurer's advance to carry on works and services in respect of "Additions, New Works and Buildings - Payable from Revenue " until parliamentary appropriation is available, and to meet miscellaneous and unforeseen contingencies incidental to the services of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>.- Although the Treasurer has stated that no new items have been included, there are certain items to which I should take exception if we were discussing the Estimates. Notwithstanding that, however, we are agreeable to this supply being granted so that the Government may be enabled to go to the country. After the elections have been held it is probable that another government will be in power; and should this party be returned it will make radical alterations in respect to the remainder of the financial year. </para>

                </quote>
                <para>The purpose of this measure is to provide from the Consolidated Revenue Fund the sum of £10,000,000 for the payment of invalid and old-age pensions. From time to time Parliament has made appropriations of a similar amount, and transfers have been made under the authority of the relative Appropriation Acts to the trust account from which payments are made to pensioners. The total amount previously appropriated for this purpose is £101,250,000, of which £98,296,126 had been expended up to the 30th June last, leaving a balance on that date of £2,953,874. This balance is sufficient to meet payments up to the last pay day in September, and a further appropriation is now required to provide for payments from October onwards. The sum which the committee is now asked to appropriate will meet requirements for approximately twelve months. The measure has no relation to the rate of pensions or the conditions under which they are payable. </para>

                    <para>.- In common with other honorable members, I consider it is high time that inquiry was made into the administration of this legislation, particularly as it affects invalids. I have had brought under my notice numerous cases of persons who are unable to do any work; yet they are told by those whose duty it is to authorize pensions that they are capable of doing some work. Presumably, that decision is come to in the light of the medical reports. They may he able only to wash a. cup, or perform some slight service of that nature. The administration is too rigid. I know of a boy who is practically paralysed down one side.  His  chest has wasted away. He has almost to drag himself along the floor, and he has been told by the administration that he can do some light employment. That is one of the serious anomalies that should be rectified. Irrespective of the trend of politics at the present time, let me say that it is high time that the Minister took steps to compel those who administer the law in respect of old-age and invalid pensions, to carry out their duties properly. </para>

                <para class="block">The purpose of the bill is to provide the sum of £10,000,000 from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the payment of war pensions. Parliament has, from time to time, made appropriations of a similar amount, and transfers have been made under the authority of the relative appropriation acts to the trust account from which payments are made to pensioners. The total amount previously appropriated for this purpose was £75,622,632, of which £72,116,683 had been expended, up to the 30th June last, the balance on that date being £3,505,949. This balance is sufficient to meet war-pension payments up to the middle of November next. -A further appropriation is required -to provide for payments from November onwards. The appropriation which the committee is now asked to make will meet requirements until approximately December, 1930. I would add that this measure has nothing whatever to do with the rate of pensions or the conditions under which they are payable. </para>

                    <para class="block">This measure is necessary for the validation of the collection of duties under the revenue tariff proposals contained in the motion submitted to the House on the 22nd August last. As the House is aware, those duties became operative when tabled, but it is necessary that they should be validated during the life of the Parliament in which they were introduced! In the event of a dissolution prior to validation, they would lapse, and the extra duties collected under them would have to be refunded. Therefore, honorable members will recognize the necessity for this measure. It is not intended in any sense to be the last word upon this schedule. The validation is only for the brief period ending the 20th December next? </para>

                        <para>.- As the Minister has said, this bill validates the schedule that has been tabled. The schedule contains some items with which I thoroughly agree, as, for example, the protective duty that has been levied on imported tobacco to encourage the tobacco industry in Australia. That duty would be supported, I believe, by most honorable  members, and it would be a pity to jeopardize the protection of the industry by failure to validate the schedule that has been tabled. The schedule contains, too, some items which I oppose just as strongly as I support others, and, were it not for the fact that the Government has agreed to limit the operation of the measure to a period of three months, honorable members on this side of the House would oppose it. In view of that limitation of time, the Opposition is not prepared to vote against the bill, although it includes some items with which we disagree, and others with which we agree. The effect of the bill will really be" the same as if the schedule were allowed to remain on the table for another three months. It is now clear that, unless this Parliament determines otherwise, this schedule will cease to have effect at the end of three months, and another Parliament will be asked to consider a new schedule, which I hope will contain the good features of the present schedule, but not the bad ones. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. We have to. accept the bad with the good; but their operation is limited to the period of three months. I understood that the intention of the Government was to make the period four months; but I made m_v opinion known, and the Government met the Opposition by limiting the operation of the duties to three months. Supply has been granted for three months, and that, too, includes provision for expenditure with which the Opposition does not agree, and which this Parliament would be entitled to criticize if it had the Estimates before it. We have agreed to the operation of the schedule for the limited period of three months to enable the election to be held and a newly-constituted House to assemble here. So the reason for the granting of three months' supply is the same as that for the validation of the collection of these duties for three months. Therefore, I do not propose to vote against the bill, although it contains features with which the Opposition disagrees and against which it will certainly fight during the coming election. </para>

                        <para>. - I would have preferred the Government to bring in a bill to validate the  collection of these duties to the present time, and give the House a proper opportunity to discuss the matter, because, when taxation is to be imposed on the people, their representatives in Parliament should at least be permitted to voice their opinion as to the fairness or necessity for those taxes. I do not think that it is essential that there should be increased taxation. Had due economy been exercised, these increased duties would not have been  ncessary.  When it is found imperative to impose increased taxes they should be placed on what may be termed luxuries. Unfortunately, the cost of living is increasing year by year. Nearly every other country has made a big effort to bring about a return to normal conditions. I hope that after the election the object of the Government - the present Government, I trust - will be to reduce the cost of living. That means that the cost of production must come down. It is no use living in a fool's paradise. Under the present conditions we are on shifting sands. We are dependent to too great a'n extent upon borrowed money. We are taking huge sums from the people which should be used for development in order to provide  employment.  I have already asked the Minister by way of questions in  the House, and I now ask the Government, to consider the remission of the duty on motor truck chassis which are being largely used in the development of rural areas. I hope that, until the matter can be fully investigated, the Government will approve of a small amendment that will enable these chassis to be admitted duty free. I do not wish to obstruct the passage of the bill ; but I ask the Government to realize that motor trucks are extensively employed in developmental work. Until we are satisfied that we can get these trucks on the free list from Great Britain equal to those from the United States, we should not further burden the country. </para>

                            <para>- I am not discussing the merits of these duties imposed; I am merely reminding the House that, the schedule contains many items to which exception might be taken from one side or the other. But, as I intimated to the House earlier in the afternoon, I have tendered certain advice to  His Excellency  the Governor-General, who has agreed to a dissolution subject to the granting of supply and the necessary protection of the revenue. Once a dissolution has been granted, it is not permissible for the Parliament to pass additional legislation or alter any existing legislation. It can take steps to provide the necessary moneys to carry on the services of government until after the election, and to safeguard the revenue; but it may not introduce new duties or vary duties that are already operative. Whatever views honorable members may hold regarding the duties under consideration, it is now too late to deal further with them. The Leader of the Opposition has pointed out that he disagrees with a number of the items in the schedule, but these duties are actually operative. </para>

This work is at present being carried out in temporary premises and in the laboratories of the universities and State government departments. A great deal of inconvenience has been caused by this, and the work cannot be done so efficiently as if the whole staff was housed under one roof. If the House agrees to this proposal the construction of the necessary building can be undertaken at an early date. The cost will be £52,000. </para>

                    <para>. -  I cannot allow this motion to go through without voicing a protest. We are now on the eve of a dissolution of Parliament. The Government has brought down proposals for a very heavy increase in taxation, while, at the same time, it proposes to proceed with what the public of Australia regards as grossly extravagant expenditure on the Federal Capital. It has been stated that £700,000 is to be spent on Canberra this year. The governments of to-day are concerned chieflywith finance, and the concern of the public is whether or not a government is economically spending the public revenues and whether the heavy taxation imposed is justified. An important step of this kind should not be decided before the election. If this motion is passed the country will be committed to an expenditure of £52,000. Before the work is completed I believe it will cost £70,000 at least. </para>

                        <para>- It has not ; it was tabled only yesterday or the day before. The time has arrived when a halt must be called to expenditure. The public is crying out about the wasteful extravagance at Canberra. There is no real need for this work, and in any case Parliament should not be asked to agree to the expenditure of this sum when the whole policy of the Government is to be placed before the people. The Government's proposal represents a breach of the trust which the people repose in Parliament, and I shall vote against it. </para>

                    <para>.- No other undertaking authorized by Parliament during the last ten years has had more to justify it than this has. This is a proposal for carrying out an important work to which we are pledged. In many ways we are still suffering from the folly of past mal-administration, and the present proposal of the Government represents a step towards recovering some of the lost ground. I heartily support this proposal, and if the cost were to be twice as much I would still support it. In the laboratories which are to be built, experts will investigate such matters as soil improvement, and the evolution of improved grasses and plants. It will be a work of great national importance, one which will help </para>

The honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mann)</inline> would not oppose the motion if he understood the subject. I sympathize with him because his environment has prevented him from becoming acquainted with some of the problems concerning which I have endeavoured to educate the House. During the last Parliament I moved that the Government should set aside an area of 20 square miles in the Federal Capital Territory for the purposes of a research institute, station, and farm, and I suggested a means whereby the necessary money might be raised. The same motion appears on the Notice-paper for this session. </para>

                        <para>- I am merely pointing out that the proposal submitted by the Minister is in consonance with the larger one to which I wish to get the assent of this House. This morning I received from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Julius,  Chairman  of the Bureau of Science and Industry, three pages of foolscap in which he highly commended my proposal, and pointed out how essential it is that such an institute should be established as soon as possible. In Great Britain similar institutes have been in operation since 1843 and have aided to a marked degree the progress of primary production in the Old Country. In the United States of America research work is regarded as fundamental to progress. To every professional man in the Commonwealth, the leading professors at the universities, and 770 newspapers, I have distributed copies of a pamphlet setting out the details of my scheme, and by not one has it been adversely criticized. A few weeks ago <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McMasters,</inline> a prominent pastoralist, and successful experimenter in the improvement of our flocks, offered £20,000 towards a fund to promote research in the pastoral industry. The Graziers Association has proposed that a fund of £200,000 should be established, and if the Government supports the proposal on national grounds, I am sure the money will be raised. An institute such as is proposed will be the envy of the world. In seeking to lower the cost of production we should not interfere with wages until we can assure to the people cheaper food. No proposal ever submitted to the House was more justified than is the motion now before us. It is recommended by the Works Committee, which has shown a breadth of vision for which it cannot be too highly commended. </para>

                    <para>.- The protest made by the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mann)</inline> is in accordance with the views of the majority of people. The economic position of Canberra is a horror. What can be shown for the £12,000,000 that has been expended in the creation of this city? If the proposed expenditure of £52,000 would do anything towards insuring proper food for human beings and teach them how to avoid disease, I would support it. At the same time, I recognize that diseases of stock should be thoroughly studied so that the meat we eat may be wholesome and that which we export to Europe may be able to compete on favorable terms with that of the Argentine. The War Office has given to the Argentine, in preference to Australia, contracts for the supply of meat to the Army and Navy. Even the deadly poison formalin was used to preserve meat for export to the Homeland, and God alone knows how many men, women, and children have paid with their lives for that infamy. At the recent medical congress in Sydney, testimony was given that the dreadful disease, cancer, which menaces every old man, may be caused in time by the irritation of the intestines, due to certain substances. Amongst the contributors to such irritationare the preservatives and other impurities in foods. The finest white flour is now recognized to be almost deadly; it has little or no food value, because the best parts of the grain have been extracted during the gristing process and used as offal. Sugar, rice, and other foods also lose value through over-refinement. In connexion with the estimate of £52,000 for the proposed institute, I hope that we shall not have a repetition of previous occurrences under the administration of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Butters. </para>

                        <para>- Thank God he is retiring. I hope that the Minister for Home Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott),</inline> if he is returned to office - if not, his successor - will see that the estimates given to Parliament are adhered to, and that if the estimate for this proposed work is exceeded, the officer responsible will be punished. This Parliament House, which was originally estimated to cost. £230,000, has absorbed nearly £700,000 of the taxpayers money. I hope we shall not be told later that an institute estimated to cost £52,000 has actually cost £150,000. I make this protest as a reminder to whomever the officer concerned may be, that works must be completed within the estimated amounts, particularly in this time of economic stress, when the people are staggering under a load of debt, much of which has been unjustly placed on their shoulders. </para>

                    <para>.- I heartily endorse the remarks of the Prime Minister regarding yourself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> the  Chairman  of Committees, the officers at the table, the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, and the attendants of the House. You, sir, have always been fair and impartial in the chair, and in all respects have upheld the highest traditions of your office. The Prime Minister said that some honorable members had made the task of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff more difficult than it need have been. That may be true, yet no one has made it more difficult than the Government has done; because, whatever the disabilities of honorable members during a 46-hours sitting, those of the Clerks at the table, the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, and the chamber attendants must be very much greater. We sympathize with them in what they have thus suffered. Unlike honorable members, they cannot curl themselves up in a quiet place in a blanket, and sleep while others talk. I am sure that we all appreciate the courtesy and capable assistance of all the officials of Parliament. </para>

                    <para>. - I do not desire to strike a discordant note upon this happy occasion, when we are on the eve of our return to our homes. I cordially support the remarks made by the Prime Minister, and endorsed by the Leader of the Labour party. While regretting that the exigencies of political life forbid me to express the hope that we shall all meet again in the next Parliament, I may be permitted to say that I trust that we shall, at least, have the privilege of meeting all of our friends now and again in the lobbies. I understand that one honorable member opposite has linked up with the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, and proposes to make extensive and exhaustive research in the swamps of the middle-west of New South Wales into the origin and genesis of fangless snakes. In these circumstances, we could not think of breaking in upon his inquiries with the more active work of a member of Parliament. I understand that another honorable member opposite is already engaged in the manufacture for himself of a crown of martyrdom, which is to be hung in some convenient place in the electorate of Wakefield. None can tell what fortune may hold in store for him. We can only wait and pray - pray rather than wait - because there is ah active time ahead of us. Many of us have condemned Canberra in round terms, but most of us long to return to it. With all its faults, we love it still. I like change, and in the next Parliament I shall be quite content if we who sit on your left, sir, enjoy the changed view that is to be had from your right. Such a change will be eminently satisfactory. I wish no person any harm. The worst that can happen to any of us is to be given temporary rest, which surely all of us have earned and deserve. It is my  cordial wish that that may be given to some honorable gentlemen who now sit on your right. I believe it will be given to them in rich measure - not, perhaps, the rest which comes from the consciousness of having done right and served one's country disinterestedly; but rest of another kind, which is better than none at all. I am grateful to you, sir, for having presided so impartially and ably over this chamber. It is not for me to express the hope that you may occupy your present position when the new Parliament meets. That Parliament will be the master of its own destiny, and who can tell who will then occupy the position that you now fill? Who can tell, also, who will be  Chairman  of Committees; and whether he will sit out the whole of the gloomy period allotted for debate, or be tempted by parliamentary circumstances to leave the chair ten minutes earlier than the fixed time? Political work is very exacting, and although we always hope to stay the distance we sometimes fail when we have almost reached the goal. Maybe that will be the fate of the  Chairman  of Committees; I cannot say. The answers to all these questions are wrapped in the mists of the future. </para>

                <para>I most cordially thank you, sir, and the officers of this House. I sincerely hope it may be the dispensation of the wise Providence that guards the interests of this country that we who now sit on this side shall return in sufficient numbers to justify our taking our places on the other side. We certainly deserve to do so; and in such an event we shall do justice to our country. </para>

                    <para>.- During the last election campaign, I understand, wireless broadcasting facilities were made available to the leaders of the respective parties, once in each State. Wireless has expanded, so enormously that it has become a most effective means of reaching the people, particularly in remote centres. I ask the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> and the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gibson),</inline> if possible to extend the facilities to include not only the leaders of parties but also - to a limited extent, at any rate - all other candidates. If that is not possible I ask that the privilege may be accorded to at least the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> because of the fact that the election is considered necessary in consequence of the vote that was taken on the amendment which he moved to the Maritime Industries Bill, and that that will be the principal issue in the campaign. I may mention that I have not discussed this matter with the right honorable gentleman, and that I make the request without his knowledge. The issues should be put to the people as clearly and effectively as possible. </para>

                <para>I understand that in the party room this morning the Prime Minister made a definite statement regarding the date of the election.

If we are spared by a kindly Providence to take part in the deliberations of the next Parliament, we should set our faces sternly against all-night sittings, which are. iniquitous.

At- any rate, sir, you will do so as long as I have any influence in the party. I say this because I take a broad, national view. Do I not remember the consideration you have extended to me time after time when in this chamber I have wandered from the path of political rectitude? I have nothing but feelings of gratitude for a  Speaker  who can be so generous to old sinners like myself, and you shall be  Speaker  for ever if I have power to keep you in the position. </para><para>We are now on the way to the graveside of some members of this House. Let us hope that it will be that of our opponents. We shall bury them with feelings of gratitude, mingled with feelings of sadness. The fortunes of war necessitate that in a political struggle some must die; hut on such an occasion we prefer to bury our political opponents - of course, with every honour, even though we may be put to the expense of floral tributes. In these contests we are apt to make all manner of assertions about each other, but I make a promise to those who support the Government. My general rule of conduct is to observe humility and kindness in dealing with my opponents unless I am assailed, and even then the attack must be warm. It is only now and then that I am aroused. The promise I make is that in this contest on the public platforms of Australia I shall try to uphold that dignity which I always seek to maintain in this chamber. I shall not say one word against my opponents that can be regarded as being other than in good taste or dignified. I may, of course, say, in company with the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. R. Green),</inline> that my opponents are " maggots," or I may paraphrase the words of the honorable member for Gwydir <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott),</inline> and describe them as " snakes whose fangs have been drawn." Or I may use the words of my old friend the Treasurer, and describe them as being " infected with tetanus germs." But I shall not mean what I say. Such language as that will only be for the sake of publicity. With the usual decency that adorns our public life, after assailing each other's private characters on public platforms, we can still have our cups of tea together. We may talk of "running sores," but in the  corridors of this building we can still shake each other's hands. I might go still higher in the matter of culture - I cannot help my superiority, since God has made me superior - and say of some of my opponents what the right honorable the Prime Minister said of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charlton,</inline> "So ignorant; so degrading to public life"; or as he said of another's speech, "It violates every decency of public life." We shall say all these things, and yet when we come hack again - triumphant on this side, I hope - we shall resume our friendships. Nevertheless, on this occasion I trust that on the public platform and elsewhere we shall observe decency of manners, and decency of address. In this respect our language will not lose by. comparison with that used by honorable members supporting the Government when they speak of us on the public platforms of this country. </para><para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline>
                    as men about to die, but although we die as members of this Parliament, we, or at least the majority of us, hope soon to rise again as members of the next. This is my last opportunity to protest in this Parliament against the enormous expenditure on the roof of this building. Some time ago I drew the attention of the Government to the had condition of the roof, and I was told that a certain sum of money had been reserved until the contractors had made the roof  perfect. Parliament went into recess, and before it met again the Commission, put 80 tons of gravel on the roof and repaired it at an expense of £2,500. How much were the contractors made to pay for those repairs? The Commission withheld £877 from them, but it expended £2,500. Did the roof stop leaking.? No, and I understand that it is still leaking. I protest against this waste of money. Why did not the Commission make John Howie and Sons complete their job? Were they not able to construct a roof properly? The Commissioner, who has been eulogized by the Prime Minister, passed the expense on to the country. The cost was £2,500, and only £877 was debited against J. Howie and Sons. Even that firm claims to have been unjustly treated by the Commission.
                </para><para>Another matter to which I wish to refer is that of the building of the" theatre at Canberra. The unfortunate man who built it, placed his plans before the commissioners, who passed and endorsed them. The plans provided for a roof which would enable a fireproof curtain to be installed in the theatre, but some one discovered that the roof was out of alignment with that of Parliament House. This unfortunate man was put to an additional expense of £900 without receiving one penny compensation. The present roof does not permit of the provision of a fireproof curtain, therefore a grave injustice has been done, because, without such a curtain, the manager is able to exhibit only moving pictures. He cannot have a theatrical performance without permission. There was no room in the roof to enable a fireproof curtain to bc raised, and the Commission suggested  that a  room 12 feet by 12 feet should be built at the corner of the fl ys. Any one who understands anything about an asbestos curtain knows that such an arrangement would soon destroy it. Later on, that great Shakespearean actor, Allan Wilkie, wished to give a performance in the capital of Australia. The manager of the theatre made application to the Chief Commissioner for permission to use it for that purpose, and the Commissioner  waited  twelve days before answering. Allan Wilkie could not wait, so at that time Canberra lost the opportunity of seeing the great  Shakepearean  actor. Later on, the position was remedied. The Commission unjustly wronged the builder of the theatre by putting him to additional expenditure without one penny compensation. </para><para>I come now to Parliament House, this wonderful structure which was estimated to cost £220,000. Has the person who made that estimate been suspended or dismissed for his fault? The cost of this building, to June, 192S, was £617,516. That is how the people's money is wasted, and I lay the charge of wasteful expenditure at the door of the Commission, principally. The most useful act that the Chief Commissioner does will be to leave Canberra. The words "Thank God!" will then echo in many homes in Canberra, and the people are even now offering prayers of thanksgiving because the dictator's reign has about finished. </para><para>I cannot wish the Government the good fortune to return to office. I candidly admit that I never allow friendship to interfere with politics. In a political fight my opponents are my enemies, and I hope that most honorable members supporting the Government will soon sink into the limbo of political oblivion. Whether this Government is returned, which I doubt, or another government takes its place, does not alter the fact that it is the duty of the Commonwealth Government to abolish the present absurd system of estimating the cost of building at Canberra. This building, although of a temporary character, was estimated to cost £220,000, yet its actual cost was over £617,000. Is it any wonder that Canberra has earned the name of being an open malignant ulcer upon the finances of Australia? I am certain that the majority of honorable members in their hearts would like Canberra closed down altogether. Any business firm that had branches in the capital cities would close down any branch that was not paying. The Federal Capital should have been situated at a place like Albury or the North Shore of Sydney. Under act of Parliament we were permitted to take up land at its valuation, and 27 or 28 years ago the value of 100 or 150 acres on the North Shore of Sydney would not have been very considerable. Albury is a wonderful city, situated on the banks of Australia's greatest river. It will shortly have adjacent to it a lake larger than Sydney Harbour. Had Albury been chosen as the Federal Capital City, it would have now had a population of 100,000. Its citizens would have been paying their dues to Australia, and no loss would have been made. What is the present position? We have the abominable system of building from a circumference instead of from a centre. This is the first time in the history of the world that such a system has been introduced. Canberra has a paltry population of 7,000, and yet the city is divided into 22 sections. When one goes out at night, the enormous number of lights reminds one of Sydney or some other large city. I have taken this opportunity of protesting against the action of the Federal Capital Commissioners, and I have no hesitation in saying that when the history of Canberra is written it will clearly show that the tremendous amount of unnecessary expenditure incurred has placed an exceptionally heavy burden upon the finances of the Commonwealth. </para></speech>

                    <para>. - While not proposing to follow the honorable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Maloney)</inline> in the remarks he has made concerning this capital city, I wish to make it perfectly clear that I entirely dissociate myself from everything he has said regarding the Chief Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Butters. When the history of Canberra, to which the honorable member referred, comes to be written, it will not be condemnatory of the work of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Butters, but will, I am sure, commend him for the success with which he carried out a difficult task during the early days of establishing the Federal Capital. </para>

For example, if the House were dissolved before the Royal Assent were given to all the measures passed by Parliament, they would not become law.

The honorable member for Maribyrnong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fenton)</inline> suggested that it would be desirable to appoint a committee to determine the extent to which wireless should be used by the leaders of parties. Such a suggestion is quite impracticable. The only basis upon which arrangements can be made is that of according' equal facilities to all parties.

                        <para>- Identical arrangements were made for the leaders of all parties. I am under the impression that the leaders of the parties had an all- Australia broadcasting, in connexion with which the land lines were made available, and, in addition, were entitled to broadcast once in each State. The arrangements made for the leaders of all parties were identical, and that will be the course adopted during the forthcoming election. I have no knowledge of my speeches being broadcast twice as suggested by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition; but the only way in which that could have happened was under the arrangement I have mentioned. There was no distinction made between party leaders. </para>

                    <para>. -  Before putting the motion, I desire to thank the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> and the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> for their remarks about the  Chairman  of Committees and myself. I desire, also, to express appreciation of the faithful and efficient way in which the officers of  Parliament  have carried out their duties. During the period in which I have been in the chair, I have endeavoured to the best of my ability to uphold the dignity of Parliament, and to perform impartially the important duties which devolve upon me. I thank honorable members for the courtesy they have shown me, and for their readiness to submit to rulings of the Chair. The way in which our parliamentary work has been conducted will, I think, compare favorably with the proceedings in any parliament of the British Empire. </para>
