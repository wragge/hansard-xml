        <para>That the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> do take the Chair  of the House as Speaker. </para>
        <para class="block">I have known the honorable member during the ten years for which he has been a member of this Parliament. The more he is known the better he is liked. I have had the honour to sit under four Speakers, the late Honorable Charles McDonald, the Honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Elliot</inline> Johnson, the Et. Honorable W. A. Watt and the Honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom. Each of these gentlemen occupied the Chair with dignity and success, and it will be a difficult task to follow in their footsteps. But I have no hesitation in declaring that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Makin</inline> will uphold the best traditions of the office. He is n straightforward, honorable and upright man, and he has already filled many positions in the Commonwealth Parliament.. He has sat as a member of various committees of this House, and one can not but admire his steady adherence to duty and his constant devotion to the business which engaged his attention. He has acted as Secretary of the Parliamentary Labour Party with great credit to himself, and most acceptably to his colleagues. During the last seven years he has been a temporary  Chairman  of Committees, and on the many occasions on which he has presided in that capacity he has displayed full qualification for the duties of the office to which it is now proposed to elect him. He has represented the division of Hindmarsh in South Australia for the last ten years. At the recent election he was returned unopposed, and to be unopposed is a very great compliment to any man. When the seat has been contested he has been returned by a large majority, which shows that his constituents have the fullest confidence in him. He having so worthily represented his constituents in the Hindmarsh division, and having so satisfactorily discharged the other duties that have fallen to him as a member of the Parliament, I have no doubt that he will make a worthy successor to the gentlemen who have preceded him in the chair of this House. </para>

          <para>.- I second the motion. Every member who has any knowledge of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Makin</inline> and of his Parliamentary services will, I am sure, agree with me that he is well fitted to occupy the office to which it is proposed to elect him. He has a strong judicial sense and  a  wide knowledge of parliamentary procedure. We have all admired the diligence with which he  has  devoted himself to his work, and I am confident that if elected to this office he will fill it with credit to himself and in accord with the highest traditions of the Parliament, irrespective of party considerations. </para>

          <para>.- I support the motion. It is a compliment to South Australia that yet another representative for that State should be proposed to fill the high office of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> The first  Speaker  of this Chamber was a South Australian and two representatives from that State have had the honour of filling the presidential chair in the Senate. If the motion is agreed to I have no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Makin</inline> will justify the confidence reposed in him, and that he will uphold the best traditions of the Parliament. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>My principal reason for rising to speak at this juncture, however, is to say that, in my opinion, the time has gone by when the  Speaker  of this chamber should be chosen in this fashion. The remarks that I shall make on this subject are not spontaneous. They are the result of careful consideration over a long period of years. I believe that the presiding officers of the various Houses of Parliament in Australia should be paid officials and not some one who has been elected to represent a constituency. I held these views long before I had any aspirations to parliamentary honours or any hopes of ever being a legislator. Many years ago I tabled a motion at a conference of the South Australian Labour party to the effect that the  Speaker  of the House of Assembly in that State should be a paid official of the House. I believe that the  Speaker  of. this chamber should also be an official and not a member. I am fortified in this opinion by the recent occurrences in connexion with the Speakership of the House of Representatives. </para>

            <para>- That is beside the point at the moment. It is an anomaly that the Speakership of this chamber should be a party political plum. That has been the case in the past, and the best man for the position has not always been elected to it. Reference has been made by the previous speakers to the admirable manner in which the honorable member for Hindmarsh has represented his district in this Parliament. If he becomes the  Speaker  of the House, his knowledge and ability as a representative will, to a large extent, be lost to his constituents. The work he will be able to do in that regard will be negligible. If this occurs, he may meet with the same fate as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Littleton</inline> Groom, who, because be would not follow the dictates of the previous Government and vote for it, is now, to put it colloquially, &#34; on the outer &#34;. That, I suggest, is a serious anomaly. The  Speaker  of this chamber should be free from party ties or political influence. I can recollect quite well occasions when the  Speaker  of this House was called in to vote to save the Government. That is not as it should be. The Labour party is a party of reform. Consequently I feel that this is an appropriate occasion to refer to this subject. I suggest - and I maintain that the suggestion is reasonable - that the  Speaker  of the House of Assembly in each of the States should be the State Governor, and that the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives should be the Governor-General of Australia. I look forward to the time when we shall dispense with many old customs, and get thoroughly up to date in making practical use of the occupants of such positions. I make this suggestion in the hope that before long it will bear fruit. I repeat my appreciation of the selection of the nominee for the Speakership, and have no doubt that he will more than justify the confidence about to be reposed in him. </para>

        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Dr.</inline>EARLE PAGE  (Cowper) &#91;11.16). - I have no intention at this stage of entering into a debate on the subject raised by the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates)</inline> excepting to say that, in my opinion, it is proper that the elected  representatives of the people should themselves elect the officer who is to preside over them. Nor have I, as a member of the Country party or of the Opposition, any intention to nominate another candidate for the office of  Speaker.  * I recognize that the custom has always been for the most numerous party in the House to nominate the  Speaker.  Previous Speakers, irrespective of the party to which they belonged, have carried out their duties impartially. </para>
        <para>But the present seems the most appropriate time to raise a matter affecting the privileges of members and parties in this building. During the past few weeks, owing to the defeat of the last <inline font-weight="bold">Speaker (Hon. Sir Littleton Groom),</inline> we have been without a  Speaker.  The result has been that, instead of the <inline font-style="italic">status quo</inline> having been observed, other arrangements have been made regarding the disposition of the rooms in this building. Unless some permanent basis for the allocation of rooms is arrived at we may, in the future, find that rooms have been so allotted as to cause personal friction - a situation which would be most unfortunate. When I brought this matter under the notice of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> he met me with exceptional courtesy, and he has since done his utmost to provide suitable and permanent accommodation in the building for the Country party. Almost since the beginning of Federation there have been three parties in this Parliament, and suitable accommodation has been provided for each of them. Invariably the greatest courtesy has been extended towards the members of all parties, thus enabling them to carry out their official duties in the most effective manner. I should like to secure from the new  Speaker  an assurance that the custom of the past will be followed in the future, and that ample provision will be made in this building for the Country party, which I have the honour to lead. I recognize the difficulty that has now been caused by the planning of this building. Hitherto the room occupied -by the Country party has been one facing the same balcony as the adjoining room occupied by Government members. That was a satisfactory arrangement when the members of the two parties occupying those rooms supported the same Government. </para>
        <para>The difficulty, however, is not insurmountable ; it should not be impossible to devise some means of overcoming it. </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">The honorable member for Ballarat has had a long public career in Australia, first as a member of the Legislature of Victoria, and then as a member of the Commonwealth Parliament. He may be ranked as one of the fathers of this Parliament in that he has been a member of it for 25 years. He has had much experience of the Standing Orders - in fact he has come into conflict with them on some occasions. Consequently, he is well fitted to discharge the duties of  Chairman  of Committees with tact, impartiality and sympathy. He is popular with honorable members of this House, and will preserve the dignity of his office in conformity with the traditions established by the distinguished persons who have held it before him. </para>

          <para>.- I have much pleasure in seconding the motion of the honorable member for Reid, and in endorsing his references to the honorable member for Ballarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McGrath).</inline> I have no doubt that that honorable member&#39;s long experience in this House, together with the experience he gained as a member of the Victorian legislature, will fit him admirably for discharging the responsibilities of his office. I do not agree that he has found himself much in conflict with the Standing Orders in the past; in fact, his behaviour as a member has been exemplary. I am confident, however, that if there is anything in the Standing Orders in conflict with justice he is the person to set matters&#39; right. A love of justice is characteristic of the man, so that if there is any part of the Standing Orders which it is necessary to scrap he will do his best to have it done. The duties which he will have to perform could not be in safer hands than his. </para>

          <para>.- I have listened to the honorable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Coleman)</inline> and the honorable member for Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Yates)</inline> hoping to hear from them some adequate reason why this choice has been made. We might have expected to hear that the honorable member who has been proposed for this office had been a temporary  chairman  of committees, and in that way had qualified for the office of  chairman.  It is significant that neither the mover nor seconder of the motion could say that the honorable member for Ballarat had had any experience whatever in the Chair. The only reason given for his fitness to administer the Standing Orders was that he had sometimes found himself in conflict with them. This reason does not seem sufficient for putting him into the Chair, his only qualification being, apparently, that he has not obeyed the Standing Orders as other honorable members have been wont to do. Another surprising thing is that no reference was made to an honorable member who was Temporary  Chairman  of Committees in an honorary capacity for a considerable time while <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bamford</inline> filled the office of  Chairman.  I refer to the honorable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins),</inline> and I am surprised that he has not been put forward as a candidate for this high office. The 25 years&#39; parliamentary experience of the honorable member for Ballarat cannot be compared with that of the honorable member for Newcastle who has been a member of this House since its inception, and who, prior to that, was a member of the New South Wales State Legislature. He is the only honorable member of this House who has consistently represented the one constituency since the inauguration of the Commonwealth Parliament. As he has had considerable experience in the office for which the honorable member for Ballarat has been nominated, one might have thought that he would have been given the opportunity of fillingit. </para>

          <para>. -  I desire to offer a few words of congratulation to the honorable member for Ballarat. upon his appointment as  Chairman  of Committees. For many reasons the honorable member is well fitted for that position. The qualification which has been emphasized is not the only reason for his election to a high and honorable office, although the fact that he has in the past broken the Standing Orders may cause him to deal leniently with future transgressors. Perhaps the honorable member for Richmond <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. R. Green)</inline> particularly may have reason to be grateful that the occupant of the Chair is not a strict disciplinarian. I am confident that the honorable member for Ballarat will discharge his duties with impartiality, and will bring to bear on the position that force of character which is his outstanding characteristic and is necessary in one who presides over the committee proceed ings of this Chamber. I recall with pleasure 25 years of close association with him ; through many trials and struggles the honorable member has remained true to his principles and his friends, and I am confident that he will be true to the best traditions of the office to which he has been elected. </para>

          <para>.- I offer the congratulations of the members of the Opposition to the honorable member for Ballarat upon his election to the Chairmanship of Committees. The honorable member is an experienced parliamentarian and a skilled debater, and he is further equipped for his new office by his personal experience of the operation of the Standing Orders. Many of us who now sit in opposition have come into conflict with him in debate, but when he is pre siding over the committees of this House we shall forget our past differences as, we know, he will forget them. We are confident that he will impartially administer the Standing Orders and preserve the dignity and decency of our proceedings while at the same time protecting the rights of all honorable members. We wish him well during his term of office and offer to him our support in the administration of the Standing Orders. I hope that he will interest himself in bringing the rules of debate more up to date. An effort to that end was made in the last Parliament and I hope that that work will be carried to completion. In any endeavour to improve the Standing Orders, the  Chairman  of Committees will be assured of the cordial support of the Opposition. Again I promise the honorable member for Ballarat the assistance of honorable members on this side of the Chamber in maintaining the traditions and dignity of his office. </para>

The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McWilliams</inline> was a native of Tasmania, and one of its most loyal sons. The claims of the little island State were put before this Parliament by him earnestly and with considerable ability. He was a zealous and competent advocate of the rights of his State, which will mourn the loss of one who represented it well, as the Commonwealth will mourn the loss of one who rendered conspicuous service in this National Parliament. At the age of 33 he was elected a member of the Tasmanian Parliament and held his seat in the State House for seven years. He was elected a member of the Federal Parliament in 1903 for the division of Franklin, and held the seat for nineteen years, until the general election in 1922. For two years preceding his defeat he was the Leader of the Country party in this House. He was re-elected for the same division at the general election in 1928, and was again returned on the 12th October last. During his public career the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McWilliams</inline> occupied many important and honorable positions. He was a member of the Select Committee appointed in 1910, and of the Royal Commission of the following year, to inquire into Tasmanian Customs leakage. He was also a member of the Pearling Royal Commission in 1913. In 1914 he served on the Royal Commission that inquired into the powellizing of Australian timber and was a member of the Federal Parliamentary Recruiting Committee in 1917-18. The late honorable gentleman was also a member of the Select Committee that inquired into the sea carriage of goods in 1920, and. was a member of the Cockatoo Island Dockyard Royal Commission in 1921. In the discharge of his duties as a member of all these royal commissions and select committees, the late honorable gentleman gave of his best, as indeed he did as a member of this and the Tasmanian Parliament. Honorable members are aware that, he was not robust. Yet,  although he suffered physically, he gave close attention to his public duties. He was a man of very high character and personally was most likeable and gentle in his nature. He was always prepared to find something good even in the most critical moments of public debate. He will be much missed by honorable members. All who were associated with him for so many years will deeply regret the loss of one who was their friend. I am sure that the House will join with me in extending the sincerest sympathy to his widow and the members of his family. I therefore move <inline font-style="italic">(by leave) -</inline></para>

He was as active as any private member could well be. He threw himself into his work with great thoroughness during his long association with this Parliament.
