            <para>- The Premier of New South Wales is reported to have stated yesterday that he was shocked to find that a large number of miners were working in the coal-mining industry in New South Wales for less than the basic wage, but that further action to remedy that state of affairs was the responsibility of. the. Commonwealth Government. In view of that authoritative statement, will the Prime Minister take action, similar to that taken against the Timber Workers' Union, against the owners who have thrown 12,000 miners out of employment? </para>

              <para>- I have discussed this matter with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bavin</inline> several times, and I am quite certain that he has not suggested that acoal-miner in regular employment does not receive the basic wage. The trouble is that, although the daily wage is sufficient to ensure the regularly employed worker a weekly return at least equal to the basic wage, the intermittency of employment is such that the earnings of many men are below that standard. The object of the proposals of the Commonwealth and New South Wales Governments is, by increasing the output to increase also the number of days per fortnight that each man can work, and thus assure to all at least the basic wage. With regard to the second part of the honorable member's question, I stated yesterday that the Government will take all steps necessary to enforce Commonwealth laws. </para>

            <para>- Will the Prime Minister afford organized bodies of primary producers an opportunity to present their case to the representatives of the overseas shipping companies, who are about to make inquiries in Australia? This is desirable in order that the visitors may have a clear understanding of the position of our industries. </para>

            <para>- Recently a board was appointed of representatives of all the big exporting primary industries of Australia, such as wool, wheat, mutton, beef, dairy produce, processed fruits, and so on. I have no doubt that these industries will all be able to put their case clearly before the board, and that it will make sure that the facts are placed before the overseas shipping representatives. If an additional opportunity to meet the visitors is desired by representatives of a particular industry, and time permits, I shall be pleased to do my best to arrange it. </para>

I understand that fears are entertained for the safety of these persons. It is thought that they may be starving. Has the Government taken any action to institute a search for the party? </para>

            <para>- On the 17th December last a police party was despatched to search for an aboriginal who was alleged to have murdered a white settler. At that time the Government Resident did not expect to hear anything of the party for at least ten weeks.No anxiety is entertained for its welfare. The only thing that has happened is that a horse belonging to the police knocked up, and a camel was supplied by one of the station-owners to take its place. </para>

            <para>- A week or so ago the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin)</inline> asked the Prime Minister to have inquiries made into the distress which existed in part of his electorate. The Prime Minister informed us subsequently that inquiries had been made through the Premier of South Australia. A few days ago I drew the attention of the House to the distress which existed in a part of my electorate. Will the Prime Minister have inquiries made into the matter through the Town Council and the Local Distress Committee of Port Pirie? If he finds that acute distress exists, will be consider subsidizing by£1 for £1 the collections that are made in the district for relief purposes? </para>

            <para>- It was stated in the press a day or so ago that the report of the officer of the Auditor-General's Department upon certain housing contracts in Canberra had been made available to the Government, and that it had been referred to the Chief Commissioner in order that the officers concerned might have an opportunity of presenting their side of the case. Seeing that this report was made on the recommendation of a joint committee of this Parliament, does not the Prime Minister think that it should be made available to honorable members immediately? Will the Prime Minister inform us of the procedure he proposes to adopt in connexion with reports of this nature? This report was described as scathing, and I submit that honorable members should be informed of its contents. </para>

Some papers were laid on the table, and on examining them I found that a number of important documents had not been included in the file. I refer particularly to the report of the expert who examined the foundations, and also the papers relating to the negotiations between the architect, the contractor and the Federal Capital Commission, and the final adjustments that were made. I now ask the Minister to lay on the table a complete file relating to the contract. </para>

              <para>In August, 1920, the representative of the British-Australasian Tobacco Company Proprietary Limited, when giving evidence before the Tariff Board, made an offer on behalf of the company to provide a sum up to £50,000 for expenditure in conjunction with the Commonwealth and/or State Governments on a £ for £ basis for the development of the tobacco-growing industry in Australia. The Development and Migration Commission and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research subsequently discussed this offer with the company, with the result that a definite proposal was submitted by the companyand agreed to by the Commonwealth Government. The arrangement is that over a period of three years, the company will find £20,000 rateably with the sum of £10,000 to be found by the Commonwealth and/or State Governments for the purpose of carrying out investigations and field experiments. If, at the expiration of the three-year period, developments are sufficiently satisfactory to warrant further effort, and it is mutually agreed that further expenditure is justified, the company will provide a further £30,000 conditionally upon the Commonwealth and/or State Governments providing a similar amount. The total amount that may he applied to this work is, therefore, £90,000. The Commonwealth Government has made an arrangement with the Governments of the five mainland States, under which it is provided that, over the first period of three years, the Commonwealth will find £5,000 and each State £1,000, and over the second period the Commonwealth £15,000 and each State £3,000. Under the terms of the agreement, an executive committee to control the policy and general direction of the investigation was constituted, and it was agreed that the contributing State should nominate the Directors of Agriculture, or such other officers deemed suitable, to act as an advisory committee. It was also a condition of the agreement that the executive committee should consist of a representative of the Development and Migration Commission, a representative of the Executive of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and a third member to be jointly appointed by these two bodies. The investigation will cover the whole field of the economic production of tobacco in Australia. 2. (a) Experimental work has been started in each of the mainland States of the Commonwealth, and it is hoped to obtain as rapidly as possible, data on the cured leaf qualities of the tobacco grown in many widely separated districts of Australia. This is what is called exploratory work. In addition, a considerable variety of work is already under way dealing with time of planting,methods of handling seed-beds, variety tests, field cultural methods, methods of harvesting and curing, and so forth. Investigations are also in progress in regard to overcoming the Blue Mould disease, one of the most serious troubles with which the Australian tobacco-grower has to contend. (b) By the Australian Tobacco Investigation in conjunction and in co-operation with the various State Departments of Agriculture, (c) The experiments are obviously of such nature as to make it impossible to achieve definite results within the short period in which they have been conducted, but, nevertheless, much valuable data are being collected and in some instances favorable and hopeful indications are manifesting themselves. </para>

It is impossible to state at this stage whether it is a fact that, if the scheme of sale by private treaty had been in force when the officers of the first wave were transferred to Canberra, higher prices would have been realized. Officers who take advantage of the scheme of sale by private treaty are bound by the undertaking to build or purchase and reside in a home in Canberra in a similar manner to officers who accept the Government's valuation.

            <item label="2.">
              <para>The purport of the interview - which cannot properly be described as a consultation - was that they stated that the employers in the timber industry were anxious to work in accordance with the award of the Arbitration Court; that the Timber Workers Union had called its members out on strike; that the officials of the union were misrepresenting the terms and the effect of the award; that many members of the union were willing to work in accordance with the award, but were prevented from doing so by threats directed against themselves, and more particularly against their wives and children. They asked that the Government should take action to enforce the law. The Attorney-General replied that the matter was already being investigated, and that such action would be taken as was thought proper. </para>

The terms, as framed by the Administrator of the Mandated Territory (Brigadier-General Wisdom) limit the investigation to 'matters relating to mass meetings of natives that occurred at the Roman Catholic and Methodist Mission Stations at Malaguna on 2nd and 3rd January, including the origin and causes of the meetings. ' Under the Commissions of Inquiry Ordinance of New Guinea the Administrator of the Territory is empowered to issue commissions for inquiries, and in the present case the investigation was ordered by him. It was understood when the inquiry was announced that it would embrace consideration of the dissatisfaction existing among white residents iu consequence of their relations with the Administration. A further request has been made recently from New Guinea for on examination of that aspect."? 2.

            <para>- On Friday last, the honorable member for Yarra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> stated that a corporal who was in camp at Seymour made application to the Commanding Officer of his unit for leave to attend the funeral of a relative, and that the application was not granted. The honorable member asked if it were in the power of the Commanding Officer to grant permission in such circumstances, and, if so, why permission was not granted in this case. I am now advised that the corporal in question received a telegram on 15th February, informing him of the death of his relative. The trainee duly reported to the camp headquarters, but on his arrival no officer having authority to issue a railway warrant was available. This occurred between 11 a.m. and 12 noon, and, as the train left at 12.20 p.m., a warrant could not be obtained in time for the trainee to reach the station and catch the train. The trainee was unwilling to pay his fare from Seymour to Melbourne - which amount would have been refunded to him - and decided not to attend the funeral. </para>

        </quote><para class="block">The Government is proposing this limitation of time in order to ensure that honorable members who desire to speak on the bill shall have an opportunity to do so. In doing this it has been influenced to a considerable extent by a discussion which took place in the House three or four weeks ago on the time allotted to the consideration of the estimates. It has been our frequent experience that in the early stages of a session, so much time is devoted to debating one or two matters, that it is found impossible to find time for the adequate consideration of many major measures that come before the House towards the  end of the session, without resorting to the undesirable expedient of allnight sittings. We are submitting this motion with the express object of ensuring that a fair time shall be allotted to the consideration, of the bill. In practically every deliberative assembly throughout the Empire procedure of this description is adopted. It is done automatically in the House of Commons and in the parliaments of some of the Australian States. I ask honorable members to consider seriously whether it is not more desirable in the interests of proper discussion to allot to important measures like this a fair period for discussion, than to rush them through without adequate attention. The motion will allow the bill to be discussed for a reasonable time. </para></speech>

          <para>.- I do not propose to spend much time in discussing this motion, for that would have the effect of still further reducing the totally inadequate period that the Prime Minister has allowed for the consideration of the bill. I agree that there is something to be said for ensuring that fair time shall be allowed for the discussion of important bills, but how can we determine how much time a bill like this will require? It would have been very much better had the Prime Minister waited to see how the debate progressed before introducing a motion like this. This is one of the most important bills that this Parliament will consider. If it is passed, the hands of Parliament will be tied for 58 years so far as the subject with which it deals is concerned. It may be that three days will allow honorable members sufficient time to express their opinions on the subject, although I have grave doubts about it; but the three days have not been wisely distributed. The absurdity of applying the guillotine at the times specified in the motion will be realized when I point out that the only effective debate on the measure will occur at the second-reading stage. The bill cannot be altered at the committee or third-reading stage, so debate at those stages could serve no useful purpose. The motion provides that only twelve hours shall be allowed for the second-reading debate. That will mean that only twelve members will be able to speak for one hour each on the important and involved matters referred to in the measure. It could not be justly said that an honorable member who spoke for an hour on this measure was stone-walling. The Prime Minister, I' suppose, occupied his full time in introducing the bill, but he is not the only one who has responsibility to his constituents. We are all responsible, to those who elected us, and many of us will wish to speak on the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. I do not suggest that the whole 75 members who have not spoken will want to do so, but I am positive that more than twelve will seek an opportunity to state the case from their point of view. Surely it would have been wiser had the Prime Minister said that he' proposed to allow three days for the consideration of the bill. Honorable members would then doubtless have endeavoured to curtail their remarks as far as possible, having regard to their responsibility to their constituents. The introduction of motions like this will cause a great deal of irritation in the House. It cannot be argued that the passage of this measure has been obstructed, for it has not yet been debated. The Prime Minister is really inviting the adoption of measures of retaliation. An Opposition is not without some power in that respect. I do not think that Parliament is being treated fairly. Honorable members have in some cases, expressed views on this subject at variance with the policy of the party to which they belong, and they should be given the opportunity of making their position clear. But they will only have until 10 o'clock to-morrow evening to do so. It cannot be argued that there is any need for haste. The agreement need not be ratified until the 30th June, and we are only in the third month of the year. One might well utter the warning " Beware the Ides of March." This is a new Parliament, and many members of it have had no opportunity whatever to discuss the bill. I ask the Prime Minister to consider whether he is treating Parliament fairly. </para>

          <para>.- It is rather remarkable that the Prime Minister, of all men, should have introduced a motion like this. The inference conveyed by it is that the time  of Parliament is so <inline font-style="italic">limited that it</inline> must be rationed to ensure that certain measures shall be reasonably debated. Yet it is only a few weeks ago that we were informed that the Prime Minister was agreeable that Parliament should rise for a whole week in order that another body might deliberate in Canberra.  His  attitude then was strangely inconsistent with that which he now adopts. But there is a wider aspect of the subject. How can the Prime Minister know what new points may be brought to light during the debate on this bill? Neither he nor any one else can say with any certainty that the time proposed to be allotted for. considering the measure is in my sense adequate. There may be some virtue in taking steps to ensure that the time of Parliament shall be used to the best advantage, but suddenly to introduce a motion like this to specify the period for which this important bill shall be debated is unjustifiable. The Government has said from a thousand platforms that this is one of the most far reaching bills that this Parliament will be called upon to consider. I join with the Leader of the Opposition in protesting against the proposed procedure, and agree with him that the introduction of motions like this tends to create irritation. I opposed the rationing of time for the consideration of the Transport "Workers Bill, and I shall vote against it again on this occasion. </para>

          <para>.- If we are to believe the statements which have appeared in the press in relation to this bill, it is not only a highly contentious measure as between the members of the different parties in the House, but also as between the members of the different parties supporting the Government. It is quite conceivable that eight or ten Government supporters will wish to speak during the second-reading debate en the bill. Doubtless, the Treasurer will wish to discuss the subject, and so will the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart),</inline> the right honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> the honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse),</inline> the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mann),</inline> and the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell).</inline></para>

        <para class="block">The last mentioned has strenuously assailed the proposed agreement. In these circumstances, the motion is an insult to Parliament. Honorable members opposite should not tolerate it for a moment. The Labour party has vigorously opposed the ratification of the agreement on every platform in Australia, although it was favorable to the extension of the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth. I consider the introduction of the motion to be a political outrage, and if honorable members opposite support it they will disgrace Parliament. </para>

            <para>- The methods adopted by the Government in transacting the business of this Parliament are positively outrageous. I was glad that the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Collins)</inline> voted with the Labour party a few minutes ago against the application of the guillotine, and I trust that he will do so again. The method of conducting parliamentary debates has changed, and we, on this side of the House are being compelled to knuckle down to the party system, which has been instituted by the composite government. The combined parties opposite come to a decision, and the Government then forces its legislation through this House, paying no heed to any suggestions offered from this side of the chamber. The Government might just as well ask us to pass its legislation without any discussion at all. I object to the use of the guillotine on this bill. It is one of the most contentious measures that have been before this House, and an opportunity should be given to all honorable members to place their views upon it before the House.- </para>

          <para>.- I do not profess to know whether the time supposed to be allotted for the discussion of this measure will prove adequate or not: in so far I am in the same position as the Prime Minister himself. We differ in that I do not arrogate to myself the right to decide this question for other members. Let me submit one or two points for the consideration of the House. During the past three years of the regime of the Bruce-Page Government, Parliament has sat on 200 days, or an average of nine and a half weeks a year. If the Government had a record of colossal performance for those brief sittings, it might urge it in justification of keeping Parliament closed; but we know that the contrary is the case. During the first three years of the regime of the Bruce-Page Government - from 1922 to 1925 - Parliament sat only for 171 days, or an average of eight weeks a year. Thus the Parliament has sat for only 371 days in approximately six years, or not quite one year out of six years.

          <para>During the lifetime of Parliament, this Government has employed its strength mainly to keep itself safe, not to achieve anything great for the national good. It has not even produced an average proportion of legislation. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Under date of 16th April, 1928, this newspaper said : " Hosts of citizens are tired of the Government's dalliance and impotence." I am in agreement with the views so well expressed by a journal which gave discriminating support to the Government at the last election. Under date of 15th November, 1927, it said: "Australia has probably never had a Government which did less. " On the 16th March, 1928, it said : " The ardour of many once enthusiastic supporters has been chilled by the Government's record of achievement. " It is in these circumstances, and with this barren record, that the Prime Minister tells us now that his main object is by the operation of the guillotine machine to close the doors of Parliament as early as possible. It may be that the time allotted for the discussion of this bill will prove sufficient. We do not know to what extent honorable members opposite are interested in the measure in question. I am not in a position to say how many members on this side of the chamber have given serious consideration to. it and desire to express their opinions in speech. Those who have not hitherto thought of speaking on this subject may be moved by statements uttered during the debate, to make speeches. The measure goes to the very root of our constitution, and is important for both its historical and its practical associations. It is one to which the Government should be prepared to give, if not unlimited time, such time as may be found necessary for full discussion. The time required for this can be decided only by the debate itself. The. quality and standard of'the debate should determine the length of time to be taken. I make this protest because I feel that it should be made on every occasion when this particular circumstance arises, and because I consider that Parliament should be a deliberative assembly; it should not be merely a chamber recording the decisions of the Government or of caucus ; or the opinions of the composite body opposite, that conglomeration of inharmonious parties and sections of parties. </para>

          <para>. - I do not wish to encroach upon the time allotted to the debate, but I feel that I should place on record a few figures showing the actual time that has been spent on the Financial Agreement in this House, in order to show the feebleness of the contention of the Opposition that the bill should not be declared urgent. This measure was brought down to the' House as a new measure some eighteen months ago. Its  underlying principles were discussed from many angles, but the time occupied in the debate at all stages was only <inline font-style="italic">11%</inline> hours, and the debate terminated without any pressure. On this occasion the Government is offering honorable members the opportunity of debating the bill, at all stages, during 15^ hours. When the referendum measure, which dealt with this subject and its submission to the people, was before the House, it passed through all stages in one sitting. It is, therefore, obvious that the time now allotted by the Government is absolutely ample, particularly in view of the fact that the subject has been well canvassed in this House during the last two years. As to the statement of the honorable member for Batman <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan.)</inline> concerning the sittings of this House during the last six years, the fact is that the last Parliament, in three years, had 205 sittings of 1,657 hours. The preceding Parliament during three years had 166 sittings of 1,133 hours, an average over all of 62 sitting days or of 499 hours each year. But I find that the Queensland Parliament, during the last eight years, averaged only 47 sittings of 373 hours each year. The average for the Commonwealth Parliament during six years, was 62 sitting days or 499 hours a year. </para>

That sentiment had not long been expressed when the Treasurer was responsible for an exhibition which convinced every honorable member that the criticism of the right honorable member for North Sydney was fully justified. </para>

            <para>- The Treasurer has even forgotten that this is a new Parliament. He read from the pages of an old <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard</inline> to show that when this measure was before an earlier Parliament, a certain number of hours were devoted to its consideration. I remind him that since that time there has been a general election, at which there were a number of casualties among government members. If the nine new members who sit on this side had been elected as supporters of the Government, very strong opposition would have  been raised to this violent interference with the liberties of honorable members; but as the Government cannot forgive them for sitting in opposition to it, the very earliest opportunity is taken to prevent them from expressing their views upon this very important matter. The Treasurer has said that it is the most important measure which has ever been discussed in this House, and I largely agree with him; yet the Prime Minister claims that, on the grounds of urgency, the discussion of it must be curtailed! That has been completely answered by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin),</inline> who has pointed out that effect will not be given to it until the 30th June next. The urgency of the matter lies in the fact that certain honorable members opposite have to get away to the businesses they transact in other parts of the Commonwealth. I ask the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mann),</inline> the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> and the honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> to express their opinion of this proposal of the Government. When the measure was before the House last year, the honorable member for Forrest practically confined his remarks to its effect upon Western Australia. It would not be too much to ask that the time which the Government proposes to place at the disposal of all honorable members should be given to that honorable member, so that he might adequately express the views of his State. Of course, honorable members opposite cannot quarrel with the Government for having taken this step, because they are a party to it. They participated in a joint meeting, at which, I am told, the principal reason advanced for terminating the business of the session before Easter was that some honorable members have pressing business engagements in other parts of the Commonwealth. </para>

This is not the case.

          <para>. -  I join in the protest against the curtailment of the debate on this most important measure. During the progress of the present discussion a number of honorable members opposite interjected " Why waste time now?" I and other honorable members on this side realize that if we do not now register our protest we may be misunderstood by those whom we represent in this Parliament. It is not sufficient for us to go throughout our electorates and explain to our constituents that, because of the application of the guillotine by the Government, we were unable to speak on certain matters. The Financial Agreement Bill is one of the most important measures that has been before this Parliament since I have been a member of it. I was informed that the Prime Minister stated, during the recent election campaign, that I was asking for a negative vote on the referendum proposals, and that I did not oppose the Financial Agreement Bill or the referendum for the alteration of the Constitution proposals when they were before this Parliament. Those statements if made, were incorrect, and it is merely to give supporters of the Government an opportunity to promulgate similar misleading information about honorable members of the Opposition that the gag is now being applied. The Leader of the Opposition made a very fair suggestion to the Prime Minister. He said that this bill would be discussed mainly at the second-reading stage, as it would necessitate very little committee consideration. The Prime Minister received that suggestion in a most cavalier fashion and, instead of giving it attention, walked to the back benches and began a. conversation with the honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> who opposed the measure when it was before the House last year. That was an act of discourtesy. South Australia is represented by a very small number in this chamber, but this proposal vitally concerns it, as it does Western Australia and Tasmania also. Many of the representatives of each of those States have already opposed this measure. If the report which has been referred to by the honorable member for Boothby <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Price)</inline> is not brought before this Parliament before it adjourns, South Australian members will not know what the Government contemplates doing. Even those South Australian representatives who, for political considerations, do not oppose the measure, would at least like to place the case of South Australia before the House. That State has only seven representatives here, but if the Government allows only eleven speeches to be made on the second - reading of the bill, I and other South Australian representatives may be crowded out. It is against such procedure, which savours of indecent hurry, that I protest. This Parliament has sat now for four weeks, and proposes to continue for another three weeks only before going into a recess while the agreement need not be finalized until June next. Honorable members of the Opposition have signified their readiness to resume the session after the Easter adjournment, but the Government will not agree to this. The operations of the provisions of this Financial Agreement will take from South Australia  £31,000,000  in  58  years, and the bill to ratify it is being rushed through without giving honorable members representing that State an opportunity to protest against its passage. I hope that the Prime Minister will consider the suggestions made by the Leader of the Opposition. It is quite possible that, by a rigid enforcement of the Standing Orders, and because very little can be done in committee in connexion with this bill, extra time may be obtained, and the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition is a fair  one, and as such should receive consideration. The Treasurer referred to entirely irrelevant matters, and the Attorney-General did the same. They directed attention to the number of the sittings of the Queensland Parliament, which has nothing at all to do with us. This attempt of the Government to stifle discussion is an insult to new members, of whom, if they all spoke, there is a sufficient number on this side to exhaust nearly all the time which it is proposed to allot to the debate. </para>

            <para>- I am obliged to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> for taking the honorable member for Richmond to task for his irresponsible interruption. I am not repeating the remarks of other honorable members, but, knowing him as I do, I allow him a certain amount of latitude. Perhaps he was not in the chamber when the debate began. Undoubtedly, the honorable member, with the exception of one vote which he registered with the Opposition, has proved himself to be a party hack, and he is one of those responsible for the proposed curtailment of this debate. The point at issue is whether the debate on this measure is not of such importance that it should be prolonged so long as honorable members wish to address themselves to it. I contend that it is. The honorable member for Balaclava made a very fine speech in opposition to the financial agreement, before this Parliament transferred from Melbourne to Canberra. I know that many honorable members would like a similar contribution from him now. I recall the interesting figures which the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mann)</inline> recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> last year, which assisted this party so much during the election campaign. It would not be possible to deliver many such speeches in the twelve hours it is proposed to allot to the debate, and I hope that another day will be devoted to the discussion, in order that honorable members may have an opportunity to express themselves fully at the second-reading stage. </para>

            <para>.- The House has just decided that this is an urgent measure. In June, 1926, the Treasurer also deemed it to be an urgent measure. So urgent did he deem it then that he withdrew from the States the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments, amounting to £7,500,000 per annum, and the States were asked to re-impose taxation to that amount within one month. The Government has until the 30th June to ratify this agreement, yet it is proposed to treat it as an urgent measure. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The bill is to ratify an agreement entered into between the Commonwealth and the State Governments. This is a new Parliament, containing a number of new members elected to oppose this agreement, and from amongst those who sat on the opposite benches in the last Parliament we miss a number who supported it. We are, therefore, entitled to ask that this measure be considered anew by the present Parliament. If the agreement is ratified now it will be binding for 58 years, or until there is a unanimous agreement between the seven Governments of the Commonwealth and States of Australia to alter it. Honorable members know how difficult it will be to get unanimity on such a subject. There are some points connected with this bill which need to be made clear. In the first place, the rejection of the bill and the restoration of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments would not prevent the adoption of a scheme for the consolidation of the public debts. Also, the referendum taken during the last election did not ratify the Financial Agreement. This agreement embraces three main points, which should be treated separately. They are (1), the consolidation of public debts, with a unified borrowing authority; (2), the distribution of revenue by the Commonwealth to the States; (3), the payment of an increased rate of interest on transferred properties. The Treasurer, in a speech in Sydney the other day, as reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of the 5th of this month, said that the financial agreement was approved by an overwhelming majority of the electors. </para>

          <para class="block">The Prime Minister pays a poor compliment to the intelligence of the electors, and does not rate his own influence very highly. If the right honorable gentleman is right in believing that that is the electors' standard of intelligence, one can understand why . the Government was returned to office at the last elections. In order to show the foolishness of the Prime Minister's statement, let me point out what happened in five Labour strongholds in Victoria, namely, the divisions of Batman, Bourke, Maribyrnong, Melbourne, and Yarra. Those divisions polled 207,281 votes in the affirmative at the referendum, and 27,915 votes against, while for the Labour candidates they polled 161,831 votes, and 78,149 against. In my own electorate, where I made the statement that the carrying of the referendum would not involve the endorsement of the financial agreement, there was a majority of three to one in my favour and against my opponent, but there was a majority of 33,000 to 4,000 in favour of the issue submitted at the referendum.

              <para>- I shall quote extracts from a speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier</inline> to the honorable member's discomfiture shortly. The Prime Minister declared that the States had all ratified the financial agreement, and put that forward as a strong argument in favour of the bill. I propose, to quote extracts from speeches on this subject made by State premiers and representative men in State politics. It is true, as the Prime Minister has said, that the States have all ratified the agreement. They did so because it was the best they could get after the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments had been abolished. The point I wish to stress is that the proposal to withdraw the capitation grant was objected to by every State government and the opposition in every State parliament, as well as the Opposition in this Parliament and a large number of honorable members who to-day are behind the Government. When the bill to withdraw the capitation payment came before this House the whole of the Opposition objected to it, and we were supported by the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes),</inline> the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Stewart),</inline> the honorable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gregory),</inline> the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett),</inline> the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mann),</inline> the honorable member for Fawkner,(Mr. Maxwell), the honorable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Rodgers),</inline> the right honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> and the honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse).</inline></para>

          <para>The Prime Minister invited honorable members to read the views of State Labour premiers on the financial agreement, and quoted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier</inline> as having said that he preferred the agreement to the possibility of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment being abolished. Of course it is obvious that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier</inline> would prefer the agreement in suchcircumstances.

Of course when the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments were abolished the States were left at the will of any Commonwealth Government of the day as to what it might contribute to the States in future or whether it would contribute anything at all. </para>

But what are the facts? Under the agreement Tasmania received £304,370 in the first year. Under the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system that State would have received £267,367. These figures seem to indicate that under the agreement Tasmania, in the first year, benefited to the extent of £37,000 the" difference between the amount that would have been received under the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system and the amount actually paid under the agreement. "What the right honorable gentleman did not point out was that last year the grant to Tasmania was cut down from £378,000 to £220,000, a reduction of £128,000. It would appear, therefore, that whilst the Government apparently proposed to give Tasmania £37,000 extra under the agreement, actually that State last year received £158,000 less than it would have obtained if the capitation payments had been continued. The right honorable gentleman then spoke of the " amazing sympathy " which, he said, Opposition members were now showing for the States. I have listened to many speeches delivered by the Prime Minister, and on many occasions I have been able to expose his inaccuracies; but I venture' to say that his latest reference to the attitude of members on this side towards the States in their financial difficulties, transcended all his previous attempts to misrepresent us.

              <para>- The Prime Minister spoke of £3,000,000 in round figures, and declared that the Labour Government in 1911 deprived the States of that amount of revenue at one stroke. As a matter of fact the agreement in question was made between the then Prime Minister and the State Premiers. I have the document in my hand. It provides that <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments of 25s. shall take the place of the return of three-fourths of the customs and excise revenue under the Braddon section.

            <para>- Only one Labour representative advocated that the agreement should be embodied in the Constitution, and he was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carpenter,</inline> the then honorable member for Fremantle, who lost his seat. The only vital difference between the Deakin Government and the Labour party, was, not as to the amount of the payment, but as to whether the agreement should be embodied in the Constitution or be limited to a term of years. The Prime Minister is accustomed to make loose and inaccurate statements on the platform, and it is necessary for us to confute him with documents in this House. I have shown beyond the possibility of contradiction, who was responsible for taking from the States in one year this £3,000,000 mentioned by the Prime Minister and I shall now submit further documentary evidence to correct the Prime Minister's misrepresentations. I hold a copy of the bill introduced into the Federal Parliament by the Deakin Government on the 6th October, 1909 to provide for the payment of 25s. <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> to the States. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member is wrong. If he will compare the bill introduced by the Deakin Government on the 6th October, 1909, with that subsequently introduced by the Labour Government, he will find that both provided that the agreement should come into operation from the 1st July, 1910, but, whereas the Deakin bill proposed that the agreement should be embodied in the Constitution, the Labour party proposed to limit its operation to a period of ten years. The statement by the Prime Minister that the bill introduced in 1910 to endorse the agreement made by the Deakin Government with the States, took from the latter at one stroke nearly £3,000,000, is not an honest representation of what happened. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member should brush up his history. The Deakin Government at that time was the child of a fusion of the Liberal protectionists and the Free Trade section led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook. It represented a union of the anti-Labour forces of that day, as the present composite Government represents a union of the anti-Labour forces to-day. The second-reading of the bill which the Labour Government introduced in 1910, was carried without a division, on the 19th July, <inline font-style="italic">vide Hansard,</inline> page 513. Because the bill was merely a proposal to endorse the agreement made by the Deakin Government, no anti-Labour members voted against the second-reading; yet the present Prime Minister says it is extraordinary that such sympathy should be shown the States by a party which took away from them nearly £3,000,000 at one stroke! Even the clause which provided for the payment of 25s. per head and set out the date upon which the arrangement should come into operation, was carried on the voices on the 20th July, 1910, <inline font-style="italic">vide Hansard,</inline> page 589. This bill of 1910 should be framed alongside the Prime Minister's speech as a warning to others to avoid monstrous misrepresentation on an important matter affecting the relations of the Commonwealth and the States. Let the States remember that the original agreement was made by the Deakin Government, and not one supporter ofMr. Deakin opposed the ratifying measure introduced by the Labour Government in 1910. </para>

          </continue><para>I repeat that the recent referendum did not endorse the agreement that is now before us; that document was not submitted to the people. The eulogies by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer of the consolidation of debts and the future control of borrowing are beside the question; those features of the agreement are not affected by our advocacy of the restoration of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments. Last year I spoke in cordial support of the consolidation, of the debts, the control of future borrowing, and the establishment of a common Australian stock. Upon those features of the agreement there is no difference of opinion between honorable members opposite and those on this side of the House. But we propose, as an alternative to the present agreement a new one, providing for the consolidation of the debts, the unification of borrowing, and the establishment of a loan council, but on the basis of the payment by the Commonwealth to the States of 25s. per head per annum. The Prime Minister asked for a statement of the Labour party's attitude on this matter, and by interjection, I asked him why he had not read the Labour party's platform, a copy of which I had sent him at the request of his secretary. We are not ashamed of our platform, and I thought that the perusal of it might be edifying to the right honorable gentleman. One plank of it frankly declares that pending an alteration of the Constitution to change the respective functions . and responsibilities of the Commonwealth and the States, there shall be no interference with the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments. </para><para class="block">In the policy speech I delivered as Leader of the Labour party at the last election, I said that the Labour party strenuously opposed the withdrawal of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments from the States. We have not changed our attitude upon that question in the slightest degree, and as the payment to the States was 25s. per head, we still stand for that payment. To suggest that we did not know what the amount would be is paltry quibbling. What we put before the people was that we stood for the retention of the payment of 25s. per head to the States, and the making of a new agreement with them in respect of the consolidation of the public debts. The Prime Minister admits that there is ground for this criticism of the bill, that it pledges the revenues of the Commonwealth too far ahead. In my opinion, the Commonwealth Parliament should be unfettered in its expenditure except, perhaps, for a limited period such as was provided for in 1910,or by. pledges made to the electors. The consolidation of the debts and the control of borrowing necessitate a permanent arrangement with the States. There is not the flexibility in those matters that there ought to be in an agreement relating to the distribution of revenue. This Parliament should retain control of the collection and distribution of its own revenue, and if the Prime Minister is so confident that he has the support of the States in regard to this agreement, and that they were not forced into accepting it when they found the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments gone, let him invite them to another conference on the basis of the restoration of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments and the making of a new agreement relating to the consolidation of the debts and control of future borrowing. </para><interjection>

              <para>- My suggestion is that the original position in regard to the payment of 25s. per head to the States should be restored, and that we should then take up with the States, in a better atmosphere, the question of the consolidation of the debts and the unified control of borrowing, and, incidentally, the contribution the Commonwealth may be expected to make towards the sinking funds of the States. The Treasurer is confident that his scheme is the best, and the Prime Minister is satisfied that the States are with him, but I challenge the Government to go to the States with the alternative proposal I have made. </para>

              <para>- I agree that as the present Government has been the first since 1910 to make the States nervous and fearful of this Parliament, it may be necessary to have a fixed but limited term for the payment of the 25s. per head in order to remove their fears. I would agree for that reason only to have a fixed term. It would tide the States over a period when a dangerous Government like the present might be in power in the Commonwealth. Until there is an alteration of the Constitution, carrying with it a redistribution of the functions and responsibilities of the Commonwealth and the States, there should be no interference with the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments, but a new agreement could be made with respect to the unification of debts and control of borrowing. The present Government by its meddling with an arrangement which at the time was giving satisfaction has created feelings of jealousy and unrest between the great governing bodies of the Commonwealth and the States. </para>

              <para>- Yes, and that is fraught with danger. The idea of consolidating debts is not new, but as I dealt with that in my previous speech, I need not speak of it now except to say that since the beginning of federation, one Treasurer after another has advocated that the State Governments should be asked to agree to the consolidation of debts. The present Government has been fortunate in that, during its term of office and for the first time in the history of these negotiations, five out of six State Governments were Labour, and we all know that for years Labour has advocated the consolidation of the debts and the unified control of borrowing in order to bring about economy in the raising of loans. </para>

              <para>- We could have induced the States to come to an agreement with us regarding the consolidation of the debts, the States to meet the interest charges on their own debts, and to provide their own sinking fund contributions towards their liquidation, without there being any interference with the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments. If there is warrant for the Commonwealth making a contribution to the sinking funds of the States, as an encouragement to the consolidation  of the debts or the strengthening of the States' sinking funds, I do not think there would be any opposition to it from this Parliament. But I do not hold that such sinking fund contributions should apply to future State loans, in addition to the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments. The Commonwealth's contribution in that respect was to be merely an offset against the saving it effected by not having to make <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments which must increase with the increase of population in the States. There is nothing wrong in the Commonwealth and the States entering into an agreement for the consolidation of the debts, and the formation of a loan council with a Commonwealth sinking fund contribution to extinguish the indebtedness of the States, as  well  as that of the Commonwealth. But it is the business of the States to meet the interest payments on their own debts, just as it is the business of the Commonwealth to give the States an equitable share of the customs revenue it collects. In these circumstances, the retention of the payments of 25s. a head to the States would have been equitable ; but, now that unrest has been caused by the withdrawal of these payments, we should take steps to restore them for a fixed, but limited, period of years, and so render the position of the States more secure than it would otherwise be. To bind this Parliament for 58 years to contribute certain sums out of revenue without deciding, first of all, what shall be the functions performed by the Commonwealth and the States in future, is wrong and unsound. <inline font-style="italic">No</inline> one has urged more than the present Government has done the need for a revision of the Constitution. In his policy-speech of three years ago, the Prime Minister pledged himself and his party to the holding of a constitutional session for a complete revision of the Constitution. If that revision had been made and the respective responsibilities and functions of the Commonwealth and the States had been defined, I could understand the making of a permanent arrangement in regard to their financial relations. But this change  not having been made, and as no one can say what will be the respective responsibilities or functions of the Commonwealth or the States ten years from now, to pledge ourselves to make a fixed contribution to the States for 58 years is to take from this Parliament the control of its own finances. </para>

          <para class="block">The proposals in this bill, which I have consistently opposed, are the most extraordinary that could be submitted to this Parliament. When the legislation which this measure purports to validate was first introduced, it was contrary to the principles advocated by all parties represented in this Parliament. It was a definite plank in the Nationalist party's platform that the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments to the States should be preserved. That plank was afterwards removed. The Country party's platform repudiated the abolition of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments to the States until certain radical alterations of the Constitution were made. And, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, the platform of the Labour party contained a similar provision. As a matter of fact, honorable members two years ago fought tooth and nail for the retention of these payments, and I can hardly understand, now that they have the opportunity to restore them, how some honorable members can go back on what they then advocated, or how they can deny arguments which they then advanced. Ever since the election, we have been stormed by assertions from the platform and the press that honorable members have no right further to oppose the ratification of the financial agreement, because their masters, the people, have decided in favour of '.it. That is not correct. The Leader of the Opposition has effectively countered that argument; but I shall advance a few more reasons why it should not be assumed that the issue has been determined in that sense. To understand the meaning of the referendum vote we must consider the conditions under which it was taken. We may do this by studying the statements made prior to the election by the leaders of the various parties. The </para>

            <para>The approval of the referendum by the people does not involve the acceptance of the financial agreement itself, but will merely give the Commonwealth a general power to make agreements with the States in regard to public debts and borrowing.

          <para>Nothing could be clearer than that. It is quite evident that the Prime Minister did not expect his followers who voted " Yes " to the question submitted at the referendum necessarily to commit themselves to the agreement. Yet in moving the second reading of this bill the right honorable gentleman said - </para>
          <quote>

          </quote>
          <para>No conviction could possibly be based upon a weaker foundation. I ask honorable members to consider for a few moments why the Prime Minister was so careful during the election campaign to draw a distinction between approving of the referendum and approving of the agreement. I am convinced that the reason was that he felt that unless the people looked at the two questions separately they would vote against the referendum for they did not intend to endanger the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> grant. Many Nationalist supporters expressed to' me personally their abhorrence of the financial agreement, but said that as the Prime Minister had regarded the two questions as entirely distinct they were willing to vote for the referendum. The people were told quite clearly that the abolition of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> -payments was not involved in voting for the referendum. In these circumstances the Prime Minister is not entitled to assume that because the referendum was approved the financial agreement was also approved. Two  ques-  tions were really submitted to the people in the referendum. One of them involved the granting of additional powers and the other the restoration or otherwise of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments. The second question was not directly stated, but it was certainly implied. The Leader of the Opposition made it clear to the last Parliament and also to the electors, that although the Labour party was favorable to the granting of additional powers to the Commonwealth, it was absolutely committed to the restoration of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments. We have been told that an overwhelming majority of the people favoured the agreement, but I propose to analyze the figures to demonstrate that this was not so. Fortunately it is possible to do this by a means which admits of hardly any question. I propose to take the total number of first preference votes cast for the candidates of the respective parties, and to argue that the first preferences given to Labour party candidates were without any question given in favour of the restoration of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments, for this was an important plank of the Labour platform. </para>

              <para>- The recent referendum clearly demonstrated the approval of the people to the granting of additional financial powers to the Commonwealth; but instead of the vote being taken as a confirmation of the financial agreement, it must be regarded as distinctly disapproving of it and favouring a restoration of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment. The large " yes " vote recorded in the referendum may be divided into two parts. We may assume that the Labour " yes " votes were cast in favour of the restoration of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment, and the antiLabour votes in favour of the financial agreement. The error in assuming those two facts is no greater in the one case than in the other. If we compare the figures - and I shall quote them as supplied by the Commonwealth Electoral Department - we shall ' find that certain facts emerge. In New South Wales the " yes " votes cast totalled 754,444, and the total first preference votes cast for the Labour party in the Senate election, which is a fair basis of calculation, was 604,272, or a majority of the " yes " votes in f  favour  of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment of no less than 454,098. In Victoria the "yes"votes totalled 791,425, and the total of Labour's first preferences for the Senate was 427,079, or a majority of 62,733 " yes " votes for the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment in that State. In South Australia the "yes" votes totalled 164,628, and the total of the Labour first preferenceswas 134,731, or a majority of 104,834 " yes " votes for the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment. In Western. Australia the "yes" vote totalled 96,913, and the total of the Labour first preferences was 75,735, or a majority of 54,557 "yes" votes for the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment. In Tasmania the "yes" vote totalled 62,722, and the total of the Labour first preferencewas 33,250, or a majority of 3,778 " yes " votes for the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment. In one State only, namely, Queensland,were the votes cast the other way. In that State the total of the " yes " voteswas 367,257, and the total of the Labour first preferences 147,351, or a majority of 72,455 against the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment. In analysing the " yes " votes in this manner, which I think honorable members will agree is perfectly straightforward and justifiable, it will be seen that five of the six States cast a majority of votes in favour of the restoration of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment. </para>

              <para>- I have given the figures as supplied by the Electoral Department, and I shall be glad to show the honorable member how I arrive at my conclusion. If we take the total for the whole of Australia Ave find that the majority of " yes " votes in favour of the continuance of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system is no less than 607,445, and that five of the six States voted the same way. In  view  of these figures I fail entirely to see that there is any foundation for the assertion that the recent referendum has shown an overwhelming approval of the financial agreement. I admit that it has shown an overwhelming approval of an increase in the powers to be vested in the Commonwealth, but as soon as we analyse the subsidiary or second issue we find that the people voted against the Government's proposal. </para>

              <para>- That is a matter of opinion. I speak of what I knowwas the case in my own State. The agreement is divided into two parts. One relates to fixed contributions as against the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment, and the other to the arrangement of loans and the consolidation of debts. There are many persons who voted "Yes" because they thought that the disadvantages associatedwith fixed payments, as against the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment, might be out- weighed by the greater advantages accruing from the consolidation of debts and proper loan management. I do not agree with that view; but I point out that the amendment which I have moved makes it quite possible for those members to give effect to their desire, without having the financial agreement foisted upon them. The terms of my amendment arc that the bill be withdrawn with a view to the Government submitting to the States a revised State Debts Agreement, which shall include the restoration of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment of 25s. per head for a period of at least ten years. That will still leave the consolidation of debts and proper loan management to be dealt with ; but it . provides that, instead of fixed payments, the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system shall be restored. </para>

              <para>- If a majority of honorable members vote for the amendment, it will not commit them to the abolition of the proposed arrangement with regard to the Loan Council or debt control, of which many of them approve. I think, however, that the advantages of the Loan Council and debt control have been tremendously exaggerated, as I shall show later; but if a majority of honorable members favour the proposed system of handling the State debts and conducting the Loan Council, and at the same time are opposed to the continuance of the <inline font-style="italic">par capita</inline> system, they can achieve their objective by supporting the amendment. </para>

          <para>By a strange coincidence, it will be exactly a year to-morrow since I last spoke in this House on the financial agreement. I then submitted a number of figures to show what I thought would be the detrimental effect of this agreement upon State finances. I do not propose to quote those figures again, but honorable members will perhaps allow me to remind them that I then said that the total losses to the States during the currency of this agreement, as compared with the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system, would be about £320,000,000. </para>

              <para>- Yes, the conditions and methods of calculation were carefully set out. The figures which I then adduced have been answered, categorically, only on one occasion, and that was by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Latham)</inline> on 15th March of last year. This is the first opportunity I have had of replying to the statements he then made. The Attorney-General traversed my speech very carefully - it was a compliment to me that he thought it necessary to do so - and dealt with every point, putting the best construction he could, as one would expect him to do, on the different aspects of the agreement. I admit that while I concluded that the loss to the States would be £320,000,000, there were certain factors covered by the agreement that could not be accurately . estimated, such as contributions to new loans. The Attorney-General, after a justifiable assumption of what these would be, concluded that my figures were very much over-estimated. He made out a sound and a clever case from the Government's viewpoint. I do not think his figures are accurate, but I am prepared to accept them and to argue the position from his case instead of from my own. The Attorney-General summed up his analysis of my figures by admitting that under the proposed new arrangement the States would lose £158,000,000. </para>

              <para>- That is not the point. We were comparing the relative effects of these two systems upon the States, and to do that it was necessary to take the two over similar periods. We could not do anything else. My comparison covers the period of the agreement, and that is the only sensible way of comparing the two systems. The Attorney-General admitted that the loss to the States under the new arrangement was £158,000,000, and I suggest to honorable members that even that loss is sufficiently serious to make us pause before entering into the financial agreement, which, on my figures, represents a loss of from £2,500,000 to £3,000,000 a year to the States. </para>

              <para>- The difference between my figures and the Attorney-General's figures arises out of the contributions in respect of new loans which can be estimated but not definitely stated. I have said that I am prepared to accept the Attorney-General's figures, although they are not so favorable to my case as are my own, but they are quite sufficient to warrant honorable members pausing before accepting such an arrangement as this. </para>

              <para>- Then the federation should exist only for a term of years. At the time of federation there was no suggestion of an arrangement such as the present financial agreement.Were the States and the people of Australia invited to join the federation under a delusion? Surely it was thought that there would be some permanency in the undertakings and engagements entered into between the Commonwealth and the States. How bitterly the States must now regret their action in joining the federation. </para>

          <para>The Attorney-General just now interjected somewhat on the lines of the point that he made when he criticized my analysis of the agreement. He then complained that I was comparing certainty with uncertainty. It has repeatedly been stated that the Government is, under this arrangement, bringing about certainty instead of uncertainty. The question of certainty or uncertainty has nothing to do with the merits of these two arrangements. If it were merely a question- of certainty, this House, this Parliament, this Government could have given as much certainty to the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system as has been given to this agreement. That entirely rests in the hands of the Government. To say that one is certain and the other uncertain, is merely to drag a herring across the trail. It was quite possible for this Government to recommend that the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system should be made certain. It was only a question of determining which was the more just method, and that is what I am now arguing. Whenever that is decided, let the Government use its power and influence to give to the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system, if that is considered to be the more just, the certainty that it proposes to give to the financial agreement. </para>
          <para>I am quite satisfied that this arrangement, compared with the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment, will mean an immense loss to the States. We have been told that we have no right to consider that point now, because the agreement has been definitely accepted by the States. That point was fully dealt with by the Leader of the Opposition to-day. I have no desire to take up the time of the House by traversing the ground covered by that honorable member, but I wish to emphasize one point that he -made regarding my own State. I have been told that, because the Premier of Western Australia has accepted the agreement, I have no right to take up this subject again and to persist in my attitude. Under what terms and conditions did he accept the agreement? That has been fully demonstrated to-day. Although the Premier of Western Australia was compelled to accept this agreement, during the recent campaign he threw his weight, influence, and voice on the side of the restoration of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system. The decision of the Government and Parliament of Western Australia, wrenched from them by compulsion, will not deter me for a moment from fighting to the last for what I think is just for my own State. We have been told again and again by the Government that the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system was unsatisfactory, because the Commonwealth had to make the larger payments to the more populous and wealthy States. There is an extraordinary idea behind that contention. Are not contributions of revenue made in proportion to the population and wealth of the States, and should not the Commonwealth return revenue to the States in the same proportion? I am not out to make any unfair claim on behalf of Western Australia against the interests of the other States. If my State gets into serious financial difficulty, it is the duty of the Commonwealth, under the Constitution, to come to its assistance, and not to institute a regular system under which the smaller and less wealthy States will gain an advantage over the larger States. The Government's argument that the new arrangement will enable greater assistance to be given to the needy States has to-day been answered by the honorable member for Yarra, who instanced the case of Tasmania. It is only right that the bigger States should get the bigger share of the revenue. </para>
          <para>I shall now refer to that part of the agreement relating to the Loan Council and the raising of loans. The remarks which I made in my previous speech on this subject were answered by the Treasurer on the 21st March last year. He claimed that the arrangement with the Loan Council and its management of our debts had greatly improved the credit of Australia, and to support his argument he quoted the ruling market prices of Australian stock. That is no criterion of credit. The real criterion is the response to the loan at the time of flotation. I wish to give honorable members a few startling facts to show in what way and how much the credit of Australia has been affected by the operations of the Loan Council. In my previous speech I pointed out that one of the difficulties of the Loan Council would be that it would be placing large loans on the London market beyond the absorptive power of that market at the time of flotation, and that this would compel it to depend more and more upon the underwriters. I shall read to honorable members the results of flotation since 1927, all all of which are included in the operations of the Loan Council. It will be understood that when a loan is underwritten by the big financial houses, they undertake that the Government shall get the money at a certain charge. If the public take it up avidly, that is evidence that the credit of the Government stands high, but if, on the other hand, a large portion of the' loan is left on the underwriters' hands at the time of the flotation, then the loan is beyond the absorptive power of the market. It may also be unpopular to a certain extent, because of more attractive issues being available at the time. Afterwards the underwriters gradually unload their stocks on the market as opportunity offers, and so profit themselves. On the 8th July, 1927, a loan of £7,000,000 was floated in London at a minimum price of £98, with interest at 5 per cent., and 89 per cent, of it was left on the underwriters' hand3. On the 25th November, 1927, a loan of £7,500,000 was floated at the reduced price of £97 10s., with interest at 5 per cent., and 75 per cent, of it was left on the underwriters' hands. On the 7th March, 1928, a loan of £8,000,000 was floated at £98, with interest at 5 per cent., and 84.4 per cent, of that loan was left on the underwriters' hands. On the 1st May, 1928, the American loan of 52,000,000 dollars was floated at £92 10s., with interest at 4^ per cent. "We know the disastrous result of that loan. In 1928 large lots were being sold on the London market at a price as low as £84 per 100. On the 17th July, 1928, a loan of £7,000,000 was floated at £98, with interest at 5 per cent., and 87 per cent, of it was left on the underwriters' hands. In December, 1927, the big conversion loan of £36,000,000 was floated in Australia, and although the market was kept open, I think, for months, £10,000,000 out of £36,000,000 was left on the hands of the banks which had underwritten the loan. By way of comparison, let me say that on the 25th April, 192S, amidst all these other transactions, a loan of £3,000,000 was raised for "Western Australia at £98, with interest at 5 per cent., and the loan was immediately oversubscribed by the public. In January of this year a loan of £8,000,000 was floated by the Commonwealth at £98, with interest at 5 per cent., and 84 per cent, of it was left on the underwriters' hands. "We are told that this arrangement for the management of loans is heartily approved by financial circles and authorities. Upon inquiry as to who the financial authorities are, we are referred to quotations from one or two financial papers published in London. I suggest that these authorities are, in fact, very closely associated with the great financial houses which underwrite the loans. That they will approve of such a method of floating loans there can be little doubt. As the underwriting expenses in London amounted to 25s. per cent., the cost of floating the loan of £8,000,000 issued in January last was £100,000, which, added to the £160,000 lost to the Commonwealth owing to the loan having been floated at £98, represents a loss of £260,000 to the Commonwealth and a profit of the same amount to the underwriters, if they unload at par, in connexion with that loan. Instead of obtaining £8,000,000, the Commonwealth received only £7,740,000. </para>

              <para>- I realize that; but I am dealing with the main items in order not to complicate the position. The prospectus stated that the loan was an excellent investment, because at £98 it represented a return to the investor of £5 2s. 3d. per cent. Actually, it cost the Commonwealth £5 3s. 4d. per cent., if we take into account the amount which it did not receive, but upon which it pays interest. The underwriting expenses of the £7,000,000 loan now being floated in Australia will not be so great, for the bank changes in Australia are only 10s. per cent. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth will pay £35,000 in underwriting expenses, an investor at par will get £5 5s. per cent., while the Commonwealth will pay £5 5s. 6d. per cent. In considering these matters, we should not forget that a financier who underwrites a loan floated at £98 may unload it on the public at par, so that on every £1,000,000 he makes a profit of £20,000. Is it any wonder that these transactions are favorably commented on in the London financial market? That is the point I wish to emphasize. </para>

          <para>I mention these things to show that some of the objections I raised on a previous occasion to the composition of the Loan Council, and to its operations, have been confirmed by subsequent experience. Even if we agree that there should be a loan council - and in that matter I am prepared to accept the advice of men experienced in financial matters - I suggest that its methods require a good deal of alteration. The practice of unloading big loans on the London market beyond the absorptive power of that market has been referred to frequently. It benefits no one but the underwriters; it certainly does not benefit the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>- I have not been able to see any advantage in having only one borrower. This is due to the way loans are managed. If loans were gradually floated on the London market, as they would be if floated by the States separately, I feel certain that better terms would be obtained. A great deal depends upon the way in which the money is spent. The real reason why Commonwealth loans have not been floated on so satisfactory a basis as those issued by the States is that the management of Commonwealth loans is not regarded as satisfactory by investors. The question before us is too big to be dealt with on party lines ; but I feel that, in moving my amendment, I am only carrying out the policy of the party to -which I belong. Being convinced of the equity of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments I pledged myself during the recent election campaign to do all in my power to restore them if reelected. </para>

              <para>- With one exception, every Western Australian candidate, for either House, who was successful in the recent election, expressed himself as being opposed to the financial agreement and in favour of the restoration of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments. I am convinced that my pledge to the electors in relation to the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments was one of the reasons why they gave me such support, that the consensus of opinion in Western Australia is in favour of the restoration of those payments, and that the people of that State will be grievously disappointed if other arrangements are substituted for them. I am convinced also that the result of the referendum proposals has been misrepresented, and that if the figures are properly analysed they will show that the people of Australia are of the opinion that the finances of the States should be placed on a firmer foundation by the restoration of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments. The great majority of the people resent the idea of having £158,000,000 taken from them. </para>

              <para>- Money raised by the Commonwealth on behalf of the' States is being absorbed by the Commonwealth, the excuse being that it is necessary to do so because of the commitments of the Commonwealth. Many of those commitments represent extravagances. Money has been spent by the Commonwealth in directions which amount to an intrusion by it on the rights and functions of the States. The taxpayers of the States, who are in close touch with their local governments and are feeling the pinch of extra taxation imposed to make up the shortage of funds, feel that they are not being fairly treated by the Commonwealth. I am afraid that there is a great deal of truth in the statement made this afternoon that the control of financial matters by the Commonwealth has created a feeling of disturbance and distrust in the States which will take a long time to eradicate, and will do a great deal to prevent stable government in Australia. On all the grounds I have mentioned, I am opposed to the agreement and I, therefore, commend my amendment to the House. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member for Perth claims to speak on behalf of the States, but a careful consideration of the position will reveal that the adoption of the method he has proposed for delaying the ratification of this agreement, would injure rather than assist the States. When the agreement has been validated by this Parliament, the States will obtain a measure of constitutional security, for a term of 58 years, which they do not at present possess. The constitutional amendment that was agreed to by the people at the last referendum makes it possible for any future proposal that is mutually acceptable to all of the governments in Australia to be substituted for this agreement. The real safeguard of the States lies in the immediate validation of this agreement, because when that has been done they will occupy a constitutional and statutory position which they do not hold at the present time. Consequently those who really desire to safeguard the interests of the States should support the validation of the agreement. At a later stage I shall show that the action of the Opposition is designed to continue a state of uncertainty and dependence of the States on the Commonwealth, which is in accordance with both the history and traditions of the Labour party. </para>

              <para>- Strictly speaking, the honorable member is quite right. All honorable members should turn to and address the Chair; but owing to the design of this House, it is not possible for either the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition when speaking at the table to do so. The Treasurer appears to be addressing honorable members in the right hand corner of the chamber, and it is exceedingly difficult to hear him. If he would face towards the centre of the chamber it would be better for all. </para>

              <para>- The only way to overcome the difficulty would be to use <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker's</inline> rostrum. The honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mann)</inline> has suggested that in the raising of loans the results achieved by the Australian Loan Council are not so good as those which would be obtained by the different State Governments acting individually. The complete answer to that is that during the last five years there has been in existence in Australia a voluntary Loan Council, to which every State Treasurer whose instinct is to get the best terms he can for his State, as well as the Commonwealth Treasurer, has gone when it was necessary to raise a loan. They have done so because of their practical experience of the benefits of a Loan Council. It is suggested that the fact that our loans have not been oversubscribed is an indication of bad financing. A long list has been given of loans, of which 70 per cent, or 80 per cent, has been left on the hands of the underwriters, and it has been contended that because of that fact we have not financed soundly and wisely. The right honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> will appreciate^ the fact tha.t when a loan is very largely over-subscribed, it is an indication that the terms offered are too favorable to the investor and nor sufficiently in the interest of the public. "What is the position at the present time in regard to Australian stocks in both London and New York? A month or so ago we floated in London a loan, of which 84 per cent, was left in the hands of the underwriters. It was issued at £08, and carried interest at the rate of 5 per cent. Just immediately prior to the placing of that loan on the market there were issues for both India and New Zealand, which were heavily oversubscribed. Since that time there has been an increase in the bank rate, with the result that the majority of the loans on the London market have slightly receded. The Australian loan, however, is still standing practically at the price of issue; whereas both the New Zealand and Indian loans have receded a couple of points. Therefore, our credit is relatively in a much more favorable position. Our experience has been of a similar nature in connexion with the loan issued last year in New York at £92 10s., and an interest rate of 4$ per cent. It is true that subsequent to the flotation of that loan there was in the United States of America a very heavy slump, which affected all stocks throughout the length and breadth of that country. But the latest quotations received showed that Canadian and even American stocks had depreciated more than Australian stocks, compared with the position which they occupied some months before the slump took place. Just before the slump they were in a better position than we were, but at the present time their position is relatively not as good. These facts indicate that we have done extraordinarily well in having obtained in London and New York all the money we needed at rates which were in the public interest. The maintenance of our position and the support accorded to us show that the public themselves appreciate that fact. </para>

              <para>- The time which is taken up with these numerous points of order should be. added to that which I am allowed under the Standing Orders, so that I may have a reasonable opportunity to make out a  case  in reply to that of honorable members opposite, who were given an absolutely fair deal by this side of the House, and were listened to in silence. The Leader of the Opposition can be most effectively answered by contrasting the circumstances of the Government, which seeks to validate the agreement, with those of the Opposition, which seeks to destroy it, by comparing the proposals of the Government with those of the Opposition for dealing with the important problemsinvolved, and by examining their effect upon the Commonwealth and the Statesand the attitude of the States and the  people of Australia to these proposals. Such a review would prove beyond doubt that at the present juncture the proper procedure is to validate the agreement. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue><para>What is the position which the Government occupies in regard to this matter? I submit that it is a very strong one. It comes to this House fresh from an election with its policy endorsed by a majority of the electorates. An important feature of the policy was the validation of this agreement. When I outlined at Grafton the financial policy for the Government I said - </para><quote>
            <para>If the referendum is accepted, the Government is pledged to validate the agreement, and thereafter the States will have an absolute guarantee of defined future assistance from the Commonwealth, and the Loan Council will be established on a permanent basis. As it has taken the experience of 27 years of federation and many years of pre-federal discussion to arrive at this agreement, the Commonwealth Government confidently appeals, not merely for an affirmative vote on the referendum, but for an endorsement of its policy in this regard. </para>
          </quote><para class="block">It will thus be seen that the matter was placed before the people in the most unequivocal terms. We asked not only for an affirmative vote on the referendum, but also for an endorsement of our policy. We came back, not only with this policy endorsed by a majority of the electors, but also with the agreement signed hy all the State Premiers and ratified by all the State Parliaments. In addition, it has operated with universal satisfaction for nearly two years. The Government came back to Parliament with an amendment of the Constitution that was necessary to enable this agreement to be carried into effect - a constitution amendment approved by a three to one majority in all the States, the actual figures being " Yes " 2,237,391, and "No", 773,852. That demonstrates that the people of Australia strongly desire the permanent settlement of this vexed and doubtful question. The approval of the referendum and the return of this Government to power, together, provide a mandate for the validation of the agreement. In the United States of America, which has a federal system of government on all-fours with that of Australia, assent to any constitutional amendment by three-fourths of the State Parliaments is sufficient to carry that amendment. Here, we have  a  pro posed constitutional amendment and  an  agreement which have been accepted by the Parliaments of all the States of Australia in every case by substantial majorities. The  Government,  therefore, has the authority both of the States and the people of Australia in proposing to validate this agreement. The position of the Opposition, however, is weak indeed. When the Leader of the Opposition and his party went before the people at the last elections, they placed this matter in the forefront of their policy. In his policy speech, the Leader of the Opposition said - </para><quote>
            <para>The carrying of the referendum will not ratify the financial agreement entered into recently. The agreement will come before the next Federal Parliament for acceptance or rejection. </para>

The people of Australia, having heard both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, returned them to Parliament without changing their positions. The Leader of the Opposition now seeks to revive a dead issue. He comes to this House with a proposal, not to amend the agreement, but to destroy it. In that he has not the backing of one State Parliament or Government. The Government on the other hand, comes forward with an agreement, which has been approved and signed by every Premier in Australia. Although certain Labour Pre- miers supported the Leader of the Opposition in his election campaign, not one of them, when on the hustings, advocated a return to the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments in lieu of the present financial agreement. The Leader  of  the Opposition possesses no mandate from the State Governments or the people in this matter, and in view of his position in the House he has no opportunity to negotiate with the States for a new agreement.

The honorable gentleman went to a great deal of trouble to show that it was an anti-Labour, and not a Labour Government which took that action. But he forgot to mention that the agreement to which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> and six members of State ministries subscribed their names did not anticipate the continuance of a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payment for a term of ten years, but the incorporation of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments in the Constitution.

The right honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt),</inline> who for so many years ably helped to guide the destinies of Victoria, can bear me out when I say that in practically all the discussions that took place between the Commonwealth and State Governments on this matter between 1901 and 1910, the States asked not for a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> grant, but for the return of a certain proportion of the customs revenue. At one time the request was for three-quarters of that revenue. In 1909, just a few months before the system of <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments came into force, the States asked not for such a system, but for three-fifths of the customs and excise revenues. They accepted the system of <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments only when it was found that the sands of the " Braddon blot " provision were running out; that their constitutional safeguard was expiring, and that the proposed <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments afforded them the only practical opportunity to safeguard their financial interests. If one examines the various suggestions that have been made by different State Premiers from time to time one will find that, in 1905, a request was made that section 87 of the Constitution should be amended so as to make the Braddon clause perpetual, and secure the return to the States of three-fourths of the revenue from customs and excise, and that, subject to the foregoing, the whole of the State debts be taken over by the Commonwealth. Just as that resolution dealt primarily with the double problem of providing financial assistance to the States, and of the transference of State debts, so - and here the right honorable member for Balaclava, who was present at many of these conferences can bear me out - nearly every discussion that has taken place on these problems made no endeavour to separate the two matters. The endeavour always was to settle them together. </para><interjection>

The two matters again appeared together. It is true that there was an agreement between the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth and the Premiers of the different States in 1909, which contemplated the perpetual financial security of the States by the continuance of the <inline font-style="italic">p&amp;r capita</inline> payment of 25s.; but when the Labour party came into power in the Commonwealth Parliament in 1910, it gave the States security only for ten years. Incidentally, that Labour Government made the financial position of the States worse to the extent of £2,800,000. As against that, this Government has increased the payments to the States by no less than £900,000, and it is universally admitted that, at least for the next ten years, the financial position of the States will be better than heretofore. In addition to giving the States financial security, this agreement does not interfere with the rights of any State, as it is provided that if a mutual agreement can be arrived at between the Commonwealth and the several States, any new agreement may be substituted. </para><interjection>

              <para>- I am simply dealing with my own case. What will be the position, if the agreement is rejected, as it will be if the amendment of the honorable member for Perth is carried? That will mean that we must start out again on the rough and tempestuous sea on which we have been voyaging for the last 28 years, and again endeavour to find a satisfactory means for the taking over of the debts of the States, and securing that a certain amount of the revenue collected by the Commonwealth shall go to the States in lieu of the old customs and excise revenue, and the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments which followed the original financial provision of the Constitution. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue><para>If we contrast the schemes put forward by the Government and by the Opposition, we shall see how much more favorable to the States is that of the Government. The Government proposals are for the consolidation of the public debt and a common control of borrowing. There is at present in operation a control of borrowing by the Loan Council. This is acceptable to all the States, and has now worked successfully for five years. This principle is accepted by the Labour party, but if the agreement is rejected, the Labour party must devise a new and acceptable means of giving effect tq their scheme for unified borrowing. In the provision of sinking funds, the Government is prepared to assist the States to a definite and substantial degree. Adequate sinking funds are to be created for the debts of the States, and we are to have a combined sinking fund, which will enable us to improve our credit in the money markets of the world. The Opposition says that sinking funds are useful and valuable, but they do not say how much they would be prepared to contribute to them. The Leader of the Opposition said that his party might be prepared to establish a sinking fund for past State debts, but he was silent as to what precisely they were prepared to do. He was not prepared to give assistance for sinking funds against future State debts. The proposition of the Labour party is a nebulous thing. The Leader of the Opposition asks Parliament to accept something which is in the clouds, instead of the clear and definite proposal of the Government. </para><para>The three points of the agreement are financial assistance to the States, consolidation of existing debts with control of future borrowing, and the establishment of a sinking fund. The Government's proposal is to provide assistance for 58 years on the basis of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments for the year 1926-27, which amounted to £7,585,000. The Commonwealth Government, however, is prepared to provide a proportion of the sinking fund, which will be a continually increasing amount. This means that a factor in the payments to the States is the development of the States, and the claims of the less developed States for a greater degree of assistance are recognized. We propose to get away from the basis of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments, but to do so with a minimum of interference with the financial position of the States. That is the object of the agreement. The Commonwealth contribution to the State sinking funds will be in accordance with the amount of money borrowed. Our contribution to the Western Australian sinking fund on new debt incurred last financial year was £11,500, while to that of Victoria it was only £20,000. Victoria has four times as many people as Western Australia, but received only twice as much towards her sinking fund. This was because much of her developmental work has already been done, whilst Western </para><para>Australia has a great deal still to do. It is reasonable and proper that the Commonwealth. Parliament, which is responsible for the whole territory of Australia, should help by this means to bring about a united and progressive Commonwealth, and should aim to ensure, as far as possible, that the less developed States shall receive assistance which will enable them to develop their resources. </para><interjection>

The right honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> interjected very pertinently, when this matter was being discussed by the Leader of the Opposition, that no State would accept the Labour party's proposition on such terms. </para>

              <para>- If the Leader of the Opposition proposes to contribute to the State sinking fund, as well as restore the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments, it will he necessary for the Commonwealth Government to find £13,900,000 more during the next ten years than under the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> system. Yet it has been said by the honorable member and his former leader that the present agreement is too liberal to the States, that it would tie up the Commonwealth revenues too much, and is dangerous from that point of view. If that be so, surely the Opposition cannot favour the giving of £13,900,000 more than the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments during the next ten years. From the Commonwealth point of view, it is impracticable to restore the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments, and, at the same time, contribute to the States sinking fund, while it would be impossible to induce the States to not take less than it is now proposed to give them under this agreement. </para>

              <para>- The Leader of the Opposition asks whether the matter cannot, be adjusted ; but he will not himself propose anything definite. The Government asks for the endorsement of an agreement in which everything is settled ; in which every " t " is crossed and every " i " dotted. The Opposition, on the other hand, asks Parliament to tear up the agreement, and to start out again on an uncharted sea, with nothing to guide it. </para>

          </continue><para>Let us contrast the security afforded the States by the Government's scheme with the uncertainty of the States' position under the proposals outlined by the Leader of the Opposition. In the Government's scheme a definite minimum payment of £7,585,000 a year is assured to the States for 58 years. The States are also assured of a sinking fund contribution towards past and future debts as well as of an increase of interest on the transferred properties. That is a minimum secured to them under the Constitution once this agreement has been ratified by Parliament. The States can have no security until this measure is passed; but, once the agreement has been ratified, they will be in a position of security such as they have not occupied since federation. The Leader of the Opposition asks that, instead of giving them this definite security, we restore the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments for ten years. I shall inform honorable members presently what the Labour Premiers have to say about that. The history of Labour in this country shows that its policy is to have the States dependent on the goodwill of the Commonwealth. The Leader of the Opposition put the position quite plainly when he said that his party could not stand for an agreement which tied the Commonwealth up in perpetuity, or for any term longer than ten years. </para><interjection>

The reason that the Labour party at the present time desires to prevent the validation of the agreement and the giving to the States a measure of constitutional and legal security, has been frankly exposed by members of that party. They have said that if the Labour party ever gets into power, it wants to use the Commonwealth revenues for its own purposes - social schemes and such things. It wishes to bring about unification, and its attempts in that direction would be handicapped if this agreement were in existence.

              <para>- It would not be clean. It would be defaced by all the mistakes of the past and the gross breach of the present agreement if we failed to validate it. We have now an opportunity of getting rid for all time of the difficulties and antagonisms which past discussions of this problem have engendered. If this agreement is lost, we shall lose the benefit of unified borrowing, definite sinking funds, and the consolidation of the public debts. Labour believes that those things would be benefits if they could be brought about, but yet is prepared to attack them in order to defeat the agreement. It is prepared to wreck the thing which it admits is good, simply because it desires to alter what is a less important part of the agreement. </para>

          </continue><para>I confidently urge the House to validate this agreement; first, because it has been accepted by the States, and because the machinery for varying it is contained in it and can be put into operation when the parties mutually desire; but chiefly because of the immense importance to Australia of the mobilization of her public credit. The danger of delay can be seen by what took place in 1910. In that year a referendum was carried favouring the taking over of State debts by the Commonwealth, hut although this proposal was carried by a majority of hundreds of thousands, nothing was done, and nothing has been done up to the present time. The recent referendum has provided further evidence that there is an urgent desire among the public that the public debt problem shall be settled. In spite of this, the Leader of the Opposition tells us to delay still further. Delay in political matters is fatal. The people have twice expressed their desire that a settlement shall be come to. The Opposition counsels delay, but there is nothing to show that if we allowed this opportunity to pass any satisfactory agreement would be come to in our time. </para><para>Some honorable members say that they are opposing this agreement on behalf of the States.

In view of the futility of earlier conferences, the attainment of an agreement with the States is, in itself, an achievement of no mean magnitude. A feature of it is the establishment of properlysafeguarded sinking funds such as we have never had before. This is an essential adjunct of sound government finance to which lenders now pay special attention. The benefits to be derived from a permanently constituted loan council to deal with all debts and borrowings are immeasurable. The function of this body will be to avoid suicidal competition between governments in the money market, such as, unfortunately, happened too frequently in the past. The financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States will be stabilized, and we have provided for immediate relief to the finances of the States. Above all, the agreement will enhance Australia's credit so that substantial savings of interest will be ultimately secured to the people through the issue of new and conversion loans on better terms than would be possible in the absence of co-ordinated debt management and sinking fund provision. The agreement has been approved by the Parliaments and people of Australia, and has been the subject of most favorable comment by financial experts in London, New York and Australia.

            <para>.- The special pleading of the Treasurer was pathetic, but was in keeping with his attitude on this subject since he first sought to impose upon this Parliament an agreement that is not a satisfactory adjustment of the relations of the Commonwealth and the States. His speech was far from convincing. He sought to make the House believe that the State Governments readily accepted the arrangement that is contained in the bill, but a perusal of the history of the negotiations discloses that at the various conferences the State Premiers and Treasurers showed marked hostility towards it. Seeking to bend the State Governments to its will the Commonwealth Government took advantage of its statutory power to discontinue the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments, and the representatives of the States were forced to negotiate a new arrangement with the knowledge that unless some alternative scheme were accepted their revenues would suffer seriously. Instead of the negotiations being conducted in an atmosphere of confidence and goodwill, there was evidence of strong resentment by the States of the domineering attitude of the Commonwealth. The State representatives realized, however, that in order to avoid financial chaos they must make the best of a bad situation. In seeking to make the House and the public believe that the State Premiers and Treasurers recognize special virtues in this agreement, he took to himself and the Government more credit than they deserve. The States have failed to recognize any merit in the agreement, but under duress they have made the best terms possible with a grasping Federal Government, The honorable gentleman, when quoting from the speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Collier,</inline> the Premier of "Western Australia, did not include this statement made in the State Parliament on the 12th June last - </para>

          <para class="block">No more damning indictment of the financial agreement could be uttered. As a matter of fact,, all who hold responsible positions in the various States have been emphatic in their opposition, to the withdrawal of the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments, and this Parliament would be wanting in its duty if it did not warn the present Government that if it  continues to impose unfair conditions on the States, neither those who are responsible for the administration of the affairs of the States nor those entrusted with the control of Commonwealth affairs will be satisfied. It is an iniquitous idea to bind the States and the Commonwealth for the period of 58 years, imposing on citizens yet unborn an obligation in respect of which they have had no voice. I always deprecate any suggestion of repudiation, but in this case I feel that future Governments will have a very strong incentive to rectify the wrong that is being done by the present Government. </para>
          <para>The Treasurer utterly failed in his endeavour to place upon past Labour administrations the responsibility for certain steps that have been taken to define the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. As a matter of fact, the unfairness of his comments called forth strong protest from some honorable members on his own side. The Treasurer never deals with the merits of the matter under consideration at the moment. He spends his time in trying to show there is some sinister motive behind the criticism of m the Opposition, and in trying to relieve himself of responsibilities which should rightly be his. It was refreshing to note his failure to prove a worthy defender of his own chief. With the present Ministry it is evidently a case of each man for himself. When he was asked if he would stand by a statement made by the Prime Minister with .reference to the attitude of a past Government that was Labour in complexion, he said " I am speaking for myself." That was clearly an admission of the unreliable and misleading nature of the Prime Minister's words, the incorrectness of which the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> had already exposed by documentary evidence. All that the Treasurer did to try to exonerate his own leader from the charge of misrepresentation was to show that in 1910 the States had asked for more than was provided for in the agreement made by them with the Deakin Government. </para>
          <para>The Treasurer claims that because the Government came back after the elections with a majority in this House, its financial proposals had the endorsement of the electors, but no one by any stretch of imagination could make that deduction. At the last election, as at the previous one, the battle cry of the Government on a thousand platforms was the maintenance of law and order and industrial peace, and the financial agreement was lost to sight. It is, therefore, unreasonable for the Treasurer to say that his financial proposals were endorsed by the electors. Does he forget that every honorable member returned to this House to represent Western Australian constituencies is pledged to oppose the Financial Agreement Bill? </para>

          <para>The Treasurer can get very little satisfaction from the total figures cast for the various parties at the last election. The total Labour vote was 1,422,418, not including certain votes which are now the subject of litigation before the Court of Disputed Returns. The Country party's candidates received 291,567 votes, and those of the Nationalist party 1,157,602. For Independent candidates 34,246 votes were cast, but they were certainly not anti-Labour votes and ought reasonably to be added to the total votes cast for Labour candidates. In these circumstances it is clear that honorable members of the Opposition are more entitled than are honorable members on the Government side of the chamber to declare that they voice the will of the majority of the people of Australia. Further evidence that this proposal did not meet with the approval of the people is provided in the fact that ten members on the ministerial side of the House in the last Parliament lost their seats at the recent election, eight of them to candidates standing in the interests of the Labour party. If the Treasurer advanced that as an argument in support of his case, he would make himself a laughing stock of the community. </para>

              <para>- Quite so. I have received a telegram from the <inline font-style="italic">Register,</inline> one of the leading daily newspapers of Adelaide, to the effect that serious concern is felt in South Australia because the Government is -proceeding with the consideration of this bill without waiting for the presentation of the report of the South Australian Disabilities Commission. Unquestionably, that report should be considered before the financial agreement is ratified; otherwise the interests of the State may be seriously prejudiced. That a South Australian newspaper, which lent considerable support to ministerial candidates at the recent elections, should express such hostility to the policy of the Government in this regard, is significant. It is surely not unreasonable to ask the Government to await the receipt of this report before it rides roughshod over the claims that have been advanced for financial assistance for South Australia to offset the disadvantages she has suffered through federation. </para>

If the responsible Ministers of the respective governments of the Australian colonies were unable for so long before federation to agree upon even a temporary settlement of these issues, it is not reasonable to expect us, satisfactorily, to solve the problem for the next 58 years after a debate lasting a few hours. I am quite confident that the people will not approve of such a hurried settlement. I am not a great advocate of State rights. I prefer to see the larger interests of the people of the Commonwealth advanced. But so long as our Constitution remains as it is we must recognize that the States have certain rights which should be preserved. There is another reason why any agreement we may reach in attempting to settle this vexed question should not be for such an extended term as 58 years. It is generally admitted by students of political economy, that the remoulding of the Commonwealth Constitution , is long overdue. Very early in his political life, the Treasurer strongly advocated the remodelling of our present governmental system by the creation of new States. But when his party became associated with the Nationalists and a composite Government was formed, instead of immediately moving in the direction of providing a means for the creation of new States, he said that the Government would hold a constitutional session of Parliament at which this subject, which he had always regarded as of outstanding importance, would be discussed. That promise has never been fulfilled. If the Treasurer is still of the opinion that new States should be formed, it is difficult to understand how he can support an agreement in which provision is made for the control of Commonwealth and State finances over a period of 58 years, and which may interfere most seriously with the new State movement, of which he is supposed to be an ardent supporter. </para>

            <para>. - It is surprising to me that honorable members opposite, particularly some of those who have stressed the importance of this measure are not willing to continue the debate. An honorable member opposite who, I believe, expected to receive the call, left the chamber, after a conversation with the Minister. In view of the opinions expressed in this House by Ministers and some of their supporters, I do not know how they intend to justify their support of the bill. </para>

          <para>I wish, to refer at the outset to the manner in which the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> introduced this subject, very important measures have been introduced into the Federal Parliament by Prime Ministers and other Ministers, but I do not know of any occasion on which there has been greater misrepresentation of the attitude of the Labour party than there has been in connexion with this bill. I was very glad to hear the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> unwind the Prime ' Minister as effectively as he did this afternoon and prove conclusively that the right honorable gentleman had used arguments that were absolutely misleading. An ineffective apology was offered a little later by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Earle Page)</inline> who, instead of amplifying the Prime Minister's utterances, or attempting to defend his assertions, slunk away as soon as he was assailed by the Leader of the Opposition. The debate on this measure has proved that the Prime Minister is one of the most unreliable public men in the Commonwealth. If the newspapers deal fairly with the discussion on this measure, the people outside who have stood behind the Prime Minister so assiduously in the past, will in future relinquish their support. A message has been despatched to Ministerial supporters to be present in sufficient numbers to  enable the measure to be passed. </para>

              <para>- In the Ministerial caucus room the Prime Minister outlines what he proposes, and immediately his supporters bow and agree to his sugges tions. One cannot refrain from describing them as dumb driven cattle. Bather than occupy the position they do, I should prefer to retire from public life. While for months past a certain section of the members on the Ministerial side of the House have opposed the agreement, because of some pressure, political or otherwise, they have now been forced into the position of supporting this measure. The division on the second reading will, no doubt, disclose that they are not now prepared to stand for the principles that they advocated for so many years, preferring to slink behind their fellow members in order to form a majority with which to carry the bill. I cannot conceive of any honorable member, whose desire is for this great country of ours to progress, binding this Parliament to a certain proposal for a period of 58 years. The Treasurer said to-day that he was still in favour of new states, but how will he re-adjust the financial arrangements of the States when other states are created ? It appears to me that honorable members supporting the Government are afflicted with what might be termed the " State-rights " microbe. Some of them are voting for this measure because it will to a certain extent preserve the rights and privileges of the States for a period of nearly 60 years. I am no States' righter. The present boundaries should be regarded by this National Parliament as imaginary, and I hope the day is not far distant when Australia will be divided into a number of provinces under a system similar to that in operation in Canada. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member well knows the Labour party's platform. We do not call ourselves unificationists. When new states are created, I do not know how the Treasurer will re-adjust the financial arrangements. I leave that to the imagination of his most peculiar brain. I doubt whether his efforts in that direction will be more successful than they have been in evolving other financial schemes. When speaking to-night he posed as a wonderful financial magician; he was the man of all men in Australian who could propound schemes under which Australia would advance by leaps and bounds ! We have only to look back for three years to ascertain how far Australia has descended financially. Instead of the huge surpluses of the past we now find ourselves in a serious financial position. Our public works are being curtailed, and unemployment is rife throughout Australia. It is evident that the Treasurer's financial forecast will not be realized, and that Australia will be in arrears considerably over £3,000,000 at the end of this financial year. </para>

              <para>- Yes. At the end of last financial year the estimate of revenue was short by £2,500,000. The Treasurer budgeted for an increase in customs revenue of over £1,000,000, and up to date that estimate is £1,000,000 short. Therefore, at the end of this financial year we shall probably have a deficit of £3,000,000.

I should like to hear the view of the right honorable member for Balaclava <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watt)</inline> on the financial agreement, because I am expecting that his speech will not be altogether in favour of the bill. Whether he has had influences brought to bear upon him in respect of his vote, remains to be seen.

            <para>The Commonwealth, plus two of the smaller States, namely, Western Australia, which has, I think,' a population of 320,000, and Tasmania, which has a population of about 250,000, can together outvote Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia, which together have a population of 5,500,000. That does not seem to be right tome. I do not like placing ourselves practically in pawn to the Loan Council. </para>
          </quote><para class="block">That deals with a different aspect of the problem, to which I shall direct myself on a later occasion. It is unnecessary for me to quote from the speech delivered by the Prime Minister, as that was effectively answered by the Leader of the Opposition. It is difficult to define the position of the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Maxwell)</inline> in this matter. I do not think that he has made a definite speech on the subject. But, judging from his occasional remarks, one may reasonably assume that the honorable member is decidedly uneasy about the terms of the agreement. As is well known, he voted against the Government when the Labour party endeavoured to postpone the ratification of this agreement. Now, according to the press, to which I do not always pay serious attention, the honorable member has been convinced that it is the right thing to vote for the agreement. I shall defer my criticism on that prophecy until a vote is taken on the second reading. The honorable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Prowse)</inline> delivered a fairly strong speech against the agreement, which I shall not quote, and declared that he intended to make his position perfectly clear before his electors. I gather, from interjections that have been made, that seven or eight of the twelve members now representing South Australia and Western Australia are averse to the ratification of the agreement. The vote on the second reading will disclose whether any conversations have taken place. The present Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett)</inline> last year had something to say about the financial agreement, as may be gathered by a reference to page 4011 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> No. 28, of the 21st March, 1928. In the course of a shortspeech the honorable gentleman said - </para><quote>
            <para>It may be remembered that I strongly favour a substantial reduction of revenue duties, and that I am also very sympathetic towards a reduction of excise. I look forward to seeing the customs and excise duties substantially less than at present. If that hope is realized, the States would be in an even worse position than they are in to-day. </para>

            <para>I look upon the whole agreement as purely of a temporary nature; otherwise, I should not have supported the second reading. I do not, for one moment, anticipate that it will last for 58 years. The original provision for paying the States three-quarters of the customs revenue lasted for only ten years after federation, while the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments operated for eighteen years. It seems logical, therefore, to assume that this agreement will stand only until the people, in their own generation, decide to alter it. I know of nothing more absurd than that this House should attempt solemnly to legislate for 58 years ahead in the supremely important realm of finance. If I thought that the agreement would last for that term I should not view it as favorably as I now do. It is merely a good temporary arrangement. </para>

              <para>- I prefer that the honorable gentleman should be present in this chamber, as it is rather depressing to make quotations from the speech of an honorable member who is absent. Perhaps I should have sent for the honorable members for Fawkner and Forrest before referring to their views. I have read the statement of the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Gullett),</inline> who is now Minister for Trade and Customs. What attitude will he adopt when the vote is taken on the second reading of the bill? He describes <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Earle</inline> Page as a tragic Treasurer; but apparently we have a tragic Minister for Customs, too. He went on to say on the occasion to which I have referred - </para>

It is a pity that that aspect of the agreement has been so greatly exaggerated. </para>

What inducement, I wonder, is held out to them to change their opinions, and sacrifice their principles? If the honorable member for Henty votes for this agreement, which is the same agreement against which he spoke last year, how will he reconcile his action with his previous utterances? I presume that he will vote with the Government without giving honorable members, or his constituents, any reason for his change of attitude. I think that it is due to honorable members of thisHouse to know why he has changed hisopinion. </para><para>As an Australian, and one who believes in the progress of Australia, I protest against a proposal to tie up therevenues of the Commonwealth for 58 years ahead. Such action would be criminal. It would not be in the interests of the people as a whole. The electors, I believe, have now realized which party stands for the real national interests. I presume that honorable members oppositehave already made up their minds <inline font-style="italic">asto</inline> 'how they shall vote. Honorable members of that party who were inclined to be recalcitrant have been brought to heel. It would be interesting to know the process by which this was done.

The honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mann)</inline> has reduced his estimate of the total loss. which will be sustained by the States. He said at first that it would be over £300,000,000; hut he has now accepted the Attorney-General's estimate of £158,000,000. In my opinion, it will be greater than that. The estimate of the honorable member for Perth was made, not by himself, but by a qualified statistician. It is clear from the calculations of the statistician that the States are likely to lose nearer £380,000,000 than £150,000,000. Even according to the figures used by the Attorney-General they will lose at least the latter sum. The representatives of the States were between the devil and the deep sea, and they accepted, under duress, what the Commonwealth offered, fearing that if they refused they would get nothing. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hogan, Mr. McCormack, Mr. Collier,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Forgan</inline> Smith have stated, " We were forced into the agreement and we had to make the best of a bad situation.

            <para>. - Most honorable members return to their homes at the week-end, and last week many of us, expecting that the House would not meet until Tuesday, made public engagements for Saturday next. I think that some notice of the Government's intention to propose an additional sitting day might have been given to us. I have no objection to sitting an extra day, but the Government has not acted fairly in springing this change upon us without warning. I understood that this week and next week the House would meet on Tuesday and in the following week on Monday. However, this treatment is only what we may expect from the present Government, and when honorable members opposite ask us to be kind, generous, and tolerant towards them, they are expecting too much of human nature. </para>

            <para>.- I hope the Prime Minister's intimation regarding the Monday sitting is not his last word on the subject. Whatever may be our views in regard to the operation of the guillotine and the closure, I hope we have not reached that stage when the ordinary courtesies of parliamentary life will be set aside. The right honorable gentleman knows perfectly well that it is a matter of great importance to members of the Opposition that they shall attend regularly in this House on all sitting days, and they are quite prepared to do so, but they have also obligations in their constituencies.- I, like other honorable members, have made public engagements in accordance with what I understood would be the sitting days of this House next week. In the past, it has been customary to give to honorable members ample notice of any change so that when they returned to their constituencies they could arrange their public engagements accordingly. If the Prime Minister replies to this complaint, that the Opposition members have expressed a desire to  sit here and work, such a retort will be quite unworthy and unjust. Our objection is that great confusion and inconvenience will result if the House is to meet on Monday next without adequate notice, thus causing honorable members to break engagements they have made. The inconvenience will be greater by reason of the fact that, because of the extra sitting days, the opportunities for attending to public business in our electorates have been reduced to a minimum. Apparently the Prime Minister has not even consulted the Leader of the Opposition in regard to the Monday sitting, but it is not too late for him to tell the House that he will have regard for the convenience of members on both sides, unless of course his own supporters were taken into his confidence earlier. I ask him to reconsider his decision. </para>

This afternoon, while questions upon notice were being answered, I left the chamber to speak on the telephone to the secretary of the Prime Minister's Department. While I was thus engaged the division bells rang, but I did not hear them, and when I sought to re-enter the chamber, the doors were locked and I missed the division. I suggest that inquiries should be made as to the possibility of fixing bells where they can be heard in the telephone boxes. If I had been present in the chamber this afternoon I should have recorded my vote against the question " that' the Financial Agreement Validation Bill be considered an urgent bill." </para>

            <para>.- In view of the fact that the Prime Minister's announcement that the ' House  13  to meet on Monday next has come as a complete surprise to honorable members of the Opposition, I suggest that he might allow the matter to pass for the coming week and have the Monday sitting in the following week.

          <para class="block">I am sure that honorable members will be willing to sit in the mornings or later at night. I suggest, however, that when drastic alterations of the sitting days are to be made the Opposition should be consulted, or at least notified. The alteration of the first sitting day of the week from Wednesday to Tuesday made very little difference, but the further change from Tuesday to Monday makes a great deal of difference. It prevents quite a large number of honorable members from doing any work in their constituencies or in the State capitals. If honorable members arrive in Sydney on Friday night there is very little time for them to do anything on Saturday, and if they are compelled to leave Sydney again on Sunday night they cannot do what they have set aside to do at the week end. I suggest that next Monday might be left clear to honorable members. </para>

            <para>.- I have no desire to shirk my parliamentary responsibilities. I cannot get to my home at the week end. It would take three days to reach it and three days to return. But when the Prime Minister intimated that the House was to meet on Tuesday I made arrangements to spend this week end with some relatives who live not too far away from Canberra, but far enough to prevent me from getting back to my duties by Monday. I ask the right honorable gentleman to consider the convenience of honorable members and postpone the Monday sitting until the following week. We can sit in the mornings if necessary. </para>

            <para>. - I think it was last Friday that the Prime Minister said, that in order that honorable members should not be inconvenienced, he would give them due notice that the House would meet on Tuesdays. Every honorable member left Canberra with the full understanding that the Prime Minister was consulting the convenience of the House and the fact waa appreciated. I took it for granted, as I think every other honorable member did, that the arrangement was to continue until the rising of Parliament. </para>

              <para>- I hope that the honorable member is not expressing the view of the Government. Honorable members of the Opposition have rightly taken objection to a reecnt curtailment of their privileges, and I hope that this announcement by the Prime Minister is not in the nature of a step of retaliation. The people will not be impressed by it. An extra sitting day will not help the Government very much in its desire to deal with certain work before Easter. The real question at issue is that honorable members are entitled to ordinary courtesy. It strikes me that ' the step taken by the Government is an act of reprisal for the attitude taken up by the Opposition. It is certainly no credit to the Government. I distinctly remember the Prime Minister saying on Friday last, that he desired to give honorable members due notice of the Tuesday sittings, so that they might make their arrangements. At any rate, we left Canberra with the distinct understanding that the House would meet on Tuesdays, but now we are told that that arrangement is all off, and that the House is to meet next Monday. It is a distinct act of discourtesy. I remind the right honorable gentleman that honorable members of the Opposition can retaliate. The proposal of the Opposition is that Parliament should continue its sittings after Easter. We strongly object to a recess of five months. If the Government is right in saying that it has a full programme of work to he done, it will make very little progress by asking the House to sit on an extra day. The proper way for the Government to get through its programme is to ask the House to resume after Easter. Only in that way can it satisfy the people that it is not shirking its duties. I resent this breach of faith on the part of the Prime Minister, who gave us a distinct undertaking at the last week end that in future the House was to meet on Tuesdays. I trust that some other motive is actuating the Prime Minister than that of retaliating on the Opposition for the criticism offered by it. </para>

            <para>.- I do not regard the announcement made by the Prime Minister as an act of discourtesy to honorable members. It ia somewhat interesting to hear the suggestion of some honorable members, who live practically adjacent to Canberra and who are privileged to get to their homes each week end, that we should meet after Easter. They forget that other honorable members live in distant States, and have to remain in Canberra for the whole of the session, I think that the Government oan get through its programme by Easter, if we sit each day without working late at night. It is ungenerous .of honorable members who live reasonably close to Canberra to adopt this attitude. Evidently they would not mind bringing members who live in distant States back here to finish up a little business that could be done before the adjournment. This is only Wednesday so I think it may be said that the Prime Minister has given reasonable notice of the proposed Monday sitting. </para>

            <para>, -  I regret that the suggestion has been made that I have been guilty of discourtesy to. honorable gentlemen opposite. The even more unworthy suggestion has. been put forward that my proposal was inspired by some desire to adopt retaliatory measures for something that honorable gentlemen opposite may have done. The honorable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Parker Moloney)</inline> even charges me with a breach of faith. There is no justification for any of these accusations. Whatever may be my faults, I. have always endeavoured to act courteously towards honorable members opposite. T certainly would not be led into the adoption - of measures of a retaliatory character as has been suggested. This is Wednesday, so I think it may be said that I have given fair notice of the proposed Monday sitting. A number of honorable members  must have known last night that the Government was considering whether it would or would not be necessary to sit on Monday. The Secretary of the Joint Committee on Public Accounts telephoned me this morning to ascertain whether the House would sit on Monday next. I informed him that it would, and that he could so advise his committee. Honorable members from both sides of the House are members of that committee, and they must have known yesterday that there was a likelihood of the House being palled together on Monday. I told the Leader of the Opposition this afternoon that we should be meeting on Monday. I have, therefore, done everything that I could reasonably do to meet the convenience of honorable members. One honorable member observed that I informed the Houselast week that it was proposed to meet on Tuesday of this week, Tuesday of next week, and Monday of the following week in order to dispose of the business which the Government de- sired to do before Easter; but I remind honorable members opposite that they upset that arrangement somewhat by taking up the whole of last Friday in discussing a motion which was given precedence over Government business, but which, nevertheless, prevented the Government programme from being carried out. </para>

              <para>- I was somewhat precluded from doing that because of certain tactics that were adopted at the close of last Friday's sitting. I have never been guilty of any intentional discourtesy to honorable . members opposite. I have always endeavoured to meet the convenience of honorable members on both sides of the chamber. I am quite prepared to discuss with the Leader of the Opposition whether it would be convenient or otherwise to meet in the mornings instead of adding to the sitting days. I shall also take the opportunity of discussing with him the measures which the Government, proposes to bring forward before the end of the session. </para>
