            <para>- On Saturday last I met, in Sydney, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudehope,</inline> the secretary of one of the maritime unions in Sydney, and I have since had a further telephone message from him regarding the prosecution and imprisonment of Jacob Johnson. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudehope</inline> told me that he had interviewed Andresen, one of the principal witnesses in the Johnson case, in regard to the statement made by the Attorney-General that Andresen was not the instigator of the prosecution, and  that the department had prior declarations by other witnesses.  Andresen  said that two statements were made prior to his, but they were not used iri the prosecution of Johnson, nor were the informants called as witnesses. Rigby and Powell, who, apparently, were regarded by the Crown as important witnesses, were, he says, called merely to corroborate Andresen's statement, which was given to them in order that they might know what his evidence would be. He says, further, that his own statements were wilfully untrue, find that one of them was drafted at the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dillon,</inline> the Secretary of the Shipping Company, and, that prior to entering the witness box, he was handed, by one of the Commonwealth officers, Longmuir, a transcript of the evidence to be given by Rigby. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudehope</inline> says that he has received a communication from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKernan,</inline> Secretary of the Adelaide Branch of the Seamen's Union, informing him that Powell has made a sworn declaration that he did not hear Johnson make the statement which he, Powell, swore in the witness box Johnson had made. In view of this testimony, involving grave allegations against the officers of the Crown Law Department, does not the Attorney-General think that an inquiry into all the circumstances of this prosecution is warranted ? </para>

            <para>- I gather from the statement, of the honorable member for Dalley, ihat <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tudehope</inline> has told him of what he says Andreson  told him (Tudehope), which the honorable member now tells to this House, so this information is at least third hand. As far as I follow what the honorable member has said,  Andreson's  statement now is that his evidence was obtained before that of Rigby and Powell. The documents show, however, that the statements of Rigby and Powell, which they subsequently repeated on oath at the trial, were in the possession of the department before Andresen had anything to do with the case. </para>

              <para>- I refer to sworn declarations by Rigby and Powell and longer signed statements subsequently made. The sworn declarations were not used in the court as evidence, because the deponents went into the witness box. I am at present in communication with Messrs. Sullivan Brothers, the solicitors for Johnson, in respect to this matter, and if Andresen will make a statutory declaration in Australia - not in New Zealand, because no responsibility attaches in the Commonwealth to a statutory declaration made outside of it - containing the substance of what the honorable member for Dalley has said, I shall certainly be prepared to take action. </para>

During the forthcoming recess a conference of representatives of the Commonwealth and the State Premiers will be held, and national insurance and social legislation generally will be considered with a view to definite action being taken when this House re-assembles later in the year. </para>

            <para>- In February last I asked the Postmaster-General a question relating to wireless telegrams between Flinders Island, Tasmania, and the mainland, for which a minimum charge of Ja. Sd. is made. The Minister said that lie would make an inquiry into the matter, la he yet in a position to inform me of i lie result of his investigations? If he finds that he cannot reduce the minimum charge, will he consider increasing the maximum number of words that may be transmitted for it? </para>

            <para>- I have received an intimation from one of the largest film producing companies of England, another from one of the leading companies nf America, and yet another from  ii  well-known young Australian producer who has just returned from Hollywood, that they desire to produce a big film in Australia. Will the Minister for Trade and Customs, therefore, ask Cabinet to consider instituting at an early date the scheme recommended by the Motion Picture Industry Royal Commission for the granting of awards of merit? The commission recommended that this scheme should run in conjunction with the quota system, but, as there seems to be considerable delay in the States in passing legislation necessary to enable the Commonwealth to legislate on this subject, it would, be advisable for the proposed awards of merit to be offered at once. </para>

            <para>- I notice that order of the day, No. 10, deals with the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Bill. I think that it is safe to assume that, at this late hour of the session, that important measure will be among the "slaughtered innocents." Seeing that it has a vital bearing on Commonwealth employees who have met, and may in future, meet with accidents, and that, under the present law, the maximum compensation obtainable is £2 a week, will the Minister for Home Affairs consider the immediate reduction of the hospital charge at Darwin from £3 10s. to 35s. a week, which was the charge formerly made? </para>

            <para>- In view of the fact that the Government has decided not to grant protection to the cotton industry before the adjournment of Parliament for the coming recess, will the Minister for Trade and Customs accept an invitation from the cotton-growers of Queensland to visit the Northern Burnett, Callide, Wowan, and other districts so that firsthand information may be obtained from the growers' point of view ? Is the Minister aware of the statement made in the Senate yesterday by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greene,</inline> ex-Minister for Trade and Customs, and Chairman of Directors of the BritishAustralasian Cotton Growing Association, severely criticizing the Government for breaking the definite promise to both the growers and this House to give protection to the industry? </para>

In the event of an invitation being extended to me by the Queensland cotton-growers to visit their areas, I shall be pleased to see if I can make the necessary arrangements to do so. Of course, I cannot give any definite undertaking in the matter. </para>

            <para>- About a fortnight ago I asked the Prime Minister if he would make inquiries concerning the distress that exists on account of unemployment in Port Pirie, South Australia, and, if he found that it was as severe as I stated it to be, whether he would consider the payment of a subsidy at the rate of £1 for £1 on all collections made in the district. The right honorable gentleman promised to have inquiries made. If those inquiries are not yet completed, will he endeavour to hasten them, and let me know what the Government intends to do? </para>

            <para>- Certain recommendations were made by the Shipping Board in relation to the payment of pensions to a portion of the staff of the Commonwealth Shipping Line. Those recommendations were accepted by the Government, and have been put into effect. I understand that representations are still being made to the Shipping Board in the case of Captain Daniel, and communications on the subject have been sent to the Government. It is not proposed to vary the decision that has been come to. It is a matter for the discretion of the honor able member or the individual concerned whether any advantage would be gained by continuing to make representations to the Shipping Board. </para>

          <para>. - I do not expect the Minister to give a clear and definite indication of Government policy; but I, nevertheless, take advantage of this opportunity to ask him. when it is intended to give this House an opportunity to consider the various recommendations that have been made to the Government from time to time by the Tariff Board. When I referred to this matter on <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> previous occasion, the Minister did not deal with it in his speech in reply to the debate. There are quite a large number of outstanding recommendations of the Tariff Board. I should like the Minister to state how many are actually before him at the present time. This problem is causing a great deal of concern to manufacturers, and, in view of the unemployment that is rife throughout Australia, its solution brooks no delay. </para>

The second annual report of the commission, which will be available at an early date, will furnish in full detail the various investigations which are in progress and those which have been completed since the date of the commission's last annual report. </para>

              <para>It is believed that means can be found for adequately catering for educational activities under a system where the programme is provided by public contract. 5 and 6. The Government is in possession of information which shows that, while certain companies are making profits, the general position, judged from the Commonwealth stand-point, is such that the revenue is barely sufficient to ensure an expansion of the service as contemplated under the national broadcasting scheme; consequently it would be unwise in the extreme at the present juncture to make any alteration in the licence-fees. The Government is anxious that additional stations should be erected as rapidly as possible, and I think it will be generally agreed that the service should be self-supporting. </para>

            <para>.- I have no wish to criticize or oppose the bill. It is a small measure and 1 take it that the Treasurer has discussed with the Premiers the nature of the representation on the National Debt Sinking Fund Commission. Obviously, under the financial agreement, the States should have representation on the commission. I presume that the Treasurer has also  discussed  the method of selecting the representatives, so there is nothing more to be said on that subject. As the method of securing the retirement of State representatives and the appointment of their successors has, no doubt, been agreed upon by the Premiers, there is no criticism that fan be offered to the bill. </para>

            <para>- Yes. The other amendments in the bill will make it possible by order in council to exempt from the payment of charges small quantities of butter or cheese, such as ship's stores and small orders for the island trade, which under the existing law are not exempt from the levy. The charge is so small that it really costs more than it is worth in time and trouble to collect it. </para>

            <para>- That has nothing to do with this bill. The levy on, say, two boxes of butter weighing about one cwt., would be about 2s. 8d. a box. That levy would be required to be entered in triplicate, checked and banked, and  it  is obvious that to go to that trouble for such a trifling amount is really absurd. The amendment will make it possible to exempt small quantities of cheese and butter from these charges, but, if necessary they may be re-imposed at any time, </para>

          <para>.- The subject of the bill is most important, because it opens up the whole question of dairy produce. Honorable members should have been given time to make suggestions as to what the Government might do in assisting the dairy farmers generally to market their produce. I should have liked the Minister to bring down a bill providing for a comprehensive scheme for the marketing of dairy produce in Australia as well as overseas. </para>

            <para>- When the House reassembles I should like the Minister to introduce a bill making provision for an Australian-wide marketing butter pool, to enable the dairy-farmers to get a more reasonable return for their products. Queensland has a wonderful pooling system, but because of jealousy and cutthroat competition between the States, it is greatly handicapped in its endeavours to give the farmers a fair return for their labour and investment in the industry. </para>

            <para>- This morning I asked the Minister what was the total saving made by the Dairy Export Control Board in handling the exportable surplus of butter in 1925-26, 1926-27, and 1927-28. I am pleased to note that the board was responsible for effecting certain savings. Speaking in behalf of the Opposition on the motion for the second reading of the original bill on the 18th September, 1924, I commended it as a step in the right direction, but pointed out that it covered only one-third of Australia's butter production. In respect of the two-thirds which is consumed on the Australian market, this Government has done nothing to bring about a more orderly system of marketing. The Paterson scheme is not a government conception. I believe that a man in Queensland claims to be the originator of it. </para>

I do not agree with the statement that section 92 of the Constitution acts as a bar to the creation of an Australian-wide dairy produce pool. Mr. Webb, , the Solicitor-General of Queensland, advised the Dairy Council that the Commonwealth had ample power to legislate for an orderly marketing scheme for the whole of the butter produced in Australia. </para>

          <para class="block">A Forestry Bill was received from the Senate, and, on the motion of the Prime Minister, read a first time in this House on the 30th November,1928, but no further progress was made with it. This differs from that formerly submitted only in that clauses 6 to 12 have been inserted. </para>
          <para>During the past few years interest in forestry has quickened, and there is a growing consciousness that more should he done to preserve and develop the forest resources of the country. From the time of the pioneers almost until now the clearing of the land for agricultural pursuits and for the sale of the timber on it has been the chief consideration of land settlers, and the perpetuation of the timber growth upon it by proper treatment has been regarded as of little or no consequence. The cutting over process meant that only the best of the trees were cut down, and of the felled trees only the best logs were utilized, the others being left to rot. Periodical fires have destroyed the young trees that would have grown had care been taken in controlling the fires. </para>
          <para>That sufficient attention has not been paid to the restoration of our depleted timber supplies is shown by statistics. In 1927, we imported into Australia 499,920,000 super feet of timber, principally softwood. This was valued at £5,034,000. In the same year we exported 114,000,000 super feet of timber, valued at £1.372,000. This was mainly hardwood timber, and the bulk of it jarrah, from Western Australia. The quantity of timber reaching here from other parts is, therefore, approximately four times as great as the quantity wo send away. Reducing this to a unit-of-population basis we find that while 84 super feet of timber for each unit of the population is brought into the country, only18 feet <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> is sent away. The difference between our imports and exports of timber is a matter of serious moment. The gravity of the position is emphasized when we look at the timber export trade statistics over a series of years. In 1903 we exported 30 super, feet of timber <inline font-style="italic">par capita,</inline> and in 1913 the quantity had increased to 37 super, feet <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline> Thirteen years later it had fallen to 20 super, feet <inline font-style="italic">per capita,</inline> and in 1923 it suffered a further reduction to IS super, feet. Our chief exporter is Western Australia, jarrah being the principal timber sent away. But the last of the virgin jarrah country in that State will soon be cut out, and the export of this timber must then cease. The larger mills are gradually closing down. This is a sure indication of the decline and ultimate fall of this valuable industry, and of our increasing dependence upon sources of supply from overseas. At the present time the bulk of our imported timber comes from America. Her virgin forests on the Pacific slope enable her not only to meet the requirements of her population of 110,000,000, but also to send large quantities away. But these supplies are not inexhaustible. Forest authorities have computed that within the next 25 years the American stands of Oregon, western yellow pines and redwood will have been so reduced that there will be no exportable surplus. </para>
          <para>Our timbers of commerce fall into one of two classifications, hardwood and softwood. Of hardwoods, Australia has a splendid range of first quality woods. Jarrah, redgum, mountain ash, messmate, blackwood, .blue gum, red ironbark, grey and narrow-leafed ironbark, tallow-wood, spotted gum and turpentine, are timbers with the qualities of which we are all more or less familiar. Cedar, maple, white beech, crowsfoot, elm and black bean are a few of the cabinet woods that, with artistic treatment, compare with the best timbers in the world, being only rivalled by mahogany. Our softwoods are of high quality. Hoop pine, bunya, kauri, celery top and huon pine are splendid timbers. Unfortunately our supplies of all these timbers are fast coming to an end. Even now the annual cut represents only a very small part of our softwood consumption. </para>
          <para>The unenviable forestry position in which Australia finds herself is due to the lack of appreciation in the past of the fundamental principle that forests should be managed so that the cut of timber does not exceed the annual growth. </para>
          <para class="block">If this principle is not observed the inevitable result must be that our forests will become exhausted. In older countries of the world it is now generally recognized that to meet the timber need of a civilized community, 0.86 acres of fully developed and scientifically managed forest is required for each unit of the population. Had our original forests been properly exploited 5,000,000 acres of forest would have been sufficient to meet the needs of our present population of approximately, 6,000,000 people. Australia still has approximately 19,500,000 acres of forest, so that, with proper management, we should be able not only to supply our own needs, but to export the yield from 14,500,000 acres annually. The scientific management of our forest heritage would have enabled it to supply the needs of a population of 24,000,000. At the present rate of increase this position will not be reached for more than 60 years. Much of the mischief done is beyond remedy, but all is not lost. The Government has realized the national importance of afforestation and has already taken steps to encourage it. It is satisfactory to know that the British Empire Forestry Conference which met in Australia last year has endorsed this action. The report of this conference is of such great interest that copies have been circulated among honorable members and their attention is particularly directed to those sections dealing with purely Australian matters. </para>

          <para>The new clauses in the bill provide for  the  acceptance of gifts, donations and endowments. It is pleasing to know that the Australian Forestry School is being appreciated by the people of Australia and elsewhere. The trustees of the Schlich Memorial Fund, which was  established  to honor the memory of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Schlich, of the Indian Forest Service, and of Oxford University, have made a gift of £75 to the school on the condition that the money is invested and the interest earned each year used for the purchase of a gold medal to be awarded to the best student of the school each year. We may be sure that the trustees of the fund were satisfied with the educational standard of the school before they made this gift. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Russel</inline> Grimwade, of Melbourne, has recently endowed the school to the extent of £5000. This magnificent gift will provide a travelling scholarship every two years to qualified Australian foresters.  The  advantage of this to Australia will be apparent when it is borne in mind that the successful scholars will have the opportunity of studying forests in other parts of the world that have been under scientific management for upwards of three hundred years. Another valuable endowment has been given by the Sydney and Suburban Timber Merchants Association. This consists of a sum of £50 annually, which this year will be devoted to books for the library of the students. Other like contributions will, no doubt, be contributed. </para>
          <para>A prize of £10 annually has also been given, and this will be awarded for the best essay on a forestry subject. It will be seen that the bill provides for a forestry fund, which will be under the control of trustees. These trustees will consist of the Inspector-General of Forests, the Secretary to the Department of the Treasury, and the Secretary to the Department of Home Affairs. The trustees are to have power to invest the fund moneys and apply them to the furtherance of forestry in such manner as the Minister approves. Donations to the fund will be receivable by the Inspector-General, who will be responsible for their payment into the fund. I have briefly explained the provisions of the bill, and T think that it will commend itself to all honorable members. </para>

            <para>.- When the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bruce)</inline> made to the House a statement in which he informed honorable members that it was proposed to send an expedition to the Antarctic I asked him to move the formal motion " That the paper be printed " so that Parliament might express its views upon the matter. In doing that I had two objects in view: I wished to study the right honorable gentleman's statement, but more particularly I desired that the Commonwealth Parliament and not the Government only should stand behind those who are asked to take the risks which are inseparable from such an expedition. This is one of the matters that should be handled by us as a nation. Nobody knows what lies ahead in the Antarctic. These expeditions of exploration may enable us to plant the Australian flag on new soil; but what the developments may be only the future can reveal. The cost of this expedition, according to the Prime Minister, will be £16,000. That seems to me to be an under-estimate, in the light of our experience of previous expeditions of a similar character. That of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Douglas</inline> Mawson cost in the vicinity of £60,000. A very important item of cost, however, is the ship, and I gathered from the right honorable gentleman that the vessel which is to be used on this occasion, the <inline font-style="italic">Discovery,</inline> is to be placed at our disposal free of cost by the British Government. Mention has been made of the financial results which may accrue from the planting of our flag in certain portions of Antarctica. The honorable member for Franklin mentioned whaling. </para>

              <para>- I believe that Austra'ian people ought to have the opportunity to share with foreign countries the exploitation of that area of water. To me, however, that is a secondary consideration. I believe that the principal advantages lie in the direction of the scientific discoveries that may be made. I recently read a statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. David</inline> Stead, the  president  of the Geographical Soc;  Pty  in New South Wales, in which he said - </para>

          <para class="block">It has been claimed that if we possessed a greater knowledge of the weather conditions in the Antarctic we should be in a better position to forecast future conditions in different parts of the world. Whether that claim can be established, I do not know; but if there is any basis for it we should certainly explore it. </para>
          <para>I have very vivid recollections of the last expedition undertaken by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Douglas</inline> Mawson in 1911. I was then, as I am now, a member of the Federal Parliament. The expedition was guaranteed by the Government of the day, and I watched with keen interest for each report that came to hand. I am pleased to be able to say that Australasia leads the world in the discoveries that have been made in the Antarctic regions, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Douglas</inline> Mawson is in the van of those who have undertaken expeditions in the extent of the work that he has accomplished. Therefore, I consider that in him we have made a very happy choice of leader for this expedition. Australia owes an obligation to future generations to enlarge the knowledge of the world, and to other countries to contribute towards the discoveries that are made. Excursions into the unknown are always fascinating, and accounts of discoveries cannot fail to stir the imagination. That is the appeal which this expedition makes to me, and I believe that it will appeal in a similar way to the majority of the people of Australia. Australians have never been backward in penetrating into the unknown. Our forefathers, with the true pioneering spirit, blazed the track through the unknown continent of Australia, and Australians have always played a not inconsiderable part in voyages of discovery. I have no doubt that the adventurous spirit of our people to-day is as strong as it has ever been. I, and those who sit on this side, support the Prime Minister and the Government in its proposal to send these daring men on this expedition. It is our earnest wish that their mission may be successful, and that they may have a safe return. </para>

            <para>.- An enterprise which is inspired by a spirit of adventure not only is good for those who undertake it, but also reflects credit upon the country which supports it, and cannot fail to have a beneficial effect upon the community as a whole. Unquestionably the scientific knowledge of the world is' enlarged by such expeditions as this; but I am rather doubtful if it will have any material financial result. The most important result, to my mind, will be the extension of our meteorological knowledge, and that is of supreme importance to Australia. This country is now, and has been for some time, suffering from adverse natural conditions, and it is incumbent upon us to investigate thoroughly every source from which we may be able to draw information that will assist us to predict adverse seasons and prepare against them. If we had a greater knowledge of changes that may occur in cycles in the Antarctic it might   be possible for us to determine in advance the nature of any particular season of the year. For that reason alone the expedition is justified. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>My principal reason for rising, however, was to refer to a matter that is becoming more and more important to Australia. It concerns a sphere of knowledge that so far we have not sufficiently explored. Time and again it has been urged that we should co-operate with South Africa in studying climatic cycles, with a view to our being notified at the earliest possible moment of any climatic changes. Hitherto it has been our custom to look only to the north and north-west, and to consider the influence of the  monsoonal  seasons upon our own. I believe that a comparison of those monsoonal seasons with antarctic variations of climate will prove very fruitful in increasing our knowledge, and enable us to predict the future with greater certainty. I again ask the Government to enter into negotiations with South Africa so that we may work co-operatively in this matter. </para>

            <para>. - I take this opportunity to express my disgust at the action which the Prime Minister took against me in 1926, when I was selected by the trade union movement as its delegate to the International Labour Conference. Those of us who were associated with the 1925 elections will remember that a good deal was said regarding the necessity for making provision for the appointment of trade union  leaders  by the agency of the secret ballot. Long before that time it was decided that Australia's delegate to the International Labour Conference should be chosen by means of a ballot of the labour councils throughout Australia. Those councils were asked to submit nominations, the idea being that if more than one nomination was received, a ballot would be taken by a central body. Prior to 1926 this method of selecting Labour's representative was approved of by the Government, if not directly, at least indirectly, because the delegates who had been chosen in that way were accepted by the Government. In 1926 a similar course was followed, and the ballot revealed that the choice had fallen upon me. One would naturally think that the Prime Minister would have been very keen to give effect to a decision obtained in that way in view of his utterances during the previous election campaign. Yet when my nomination was submitted to the Government, it refused to accept it and endeavoured to get some one else to accept nomination and thus scab upon the Labour movement. Its efforts were unsuccessful because of the solidarity and loyalty of the trade unions. Had the Government been successful in getting some one outside the circle of the trade union movement to accept this nomination, there was a strong possibility that when that representative went to Geneva the representatives of the workers of other nations would refuse to associate with him. Some time previous to this incident, a similar position arose in respect of a Japanese delegation. The Japanese Government refused to accept the nominee of the bona fide labour movement and chose a representative outside of the trade union movement in that country, but the genuine representatives of the movement were able to reach Geneva first, and, as a result of their efforts, the government's nominees were ignored by the representatives of the workers of other countries. No doubt that incident bore heavily on the mind of the Prime Minister, because at a conference of this nature, where the nations of the world gather, the ventilation of grievances such as I have referred to does not do the country concerned any good. It was only within three days of the vessel leaving Sydney that I was informed of the decision of the Government to accept my nomination. That will live long in my memory. This Government has used its power to inconvenience and humiliate, if possible, a humble citizen of this country, and for the moment it was successful. Perhaps the time will come when those responsible for that action will suffer  somewhat similarly at the hands of those with whom I am associated to-day. </para>

              <para>- It is a good practice at times to give some people a dose of t their own medicine, because that is the only way to bring home to them the fact that the working class sections of the community are entitled to at least some consideration at the hands of the Government. I attended the conference in question of the International Labour Organization on behalf of the workers of Australia, and I returned to this country convinced that the purposes for which that movement had been established were not being given effect. When President Wilson went to the continent, he had in view, I believe, the establishment of a giant organization for the settlement of differences of opinion between nations and the improvement of industrial conditions throughout the world. That was the original policy of the International Labour Organization, but I have followed its development since its establishment, and I am now fully convinced that it is not carrying out the work for which it was intended. As a matter of fact it is misleading the people. The preamble to part xiii. of the treaty which governs the International Labour Organization, reads - </para>

            <para>The ultimate object of the International Labour Organization is to contribute to the establishment of world peace, which is the aim of the League of Nations. It is implied, however, that peace cannot be secured simply by the prevention of war between nations. It must be based on social and industrial peace within the separate communities of the world. </para>
            <para>Social peace' must be endangered as long as the masses of the workers of the world have to work under inhuman conditions. It is expressly recognized that such conditions of work do exist. One of the chief reasons for their existence is that under the present economic competition between nations, the exploitation of labour in any country re-acts on conditions of labour and prevents or retards the progress of the standard of living among the workers in other countries. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>That is a praiseworthy objective, hut unfortunately the ideals of the International Labour Organization are not being car-ried out. In 1919, at a conference held in Washington, the question of a universal 48-hour working week was discussed. All the countries of the world who are signatories to the treaty were represented at that conference, and the different points of view were thoroughly and exhaustively examined. A uniform standard of hours was arrived at. Since then only four countries have ratified that decision, two of those ratifications being conditional. That is an extraordinary position, considering that the League of Nations comprises  56  countries. Great Britain is one of the worst offenders. At a recent meeting in Germany of the governing body of the International Labour Organization, the British Government's representatives explained that while they agreed to the decision arrived at in 1919, for a universal 48-hour working week, they did so believing that certain inquiries would first be instituted. Although several years had elapsed since that decision had been made, they now suggested that the whole question should again be referred to the International Labour Organization, and another conference called together to discuss it, thus proving their insincerity on the whole question. We look to Great Britain for a lead in these matters, and one would certainly not expect that great industrial country which had been responsible for the calling together of many conferences between 1919 and 1926 on the same matter, not to recognize the solemn obligation that it had undertaken at the conference of 1919. That is conclusive evidence that the holding of these conferences is waste of money, and at the same time is misleading the workers of the countries associated with Geneva. When the governing body of the International Labour Organization met in Germany, the French workers' delegate castigated the British Government on its attitude, comparing her attitude as being on all fours with that of other countries who treated agreements simply as scraps of paper. Great Britain failed to carry out its undertaking to right the wrongs of its workers, although that undertaking should have been just as binding as any agreement entered into between Great Britain and  airy other power for mutual protection in time of war. I strongly support the opinion of the French workers' delegate, because Great Britain was in duty bound to give effect to the decision that had been arrived at by the representatives of the nations that attended the conference. The preamble in the report makes reference to bringing backward countries to the stage reached by the more advanced countries. One would naturally expect any representative appointed by this Government who attends the conference, to vote for a standard of living throughout the world, similar to that of Australia. Any vote to the contrary would be an act of treachery on his part to the people of Australia. This Government was returned to power on the understanding that it accepted the condition of labour now prevailing in this country. We have built up in Australia social standards which are far in advance of those established in other parts of the world. One would therefore think that the Government's policy would be to advise its representatives to vote for a standard of living similar to that existing in Australia, but what happened? The Government's representative on every occasion voted for a standard far below that of Australia, and one in line with the backward countries of Europe.  His  actions proved that honorable members opposite accept the prevailing industrial conditions here only because strong labour organizations force them to do so. If those organizations ceased to exist, the logical attitude of those honorable members would be to attempt to lower our standards to those of southern Europeans. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook, who represented the Commonwealth Government on this occasion, voted on every occasion for standards lower than those which prevail in Australia. I was not surprised that the employers' delegate did so, because the organized employers do not believe in the hours of labour and rates of pay that our workers now enjoy. Therefore, the opposition of their delegate was to be expected ; but surely the representative of a Government that professes to subscribe to the social and industrial standards of Australia might have been expected to support a policy which would bring the more backward countries up to the level of the more advanced or at least in line with the country he represented. </para>

              <para>- I have referred to what has happened since 1919, and it is apparent that at the present rate of progress that decision will never be realized in my time, if at all. Before the British Delegation leaves London for Geneva a conference is held, to which the Australian delegate is invited. The matters to be discussed at the Conference of the International Labour Organizations are considered, and an understanding is arrived at so that the representatives of the United Kingdom and the dominions may vote <inline font-style="italic">en bloc</inline> in accordance with the wishes of the British Government. Does the Commonwealth Government believe in the maintenance of the conditions now imposed on the British workers? If it does, the vote of its delegate was consistent with that belief. But the Government at election time speaks in hearty approval of the industrial legislation introduced in Australia by the Labour party, assures the electors that it has no intention to remove it from the statute-book, and sometimes even promises to amend it for the purpose of carrying reforms still further. Having regard to such protestations, the Government's representative might reasonably be expected to endeavour to give effect to that policy at conferences on the other side of the world. I take strong exception to the Australian delegate being called into conference with those of the United Kingdom, and committed to a programme that is not in conformity with Australian standards. On one occasion when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Joseph</inline> Cook was absent from Geneva he was represented by his private secretary. Some question arose in regard to which a decision had not been reached in London. At the conference the employers' and workers' delegates sit together. I naturally expected that the acting representative of the Commonwealth Government would have discussed with the employers' delegate and myself the attitude to be adopted in regard to these matters, but instead of doing that he sought advice from the British delegation as to how he should vote on a matter affecting the interests of the Australian people. I have no desire to blame him personally, because he was only carrying out instructions. </para>

I am afraid that at these conferences, both at London and at Geneva, we are often committed to things which, if the people understood them, they would not approve for one moment. The representatives and supporters of the Government when travelling abroad and meeting foreign representatives of industry boast of the high industrial standards in Australia, and their jealous protection of them, but when opportunities are given to them to put their professions into practice, and bring the backward countries up to our standards, they vote in the opposite way. I have no doubt that those workers' delegates who have followed me to Geneva since 1926 will bear out the statements I am making. </para>

          <para>I doubt whether the League of- Nations is accomplishing the purpose for which it was created. This huge institution is being used to make the world believe that it is functioning to maintain peace. In reality, it is just tiding the world over a transition period during which the various peoples are not prepared to visualize another war. The League is being controlled by the larger powers, and the old system of bartering between nations is proceeding as of yore. Every second person one meets in Geneva is connected with some publication. These men have a very intimate knowledge of what is going on behind the scenes, and while in Geneva I often discussed matters with them. They know the methods adopted by the larger nations to retain control of the League - the bartering of seats on the Council to small nations, the selling of the rights of one country to another, in order to secure votes. These things are happening under the auspices of the Council as extensively as before the League was established. The Council was discussing some time ago the reduction  of armaments, but that was a mere gesture. Expenditure on armaments at the rate which modern invention had made necessary towards the conclusion of the war would have meant bankruptcy to the nations. If Britain were to continue to compete against Germany, France, Italy, and the United States of America in the race of armaments, the cost would be ruinous. Realizing this, the nations had to devise a means whereby they could tide over this awkward period of readjustment. There is no sincerity of purpose in those who are foremost in the League. In illustration of that, I remind the House that at the time when the League was discussing the reduction of armaments Great Britain and France were negotiating a secret treaty to proportion their naval armaments to their present financial means. The following cablegram from London was published in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> on the 8th October last - " It is not surprising that some governments are beginning to lose faith in the League of Nations," says the <inline font-style="italic">Manchester Guardian</inline> in a leading article. " The League was never more shamefully betrayed than it was by the private naval agreement reached between Britain and France, because it was made when the League was trying to secure a general reduction of armaments." </para>

            <para>.  -  The House has just heard the honorable member for West Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley),</inline> who represented ibc workers of Australia at the; 1926 Conference of the International Labour Organization, declare that it is a useless body, and is designed to defeat rather than promote the interests of the workers. I went to Geneva as the representative of Australia at the 1926 Assembly of the League, and there for the first time I beard a good deal about the honorable member. I found that he had utilized I lis position as the representative of the workers of Australia at an international convention to make a partisan attack upon the Commonwealth Government. The result was that the people in Geneva had a most unfortunate impression of the manners of Australians. In this Parliament and in Australia it is quite proper for us to have our party fights, but we should not carry them into an international conference. Because the gentleman who has just resumed his seat was unable to exclude from the International Labour Conference that acute, intense and suspicious party feeling which has characterized every speech that he has made in this Parliament, I found my position at Geneva as the representative of the people of Australia a very difficult one. I suggest that the men and women who leave Australia for the purpose of representing Australia at international conferences should at least leave behind their excessive political partisanships. Unless they do so they will do Australia very grave injury in the eyes of the nations of the world. Surely we should seek a reputation for courtesy rather than for bad manners. </para>

          <para>The honorable member for West Sydney used the opportunity which his position at Geneva gave him to attack the present political regime in Italy, although no person acting in the capacity in which he was acting is warranted in attacking a government upon which the Australian Government is on friendly terms. </para>
          <para>The honorable member said that the International Labour Organization was useless and that it was designed to injure rather than help the workers; but  he  adduced no evidence whatever in support of his statement. I suggest that the International Labour Organization should be commended for anything that it does to raise the status of the workers in other parts of the world. Such action must be of advantage to Australia. Our people enjoy a high standard of living and we have great difficulty in competing with what wc regard as the low-grade labour countries overseas. If the international labour organization can do anything to elevate the standards of these countries it is to our advantage, irrespective of our particular party politics. </para>
          <para>This morning the Prime Minister, in reply to a question by the honorable member for Brisbane <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr.</inline> D. Cameron)  regarding  the appointment of the workers' delegate to the next conference, laid upon the table of the House certain papers dealing with the subject. I propose to acquaint members with the contents of those papers, for the purpose of indicating the great difficulty with which the Government has to contend in securing a representative of the workers of Australia at Geneva. The appointment of representatives of both employers and employees to go to Geneva is governed by the Treaty of Versailles, which provides that they shall be nominated by the Government, and by no other authority, and be chosen in agreement with representative organizations in each case. The act of nomination rests with the Government, and no other authority has any right to nominate or select the delegates. In order to secure mutually acceptable delegates the practice of the Government has been to invite representative organizations of employers and employees to suggest at least three names, though they may suggest more if they please, from which a final selection may be made. An attempt has been made by the so-called Australasian Council of Trade Unions, though it is not Australasian in any sense, to arrogate to itself an exclusive  right to appoint the delegate to represent the workers of this country. Every honorable member of this House knows that this  organization does not represent the whole of the workers of Australia. It does not even represent all our trade unions, for the largest and most important of them, the Australian Workers Union, is not affiliated to the council and in fact positively repudiates it. In spite of this the council has sought to choose the delegate to go to Geneva. The Government has resisted this action, as it would resist similar action on the part of any particular organization of employers to appoint the employers' representative. The nomination must be made by the Government in agreement with the various organizations concerned. The organizations and the Government should have an equal share in making the choice. To illustrate the tactics which the Australasian Council of Trade Unions has adopted in the past, and which it is attempting to repeat this year, I call the attention of honorable members to the following telegram received from the secretary of the council on the 29th January last :  - </para>

This information is desired by reason of the fact that statements have been published under the authority of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions and have been expressly approved by the council as representing its views which condemn the International Labour Office as an institution designed to injure, and in fact injuring, the interests of the workers. </para>
            <para>These statements are contained in the <inline font-style="italic">Pan Pacific Worker,</inline> a journal which is issued by the Pan Pacific Relations Committee of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions. </para>
            <para>In the issue of 1 5th May,1928. the following resolution of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions is published.

" </para>
            <para>In the first issue of the journal (2nd April. 1928) an article appears which states (page 25) that - "The League of Nations and all its agencies and agents must be combated ruthlessly. " The International Labour Office is organically associated with the League of Nations. </para>

          <para class="block">The Geneva " Labour " Office is a creation of the Imperialist League of Nations which is run by and in the interests of the leading imperialist powers. It is nothing but the agency of the capitalist governments and the employers, intended to demoralize the working class by rousing in the latter's ranks the dangerous illusion that the International Labour Office can do something for the working class. But by its very nature the International Labour Office cannot serve the workers' interests. It can only serve as a smoke-screen for camouflaging the clash of class interests. " </para>

          <para>The question of the further relations of the International " Labour " Office of Geneva was brought up for discussion. A resolution was moved by certain members of the council to the effect "...... that after careful review of the nine years' operation of the International Labour Office and their failure to endorse the most elementary decisions in the interests of the working class, and. . . . ...... in view of the clear alliance of the International Labour Office with the most reactionary governments in the world and in the interests of the Australian Trade Union Movement, the Australasian Council of Trade Unions withdraws from attending the International Labour Office conferences in future." </para>
          <para>An amendment to the effect " that Labour's connexion with the International Labour Office and with the League of Nations be considered at the next AllAustralian Trade Union Congress" was adopted so that the question of the future relations of the Australian Trade Union Movement with the International Labour Office will be finalized by the next congress which is to meet in May, 1929, in Melbourne. </para>
          <para>This attitude towards the International Labour Office is maintained throughout the <inline font-style="italic">Pan Pacific Worker.</inline> A further example is to be found in the article on the International Labour Office in the twelfth issue dated 15th October, 1928. </para>

            <para>With reference to your letter of the 15th instant, addressed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator the</inline> Honorable J. E. Ogden, Assistant Minister for Industry, I observe that you do not deal with the matters mentioned in the letter to you, dated the 25th January, 1929, in reply to which your communication is written. You do not make any statement (explicit or otherwise) as to the views of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions with reference to either the good faith or the utility of the International Labour Organization. Your letter does, however, state that the question of the relation of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions to the International Labour Organization may be considered in May next. As the representatives to the conference must leave Australia by the 23rd April at the latest, it is impossible to postpone the matter until next May. </para>
            <para>The ambiguous attitude of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions towards the International Labour Organization creates a real difficulty for the Government. It now appears that the Australasian Council of Trade Unions does not purport to control its own policy, but that it is governed not only by decisions of what is described as the All Australian Trade Union Congress, but also by decisions of the Trades and Labour Councils of the States. </para>
            <para>With reference to the last paragraph of your letter, previous communications from the Government have informed you of the fact that neither your organization nor any other organization in the Commonwealth has either the right or the power to select a workers' representative. The Government invites suggestions from organizations, but the representative must, to use the words of the Treaty of Versailles, which apply to this matter, be nominated by the Government and chosen in agreement with the most representative industrial organizations. </para>
            <para>The Government, however, has no desire to limit the field of choice of representatives unless this is absolutely unavoidable, and if you will promptly forward the names of three persons who would be regarded by your council as persons suitable to take part in the work of the next conference as workers' representatives, the matter will receive consideration. </para>

            <para>I am directed to state that it has already been made clear that no organization of employers or employees has the right or power to choose a delegate to the conference, and your lettergram does not alter this position. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Government has the responsibility of nominating the delegate to represent the workers of Australia at the conference of the International Labour Organization at Geneva. That delegate has to be chosen in agreement with representative workers' organizations. The Government has got into touch with the most representative of those organizations in Australia. There are the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, which represents a largo number of the trade unions of Australia, and the Australian Workers Union, which is the most powerful and important Union in Australia, and is not affiliated in any way with the Australasian Council of Trade Unions. Then the Port Adelaide Trades and Labour Council insists on an individual right to submit nominations. It is not for the Government to deny to any organization the right to make suggestions. If it were to disqualify any organization from submitting names, it would be rightly condemned in this House. Letters have been written to the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Workers Union and the Port Adelaide Trades and Labour Council, asking for three names to be submitted, and the Government finds itself in a position of genuine difficulty. The Australasian Council of Trade Unions, as honorable members will see from what I have read, has been responsible for the publication of articles strongly condemning, fundamentally, the International Labour Organization. The Government wrote to the Australasian Council of Trade Unions asking whether it really desired to be represented at a meeting of an organization of which it so strongly disapproved, and which it evidently mistrusted. The reply was that, notwithstanding those expressions of opinion, it demanded the right to. select a representative for the whole of the workers of Australia, and that the question of the relation of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions to the International Labour Organization would be dealt with in May next. Possibly in May next the Australasian Council of Trade Unions will disown any association with, or any degree of support of, the International Labour Organization. What would be the position if a person suggested by the Australasian Council of Trade Unions had been chosen, and that person was on his way to Europe in May next? It is very embarrassing for the Government. In the meantime, the Australasian Council of Trade Unions insists on the right to nominate one person, who must be chosen by the Government to go to the conference. A letter in identical terms was sent to the Australian Workers Union, and by a majority of one vote that organization decided not to send in any names to the Government: but three names have been received from the Port Adelaide Trades and Labour Council. The result is that the only nominations that the Government has are from the latter body. I think that  honorable members will agree that this is a position of extraordinary difficulty for the Government. </para>

              <para>- If the honorable member had listened to the correspondence that I have read, he would have realized that it is a position of genuine difficulty not created by the Government itself. The Government desires to send to Geneva a delegate who genuinely represents the workers of Australia; but in the performance of its duty to the people, it cannot surrender its right of choice in conjunction with the workers' organizations. The Government cannot possibly agree that any single organization has the right to dictate who shall be the representative of the workers. Under the terms of the treaty, the appointment must be made in agreement with the workers' organizations; but there must be some field of choice for the Government. If the Australasian Council of Trade Unions persists in nominating one man only, and says that the Government is bound to adopt its nomination, the result may be - although the matter is still to be considered by the Government - that this year no workers' representative will go to Geneva. I have taken this opportunity of placing the position before honorable members in order that they may understand some of the difficulties that confront the Government. </para>

              <para>- It does not take much to stir the Minister. He thinks that he can get this House " lifted " just as it suits the Government, and that honorable members on the Opposition side must remain silent while he is allowed to " get away with " general attacks of this description. I have no objection to a discussion of the attitude of the organized trade unions to the Internal iona Labour Organization. If we are to understand that an opportunity will be given for a full-dress debate, I am willing that this discussion shall be continued until the matter has been thoroughly thrashed out, and if it causes any inconvenience to honorable members, they will know on whom to lay the blame. It will be laid at the door of the Attorney-General. </para>

              <para>- That honorable member took advantage of a motion for the printing of a paper to deal with some incident connected with a past conference, and he was within his rights in raising the matter to which he referred. Whether the Attorney-General or other members think that it was a proper contribution to the debate is another matter. But at least the honorable member for West Sydney took the first opportunity available to him to make his comments upon the attitude of the Government to himself, which I think he was entitled to do. The Attorney-General opened his remarks by a castigation of the honorable member. He regards him as being entirely in the wrong in raising the matter. If any ill feeling exists, it was caused by the Government when it held up the nomination of the honorable member for West Sydney as the representative of organized labour in Australia, because he did not happen to suit it. When the Government asked the honorable member to take that trip across the sea on three days' notice, it was guilty of an act of discourtesy and contempt which the honorable member was justified in resenting at the earliest opportunity which was afforded after he had come face to face with it. Listening to the cold-blooded utterance of the Attorney-General, one would imagine that the honorable member had been a disgrace to Australia and that he had not upheld the dignity of organized labour; that his language and demeanour were such that we ought to be ashamed of him as a representative of the workers of Australia. It is only fair to tell this House, and through it the country, that that view was not held by the delegates who attended the conference and came in close touch with our delegate. There is no better proof of that than the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Beasley was elected  Chairman  of the International Workers Group on the nomination of the British delegate. That was the first occasion upon which the representative of Australia or of any other dominion had had such an honour conferred upon him; and since that time no Australian representative of the workers, the employers, or the Government has been elected  chairman  of his respective group. That is my answer to the Attorney-General's attempt to slander the name and fame of the honorable member for West Sydney. He endeavoured to disparage his work by saying that he made an attack upon Fascism. The honorable member merely carried out a decision that had been arrived at by the International Workers Group. Apparently the Attorney-General would have our representative stifled, or compel him to deliver speeches written by the Government. First of all he wants the representative of the workers to be handpicked by the Government, and then wishes to dictate his utterances. The Government will learn that the organized workers of this country will not submit to such dictation. </para>

          <para>The Attorney-General went further, and lodged an attack upon the Australasian Council of Trade Unions and organized labour because they insisted upon the right to elect their own representative. The labour organizations of this country simply declared that that was their right, and that their representative was not to be hand-picked by the Government. The Government wishes to have a representative, not of organized, but of disorganized labour, and with that object has been issuing invitations to various bodies so that they will compete with one another and bring about disruption in the ranks of the workers. The Attorney-General admitted to-day that a separate invitation was sent to the Aus-tralian Workers Union, than which there is not a greater organization in Australia. At the last conference of the Australian Workers Union, the Government was repulsed by the refusal of that organization to send a separate nomination. It now admits that its interference, and its attempts at dictation, have brought matters to such a pass that we are not likely to have at Geneva any representative of the organized workers of Australia. </para>

          <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">(By leave.)</inline> - Honorable members will recall that from time to time during the past few years it has seemed possible to establish in Australia the very valuable newsprint industry. In 1925 the proposals submitted seemed likely to result in the immediate establishment of the industry. But it was evident that, before that could happen, some measure of assistance, either by way of tariff protection or a bounty, would have to be given. I then stated that the Government was prepared to pay a bounty of £4 a ton upon newsprint manufactured from Australian hardwoods. Unfortunately those expectations were not realized. In 1926 I authorized the publication in London of the statement that the Government still held to its offer to bring down a measure for the payment of a bounty in the event of the industry being established. Considerable progress has since been made, and it is now quite clear that newsprint can be produced on a commercial basis from Australian hardwoods. Two very large enterprises for the carrying out of this work are in contemplation, and their plans for raising the necessary capital  are, according to information in the possession of the Government, practically completed. But as some doubts appear to exist regarding the present attitude of the Government, I desire to make to the House, and through it to the country, the definite statement that we are prepared to submit to this Parliament a bill providing for the payment of a bounty at the rate of £4 a ton on newsprint manufactured in Australia wholly from Australian timbers, and also to provide for a deferred duty of a similar amount to come into operation when the payment of the bounty ceases - a condition of the bounty to be that it shall be paid only if there is an immediate production of 30,000 tons. I have very little doubt that if the industry is established, that quantity will be very considerably exceeded. </para>

            <para>- It will be for this Parliament to determine that limit. I am perfectly certain that it would provide an amount which would enable a substantial proportion of our newsprint requirements to be manufactured in Australia. I do not wish those who are dealing with this matter to get the impression that we might pay a bounty only upon some comparatively small quantity. If this enterprise is seriously pressed on, and a big proportion of our requirements is produced in Australia, that will not deter either the Government or this Parliament from carrying out its undertaking to assist the industry to the extent of £4 a ton. </para>

          <para>.- We have only to look at the business paper to see that the Government has not by a long way carried out all its election promises, yet the Prime Minister now proposes to adjourn the House until August. One piece of legislation, the Workers' Compensation Act, has been on the stocks for a long time, although it has passed through the Senate. To-day we are working under the most obsolete Workmen's Compensation Act in the world, and yet no attempt has been made to pass the amending legislation through this House. The Government is eager to get into a long recess, because it fears that it cannot command a majority in  divisions.  During the session it has been watching with anxious eyes the individual members in the corner. We have been sitting for 25 days and the election was held last November. We are not to sit again until some time in August. Is that carrying on the business of the country? </para>

            <para>- One thing that I appreciate about the honorable member when he is wide awake is his candour. I am prepared to accept his frank admission. This Government has done too much damage, and I suggest that it might continue to sit, in order to carry out some of its election promises and by that means balance some of the damage that it has done. I suggest that it might contribute immediately to the credit side of its ledger. A bill providing for national insurance has been introduced to carry out a three-years-old promise, and is still in the second-reading stage, but it contains no provision for unemployment. The unemployment in this country is growing and the problem should be faced. The imports to Australia are increasing ;md adding to unemployment. The financial drift is day by day getting worse,  and  we have industrial upheavals everywhere. The number of unemployed this winter will be greater than it has ever been before in the history of Australia. Instead of going into recess, this Parliament should be sitting and safeguarding the affairs of the nation. </para>

          <para>.- I join in the protest of the Leader of the Opposition respecting the Government's neglect to pass through this House the bill amending the Workmen's Compensation Act. The Commonwealth Government, as the employer of a large number of workmen, should set an example to other employers in Australia. I urged last session that this bill should be passed through Parliament. When it was introduced the Minister made a second-reading speech and I obtained the adjournment of the debate. No further opportunity was given for discussion before Parliament prorogued. The Prime Minister mentioned this legislation in his policy speech. There are many anomalies under the existing act, and it is only fair to the Commonwealth employees that they should receive the benefits that are outlined in the amending legislation. I ask the Prime Minister to provide in the bill for the payment of compensation to be retrospective, so that Commonwealth employees who may be injured during the recess may reap the benefit of that legislation. </para>

          <para>. - I fully appreciate the demonstration that the Leader of the Opposition has made. It was an admirable effort, and I recognize that it was necessary in view of his position as Leader of the Opposition. I am encouraged to find a deep feeling among honorable members opposite that Parliament should continue its sitting and carry out the Government's programme as outlined to the country at the last election. This is the first occasion on which I have seen any enthusiasm among members of the Opposition for the Government's policy and programme. But there is a limit to the amount of work that this Parliament can do. We have had a session of six weeks, and it is undoubtedly a monument of achievement for all time. It is well established that one should not attempt too much. It is very desirable that we should consult the States before submitting to this Parliament the measures which the Government has outlined to the country. The Government proposes to pursue that course, and I assure honorable members opposite that in the latter part of this year they will have plenty of opportunity to sit in this Parliament and discuss the Government's programme. I ask honorable members to compare the sittings of the State Parliaments with those of the Commonwealth Parliament. If they do that, they will find that we have every justification for being proud of our record. I regret that it has not been possible to complete the passage of the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Bill, which has already passed the Senate this session, but full consideration will be given by the Government to the suggestion made by the honorable member for Grey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lacey)</inline> that no Commonwealth employee should be prejudiced by this unavoidable delay. </para>

            <para>- On the 14th March last the honorable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Watkins)</inline> referred to the matter of the discharge from the Royal Australian Navy of Stoker W. Molineux. I promised to bring the honorable member's remarks under the notice of the Minister for Defence and to make a further statement on the subject. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The statement read by the honorable member for Newcastle on the 14th March contains three main allegations. </para>
          <para>The  first  is that money was criminally wasted on refitting H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane.</inline> The Naval Board state that Stoker Moline is not competent to express an opinion on this matter, which is one for engineering experts. The facts are that the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> had been undergoing her quadrennial refit and was a stand-by job at the dockyard. The quadrennial refit is a very exhaustive one. It entailed </para>
          <para class="block">On this occasion the re-tubing of boilers, the renewal of water reservoirs, the internal examination and cleaning of turbines, and the renewal of electric wiring. The cost, which had been foreseen before work was commenced and for which provision had been made, was £83,000, and the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> was rendered efficient for a long period of service. It is recognized that her engine-room staff had a lot of work to do in preparing her for sea, and this work was well done. The second allegation is that bad food was supplied to the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane.</inline> In fact, the honorable member in his speech referred to it as "rotten" food. The Naval Board deny that such comments have any justification in fact. The standard of food supplied to the Royal Australian Navy is excellent, and it is carefully inspected before acceptance from contractors. Moreover, the naval cooks are experts, trained in the Cookery School at Flinders Naval Depot. No complaints were received about the food supplied to H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane</inline> on the cruise to Honolulu, and the officers' messes obtained provisions from the ordinary ship's stores. For the information of honorable members I have obtained the menu for a week at the identical period referred to, and it speaks for itself. </para>
          <para>The Naval Board will welcome at any time an inspection by honorable members of the victualling arrangements in H.M.A. ships, which provide for a most satisfactory dietary. </para>
          <para>The third and main allegation is that ex-Stoker Molineux was unjustly punished because he indulged in what the honorable member describes as "a prank." The naval authorities do not hold the view that it was a prank. They regard it very seriously. One  well-recognized  naval precept, they state, is that every person in the fleet is to conduct himself with the utmost respect to his superior officer and with strict obedience to his orders; he is at all times to discharge every part, of his duty with zeal and alacrity, and so far as circumstances admit, to assist all officers in the duties they have to perform. He is on all occasions to strive to promote the welfare of the naval service, and by the good order and regularity of his conduct show an example to those who may be subject to his command. </para>
          <para>One has only to peruse the statement read by the honorable member to see that it transgresses the spirit of this precept, and that its tone is insubordinate. </para>
          <para>Under naval regulations the captain is authorized to investigate certain offences and deal with them summarily. Stoker Molineux was charged with an offence to the prejudice of good order and naval discipline in that he did type poetry, the subject-matter of which was subversive to naval discipline. </para>
          <para>The naval regulations definitely give the captain the power to try offences of this kind and award punishment up to an authorized limit. </para>
          <para>Molineux had an officer to assist him at the first investigation, and at his subsequent appeal a second officer, selected by himself, assisted him. He had the right to call and examine witnesses. </para>
          <para>The charge was proved and Molineux was sentenced to 90 days' imprisonment. The captain recommended, also, that he be dismissed from the Service. </para>
          <para>The Naval Board carefully reviewed the evidence and confirmed the sentence, except that discharge was substituted for dismissal. </para>
          <para>In order to appreciate this case, it is necessary to remember that this rating was a member of a disciplined force, and of his own free will enlisted and took an oath of allegiance. He had the opportunity which is available to every man in the Naval Service of making a complaint to his superior officer if he had a grievance of any kind. Instead of adopting such a course, he deliberately set out to foment disaffection in the ship by surreptitiously publishing verses of an insubordinate character. These verses were also published in the Sydney press, with scurrilous allegations that a state of mutiny was existing in H.M.A.S. <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane,</inline> thus bringing the Naval Service into disrepute. </para>
          <para>Honorable members have only to read the so-called poem which this man typed and they will see that he was false to his oath. He talks of his ship as " this cursed ship," and he threatens his superior officers with violence. Verses of that nature surreptitiously placed, as they were, on the stokers' notice board cannot be described as " a prank." They are insidious propaganda intended to foment disaffection in a disciplined force, and such conduct cannot be tolerated in the Naval Service. </para>
          <para>I wish to assure honorable members that this man was tried strictly in accordance with the naval regulations, that he had every opportunity to bring forward evidence, and that his sentence was also in accord with naval regulations, and confirmed by higher authority. </para>

At the time I told the honorable member that I had no knowledge of any such happenings, but I have since received from the  Chairman  of the Shipping Board, which controls the Cockatoo Island dockyard, a telegram which, because of the publicity given to the suggestion that the methods adopted by the board in regard to the disposal of the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney</inline> fittings has been unbusinesslike, I think I should read. The telegram is as follows: - </para>

            <para>.-I wish to discuss the assistance which the Prime Minister the other night announced was to be given to the gold-mining industry of Australia. To the amazement of all connected with the industry, all that the Government proposes to make available is the small sum of £25,000. To say that the right honorable gentleman's announcement came as a sort of bombshell to the mining interests of Australia is putting it mildly. I shall not trespass on the patience of honorable members at this hour by reciting the many efforts that have been made to arrive at what extent of assistance should be given by the Federal Government to an industry whose importance to Australia can be gauged by the fact that it has been responsible for half the value of Australian mining production. From the beginning of Australia up to date, the value of its mineral output, including coal, has been £1,200,000,000 and gold has been responsible for £600,000,000 of this. There is no doubt that the Prime Minister is fully seised of the importance of giving assistance to the gold-mining industry. Five years ago he called together men engaged in gold-mining all over Australia. They met in the Treasury at Melbourne and put forward certain proposals. Subsequently the Western Australian Disabilities Commission investigated the position of the industry, and  the  chairman  of the commission recommended what the mining interests thought desirable - the payment of a gold bonus. Subsequently the Development and Migration Commission was asked to investigate the necessities of gold-mining in Australia, and over twelve months ago the Government received its recommendations, one of which was that a sum of £2."&gt;0,000 should be appropriated to assist the mines in the purchase of machinery. In the event of machinery having to be imported, because of its highly technical character, it was proposed that portion of this amount should be used for paying the customs duties upon it. Among those who made this recommendation was one gentleman who had a splendid technical knowledge of the subject of gold-mining. Another recommendation was that the unexpended vote of £36,000 under the Precious Metals Prospecting Act, should be set aside for the purpose of enabling technical advice to be obtained by people engaged in gold-mining. A further sum was to be set aside for special development in mines. I have tried to show that gold represents fully half the mineral and carboniferous wealth that has been Avon from the soil of Australia. This industry was the prime factor in the development of Victoria and Western Australia, and to a less extent, Queensland. The reason for its decline is that although the average cost of mining has increased from 19s. per ton before the war to 38s. per ton now, gold has a standard value, and because it is a medium of exchange it is impossible to get more for it now than when the cost of winning it was 50 per cent. less. For this reason, the industry is in a precarious condition and I ask that Western Australia, Queensland and other States which arc remote from the highly protected industries of the Eastern States and, therefore, do not get much benefit from the protective policy but are, in fact, penalized by the extra imposts on primary production, should participate in the assistance which the Government gives by way of bounty. It is remarkable that for other primary products, including wine and dried fruits, no less a sum than £900,000 was paid last year in bounties; this Parliament gave freely to them without requiring anything like the extensive preliminary investigation that has taken place into the gold-mining industry. But in regard to the one industry which is unfortunate enough to be represented by only one man, the recommendations of the commission appointed by the Government have not been adopted. The commission suggested the setting aside of £250,000 as one means of assisting the gold-mining industry, and the allocation of £25,000 at this late hour is nothing but a gratuitous insult to a worthy section of the community. Western Australia contributes over £2,000,000 annually to customs revenue, and what does it get in return? Its people are willing to contribute towards the maintenance of the Queensland sugar industry, and most of them will support the continuance of the protectionist policy that costs £5 for every man, woman and child in Western Australia. But they are entitled to reciprocal treatment. The great interior of the continent may never be of great value for the production of stock, but its auriferous areas are the richest in the world. The people of Western Australia are entitled to assistance in the development of them, and 1 hope that the Government will see its way clear to propose something more adequate than the paltry £25,000 that has been offered. The Wiluna Consolidated Gold-mining Company which is financed by capital from abroad on the understanding that the Commonwealth will do something substantial to assist the industry, is waiting to import £100,000 worth of machinery. The amount that the Government has set aside for the assistance of the gold-mining industry throughout Australia would not suffice to pay more than half the customs duty on that plant. I trust that later this evening the Prime Minister will grant an interview to the Western Australian representatives with a view to the more just treatment of one of the great primary industries of the Commonwealth. </para>

            <para>. - As I have not been able to move the motion which has been standing in my name on the notice-paper since the opening of Parliament, for the appointment of a select committee to inquire into the fruit and hop industries, I take this opportunity to acquaint honorable members with the parlous condition of the  small fruits industry in Tasmania. Last year there was practically no market for these fruits. The processers who had been buying the fruit for years past suddenly announced that their purchases would be restricted, and that some of them would not be buying at all. The result was that the Premier of Tasmania, in Sydney, and I, in Melbourne, were seeking the assistance of retailers, housewives associations, and other bodies to enable the orchardists to dispose of portion of their crop. I have hero a copy of the contract which is forced upon the growers of apricots by the firm which is practically the only buyer in Tasmania. I intended to reserve it for investigation by the select committee; but that inquiry has been declined. In doing this, Ministers are sinning with their eyes open, because I have shown to them and others copies of the contract. This is the undertaking that the apricot-grower has to sign on pain of not being able to sell any of his fruit to this company which has almost a monopoly of the processing industry: - </para>

              <para>- I do not know; but I told most of them that I proposed to deal with this matter to-day. Recently the Development and Migration Commission issued a report dealing with the berry fruits of Tasmania. I have no hesitation in saying that its conclusions concerning the industry are the greatest drivel that one could read in any document of the kind. There is no reference in the report to raspberries, and I suppose that the relative production of raspberries and blackberries is in the ratio of 25 tons to 1 ton. Apparently, the members of the commission were unaware that raspberries are grown in Tasmania. The commission's recommendations are ludicrous. One of its suggestions is that if the growers leave the stalks on the strawberries, the fruit may be exported to Sydney or Melbourne ! That is what the growers have known for many years. The commission mentions incidentally that its recommendations should not in any way interfere with the development of private concerns. It suggests the formation of a. marketing company, on the directorate of which there shall be two representatives of existing monopolistic companies, two growers, and a  chairman  to be selected. Members of the commission draw high salaries, and no doubt they are men of ability; but it is unreasonable to expect any three men to be experts in the working of every industry in Australia. Certainly, members of the Development and Migration Commission are not experts in the fruit industry. Their report relating to the berry fruits industry in Tasmania is an absurd production. I have done my utmost to persuade the Government to institute an inquiry into the industry. I know only too well that thousands of men were practically beggared last year through not being able to dispose of their crop, and I know that large numbers will be in desperate straits this year. It is the duty of this Government to appoint a competent commission. </para>

            <para>- I emphasize the need for the appointment of a competent commission. I am certain that there could be selected from members of this House a small committee cognizant of the difficulties confronting our primary producers, who would be able to take evidence in Tasmania, analyse it, and present a useful report. Throughout the Huon, the Derwent Valley, and Collinsvale growers are producing raspberries and currants under most unfavorable marketing conditions. Even when they get a big crop and big prices, their returns are only fair, because the monopolistic concerns that are operating in Tasmania have a stranglehold on the industry. These growers naturally look to their representatives in Parliament to help them. </para>

              <para>- I have an original contract, -and I quoted from it word for word just now. Is nothing to be clone to prevent the loss of next season's crop? Are the growers to be compelled to sign this contract for another five years? If they refuse to sign it, the  companies  will not take any of their fruit, and their position will be utterly hopeless. Actually the small fruit-grower in Tasmania is at the mercy of Tiberius --these monopolistic companies that have a stranglehold on the people. </para>

              <para>- The Federal Government, I believe, could do something to help the growers. At all events, it must accept responsibility for the stupid report issued by the Development and Migration Commission, because that body was appointed by this Government. The report will be the subject of ridicule from one end of Australia to the other among people who understand the fruit-growing industry. It is because this Government is, through the Development and Migration Commission, responsible for its conclusions, that I appeal now to the Prime Minister to take action to help the fruit-growers in Tasmania. I invite the right honorable gentleman to select three honorable members from this House who are acquainted with the fruit industry, and appoint them as a select committee to investigate the conditions of the growers. If he does this I will give a guarantee that the inquiry will not cost the Government ls. for witnesses' fees. This is a fair offer. </para>

It is not to be expected that departmental officers in Canberra, Melbourne or Sydney would be able to understand fully the details of the industry. The inquiry should be conducted by men who have a thorough knowledge of the fruit-growers' difficulties. Again I appeal to the Prime Minister. Again I invite him to appoint three members of this House as a select committee. If necessary, he can limit the investigations to a period of two months. I repeat that, if he accepts my suggestion, the Commonwealth Government will not incur any expenditure by way of fees to witnesses. I earnestly urge the right honorable gentleman to do something to save these people.

              <para>- We have heard a good deal of late about the plight of certain primary industries on the mainland, but not one of them is in the parlous condition of the small fruit industry of Tasmania. The products of practically every other primary industry will keep for a short while without special provision having to be made, but the small fruit is ripe and rotten in three days. It must be handled immediately it is ready. If the process companies refuse to purchase it, it becomes a dead loss. While the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> was Prime Minister, the company to which I have already referred advertised in the press that it would buy this small fruit for12/8d. per lb. only until the succeeding 1st January. This was a big blow to the growers, and in their behalf I made representations to the Prime Minister to grant them relief. He advanced £10,000 to a local cooperative company under certain conditions. The result was that the private company suddenly discovered that it could accept all the fruit offered to it at 4d. a lb. The £10,000 advanced was repaid to the Government. The condition of many of these small fruit-growers is wretched in the extreme, and I should not like to be the Minister of the Crown who had it in his power to grant them relief, but failed to do so. </para>

              <para>- Yes, but it is now dealing with larger fruit. What is required is a co-operative jam manufacturing and preserving company specially to handle this fruit. At present Tasmanian small fruit is pulped and exported to England, where surplus Queensland sugar, also exported there, is used to manufacture it into jam. That is an absurd situation. I intend, in the near future, to make strenuous endeavours to bring representatives of the fruit-growers and sugar farmers together to consider ways and means of advancing their mutual interests, for there is no enmity between them. The only conferences held in the past have been between <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Jones and the sugar refining companies. We must inquire outside these monopolistic concerns which, at present, have a stranglehold upon the industry. In the meantime I urge the Government, with all the earnestness at my command, to do something to protect these people from the misery and ruin which is staring them in the face. I trust that an inquiry will be granted along the lines and under the conditions which I have suggested. </para>

              <para>- He represents some of the peanut-growers, and I represent, others. We have both made representations in their interests, but the Government has taken no action. I promised my constituents that I would personally bring this matter under the notice of the Government. The growers are asking for the re-imposition of the embargo, or alternatively, an increase in the existing duties to at least 6d. per lb. all round; but an embargo is preferable and can be justified. In consequence of the encouragement given to the peanut-growers while the embargo was in operation in 1927, they increased the area under cultivation considerably. In 1922-23 only 132 acres were under peanut cultivation in Queensland, and only 61 tons of peanuts were grown. In 1926-27, the figures were 60,500 acres and 3,000 tons. At that time 400 growers were engaged in the industry. Last year approximately 600 peanut-growers were operating on nearly 70,000 acres, and they produced nearly 4,000 tons of peanuts. This was sufficient to supply Australia's requirements. I point out that peanuts arc sold not only over the shop counters, but also to confectioners, nut-food companies, and certain oil manufacturing concerns. Hitherto the settlers on the land have been able to grow wool, wheat and sugar profitably because they held comparatively large holdings; but in these days of more intense cultivation smaller holdings are becoming the rule, and other crops are being grown. Peanuts are a drought-resisting and good rotation crop. Because this crop is conducive to soil fertility, agriculturalists engaged in growing maize and other crops have also commenced growing peanuts, for which the climate of Queensland is eminently suitable. As the result of an agitation in 1926, the Minister agreed to impose an embargo upon the importation of peanuts, chiefly because it was represented to him that there was a danger of introducing to Australia the rosette disease. </para>

              <para>- Most of the imported peanuts come from Java and China. If the rosette disease had been introduced into Australia, there was serious danger that it might attack the tomato and potato crops. A guarantee was given to the late Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pratten)</inline> that if the embargo was imposed, Queensland growers would supply all the peanuts needed for the Australian market. Accordingly, the embargo became effective from January, 1927, but it was lifted again in October of the same year. The imposition of the embargo had the effect of building up the industry to a surprising extent. It was worth practically nothing in 1922, but at the present time its value to Queensland is £100,000 a year, and it is still growing. Indeed, it is of value to other States, also, because the growers in Queensland buy the products of Sydney and Melbourne factories. The  chairman  of the Peanut Board, in a statement which is reported in the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mail</inline> of the 22nd August, 1928, expresses strong resentment that the peanut-growers should be denied that measure of protection which is afforded to other primary producers.

          </quote><para class="block">That is strong language to come from a government supporter. The embargo was lifted in October of 1927, and by June of the following year 700 tons of peanuts had been imported from China and Java. This was equivalent to 500 tons of Australian kernels which should have been sold at the ruling price of £74 a ton. Because of this competition, a large part of the Australian crop had to be disposed of at oil values, resulting in a loss to the Queensland growers of £26,000 for the year 1927-28. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> F.

          </quote><para class="block">Figures have been prepared by the statistician's office showing the quantity of peanuts imported during recent years. In 1924-25, Australia imported 3,263,520 lb. of peanuts, valued at £42,296, including 3,057,684 lb. from China, at a cost of £37,593. In 1925-26, we imported 4.934,211 lb., valued at £67,839, including 4,310,766 lb., at a cost of £58,874, from China. In 1926-27, our total importations were 5,870,334 lb., for which we paid £69,662. Included in the importations for that year were 5,341,335 lb. from China, bought at a cost of £62,631. In 1927, Queensland grew 4.967,428 lb. of peanuts. Australia's yearly requirements are growing and are now estimated to be 6,700,000 lb. If the growers were given effective protection, or if the embargo were reimposed, they would be able to supply the whole of Australia's needs. The embargo could be justified on the grounds that the rosette disease will probably be introduced from the East if importations continue, and will do serious damage to the tomato and potato crops. The demand for peanuts in Australia is increasing. If we consumed the same quantity of peanuts per head as America does, we could use twelve and a half times the quantity we are using now. Because of the importation of peanuts from China and Java, the Peanut Board last year had to sell a big proportion of the crop for making oil, thereby sustaining a loss of £26,000. The value of the nuts for oil is 21/2d. a lb. of kernels f.o.b. Brisbane, as against 8d. a lb. of kernels for other purposes. These low prices have greatly reduced the previous average return to the growers of85d. per lb. for 1926-27. To-day we are buying that commodity from Japan and China, whereas we should produce it in Australia by white labour in sufficient quantity to meet the local demand. The average production of Queensland in the last seven years was 1,141 lb. of peanuts per acre, and the profit amounted to1/2d. a lb., which equals £2 7s. 6d. an acre. That profit is not sufficient. The Australian market is increasing, and wo should not be importing this commodity at all. The present duty on imports is absolutely ineffective. The growers have spent £13,000 of their own money in erecting an up-to-date silo in which to store their products, and the Queensland Government is assisting them with a guarantee of £37,000, making a total expenditure of £50,000 for silos, all of which will really be borne by the growers. There is now on hand with the Peanut Pool Board 1,800 tons of peanuts with a probable carry over to next season of 1,200 tons. They will be ruined unless the Government comes to their assistance, and adequately protects the industry. Inquiries should be made immediately with a view to imposing an embargo on imports. The Tariff Board should be asked to make an immediate investigation with a view to increasing the duty to such a figure that the foreign product will be kept out of Australia. I want action taken by the Government without further delay. </para>

            <para>. - There are several matters of vital importance to my constituency that I desire to bring before the House, because probably six months will elapse before I shall have another opportunity of addressing it. As it is anticipated that the Minister for Home Affairs will shortly be taking a trip to the Northern Territory, I draw his attention to a statement appearing in <inline font-style="italic">Sun Pictorial</inline> headed, "Doctors outspoken about pitiable plight of aborigines." It is a rather scathing indictment of the administration of aboriginal affairs in Central Australia. The article states, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia -</inline> " A man constantly without the company of white women and always in the company of aborigines," says <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Walker,</inline> "gradually loses his finer feelings, and becomes not merely immoral, but unashamedly unmoral." </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There are so few white women in the interior because, among other disabilities, there is, in ordinary circumstances, no doctor for 1.300 miles north and south between Oodnadatta and Port Darwin, and for 1,000 miles east and west between Roebourne and Cloncurry. " Is there anywhere else in the civilized world that can claim this unenviable distinction?" asks <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Walker,</inline> who favours the suggested inauguration of an aerial medical service for Alice Springs. </para>
          <para class="block">We owe a duty to the pioneers in those far-flung parts of Australia to see that they are supplied with medical attention. No wonder settlers hesitate to take their womenfolk into those areas. The health of the community should be the first consideration of the Government, and I hope that the Minister will investigate the matter during his tour. </para>
          <para>I again direct attention to the unemployment problem in North Australia. Truly, the workless there have asked for bread and have been given a stone. Tenders were called recently for the carting of broken metal required in the construction of oil tanks at Darwin, but the work is to be done by prison labour. Consideration should be shown to men who are out of work, particularly when public works are under construction. I protest against the employment of prison labour, much of which is native labour, when white men are available. </para>
          <para>Another subject which calls for a protest is the method in which the Aliens Restrictions Act is being administered. </para>
          <para>I have received the following telegram on the subject : - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Copy telegram sent Minister Customs. Canberra. - Two indentured labourers were imprisoned by master pearler for refusing work in the transport of cargo carrying. These duties were connected pearling only. They appealed against imprisonment. After serving <inline font-style="italic">two</inline> weeks were released on bail. Appeal cannot be heard until Justice Mallan) returns middle April, lt is anticipated these people will be deported six  o'clock  Tuesday morning. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It should be recognized that even indentured labourers have rights, and they desire to appeal against the treatment they have received. Before a judge can return to the Northern Territory, these men will have been deported. That is not justice. They should be given the opportunity to establish their case. I trust that when the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott)</inline> visits the Northern Territory, he will make a detailed investigation, of these questions and not listen to only one side. </para>
          <para>I wish to touch briefly on the question of mineral production. Assistance has been sought to enable operations to he carried on in connexion with a metal called " tantalite," which is worth from £700 to £S00 a ton. It does not come within the classification of precious metals, and therefore that fund cannot be drawn upon for the development of the deposits that are known to exist. An amount of approximately £20 has been made available out of the leper fund and the indigent fund. I understand that tantalite is found in only three countries, of which Australia is one, and North Australia is particularly well-favoured, because the ore contains 90 per cent, of the metal. Surely a metal which is worth £700 a ton can be considered precious ! Recently a gentleman named Litchfield, whose qualifications cannot be questioned, endeavoured to obtain assistance to carry on this enterprise, but failed to do so. </para>
          <para>I hope that the Minister will inquire into this and other matters, so that something may be done for the development of the North. He should issue instructions immediately to prevent the employment of prison labour in a labour market that is already glutted. </para>

            <para>.  -  The honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. Green)</inline> has taken con-siderable exception to the fact that the Government has not provided a larger amount than £25,000 for the assistance of the gold-mining industry. It was the desire of the Government to make the amount much larger, but unfortunately the financial position of the Commonwealth at the present time is opposed to such a course being taken. The other night I stated that the Government had considered the recommendation of the Development and Migration Commission that £250,000 should be provided over a period of years for the assistance of the industry. If the financial resources of the Commonwealth warrant it, the Government will endeavour to supplement in the near future the amount that it has now undertaken to make available. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The honorable member for Franklin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Mcwilliams)</inline> has referred to a private motion of his on the notice paper, for the appointment of a select committee to inquire into the fresh-fruit industry, and <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> hop industry in Tasmania. I regret that the House has not had an opportunity to consider that matter. I cannot accede to his request that he should be given preference over two other honorable members who also have on the notice paper motions for the appointment of select committees : the honorable member for Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Jackson)</inline> relating to Australian aborigines, and that of the honorable member for New England <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thompson)</inline> concerning the tobacco industry. However sympathetic the Government might be towards the objects of those select committees and this of the honorable member for Franklin, it could not agree to the appointment of the three. If there were no other reason, the expense would be a bar. The non-appointment of a select committee, however, does not signify that it is impossible to take action that will assist the fresh-fruit and hop industries. Even on the facts outlined by the honorable member for Franklin, several courses are open. One of the most essential things is to bring the growers together in a co-operative scheme, so that they might obtain advances from the Rural Credits Department of the Commonwealth Bank. I understand that the State Government of Tasmania is about to bring into operation a scheme under which advances will be made against rural products. The Department  of Markets could render the honorable member very great assistance, and I am sorry that he has said he has not the slightest confidence in it. </para>

              <para>- That is not so. The Commission recommends the formation of <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> co-operative company to deal generally with the position of the small fruits industry in Tasmania, and it suggests that it be started in the south. The honorable member also referred to a contract which is common in that State; but whatever views this House or this Government may hold regarding that form of contract, it has no power to alter it. </para>

              <para>- That contract is one between two citizens of the State of Tasmania. It has relation to trade and commerce inside the borders of that State, and the Commonwealth has no power to interfere with it. If it will assist the honorable member at all in his laudable desire to help Tasmania, I am quite prepared to make arrangements for a Minister to visit that State to attend meetings in company with the honorable member. I cannot accept the honorable member's request that a select committee be appointed, if for no other reason than that, that would be giving the honorable member preferential treatment over other members of the House. </para>

          <para>The honorable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> has referred to the peanut industry of Queensland, and he has given the House much information on the subject. At the moment the honorable member could not tell me anything new about peanuts. I am saturated and soaked with information about peanuts, because the honorable member for Wide Bay <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Corser)</inline> has been haunting me for the last two or three or four weeks with respect to that industry. As a result of the discussions which I have had with the honorable member for Wide Bay, and the information that he has given me, I am hopeful that we shall be able to find some solution of the difficulties confronting the peanut industry. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Home Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Abbott)</inline> is not here to reply to the points raised by the honorable member for Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nelson)</inline> ; but I assure the honorable member that I shall bring his representations under the Minister's notice </para>

            <para>- I wish to place on record our appreciation of the services of. one of the members of the parliamentary staff who will retire from the Public Service before we meet again ; I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robert</inline> Mitchell, who, in June, will have completed 49 years and one month of service with the Victorian and Commonwealth Parliaments. He has been in close personal touch with honorable members, and I feel that I am only uttering their opinions when I say that he has proved a most competent and loyal officer. He has always been deeply devoted to his duty, and in our relations with him he has been most courteous and considerate. We shall miss his presence very much indeed. We wish him on his retirement a period of rest and happiness. Not only is he deeply attached to Parliament, but he has a high appreciation of its dignity and value. He has done all in his power to make the services of Parliament efficient. </para>
