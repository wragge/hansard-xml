            <para>- I direct my question to the Prime Minister and refer to the sudden emergence, after 20 years of silence, of the Liberal Party's policy on the rural economy and, as this is an official statement, I assume that it has the full backing of the Prime Minister. 1 ask: ls the Prime Minister aware that the federal rural policy in essence condemns the failure of this Government to assume a positive role of leadership in primary industry? ls he aware that this policy is in open conflict with important Government decisions, such as irrigation development, and that it is diametrically opposed to the whole backbone of Country Party policies on subsidies? Finally, does not this document on Liberal Party policy on primary industry provide the stark truth that rural industries in Australia are in a shocking mess due to inept Government leadership and policy? </para>

            <para>- Answering the last question first: This document does not reveal any open conflict between the parties forming the coalition, and indeed, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> it would be extraordinary if it did because no such open or overt or covert conflict exists. Answering another point that the honourable member made on the question of subsidies, I draw his attention to the fact that both I as Prime Minister and the  Deputy  Leader of the Australian Country Party have publicly pointed out that subsidies, particularly in the case of wool, are merely palliatives and no long term cure for the industry. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I would also indicate that the document itself is prepared by a sub-committee of the Liberal Party reporting to the executive of that organisation, but I think it repays study: but that unlike the honourable member who asked the question we on this side of the House are not directed by such outside bodies as he would be in his case. </para>

            <para>- Students in Australia at secondary schools, whether they be technical or other secondary schools, would primarily be there, as the honourable member suggests, to learn the subjects in the curriculum. They would also, I believe, quite properly be required to spend their time studying political questions which were of moment to the people of this country. But what is essential, of course, in such study is that when a matter is of political moment arguments on both points of view should be impartially placed before the students in such a school and impartially advocated and the student should, as in any other branch of learning, have that right given to him. I think what is disturbing in the matter that has been raised by the honourable member is that there is a stream of partisan literature, of inaccurate literature, in some cases I believe of literature designed against the best interests of Australia, which is poured in by the people to whom the honourable member referred without any attempt whatever to place a question impartially before students, which is what should be done. </para>

What is the total number of migrants resident in Australia who are eligible for naturalisation but who as yet have not applied for naturalisation? Why do eligible migrants not apply for citizenship? What steps are being taken to encourage aliens to seek Australian citizenship? Finally, what disabilities does an alien face in Australia and what benefits does naturalisation confer? </para>

            <para>- I recall that, when I last checked the matter to which the honourable member refers, I ascertained that as at 30th June 1969 there were some 208,000 migrants over the age of 16 years and residentially qualified for Australian citizenship who had not made application. The fact that a number of migrants do not make application for Australian citizenship results, I believe, from a fusion of factors which would include indecision at to long term permanent residence in Australia; the fact that they may be waiting for other members of the family to become eligible before themselves making application; unawareness of the importance of citizenship; or being aware, the fact that they have not come to the point of making application or would prefer to become further established in the Australian community before playing a complete and meaningful part. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As I recollect it, the third part of the honourable member's question related to disabilities incurred by aliens in the community. Aliens cannot vote at elections or stand as candidates for election. They are not eligible to become permanent members of the Commonwealth or a State Public Service. They cannot obtain an Australian passport to travel overseas and they cannot become magistrates or judges, <inline font-style="italic">la</inline> addition there are some disabilities, such as in the case of workers' compensation, relating ro aliens in individual States as a result of State law. It has always been the policy of the Commonwealth Government that migrants should become Australian citizens, not so much for the material benefits which this would confer upon them but rather because citizenship, once conferred, would enable them to play their full part as Australian citizens in the affairs of the community and to have the opportunity of total identification with the people of Australia. </para>

            <para>- I ask the Minister for Primary Industry whether he has received a request for a study to be made of proposals put last year by a Western Australian firm for the production of alcohol from surplus wheat for use as an additive to motor spirit. If the Minister has received this request, in view of the widespread interest in the proposal as a means of reducing the present unmarketable stockpiles of wheat will he report on the progress of this study and the economic viability of the proposition? Finally, will the study have regard to the very high contingent economic waste should these stockpiles of wheat be destroyed due to the depredations of rodents, insect infestation or weather damage and bin scald? </para>

            <para>- I recall seeing an article on this <inline font-style="italic">matter</inline> printed last year and distributed in Western Australia. Later it was referred to me by the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation with the request that my Department investigate the proposition. During the war the Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Ltd was commissioned to build a number of plants to produce power alcohol, or ethyl alcohol, for use as an additive to petrol. Only I such plant was constructed. It operated for a very short time mainly because there was an inadequate supply of material to keep it working. If I correctly recall the reply that I gave to the Federation concerning the findings of my Department  -  i would be happy to let the honourable member have a copy - it was to the effect that whilst it was technically feasible to produce power alcohol from wheat it was not an economic proposition. The technical position is that when it is added to petrol apparently the efficiency of the fuel declines. In addition there is some price factor in it. The real crux of the matter is that any plan to produce power alcohol calls for a capital intensive project and to make it a success there must be a continuity of raw material at a satisfactory price. The price at which one could obtain wheat apparently forbids this being an economic proposition. This has been the finding in the United States of America where this proposition has also been considered. If alcohol is to be made from grain the prices for alternative types of carbohydrates may make them much more attractive than wheat. In view of this sort of information I had to inform the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation that the advice of my Department was that this proposal was not economically or technically feasible. </para>

            <para>- Since before the honourable member for St George came into this place he has quite consistently sought to read a lack of confidence into the post 1971 arrangements being worked out by the 4 powers in the region, together with the United Kingdom. In doing this he has had no regard to fact or opinion in Singapore and Malaysia and, I believe, has had no regard to the general support in Australia for the policies which were originally announced by the Prime Minister on 25th February 1969. In answer to the honourable member's question specifically, a number of the facilities at Butterworth will be jointly used, between the Royal Australian Air Force and the Malaysian Air Force. No, the Malaysian Government has not asked that one of our squadrons be withdrawn and the 2 squadrons will be remaining there. Arrangements are far advanced in detailed examination of the questions raised by the joint usership of the Butterworth facilities and I am quite certain that the discussions will continue and a satisfactory conclusion to the matters involved in these arrangements will be reached. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I would like to give an example of the way in which the honourable member for St George has sought to mislead the House and the Australian people regarding the circumstances surrounding the establishment and stationing of our troops in the Malaysia/ Singapore region! He has said, for example, that our troops are in very inadequate and sub-standard temporary accommodation in Singapore at present. On my recent visit to Vietnam I diverted sufficiently long to examine not only the areas in which our troops are now located but also to see the areas which are likely to be the permanent locaton of our forces. There have been no complaints from the Australian servicemen involved. The facilities they are now in are good and the facilities they are probably going to are excellent. There is no complaint on this score from anyone in the Australian Army. This is just another example of the way the honourable member for St George has quite deliberately sought to use his alleged knowledge of the Malaysia-Singapore region to mislead this Parliament and the Australian people in regard to the arrangements made in that area. </para>

            <para>- Neither the United States nor the South Vietnamese signed the Geneva Agreement of 1954 or the Accords of 1962. Therefore the statements made by the honourable member for St. George are inaccurate. What did happen was that the United States, consistently with the United Nations Charter, declared that it would abide by the provisions of the United Nations Charter. But it went on to say, consistently with the United Nations Charter, that if there was a breach of the peace or a threat of a breach of the peace it would regard this matter as of great concern. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The second point raised was whether the South Vietnamese Government signed the Agreement. It did not sign the Agreement and therefore the honourable gentleman was again wrong. The South Vietnam Government did make a declaration saying that it would do all in its power to ensure that there was peace throughout the whole of Vietnam. It went on to protest against the Agreement that had been made because it said it was contrary to the long term interests and the wishes of the people of South Vietnam who had a right to independence and freedom and did not want aggression within their own territory. The simple fact is that the Agreement and the Accords of 1962 were violated and flagrantly abused by the North Vietnamese Government and the Vietcong. That is where the responsibility lies. The honourable gentleman asked whether Australia aided and abetted the breach of the Agreement. I repeat that the violation of these Agreements came from the North. </para>
          <para>As to the last part of the honourable gentleman's question, which related to the standard of efficiency of the Department, I want it to be known that I do not regard the honourable member for St. George as reflecting either the standard of efficiency or the integrity of the Department that I have the honour to administer. If he wants one other illustration of his lack of capacity for the truth I will mention what happened when he asked for permission to make a personal explanation. He said that he had written that part of the document which related to aid to Indonesia. He had nothing whatever to do with the collection of the facts or the writing of the document. He happened to be in the information and distribution section where he had the responsibility for distributing and editing it, but he had not part whatever to do with the collection of the information or the presentation of the facts. </para>

              <para>-Order! There is no substance in the point of order. I have repeatedly said in this chamber that Ministers may answer questions in a manner they think fit provided that the answer is relevant to the question that is being asked. I might say, as I have said before, that many questions are too long and that, most assuredly, many of the answers are far too long. I would also say that interjections on both sides of the House are becoming far too frequent. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue><para>I suggest to honourable members that they bear in mind the fact that question time provides them with the opportunity to seek information that is very valuable to all private members on both sides of the House. There has been a lot of time wasting in question time, and I suggest to all honourable members that they keep the length of their questions to a minimum and I suggest to the Ministers that they keep their answers as concise as possible. I ask the Ministers to take notice of what I suggested to them at the end of last year and again earlier this year, namely, when a question is long and involved the Minister may ask for leave to make a statement in answer to the question after question time. Some members apparently think that question time is a time when they can ask questions which are irrelevant under the Standing Orders. Up to this stage, with some of the new members, I have been somewhat understanding. I want to say that when we resume in May the Standing Orders relating to* question time will be strictly adhered to. I have taken the opportunity from time to time to speak to some of the new members and tell them how they can put their questions into order. I now suggest that the House come to order and that in future question time be observed as a time for obtaining information based on fact. </para></speech>

            <para>- I have read in the newspapers a report that 2 major wool growing organisations - the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation - have unanimously supported the proposal that there be a single marketing authority for the handling of the Australian wool clip and that this opinion has been supported unanimously by the </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Australian Wool Industry Conference. I have not had any negotiations with or received any direct information from these bodies, but I expect I will do so in the very near future. It is not quite clear what they have in mind as to how this authority might be operated or what might be the functions of the authority. I think it is clearly recognised now throughout the industry that the present auctions system is rather out of date for modern merchandising methods and requirements. What the organisations have in mind is some strengthening of the proposal that was put for the interlocking of one, two and three bales, that there be standards for clip preparation and presentation; that there ought to be some development of other methods of selling wool apart from the auction system; and that there be methods of negotiating sales and contract arrangements under which the user might be assured of continuity of supplies over a period of time at some agreed price. I think this is the sort of proposal they have in mind. </para>
          <para>My Department stands ready to aid the wool industry organisations and the Australian Wool Board in the preparation of proposals that might be practicable, workable and sensible. I think that in the course of supplying this information they will come forward with their recommendations whatever they might be. I would like to take this opportunity to say it is very pleasing indeed, and I am sure a great relief to everybody in the wool industry, that for the first time there is agreement between the wool industry organisations. For too many years the industry has been divided. There has been great acrimony and dissension on the question of the marketing of wool, and now for the first time we see them getting together and putting forward a proposal, and I hope it will be acceptable to the Government. </para>

            <para>- The representations which were made to me, and to which the honourable member for Reid has referred, concerned particularly the difficult position in which some of the terminating building societies find themselves. I have looked at these representations and they will be taken into consideration. The honourable member might also note that in recent months the permanent building societies for quite a period exceeded the provision of funds by the savings banks for the first time, so they have been flourishing considerably. The general overall position is that with rising money rates it is not possible to get the public to subscribe to these or other institutions except by offering a higher rate of interest. </para>

            <para>- In answer to the honourable member's question, which is really twofold, I would say, as to the first part, that frankly I do not know. I therefore do not offer to state any firm position on that. The answer to the second part is that as I understand the position - I hope I will be corrected by anyone who has a different view - the late <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evatt</inline> did resign from this Parliament to take up a position as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. That is the fact and, of course, there was nothing wrong with it. </para>

            <para>- My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Earlier in question time the right honourable gentleman regretted that he was unable to get his Party's view and the Government's view on the Vietnam Moratorium across to the secondary school children of Australia. If his regrets are sincere, why is it that no member of the parliamentary Liberal Party will accept an invitation to discuss the matter in public - in schools or anywhere else? If discussions can be arranged will the Prime Minister ensure that a member of the parliamentary Liberal Party will attend to put 'the point of view of the Prime Minister and his Government? Could he arrange, while doing that, for the honourable member for Diamond Valley to attend and explain why he sends other people to wars to which he will not go himself? </para>

There is opportunity for the Government's case on Vietnam, for the people of Australia's case on Vietnam to be known. There is no need for a member of the Liberal Party to go with a member of the Moratorium Committee, and indeed if that were to happen then those members of the Liberal Party who went would, as they always do, be seeking to present arguments for decision by students. Those members of the Moratorium would be seeking to suppress facts and to bring false facts forward, and in that kind of position no proper debate is possible, </para>

            <para>- by leave - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> one of the major new immigration initiatives to be taken by the Government in the course of this Parliament is in the area of migrant education - an area vital to the effective integration of migrants into the Australian community. The Government has approved details of a comprehensive programme of migrant education which will strengthen existing provisions and give effect to the policy announced by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> on 8th October 1969 of Commonwealth financial support for new, improved and expanded facilities for the instruction of child and adult migrants in the English language. The Government recognises that the ability of migrants to communicate is fundamental to their successful integration. There are short and long term social and human benefits for the migrant and for the community in encouraging and providing the means for migrants to learn English. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>New areas of need have become evident, and whilst there have been practical reasons in the past to concentrate on speaking and understanding the English language, the comprehensive programme now proposed will provide for more emphasis in the future to be placed on reading and writing English, on meeting the individual needs of migrants and on their citizenship education. In recent years there has been increasing public concern over the extent to which migrant children are handicapped by English language difficulty - particularly in school subjects in which verbal communication between pupil and teacher plays a predominant part. The Government has therefore decided on important new initiatives to enable special help to be given to schools in which there are migrant children with English language problems. The comprehensive programme will provide for: The expansion of existing facilities for the instruction of adult migrants; the provision of intensive full time English language courses for those who must know English so that they can be employed in the occupations and professions for which they have been trained and are qualified; and classes for migrant school children with English language difficulties. I wish to inform the House of the details of the programme. </para>

        <para>Provision of educational services to enable adult migrants to learn the English language began in 1947  -  in the opening days of the post war immigration schemes. </para>
        <para class="block">The teaching methods then used have over the years been developed into what is now known as the Australian Situational Method. In using this method teachers employ everyday situations to develop in migrant students .the use of sentence patterns in preference to translation of single words and phrases. The programme commences with language instruction in the source country before embarkation, it is continued on ships carrying non-English speaking migrants during the voyage to Australia and is followed by continuation classes, correspondence lessons and radio and television broadcasts for migrants in the Australian community. </para>
        <para>The Department of Immigration has the responsibility for the development, management and cost of the scheme. The Department of Education and Science is responsible for professional and technical advice to the Department of Immigration, and for the development of special teaching methods and materials and for the guidance of teachers in their use. By agreement between the Commonwealth and State Governments in 1951, the State Education Departments have responsibility for enrolling adult students in continuation classes and correspondence courses, for the appointment of teachers, the provision of classroom facilities, correcting correspondence lessons and supervising the day-to-day operations of these courses. </para>
        <para>Since the inception of the programme in 1947 to 1969, an estimated 708,000 migrants have attended the preembarkation, shipboard, continuation or correspondence courses. Regrettably however only a minority of migrants complete the correspondence and continuation courses. At November 1969, 14,840 migrants were enrolled in 1,053 continuation classes throughout Australia, and 7,780 migrants were taking correspondence courses. In recent years the expenditure on the adult migrant programme has been slightly in excess of Sim annually. </para>
        <para>The Commonwealth has for some time been concerned about the difficulties being encountered by migrant children and adult migrants in learning the English language. Therefore early in 1968 on the initiative of my predecessor, arrangements were made for the Division of Research and Planning of the New South Wales Education Department, in collaboration with the Commonwealth Department of Education and Science and my Department, to undertake an investigation in New South Wales into the efficacy of the existing provisions for teaching English to migrants and migrant children. The New South Wales survey was complemented by surveys undertaken by the Department of Immigration into the language problems of adolescents and migrant women and into factors causing non-attendance of adult migrants at continuation classes. </para>
        <para>The survey reports on adult migrant education indicated a desire among migrants for the provision of more opportunities for developing quickly, conversational skills and for learning more of the Australian way of life. Findings also indicated that adult migrants with inadequate English faced difficulties in finding suitable employment and in establishing and maintaining social relationships with other members of the community. As part of the expansion of the facilities for the instruction of adult migrants, we have initiated a major review of the adult education programme in source countries where pre-embarkation instruction is given, on migrant carrying ships and in the community after the migrant's arrival. </para>
        <para>The Government will extend language instruction to those European source countries where no provision is currently made (in particular to Yugoslavia and the Scandinavian areas) and will increase the number of shipboard education officers. In Australia, special attention will be given to the needs of individual groups of migrants; greater use will be made of advanced teaching techniques; and measures already taken to encourage industry to establish language classes at the work place will be intensified. Facilities for the instruction of migrants in reception centres, in hostels and in the community will be expanded. The estimated additional cost during the full financial year of the above programme will be $420,000, increasing expenditure by the Commonwealth on adult migrant education from the current figure of $1.2m to in excess of $1.6m annually. </para>

          <title>Intensive Courses</title>
          <page.no>1521</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>The first full time intensive course of English language instruction arranged by the Department of Immigration in conjunction with the Department of Education and Science (which involved students in full time intensive study for 8 hours per day, 5 days per week for 8 weeks) was held early in 1969 at the University of New South Wales for a group of professional Czech migrants. The value of the intensive course of language instruction for professional and other well qualified non-English speaking migrants was quickly recognised, and already intensive courses are being conducted on a continuing basis at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology and the Sydney Technical College. During the calendar year 1970, it is expected that 5 courses will be held at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology with 20 students on each course and at Sydney Technical College 3 courses will be arranged with 60 students per course. </para>
        <para>Courses have been held during the last University vacation at the universities of New South Wales, Adelaide and Monash, catering for 145 migrants. Initially enrolment in the intensive courses was confined to migrants who have had professional training and who require a competence in English to enable them to continue their studies or to pursue their profession or occupation. Henceforth enrolment will be open to those who require a good knowledge of English to be suitably employed and who would be able to benefit from intensive instruction. Students attending the intensive courses are provided with postcourse guidance in securing suitable employment or in furthering their studies. Living allowances are paid to migrants undertaking an approved intensive course, to assist them in maintaining themselves and their dependants for the duration of the course. </para>
        <para>The Commonwealth will provide additional centres for intensive English language courses in Sydney and Melbourne, and these facilities will be extended to other capital cities and to provincial areas of high migrant density. It is expected that Commonwealth expenditure on intensive courses will, subject to budgetary considerations, rise from $127,000 in the current financial year to approximately $1.3m in the financial year 1970-71. </para>

          <title>Child Migrant Education</title>
          <page.no>1521</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>The surveys undertaken by the New South Wales Education Department in collaboration with the Commonwealth authorities in 1968-69 disclosed that approximately 32% of migrant children attending New South Wales government and independent schools at the time of the survey were handicapped in varying degrees by some type of English language difficulty. A large proportion of these children came from homes in which English was never or rarely spoken. Difficulties were experienced by children in reading, writing and speaking. Comprehension also proved to be a major persistent difficulty affecting migrant children, especially in those school subjects where verbal communication between pupil and teacher was most important. With the release late in 1969 of the results of the survey, discussions were held between State and Commonwealth officers on the nature of provisions that would give most help tochild migrants at school. Following these discussions the States submitted statements containing their assessments of needs for the education of migrant children. </para>
        <para>Against this background and with a full appreciation of the problems confronting: migrant children and the schools in which they are enrolled the Government has. decided to finance over the next 5 years the following projects in relation to existing Government and independant schools: The salary costs of teachers employed <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> teach migrant children in special classes, and the necessary supervisory staff; special training courses for teachers in the method of teaching English as a foreign language; the provision of approved capital equipment of the language laboratory type for special classes; and the provision of suitable teaching and learning materials. </para>
        <para>So that the programme can proceed as a matter  of  urgency funds will be available  to  finance approved projects at Government and independant schools for the remainder of the current financial year and" subject to budgetary considerations it isexpected that expenditure in the financial year 1970-71 will be  to  the order of $lm. The Commonwealth will be responsible for arranging the special trainingcourses for teachers.  It  will be responsible also for the production and provision  of  suitable teaching and learning materials which will be available not only for teachers and migrants in special classes but also ior migrant children and their teachers in schools where special classes have not been formed. The estimated cost of these two items in the remainder of the financial year and for the financial year 1970-71 is $250,000. The expenditure under these 2 items will be administered directly by the Commonwealth. </para>
        <para>For the two remaining items under the child migrant education programme - salaries of teachers and of supervisory staff and approved capital equipment - funds will be available to finance approved projects at government and independent schools in the States for the remainder of the current financial year. It is expected that for these two items funds to the order of $800,000 will be required for the financial year 1970-71. </para>

          <title>Conclusion</title>
          <page.no>1522</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>In summary, the Government believes that it is a matter of national importance that migrants, both adults and school children, should toe given every opportunity to learn English. Recent experience has shown that language difficulty has resulted in some denial of economic and social opportunity for migrants. The Government intends to reduce, and as far as humanly possible to eliminate, this barrier to the equality of opportunity, so that migrants will fulfil their expectations and share with us the wealth of our land. </para>
        <para>The child migrant programme will initially be for a period of 5 years, when it will be subject to review. The funds avail able during the later years of the 5-year period will be determined in the context of government Budgets at the time, but it is expected that expenditure to the order of $1.5m annually will be incurred. The increase in the facilities for the instruction of adult migrants in intensive courses and the provision of language laboratory type equipment for schools in major centres of population will, with the approval of the State Departments of Education, enable adult migrants to obtain accelerated language instruction on a part time basis - inafterschool hours and in the evenings in schoolrooms and at centres of intensive instruction. Married women with families, workers in industry and others with limited time available for study should all benefit from an increased provision in the Australian community of more sophisticated facilities for language instruction. </para>

        <para>I propose shortly to introduce into the House a Bill to provide legislative authority for the migrant education programme. We are spending some $1.5m on migrant education in the 1969-70 financial year. Consequent upon the development of the programme to which this paper has earlier referred we expect during the financial year 1970-71 to spend, subject to budgetary considerations, funds to the order of $4m. It is expected that funds to the order of $16m will be required over the next 4 financial years. I present the following paper. </para>

            <para>- The Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> has been good enough to outline to the Parliament proposals dealing with migrant education to which he will give legislative effect in the near future. Therefore at this stage I do not propose to speak at great length on the subject. No doubt I and other honourable members will have the opportunity later to discuss this matter which, I believe, is of vital interest. However at this stage I do wish to make a few broad comments about the Minister's statement </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I thank the Minister for this early advice on a subject which we can now investigate more fully before the proposals come before the Parliament. The Government's proposal is a forward step in the fulfilment of our ideals and aspirations in the field of immigration. I believe, as does the Minister, that a more comprehensive programme is very necessary at this stage. The programme he has outlined may have some weaknesses which will be shown up in debate or by trial and error but at this stage it appears to have been well planned, both financially and organisationally, in co-operation with the States and those who will be responsible for putting it into effect. </para>
          <para>I believe that a lack of knowledge of the language of the country sponsoring a great migration programme is the greatest barrier to the integration of migrants and their social and economic success. This is true not only in Australia but in other countries with immigration programmes. I believe that for social, economic and integration purposes there is a real need in Australia to teach the English language at every level. The Minister's statement that the Government will enlarge the child education programme and will extend it to include adults, both before and after entry, is something which all honourable members must welcome. I am pleased also to note that evidently the Minister and the Department of Immigration are taking note of submissions made in this Parliament and at immigration conventions, and by interested organisations, about the need for something to be done in the field of education. I hope that his ambitions in this respect will be fulfilled. </para>
          <para>The Minister has announced that a number of surveys have been made. At this stage I do not know whether the results of those surveys have been made available to the Parliament, but I think all honourable members would be entitled to study them in detail. Undoubtedly they contain some very vital information. I am reminded particularly of the problem associated with the education of the children of migrants. My colleague the honourable member for Reid <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Uren)</inline> in whose electorate the Villawood hostel is situated, has told me that there is a big influx of migrant children to the schools in his area. A tremendous problem faces the children concerned. This influx also presents a grave problem for the teachers. That is why the financial arrangements outlined by the Minister in relation to training courses and other aspects of education should be welcomed by all members of the Parliament. </para>
          <para>I have had first hand experience of the migration education programme to date, having studied what happens overseas and what is done on shipboard. I have also studied programmes in other countries. I think the programme is commendable as far as it goes but there is room for considerable improvement. At the Australian Citizenship Convention in January 1970 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Arvi</inline> Parbo, General Manager of the Western Mining Corporation, dealt with this problem of language. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The first, most obvious, and most severe problem area for many migrants is language. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He said there were other problems. He continued: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Learning to communicate in a new language, difficult as it is, is only one of the problems created by language difficulties. An example of others is the loss of understanding that often develops between migrant families and their children. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Further on he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The children normally become fluent in English within a short time and, although often retaining a proficiency in their native language, soon come to regard English as their 'first' language. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He went on along those lines. I believe that written into this legislation that is to be brought down will be many of the sentiments expressed by that gentleman who speaks from first hand knowledge of the problem. I am reminded also of what was said at that Convention by Miss Olive Nichols, District Inspector of Schools in the Sydney city area for the New South Wales Department of Education. She delivered a paper on this matter in which she said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>These children of foreign origin, proficient in their own tongue and able to communicate in the home situation, have now to adjust themselves to an environment where it becomes necessary to learn a completely new set of speech habits, the sounds, structures and vocabulary of their initial language being of little or no use to them. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is the child's problem. But the teacher has just as big a problem in endeavouring to convey his impressions or his knowledge to the child. Evidently these papers delivered at that Convention, as well as other moves, have had a significant effect in respect of the programme that the Minister has outlined. Whilst we deal with the problems of children and teachers and questions relating to the social and economic integration of migrants, at this stage there appears to be a much more lively interest being taken by the Government and organisations in the education of adult migrants. I refer to a paper that was presented to the Citizenship Convention held this year in Canberra by Professor W. F. Connell, head of the Department of Education at Sydney University. He said that a survey by the Department of Immigration indicated that about one-third of foreign born migrants cannot speak English and that departmental English classes assist only a small proportion of them. He also said. </para>
          <para>It appears that many past arrivals have remained largely ignorant of the English language and that, so far from catching up with this backlog of students, present classes are not catching the numbers of recent arrivals. It appears that the language programme is steadily slipping backwards. </para>
          <para class="block">He went on to say that women and migrants in the age group 30 to 39 years are largely missing from numbers attending English classes. He suggested that more women might be encouraged to attend if there were morning classes and more teachers. </para>
          <para>It is significant that he suggested many of the reforms that are proposed in the legislation outlined by the Minister. They include question of subsidy, part time or full time for some of them, and an intensive programme not only for those with professional qualifications but also for others who have ability and knowledge but are debarred from taking advantage of it by reason of their lack of English. It is inevitable that these proposals cannot be implemented without the expenditure of money. One aspect of the migration programme that appears to come under criticism at this stage is that, whilst thousands of migrants are being brought to the country, the States are not being given a commensurate amount of money to provide education, housing and other factors associated with a great migration programme. This has not been forgotten in the legislation the Minister indicated will be introduced. If this programme is fulfilled in the way that the Minister has outlined today and comes to fruition as he has said, it undoubtedly will be a forward step in providing for the education of migrants and their integration into the community. </para>
          <para>As I mentioned earlier, I do not wish to speak at greater length at this stage. I see the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> come to the table. I hope that he will not want to curtail my oration in the debate that will take place on the legislation as he evidently does now. I hope he will give full opportunity to every member of this Parliament who wants to speak on this programme to do so when a debate takes place because I know of no programme which has greater continuity of support from members on all sides of the Parliament. I believe a full scale debate on this programme, whilst some criticism might be levelled at certain aspects of it, would be very fruitful to the Minister, to the Department and to the country. With the assurance of the Minister for Immigration that he will not curtail the debate when it takes place, within reason, I will content myself with saying that we on this side of the House will welcome the legislation. At this stage I see no reason why it should be opposed - we may be able to improve it - and I join with the Minister in expressing the hope that it will allow the thousands of migrants who today suffer from not having a thorough understanding of the English language to integrate socially and economically and in every way take full advantage of the opportunities given to them in this country under the migration programme. </para>

            <para>- I promise the Leader of the House that my comments will be brief because I know we have a difficult timetable to keep. As the honourable member for Grayndler <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly)</inline> said, we on this side of the House welcome this proposal. Immigration has thrown a great burden on the States and on education in particular. I rise to bring before the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> an immediate problem in regard to the Chester Hill Public School which is adjacent to the Villawood migrant hostel. I have made representations on this subject. A public meeting was held at the school because of the problem that has arisen. The residents of the area want some immediate relief. I hope the Minister, in co-operation with the State Department of Education, can bring some immediate relief to the Chester Hill Public School through these proposals he has placed before the House. There are great numbers of young migrants from the Villawood migrant hostel going to that school. Class loads have risen to over 40 when they should be under 30. We want to bring the best out of these migrant children and I ask the Minister to give the matter his consideration. </para>

            <para>- in recent years your Committee has conducted a series of combined inquiries relating to expenditure from the Advance to the Treasurer and expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund but has reported separately on both aspects of these inquiries. The 115th report relates specifically to evidence taken by your Seventh Committee concerning expenditure from the Advance to the Treasurer in 1968-69. Notwithstanding marked improvements that occurred in the quality of submissions tendered by departments, the inquiry conducted last year revealed instances of inadequate submissions having been made. Attention has been drawn to these where they have arisen. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue><para>The evidence taken relating to telegram and telephone services, particularly in buildings involving multi-occupancy, justifies further the action taken by the Department of the Treasury in 1968 in requesting departments to analyse their telephone accounts with a view to isolating the factors that have contributed to increase allocations for telephone purposes. Your Committee is also concerned by evidence tendered to the effect that the Department of the Interior is unable to assess the dates on which telephone accounts will be received. In this regard we would invite attention to paragraph 114 of our 84th report- We believe that any department confronted with that difficulty should discuss its problems with the Postmaster- General's Department with a view to obtaining accounts on a regular basis acceptable to both departments. The evidence also reflects a need for departments that are required to pay electricity accounts to ascertain from the electricity authorities concerned the cyclical arrangements that are applied in the issuing of electricity accounts to assist them with their reviews of expenditure and the formulation of their estimates. </para><para>Arising from the evidence relating to the acquisition of a site in north Queensland for the Department of National Development, your Committee has expressed the view that where the Department of the Treasury has approved the inclusion of a project in the acquisition programme pending additional estimates, it should obtain from the Department of the Interior a report on the status of the project for consideration when the additional estimates are being framed. We further believe that the principle involved in this case has a wider application. As in previous inquiries of this type the evidence has shown continued misunderstandings that arise in administrative operations. We believe that departments must at all times be vigilant to ensure that human errors of this type and the consequences that arise from them are kept to a minimum. I commend the report to honourable members and move that it be printed. </para><para>Ordered that the report be printed. </para></speech>

            <para>That the Government take note of the plight of rural industries in respect of the cost price squeeze, the dwindling markets in Europe, and the general effect  on  exports and balance of payments with a particular reference to the dairy industry. </para>
          </motion>
          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline>this is a sad day for the Australian rural industries. In 1952 the Government officially announced that the rural industries must be expanded and production targets were arrived at. This followed a big loss in rural production during the war when enlistments from rural industries were very heavy. The rural industries made substantial contributions to the war effort of 1939-45. lt was apparent when this Government came to power at the end of 1949 that something had to be done because the economy depended so tremendously on export income, 90% of which was provided by the rural industries. I do not mean the primary industries only, because I suppose the extractive mining industries could call themselves primary. For the best part of 200 years the rural industries have given Australia its export income and have played a part in the balance of trade. What is the importance of the balance of trade and balance of payments? No country can exist without an export income. No country can develop without it. If there is a deficit in the balance of payments then there will be unemployment in that country. This happened in Great Britain. </para>
          <para>In 1952 Australia needed an expansion in rural industry. Everything possible was done, including the giving of taxation concessions and help with fertilisers, to aid the man on the land to produce the export income which Australia so badly needed. As I said before, 90% of the total export income came from rural industry. Rural industries are important because of their contribution to the consumption sector. Some years ago in America it was proved that the farm sector, or the farm bloc, was the principal consuming bloc and gave employment to a tremendous number of American businesses and industries. In this country when we look at the rural sector we tend to forget that the agricultural servicing industries are providing a tremendous amount of employment and wealth in the provision of tractors, cars, petrol, fertiliser and all kinds of services affecting rural industry. Although they may comprise only 10% of the total population, there are people who live in country towns or who work in the big factories in the cities, as well as seamen and waterside workers who are concerned with handling rural products, who depend upon the rural industries. </para>
          <para>Today rural exports have fallen from 90% to 51% of the total. The value of rural exports rose from $927m in 1949 to just on $2,000m in 1966-67. I repeat that that was a most important contribution to Australia's welfare. I repeat again and again that if we fall behind in our balance of trade and balance of payments, which we have done to the extent of 16,000m in the last 10 years, then we will be due for a terrible depression and gross unemployment. 1 am glad that the Minister for Trade and Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McEwen)</inline> and the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> are in the chamber to hear that. What has saved us in the last 10 years in regard to our balance of payments has been capital inflow of more than $6,000m because of opportunities in spheres other than the rural sphere. The character of the people in the rural industries is important. They are men of tremendous courage, men of great strength, who live with their first class wives in very tough conditions. General de Gaulle said that the farmers of France had in their keeping the character of France, the honour of France the defence of France and the glory of France. Unfortunately, due to technological changes, the farmers in the Common Market countries are now going to be depleted just as it seems that farmers in Australia are going to be depleted. </para>
          <para>Let us look at the cost price squeeze. People in the wool industry tell me that the cost of shearing has risen in the last 10 years from 4% of the clip to 15%. The cost of shearing is $100m a year. This cost is doubling every 10 years. With the present trend in 20 years from today shearing will cost $400m, which will be 60% of the present value of the clip. That cost is added to by freights. Some people say that the wool industry subsidises the railways. They pay $4 a bale in freight. I am informed that the cost of freight on wool exported to Europe is about $100 a ton. This position ought to be looked at. The cost of handling wool is being looked at, but how can the industry or half of it survive if it is presented with higher costs and, in many cases today, lower returns? That is an example of the cost price squeeze. </para>
          <para>In the dairy industry many factories are looking at the day when they will close. The recent wages flow-on cost I little factory $12,000. A previous decision on wages cost them $30,000. Rail freights have increased to $15 a ton for about 200 miles. Costs have become impossible. The only way the factory can keep going is to pay less to the farmer. That cannot happen, because the farmer has already borne too great a blow with the lower prices. The worst blow that the rural industries have suffered has been the effect of the Common Market policy. The House knows that it took the Common Market many years to decide on a common agricultural price policy. When it did, as far as I can find out, the brilliant agricultural economists put up proposals but the council of ministers could not afford to lower the price in any country. So eventually prices in the Common Market countries all rose to the level of the highest priced country, which was probably Germany. In order to hold these prices up the Common Market people, while lauding the idea of breaking down customs barriers inside the six, have put on import levies. </para>
          <para>We are told that the Australian beef exports to Italy attract an import levy of 110%. In other words, beef is twice the price in Italy as it would be under free trade. The cost of butter exported to Germany and those countries that used to buy Australian butter and cheese, carries an import levy of 58.17c a pound. Because of the excessively high prices in the Common Market countries and because of the technological advances there has been tremendous production. We now know that there are literally mountains of butter and other products inside the Common Market countries. Whether Britain joins the Common Market or not - I hope that the wool people will remember this - the effect of surpluses is to deaden demand. When there is a huge surplus the buyer says: 'lt is there. I am not in a hurry to get it, because I can pick it up when I want it'. This slows down demand. In ' addition, surpluses have affected world markets. We understand that the people in the Common Market are now dumping rural products such as flour in the Pacific countries. That is traditionally Australia's market. The French, I understand, have closed Tahiti and Noumea. They are selling flour at $18 a ton over our price. Where they are competing with us, for instance in Fiji and other places, they sell flour at $18 a ton under our price. I understand that very high quality European butter is coming into Singapore, Hong Kong and those markets at about 10c to 13c a pound. </para>
          <para>What has been our traditional marketing for over 100 years has been dealt a very serious blow. This is not the fault of the Australian farmer. This is a result of the technological revolution which has hit agricultural production in the highly developed countries. Of course, the Common Market countries will not escape this. Twenty million farmers a few years ago have been reduced to 15 million and soon there will be 5 million farmers left in the Common Market countries. This is what has happened to De Gaulle's concept of the character of France and the glory of France. The farmers must be assisted to have larger holdings and to increase production. But surpluses are enormous, the markets there are shrinking and room is available for only 5 million farmers whereas there are in fact 20 million farmers. </para>
          <para>So, what is the position of the producer in the world? In the highly developed parts of the world his numbers will go down. This change will alter the sociological situation in any nation. 1 think the House will agree that the people who till the soil and who belong to the rural sector of the community are much more patriotic than are intellectuals who can sell their brains and take their brains with them to some other country. The man who lives close to the soil is much more patriotic and more devoted to his country than other people are. I hope that I am not doing anybody an injury by saying that. But I strongly believe that the people who come from and work with the soil are the ones who have the character of the nation in their keeping. I think that this is true in Australia. </para>
          <para>One of the matters to which I wish to draw the attention of the Government is the tremendous expansion in the rural indebtedness. In 1939 rural indebtedness was about $570m. It rose to $ 1,000m in 1962. The latest figures available to me show that in 1969 the indebtedness was just short of $2,000m. This is a problem to be faced by farmers in addition to the other costs including the increases in shearing costs and wages that I have mentioned. I am not criticising that element. What I am saying is that these are the problems which the rural producer meets. He cannot pass these costs onto his customers because his customers are getting less and less and are paying less and less. </para>
          <para>So, the rural producer must shoulder the whole of the increased costs and he must service this $2,000m of rural debt. He must pay interest on it. He must repay what is owing in respect of drought relief. 1 think that the Commonwealth provided the best part of SI 00m in the last few years by way of drought relief and the State Governments are demanding repayment quickly at 3%. This means that the rural producer carries an enormous debt load. All his costs are rising. If the trend in wool costs continues, more than half of the value of the wool clip will go in paying shearing costs. Added to those costs must be the cost of handling and freight. I speak not only of freight to Europe but also of freight from country centres to the city. Increases in the cost of moving wool and the cost of the sale of the product continue. When costs of one sort and another have been met. the rural producer is left with very little return. </para>
          <para>The next point that I wish to make concerns the dairy industry. It was my wish to move this motion some months ago. In the period between giving notice of the motion and making my speech on it, the Minister for Primary Industry has pointed out that the dairy industry is anticipating a production of 220,000 tons of butter and about 70.000 tons of cheese. Australia consumes about one half of this production. I recall a scheme which was known as the Paterson scheme. </para>

              <para>- No. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Paterson</inline> was a former member for Gippsland. Before the war. he worked out a very neat little sum. At that time we exported I lb of butter for every 4 lb produced. In other words, we consumed 3 lb and exported I lb. The price of butter in Australia was ls 4d per lb. Butter cost ls per lb in London. So, this clever <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Paterson</inline> took Id from the price of each 1 !t&gt; consumed in Australia - in other words, he took 3d from each 3 lb consumed in Australia - and added that 3d to the London price of ls per lb. which made the London price per I lb. Is 3d. It was a nice arrangement. At this moment, wc are not exporting 1 lb for every 3 lb of butter consumed here. We are exporting 4 lb for every 3 lb consumed here. This has thrown the whole financial arrangement with regard to butter out of balance. Aggravating this complicated situation in the butter market, the price in London is gradually fall'ing. It now stands at 295s per cwt. For quite a while it was 300s per cwt. It has dropped by 5s a cwt. This decline is attributable to the effect of the European Common Market surpluses as well as the effects of not being able to sell a good deal of butter and the cost price squeeze on the dairy industry. </para>

          <para>As the honourable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Robinson),</inline> the honourable member for Lyne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lucock)</inline> and I well know, the anticipated closure of some dairy factories will lead to a very difficult situation in country districts. Of course, a parochial problem arises. If a dairy factory closes in a decent sized country town. 20 men lose their employment. If 20 men lose their employment, some of the shops, motor traders and other employers each might put a chap off. So, a town starts to go down hill when it loses its dairy factory. This is the kind of situation that must be faced. </para>
          <para>I turn now to another matter related to the cost price squeeze. I have been trying to find out what is the cost to primary industries in Australia of tariff protection. This is a very difficult thing to establish. I understand that a Professor Gruen, of Monash University, is to carry out research involving a systematic analysis of alternative protective policies. This research will be done by Professor Gruen with the full time assistance of one research fellow and 3 research assistants. The study is to be financed by a grant of §27,384 from the Australian Research Grants Committee. When so much power and expense must be devoted to research into the subject of tariff protection, it is pretty difficult for 1 or 2 members of Parliament or for a committee concerned with primary industry to find out the facts in that connection. For many years, a number of committees including CEDA - the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia - has been trying to ascertain the effect of tariff protection or price supports. For instance, if I buy a weedicide called 245D, the position is this: As the result of the tariff on chemicals a few years ago I would pay $4,000 a ton in price support. Difficulties arise in getting this weedicide from other countries or in producing it here. A couple of drums would be purchased for a medium sized property. In buying that weedicide, I would pay per ton a total of $4,000 in price support. If all the tariffs applying to the rural sector were added up they would come to a very large sum indeed. I cite this fact because of the many attacks being made on price supports for farmers. I think that the total value of price supports for farmers would be less than $200m. I say the cost to the farmer of the various charges which are imposed on him would be in the realm of thousands of millions of dollars. </para>

          <para>I do not know how the honourable member for McMillan finds out that we are not paying very large tariff imports on the things we use in primary production. In some export industries there is a complete by-law protection of an import if it is immediately re-exported. This does not apply to the rural industries. If we import something and use it in production we do not get any by-law protection for that. If you make a Holden car and export it and you buy a part for it from overseas that part is imported completely free because it is to be re-exported. The Minister for Trade and Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McEwen)</inline> might look at this one. Our committees are trying to examine the effect of Government policies, what the State governments do, and what local government authorities do with rates on the survival of the rural industries. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Trade and Industry has made a desperate effort - I use the word 'desperate' because I think it is the right word - to see that our balance of payments is in surplus. It has been in surplus but not because of exports and imports. It has only been in surplus because we have had an enormous increase in capital inflow during the past 10 years. Our balance of payments, excluding capital inflow, was in deficit by $6,170m in the last year for which figures are available, 1969. Total exports were $14m above imports, but all the invisibles got us into trouble. Transportation came to a debit of $679m. A part of this, of course, was for transportation of wool. Income from transportation was about $390m. </para>
          <para>There are a lot of items in Australia's balance of payments which probably in the long run affect the primary producer and which the Government ought to be looking at. There are some things which should be in the Government's purview which are much more important than whether we mess about with the 3-mile territorial limit or that kind of thing. The Commonwealth Government has duties to carry out, and some minor things are being done that ought not take up the time of the Government and the time of the House. </para>

              <para>- They relate to the last decade. We were $6,000m down in our balance of payments. Trade is different. The balance of payments includes everything. In trade - that is exports over imports - we were $14m to the good. We were saved by over $6,000m coming in for investment in Australia. This is because we came good with our minerals. Who started the development of our minerals? The farmers started this because they have always wanted to increase production and income for Australia. The graziers in the north west were promoting the iron province. </para>

          <para class="block">The Food and Agriculture Committee went to the Ord River and almost fell over the iron ore, but it took 3 years for our mining committee to get the export embargo on that mineral lifted. It is the rural people, the people in the outback, who have helped the mineral production, which will bring fantastic amounts because mineral markets and prices are increasing. </para>
          <para>Because we have a good income from minerals, that does not mean that we should turn dog on the people who for 200 years have been supporting Australia and giving it its export income. This is what has happened in this country. The Press are as much to blame as anybody. We see headlines such as 'Can We Afford the Farmer?' This is a very nice situation to happen after the farmers have nourished Australia for all these years. They had a drop in production during the Second World War. Now the brilliant and clever chaps of the Press, who I can see looking at me, have turned around and have started to attack everything we try to do to increase production or to get more income for Australia. </para>
          <para>Obviously a tremendous amount of attention has to be paid to the handling of the product, but the most important job is the presentation and marketing. It is not good enough to stick butter or cheese in a container and send it away. It has to be something that the buyer wants. Too long we have had this attitude of making 100 tons of butter, sticking it on a ship and saying: 'We will get the money back'. Those days have passed. We must pay attention to marketing. 1 am very grateful to the Minister for Trade and Industry and the Minister for Primary Industry for being here. The marketing of this stuff is the important thing. We should give attention to the preparation of the wool clip and to finding the correct way to handle dairy produce and where to sell wheat. Meat, of course, has been the bonanza. I defy those people who say that there will be over-production of beef. I do not believe it. I moved that the Government take note of the plight of the rural industries, and I thank the House for bearing with me for 29 minutes. </para>

              <para>- I have been misrepresented. I feel that I must put on record the truth about my attitude to the dairy industry 6 or 7 years ago when I was on the back bench. At that time I felt that it was no kindness to the dairy industry to encourage it to increase production and I said that in the interests of the dairy farmers at that stage we should help the dairy farmers get onto other forms of production and get out of dairying. This is now virtually the policy of the Government. </para>

              <para>- Yes. I thank the honourable member. It has been very forward thinking. For many years now many of us have been advocating that it is no good going on with production that cannot be sold. The dairying industry committee of inquiry in 1961 brought this out. There is a lot of evidence of this. Today the honourable member for Macarthur <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jeff Bate)</inline> has brought forward a motion and ample time should have been given for it to be debated by this House, but because of the peculiar circumstances in which we are placed today there just is not time to do justice to any section of it or even to make a broad statement of the fact that the Government is very conscious of what is going on and what is being done. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I want to try to condense into about 3 minutes a few thoughts on the change that has come over the industry itself, not over the Government. The Government has been very conscious of the plight of the rural industries for a very long time. The Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> is doing a very courageous job at the moment in bringing home to the various industries that it is up to them now to make some of the changes that they were told a long time ago would have to be made. They are now taking notice of this and there is a very b:g improvement in the unity between organisations. I hope that in the next couple of months we will see the amalgamation of the various organisations that are concerned with so many primary industries. I am particularly interested to see that the Australian Farmers Federation at long last has come to realise that the rank and file - that is, the farmers who are out on the job - who are feeling the cost-price squeeze, are all in favour of the type of action that the Government is proposing at the present time. </para>
          <para>Under the peculiar circumstances that we have here today, I am not able to go on and elaborate on this point. There is only one other comment I would like to make in relation to the effect that these proposals have had, and that is that we have this week had confirmation from the wool industry that it is at very long last beginning to realise that it has to do something positive. As a result of this, there was a significant rise in the price trends at the wool auctions yesterday. I am quite certain that this cost-price squeeze has two ends. The honourable member for Macarthur mentioned these in his remarks. It is true that costs are rising. I would like to have time to bring into true perspective the influences of tariffs. If we look at the total tariff collections we see that they do not run into the amount that the honourable member for Macarthur mentioned. So tariffs do not all operate against rural industries. If the debate is widened to include supports of all kinds, we will get into another field of discussion altogether. </para>
          <para>It is not only costs that we have to worry about; we also have to worry about prices. If the workers of Australia continue to demand more and more money, not only prices to farmers will be increased but prices generally will increase. I understand that the price of cigarettes will be increased this week. If the price of beer is increased people are prepared to pay the higher price. However, when the price of butter is increased nobody is prepared to pay it. In deference to the timetable, I will conclude. However, an honourable member has now asked by way of interjection whether I recommend an increase in prices. Of course there should be an increase in prices. I could speak for quite a long time yet, but I know the Minister wants to take part in the debate, so I will curtail my time. </para>

            <para>- I will be brief because 1 understand that arrangements have been made to allow honourable members on both sides of the Parliament to take part in welcoming the Queen on her arrival at the airport. As far as the spirit of the debate is concerned, I think it is essential that some points ought to be put forward from this side of the House. We have listened to two honourable members from the Liberal Party speak on a problem which is of importance to primary industry. I remind both honourable members that they are also members of a Government which has been in power for over 20 years. It seems to be the common practice of many honourable members on the Government side to criticise Government policies implicitly, and often explicitly, outside of the Parliament and then they do nothing in the Parliament to show their disapproval when it comes to a vote. This practice is becoming more and more evident as more primary industries experience trouble. It is also becoming more obvious that something critical has to be done. If the honourable member for Macarthur <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jeff Bate)</inline> feels so strongly about some of the problems that he has mentioned, I would suggest that he take more constructive action and show what he feels in the House when votes are taken. </para>

            <para>The Australian Country Party will adopt a 'get tough' attitude in an attempt to get governmental approval for policies designed to ameliorate the  plight of primary producers.

              <para>- lt was a statementstatement' being in inverted commas. The important point about it is this: What will the Government do about it? Where is the evidence of this tough attitude that the Country Party is supposed to adopt? There has been no evidence of it so far. All we. hear is the honourable members on the Government side complaining about the plight of primary industries. Why do those honourable members not do something about it? In a manifesto supplied to all rural industries, the Liberal Party has said that it will take positive action to show leadership. The lack of action by the Liberal and Country Parties is a direct condemnation of their leadership. This statement about showing positive leadership is in black and white if anybody wants to read it. Why does the Government not fulfil its role and show some positive leadership, if that is the policy of the Liberal Party? This is the first Liberal Party policy on primary industries that I have seen. As I said in a question 1 asked, it is a condemnation of policy in regard to irrigation. But the policies have been decided by Cabinet and voted upon by the people who are now condemning the Government. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>I would like to make a couple of comments regarding the cost-price squeeze which was mentioned by the honourable member for Macarthur. We on this side of the House recognise the importance, and the seriousness of the cost-price squeeze to the major primary industries, particularly the wool industry. What action does the Government intend to lake in this regard? All of the evidence shows quite clearly that the woo) industry is fully entitled to fi nan,cial assistance in one way or another, lt is entitled to it on the ground of equity. The honourable member for Macarthur mentioned the cost of tariffs. However, nobody has accurate figures. The only professional attempt to evaluate the cost of tariffs in relation to primary industries in Australia was clone by the Vernon Committee. </para>
          <para>The Vernon Comittee showed quite clearly on the best estimates it could make that the total amount of subsidies paid to primary industries was a mere drop in the ocean compared to the value of the tariff protection given to major secondary industries. lt showed clearly in the estimates it made that the total value of the effective tariffs for the motor vehicle industry and the capital goods construction industries of Australia is about double the total value of subsidies paid to primary industries of Australia. We could take into account the benefits to primary industry from the embargo on sugar, for example and admittedly the industry received a major benefit. All the evidence shows that the wool industry is entitled to financial assistance. It does not matter whether it is called a compensation scheme, a cost compensation scheme, a tariff compensation scheme, or a compensation scheme for growth and inflation, the point that stands out is that the wool industry is entitled to financial assistance. </para>
          <para>One argument put forward is that minerals will be the biggest earner of export income for Australia. This is right, but let it be made very clear, as the honouarble member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean)</inline> said recently, that we should nol talk in gross figures all the time. Over 90% of . the wool produced in Australia is exported andpractically every dollar earned is net income to the nation. What is the figure when one takes into account the value of dividends or the actual outgoings of gross income earned from minerals? This is the real figure, lt shows one thing, namely, the great" value of primary industry to our export income which aids the growth of Australia. To put it starkly, if anything further happens in respect of prices or loss of production in the wool industry, the balance of payments position will be precarious. </para>
          <para>The more quickly the Government realises 2 facts about wool the better it will be. First, there is a demand for wool which is in quite a different category from wheat or foods. The elasticity coefficients of all the studies show that there is a demand for wool. However the problem is related to prices. Are we gelling the true price for our wool? Are prices being affected by buying pies or cartels, for example, from Japan? This is the question that has to be ironed out. Nobody in this Parliament can prove that the Australian wool industry is not entitled to financial assistance. If it is good enough to give indirectly, tremendous benefits to the motor car industry, the capital goods industry and practically every other construction industry in Australia, it is important - </para>

              <para>-  Then why does the Government not do something about it? It has been in office for  20  years but what has the Government done about the wool industry except talk? lt is important that this point be noted. The honourable member for Macarthur spoke about the dairy industry. He did not make any concrete proposals or suggest that producers should get out or remain in the industry. The Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> claims that he advised dairy producers  5  years ago to get out of dairy production. He said he did this; apparently he did. By way of interjection the Minister for Trade and Industry, who is the Deputy Prime Minister, said that he advised dairy producers in  1952  to get out of dairy production. I am not too certain about the force of those points of view but what does concern me, and must concern everybody else, is that dairy production is increasing and an increasing proportion of dairy products must be sold on the export market. That is a most unsatisfactory market, and it will get worse and not better. This will reduce, through equalisation, the average price to Australian dairy producers. What is the proprietary of dairy producers continuing to increase production? Surely the Government has to grasp this nettle firmly. There will bc a calamity before long because, as I said before, unlike wool we just cannot sell dairy produce. We can sell wool and if we doubled our production of wool we could still sell every bale, certainly at a price, in competition with synthetics. </para>

          <para>In conclusion I point out  I  matter related to the cost-price squeeze. In the last  15  years the prices paid for farm materials and labour have increased by over  40%.  At the same time the average price received by the rural sector has declined. Beef prices have risen, but the average for the rural sector has declined. The primary industries have responded magnificently in terms of production in that period. Production has increased by  50%.  But when we take the gross national product of the primary industries and relate that to real prices and take into account costs, we find that the average rate of growth in the primary industries is less than  1%  per annum. Let us compare that with the industries which are heavily protected by tariffs. The average rate of increase in those industries has been about  40%  over  5  years, or  8%  per annum. These are the figures that show the dangerous imbalance between primary industry and secondary industry and. the need for positive action to stimulate primary producers, particularly those in the wool industry, into further increased production so that we can earn greater export income. </para>

            <para>[12.51 - 1  thank the honourable member for Dawson <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Patterson)</inline> and the honourable member for McMillan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Buchanan for providing me with the opportunity to say a few words in this debate, particularly in relation to the dairying industry. Wc all are conscious of the very serious and worrying situation that many of our rural industries find themselves in. particularly the dairying industry. So I should like to give some facts and figures in support of what 1</inline> said in the House a week or so ago about the increased production of- dairy produce in Australia and the problem that that poses for our dairying industry.  1  hope that  1  will not transgress the understanding that has- been reached that this -sitting will not proceed past  12.15  p.m. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>During the II -year period  1959-60  to  1969-70  there has been considerable variation in butter production in Australia, ranging from  170,000  tons in  1960-61  lo the record high of  220,000  tons in  1969-70.  The previous peak was  218,000  tons in  1966-67.  For the  5  years prior to  1966-67  production had been - constant at around  200,000  tons, so that the  1966-67  figure seemed to be exceptional as good seasons were . experienced in all States. Then followed  2  years in which drought in certain States reduced production to  193,000  tons and 196,000 tons respectively. The significant factor is that over the period Victoria has been continually improving its relative position. This year production will amount to 140,000 tons in that State- 64% of the total - compared with 89,000 tons or 46% in 1959-60. New dairy farms are being developed and the number of dairy cattle per farm is increasing, which would point to further, production increases. Queensland production in 1969-70 is some 5,000 to 6,000 tons below the level that might normally be expected, so that some increase in production must be anticipated in 1970-71. Given the situation in Victoria, a production figure of at least 230,000 tons must be reckoned on for the forthcoming season unless some form of production disincentive is put into effect. This figure is supported by officials of the Commonwealth Dairy Produce Equalisation Committee Ltd. </para>
          <para>For some years the per capita consumption of butter in Australia has been declining, but because of the population increase the total consumption figure has held fairly constant at around 115,000 tons. One factor is that an increasing proportion of this amount has been sold for manufacturing purposes. However, increased competition from substitutes is having its effect and this year the Australian figure could fall to 113,000 tons. Australia has always had to depend on export outlets for a high proportion of total butter production - usually about 40% when production has been around the 200,000 ton level. Because of the difference between the domestic price, which is 47.3c per lb, and the average export price, which is 20.5c per lb, the proportion exported has a marked effect on the equalised return to the producer. This is illustrated by the following estimates which are based on current prices and include bounty payments. With production at 200,000 tons the estimated return to the producer would be 33.6c per lb commercial butter basis. For each additional 10,000 tons exported his return would be reduced by 1.2c per lb. On 230,000 tons his estimated return would be 30c per lb commercial butter. This figure would naturally be even worse if the export of that total amount could not be expected. </para>
          <para>In view of the present world market situation for dairy products the industry is pursuing a senseless policy in increasing production as it can only lead to further sales at unecomonic prices and consequential reductions in producers' returns. This is bad enough in itself, but the situation has now been reached where markets are not available to dispose of the whole of the production. Already the industry is faced this season with a 5,000-ton surplus carryover and on the basis of the current market situation the indications are that there could be a further build-up in stocks of some 15,000 tons during 1970-71 . This could leave the industry with a surplus figure of 20,000 tons by the end of June 1971, which would be an intolerable situation. </para>
          <para>The world market situation is overshadowed by the European Economic Community with its huge butter surpluses which now amount to 300,000 tons and which are being sold at subsidised prices on the markets of traditional suppliers. In addition, production in other competing countries, such as New Zealand and Ireland, is on the upswing. In the main world market, the United Kingdom, the position of supplying countries is governed by the level of the import quotas. They have been maintained at a level to hold prices down and, with United Kingdom production increasing and total consumption more or less static, there is little scope for worthwhile increases in individual country quotas. In the United States market all the action in recent years has been designed to further restrict imports, even though there has been quite a substantial decline in dairy production. The domestic industry has a powerful lobby which is acutely sensitive to imports and it has been very successful in securing higher domestic .price supports over the last 4 years and a tightening of the restrictions on imports. Apart from domestic political considerations, the huge surplus of dairy, products in Europe is a substantial factor inhibiting any relaxation in the United States import restrictions and in securing a constructive approach to the world wide trade situation for dairy produce. </para>
          <para>Outside the 2 main areas mentioned above there are numerous but small markets which, on present indications, do not seem to present any substantial opportunity for expansion in the short term. Most of these markets are in developing countries, and dietary habits and lack of purchasing power are significant factors affecting demand. </para>
          <para class="block">Moreover, butter sales are under constant pressure from subsidised butter oilfrom the EEC, which is being used for reconstitution purposes. This is a developing trend which is undermining butter prices in these markets. The other main outlet is for the sale of butter oil to milk reconstitution plants and the price for this product is governed mainly by competing products. Here again the market is under heavy pressure from EEC supplies and the returns are not relative to those received for butter. Given the present circumstances, it is difficult to see any improvement in the demand and price for butter in the world market. In effect there is a world overproduction of butter and Australia is contributing to it. </para>
          <para>Since devaluation there has been a deterioration in the world market situation. Whereas initially 79% of Australian butter exports received maximum compensation, the figure has now reached 95%. This, coupled with increased population, has lifted the devaluation compensation for butter from $4.6m in 1967-68 to $8.3m in 1968-69 and an estimated $ll.6m in 1969-70. In J 969-70 it will represent about 2.32c per lb commercial butter to the producer and, coupled with the last increase in the local price, should be sufficient to ensure that the Government's underwriting commitment of 34c does not involve any financial commitment. With production at 230,000 tons however, devaluation compensation in 1970-71 would amount to an estimated $ 1 2.7m, but this would fall short of the $20.5m which would be required to maintain the 34c underwriting. Thus,$7.8m would be required in addition to devaluation compensation. </para>
          <para>In the circumstances, all the indications are that a production figure of 230,000 tons in 1970-71 will have 3 serious consequences: (1) it willlead to a further reduction in producer returns because of the higher proportion of output which has to be sold on the export market; (2) it could involve the Government in a financial commitment, an additional commitment over the bounty of $20.5m to maintain the level of underwriting at 34c; and (3) it could add a further 15,000 tons to the estimated carryover this year of 5,000 tons, and lead the industry into a serious surplus problem. Clearly the position has now been reached, as with wheat, where production restraints are required. It is just not logical or realistic to allow the position to drift further. To do otherwise would lead to the industry being placed in an impossible situation. </para>
          <para>This conclusion does not even take account of the problems that will be posed by Britain's entry into the European Economic Community, which could require the industry to take very drastic measures to meet the situation within quite a short period. From the Government's point of view a case for 34c underwriting is difficult to sustain in the circumstances unless the industry leaders, as in the case of wheat, are prepared to face up to the situation and come up with some logical proposals in the long-term interests of the industry to curtail production to known market levels. In order to assist industry in its thinking on this question. I am willing to make officers of my Department available, and should they bring forward recommendations that would involve the State governments, 1 am happy to act as convenor and coordinator to help resolve this question. </para>

          <para>- The reply to the honourable member's question is as follows: " (1) In four States, South Australia, Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, children are required to attend school between the ages of 6 and 15 years. In Western Australia, the relevant legislation requires the student to attend from the age of 6 to the end of the year in which he reaches 15. In Tasmania students must attend between 6 and 16 years of age. The ages between which children in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory must attend school are 6 to 15 years. Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory Ordinances follow the States of New South Wales and South Australia respectively on the required age for attendance at school. Reasons for exemption from attendance between the prescribed ages vary slightly from State to State. Commonly the following reasons are accepted at the appropriate Minister's discretion. </para>

However, the following figures from a recent survey conducted in N.S.W. and the A.C.T. may be of value. This survey concerned school children of migrant origin, not including those from English-speaking countries or Asians. Figures given in this survey indicated that in August 1968 just over 5% of all children enrolled in N.S.W. schools were of migrant origin. The corresponding figure for the A.C.T. was a little under 7%. Figures for government and non-government schools were not available for N.S.W. and the A.C.T. separately. However, for the 2 areas combined, the percentage of migrants in government schools was approximately 5, while in non-government schools it was approximately 6.

            <para>The competition for Commonwealth University scholarships depends upon the number of awards available, the size of the competing group and the distribution of marks in the selection examinations. There is no means of giving a comparable statement of the position in each State" since there are variations between the States in the number of subjects on which selection is based, in the number of candidates competing for awards and the number of awards available. For the same reasons a meaningful statement of this type sought by the honourable member cannot be made about Commonwealth Advanced Education and Commonwealth Secondary scholarships. </para>

In many significant areas of educational expenditure no dissection has been available of funds allocated specifically to research. My Department is, however, currently engaged in a survey of expenditure on research and development throughout Australia, in both the -natural and social sciences. This project, known as 'Project SCORE' is directed towards obtaining the type of information sought by the honourable member. However, because of the scope and complexity of the survey which is now in progress, results will not be available for some. time. </para>

              <para>I am not aware of any estimates of the annual economic benefits to Australia from scientific research financed by the Commonwealth. lt is extremely difficult to quantify such benefits because it is only rarely that sufficient information is available to permit a cost-benefit analysis of even a single project to be undertaken. This is because the results of research may take many years to make an economic impact, the benefits are likely to be diffused throughout the economy, and the full economic impact of a given discovery can be related to the extent to which this is exploited in the process of commercial innovation. </para>

My Department is, however, in the process of undertaking a comprehensive survey (Project SCORE) of research and development expenditures and sources of funds. This survey will cover all sectors of the economy. I outlined the current status of Project SCORE in my reply to a question without notice asked in the House on 11th March 1970 which is given on page 272 of the Hansard of that date. It is expected that the analysis of the data for the Commonwealth sector will commence later in the year. When this analysis has been completed figures will be available for, inter alia, the Commonwealth's expenditure in the 1968-69 financial year on research and development conducted by its own departments and instrumentalities, and in support of research conducted by other institutions. </para>

Under these conventions the government' sector includes both Central and State Government organisations but excludes nationalised industries and government-owned business enterprises. It will, therefore, not bc possible to make valid comparisons of research expenditure in the government sector in Australia with that in countries which have published figures based on the O.E.C.D. conventions until such time as figures are available for both the Commonwealth and the States, and appropriate adjustments are made in accordance with international practice. </para>

            <item label="(1)">
              <para>It is a fact that in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland the increases have not yet been paid to all staff; approximately 9,000 (23%) remain to be paid in New South Wales, 6,400 (23%) in Victoria and 5,300 (36%) in Queensland and these are expected to be processed within six weeks. In Western Australia and Tasmania payments have been completed and all payments will be effected in South Australia on pay-day 23rd April. The increases, details of which were advised by the Public Service Board on 16lh February, 1970, affect the annual salary/wage entitlement of all staff employed in the Department; this involves some 40,000 in New South Wales alone. The associated superannuation contribution payable by the majority of permanent staff is also subject to variation. Apart from problems arising from the complexity of the adjustments and their volume particularly in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, the lime available for processing the normal fortnightly pay has been reduced by public holidays which in turn has restricted processing of the increases during this period. Every effort is being made to process the remaining entitlements as quickly as possible. The pay section staff has been supplemented by staff from other areas and extensive overtime is being worked. </para>

              <para>Adjustments for time off duty without pay is a regular action in the normal fortnightly pay preparation procedure and does nol involve variation to annual salary/wages or rate of superannuation contribution. Employees involved in a workstoppage during February approximated 14% of total staff and normally the necessary deductions would be effected within 2 pay periods. However, due to the additional work load existing at this time deductions have not been completed in the usual time. In New South Wales they will not be finished until mid-May. </para>

This Commonwealth additional hospital benefit, together wilh Commonwealth ordinary hospital benefit of 80 cents per day, a total of $2.00 per day, was payable to insured persons accommodated in hospitals. At that time, for the payment of benefits, hospitals included 'unrecognised' hospitals. However, as from 1st January 1963, 'unrecognised' hospitals were approved as nursing homes. </para>

Statistics have now become available following surveys conducted by my Department of both public hospital costs and nursing home costs. The latter costs are. of course, more applicable to the question. During 1967-68 the average bed day cost for public hospitals was calculated al $17.81 whilst the latest figures for public and private nursing homes show that in 1966-67 the average bed day cost was $5.10. Comparison of this latter figure with costs which applied when the $2.00 per day was introduced is not possible as relevant earlier cost figures are not available. </para>

This benefit is currently being received by approximately 43 per cent of all patients accommodated in approved nursing homes. Due mainly to this new benefit, Commonwealth expenditure on nursing home benefits has increased from an actual $24.5m in 1967-68 to an estimated $44. 3m in 1969-70 being an increase of 80 per cent. Expenditure in 1969-70 on Commo nursing home benefits to 28th February 1970 is $18. 8m ordinary benefits, and $ 12.2m Supplementary benefits. </para>

            <para>Medical and hospital benefit organisations registered under the National Health Act are not required to have a specific rule dealing with the disposition of their assets and reserves in the event of winding-up. The position is that one of the conditions subject to which organisations are registered is that contributions to medical or hospital funds must only be applied to the payment of medical or hospital benefits to its contributors, and towards meeting reasonable management costs. In the event of a registered organisation seeking cancellation of its registration, it is required to submit proposals for the disbursement of surplus funds. The proposals are examined in the light of the individual circumstances and having regard to the wishes of contributors. </para>
