        <para class="block">I do not really think that I need to tell this House that Billy Kent Hughes, as we all knew him, was a remarkable man and a fine Australian. In a crowded lifetime of 75 years he time and again demonstrated his courage, determination, integrity and rugged individuality, and with these qualities were combined a high sense of service, exceptional abilities and great humanity, making him one of the outstanding personalities of this Parliament. He was well known as a fearless fighter for the causes he espoused, and in the party room and in the Parliament he was articulate, dogged and outspoken. Many members of this chamber would have often disagreed with him but I believe that most of his parliamentary colleagues, if not all, on both sides of the House, had a respect and an affection for him at all times. As the oldest member of the Parliament be could look back on a lifetime of achievement and service that few men could rival, as scholar, soldier, sportsman, parliamentarian and even poet. He devoted 43 years of his life to service in Parliament: 21 years in this House and before that 22 years as a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly. He was an enthusiastic traveller and had a wide knowledge of world affairs. He was greatly concerned about the defence and security of the country for which he bad fought with such distinction in 2 world wars. He was also an ever-ready advocate for the welfare of servicemen. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">His</inline>own military career began when he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force shortly after the start of the First World War. He served overseas in the 3rd Australian Light Horse Brigade and the Australian Mounted Division. He was mentioned in despatched 4 times, awarded the Military Cross and ended that war as the youngest major in the Australian forces. He then took up the Rhodes Scholarship at Oxford which he had won in 1914 and went on to gain his Master of Arts degree. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> Kent Hughes was back in uniform again in 1940, served in Malaya and was promoted to colonel. He was captured by the Japanese at the fall of Singapore and spent 3&#189; years in Changi and other prison camps. It was while he was a prisoner of the Japanese that he wrote one of his best known works, &#39;Slaves of the Samurai&#39;. In the Second World War he was again mentioned in despatches and was awarded the Efficiency Decoration. </para>
        <para>Another area in which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> gave distinguished service was in the field of sporting activities, both as an athlete in his own right and as an administrator. He represented Australia as a hurdler in the 1920 Olympic Games and in the same year ran in the British Empire versus United States of America Games and the England versus France athletics. In 1938 he was manager of the Australian team at the Empire Games. He became  President  of the Victorian Olympic Council in 1953 and  President  of the Victorian Amateur Athletics Association in 1958, positions which he still held at the time of his death. He was, of course,  chairman  of the organising committee which staged the highly successful Melbourne Olympics in 1956. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid&#39;s</inline>political career began in 1927 when he entered the Victorian Legislative </para>
        <para class="block">Assembly as member for Kew. During the next 22 years he held a number of portfolios in the Victorian Government and was Deputy Premier for 1 year. He transferred to the Federal Parliament by winning the seat of Chisholm in the general election of 1949. In his 21 years in this House he was a member of the Privileges Committee, Minister for the Interior, Minister for Works and Housing from 1951 to 1956, and Chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs from 1956 to 1961. He was knighted in 1957. </para>
        <para>So much for the official record. Many of us also will have personal memories of events and activities which showed Billy Kent Hughes as the vital personality that he was. We will remember his concern for physical fitness - even last session he could be seen jogging around Lake Burley Griffin most mornings - and his concern for the trim condition be maintained which led to his capacity to continue to wear the uniform which has graced him in 2 world wars. Indeed, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> I understand that he used to ride a horse in his Light Horse uniform in Anzac Day marches as a returned soldier of the First World War and then return by car to march as a returned soldier of the Second World War. We will remember him in that uniform at the unveiling  a  couple of years ago of the Light Horse memorial in Canberra, which was another project to which he directed his energies. </para>
        <para>The Parliament and the nation have lost a devoted servant and a great Australian. I believe that we are the richer for his lifetime and the poorer for his passing. To Lady Kent Hughes, his children and grandchildren we who have known him for so long extend our deepest sympathy. </para>

          <para>- On behalf of the Australian Labour Party, I support the Prime Minister&#39;s motion of regret, appreciation and sympathy. None of us can fail to be aware of how sharply the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> Kent Hughes breaks a living link with an era he himself embodied for us as the oldest member of the House of Representatives. The mere presence of men like the former honourable member for Chisholm, retaining full vigour to the very last, tended to obscure how very many years, indeed generations, have passed since the rise of his generation - the generation of Anzacs. He was the last of this Parliament&#39;s original Anzacs. He enlisted on the day recruiting opened. Now only the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McEwen),</inline> the honourable member for Mitchell <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Irwin)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hendrickson</inline> remain of the scores of members of the national Parliament who had enlisted in the first Australian Imperial Force. He not only belonged to that generation but he was also an archetype. When one recalls <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> Kent Hughes&#39; manner, style, fitness - even his features and physique - one gains a little insight into what manner of men those were who, in the words of Clemenceau, &#39;astonished Europe by their valour from the very beginning&#39;. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>There would be few members of this House with whom I and most of my Party would have so consistently disagreed as our late colleague. I find it all the more appropriate to state this, in these circumstances, when I recall a particular and characteristic act of spontaneous chivalry by Wilfrid Kent Hughes on a similar occasion 7 years ago when this House paid its tribute to the late Edward John Ward. There could have been no 2 men more opposed and who more relished the give and take of opposing; but those of us who were here well remember, and those on this side remember with particular appreciation, the unstinted tribute the late member paid to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ward</inline> for his pioneering work on rail standardisation. In that great work Wilfrid Kent Hughes, as Minister for Transport in the Victorian Parliament, played an equally notable part. </para>
        <para>He was the senior serving parliamentarian in Australia. He had been in this and in the Victorian Parliament, as the Prime Minister stated, for 43 years - more than half the life of our federation. He served as a Minister in both parliaments. Yet it was as a private member - in spirit nearer the cross benches than the back - that he made his mark here. It is pleasing to recall that the last motion in his name - or at least that half of it relating to Cockburn Sound - received support from all quarters. Yet it is perhaps just as significant, as a key to the independence of his career, that the second half of his motion received scarcely any support, and none of it official. If Wilfrid Kent Hughes so often walked alone, he walked very straight. </para>

He exemplified his greatness in many spheres. It is not every great man who is necessarily a likeable man. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> Kent Hughes was great by any test that one could make, and a man to be friends with and to respect on any occasion. It was my good fortune to commence my friendship with him some years before I came into the Federal Parliament and when he was serving in the State Parliament of Victoria. I have never known an incident in Billy Kent Hughes&#39;s life that did not mark him as a man of great integrity, of great dedication and of great courage, whether it was physical courage in war or moral courage which is called for on occasions in the lives of people who enter politics. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The story of his life has been told by th.&#62; Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. I remember him for many things. Perhaps one of the best memories I have of him is that he, along with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Blarney, Judge Drake-Brockman and a few others who had all served in the First World War, came to the conclusion in the mid-1 930s that war was certain to come. This group gathered together, particularly around <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Thomas</inline> Blarney, and dedicated themselves to preparing for what they regarded as the inevitability of war and to persuading many others that if war was to come there had to be a greater consciousness in the Australian political mind and the public mind generally. It is not given to many to be so prescient as this, nor to be so dedicated. He was a man who had in the First World War, served his country in a manner that demanded no further service. It is true that he was the youngest man in the first AIF to hold field rank, the rank of major. At the time of which I am speaking - in the 1930s - he was  Deputy  Premier of Victoria and might well have felt that he could go on serving his State and his country without preparing himself for another war which he correctly saw coming. But he was not the kind of man who avoided any call to which he felt it was his part to respond. </para>
        <para>It was his fate, of course, going with the 8th Division to Malaya, to be taken prisoner and to be held by the Japanese. It was a pretty terrible experience but not one that prevented him from coming back and reentering the public life of the country with all the energy and dedication that he had. Those of us who sat with him in the Parliament and in Cabinets are well aware of his tremendously wide interest in what he conceived to be the basic welfare and security of the country. He was a man who devoted himself to comprehending the problems of international relationships, and he brought the results of his study, his very frequent visits overseas and the contacts that he made into the Cabinet room, into the Party room and into the Parliament. He was a very great man and a very good man, and his life could well serve as an example for others to endeavour to emulate. I join in expressing the deepest sympathy of my colleagues of the Australian Country Party to Lady Kent Hughes and to the family. </para>

        <para>I woke and found that life was duty. </para>
        <para class="block">Paradoxically the origin of this couplet was obscured from him; the force of it he well knew. We all I believe at one time or another try to grasp the meaning and purpose of life, and for most of us it is a halting and imperfect quest. It was never so to W. S. Kent Hughes. To him life was duty - duty to a power in this world but not of this world; duty to his country and to his people; duty to his political principles as he saw them; duty to those who reached out for help and who sought the gentle instinct of a firm but very generous mind. Neither he himself nor the firmest of his friends would have ever made pretence that in following his duty he was not frequently plunged into conflict, fierce and tempestuous. Nor would the most composed of his opponents have hesitated to agree that he always emerged from that conflict the same - no rancour, no meanness and no lasting hurt. Certainly he sought the vindication of his views. We all do. If the modesty of truth can intrude for a moment, how seldom is it we stop to think how irrelevant many of our views are in the infinite sweep of events? </para>
        <para>With his disciplined knowledge of history and with his own practised role in its creation, no sense of vanity trammelled W. S. Kent Hughes in his argument. For one to have lived out his days as our late colleague did so vigorously and with such splendid good humour and to have won such wide respect in his own country was a revelation of the man he was. That was not the boundary of that remarkable man&#39;s achievement. Few, if any, have passed through this Parliament and won such wide respect in so many countries and among so many people. We are reminded: &#39;For here have we no continuing city but we seek one to come&#39;. Wilfrid Selwyn Kent Hughes has gone to his continuing city and on that list which stretches out forever we can gladly write his name. His proud and restless spirit yet shall beckon and alert. In life its constant companions were courage and honour. And now not even death can contrive to make them desert. </para>

          <para>- The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> has paid a well deserved tribute to the memory of a very remarkable man and there is nothing that I or anybody else can add to the Prime Minister&#39;s tribute. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> Kent Hughes lived a full life. He lived it vigorously. He fought the good fight always. He never lowered his sword. He never asked for quarter and he never gave any. He always fought the good fight without rancour. After the struggle was over he had all that the Prime Minister said in the matter of humanity and even humility. I knew him for longer than anyone else in this House. I knew him from the time he entered the Victorian Parliament in 1925. I feuded with him often as a member of the Victorian Executive of the Labor Party. I feuded with him while he was a State parliamentarian and afterwards when he came to the National Parliament in 1949, which 1 had entered 9 years previously. But our friendship was always firm. It was always constant. He came to see me - as he often did. or 1 went to his room in the new Commonwealth offices in Melbourne to see him - and said he wished to go away on another world visit. He said that it would be his last. He said: I want to go to a meeting of former Rhodes scholars and I would like a pair.&#39; 1 said: &#39;Well, you will always get a pair from me. Billy, if you want one.&#39; He said: &#39;Well, you and I are two of the last of our generation left and we have known each other and respected each other.&#39; That was my last conversation with him. The shock of his death the day after he had been in the Commonwealth Parliament offices - I did not see him then - was distressing to me as it was to many other people 1 have said that he was a remarkable man. He had courage, fortitude, physical endurance, mental strength and determination right to the end. But above all that he had sincerity. Whatever he believed lie said. I have never known him to excuse himself or to withdraw any remark or anything he wrote in which he believed. I think he died as he would have wanted to die - in the evening of his life. J think he died as most people would want to die. He entered his eternal repose in the depths of his sleep. </para>

          <para>- I feel most humble indeed even to enter this debate after the standard of the speeches that have been made. When I attended the funeral of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> Kent Hughes with so many others 1 sat in the church and looked at the noble gathering that attended and I thought much of the man whom I had known over many years through family friendship and through my experience in this House. I know that 1 say on behalf of every backbencher on either side of the House that Bill Kent Hughes had the amazing ability to be with all men of whatever age. As I heard it described yesterday, he could speak even to children and reach a common ground with them. We back benchers in this House - many of us radicals, rebels or whatever we may be called occasionally - could always seek out Bill Kent Hughes and receive sound advice which perhaps would temper what we had been thinking was good common sense. We all owed an obligation to him. However, this is not what I wanted to say. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>While I was sitting in the church I thought of the number of occasions on which I had heard Bill Kent Hughes in debate on television or radio and in other spheres. I have heard him called a racist but I think it should be said - and, indeed, it was understood by all who were debating with him - that no man had more friends in Asia, South East Asia and Africa than he. He went out and sought their friendship and whatever he said or did was done for the benefit of these people and of the world. As the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McEwen),</inline> and others have said, when he debated, perhaps with young university students who were just going out into life and who had not had his experience or suffered as he had done, he was not vindic tive. Perhaps he could not understand their viewpoint, but he never finished a debate without a word of sympathy for them or expressing concern and interest in the outlook against which he had edneavoured to persuade them. </para>
        <para>I ask myself what Bill Kent Hughes himself would like to be said on this occasion. I look at him as a man who, through death, has been forced to put down his load of sticks. As the  Deputy  Prime Minister said, in the 1930s <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> was one of those who warned of the dangers confronting this country. He tried to tell people what could occur. War did occur. He unfortunately, together with many others, was imprisoned for many years by an Asian people. Later he gained much sympathy for the people of South East Asia for saying what he thought could happen in that region if ever again people should be too complacent. He had the courage to say what he thought should be said. I should like to say, on behalf of Bill Kent&#39; Hughes and all those men like him: Do not just praise my name; remember some of the things that I stood for; remember some of the messages I endeavoured to give you&#39;.

He was an authority on South East Asia and the southern regions of Africa. We are better men for having been associated with him.

          <para>-! join in this valedictory to the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> Kent Hughes simply because 1 liked him a lot, respected him a great deal, and loved the way in which he treated the back benchers on this side of the Parliament and, I feel, those on the Opposition side if they sought advice from him. As has been said, in his political views he was very much to the right of centre in some respects, but in other senses he was very much to the left because he had tremendous compassion for the aged, the frail and the infirm. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> Kent Hughes was always helpful in his attitude to those sections of our legislation that were designed to promote the welfare of people who had helped Australia but who were in need. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>He was, as has been said, a very highly intelligent man and he was a complex person in himself; but his personal needs and his own requirements were very few. He asked for very little for Billy Kent Hughes. As many honourable members well know, I was his jogging companion in Canberra. He never left one of those excursions around the lake without saying: &#39;Thank you, Ray&#39;. I felt so humble on each occasion when 1 went around with him that a man of his greatness and of his ability should say Thank you&#39; to me. But this is the type of man that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> Kent Hughes was. </para>
        <para>He was passionately devoted to Australia. This is one of the reasons why he carried out the crusades that he undertook in this Parliament. He was passionately fond of this land of his birth and of his infant nurture. This gave him the strong political views that he had. Indeed, on the day before he died he had published in the Melbourne &#39;Herald&#39; an article that symbolises <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> Kent Hughes, &#91;t is not complex; it is straight to the point, lt is headed: Time for Us to Wake Up to the Red Threat&#39;. There was no messing around with words. That is what Billy Kent Hughes felt and this is how he wrote. </para>
        <para>He was richly endowed with the personal qualities of life. As I have said, he was a highly intelligent man and he reached the attainments of a highly intelligent man. He talked to me less than 24 hours before he died and mentioned the excursion that he was about to take overseas and which has been mentioned by the right honourable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Calwell). Sir Wilfrid</inline> was going to Rhodesia to join a centenary celebration of Rhodes scholars. He was to leave Melbourne on 12th August. No doubt, that celebration will be taking place this week, or perhaps it was held last week. He was to further his education, he said, on the way other people thought and felt on such matters as foreign affairs, defence and Che ability of Australia to help people in South East Asia, Africa and elsewhere. As the honourable member for La Trobe <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr less)</inline> has said, he was not a racist. He looked at the problems as he saw them. He looked at the compassion that was needed in these countries and the good sense 1hat we should try to convey to them if at all possible. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline>Kent Hughes was deeply imbued with a spirit of service not only to Australia but to all peoples of the world. As the honourable member for La Trobe has said, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> was able to meet Ministers of State, heads of government and senior citizens and. at the same time, was able to talk to and meet with the children of this country and any country he visited. He was a great man and I too join with those who have extended their condolences to his wife. Lady Kent Hughes, and his family. </para>

I contacted the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barnard)</inline> and after a favourable response I rang to tell <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> of this. To my great surprise I learnt that he had died just a few hours before.

          <para>- I desire to acid my tribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> Kent Hughes. 1 had an unusual relationship with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid.</inline> I first saw him in September 1945 in Manila in a prisoner of war transit camp, and 1 will never forget the impressive, striking appearance of this man with a chest of ribbons. 1 did not meet him again until 1958 when I entered this Parliament. We had a wide divergence of political views and our solutions to problems were not always the same but there was a certain kindness he always showed to me personally. In a way he seemed to tend to protect me when I appeared to be in difficulties. We travelled together to represent this Parliament in April 1.968 at a War Graves Commission ceremony in Ambon, Indonesia, where a great number of our comrades were buried. 1 always found that the men who knew him during the War respected him and had a great feeling for him. He showed kindness in his personal relationships with honourable members on the Opposition side - I know he had close friends on this side of the House - in circumstances where, for instance, their wives were ill. There was always a special kindness about Bill Kent Hughes. This is a strange thing about the Parliament. No matter how wide one&#39;s political point of view may be, no matter how much we can disagree even on the solutions of our problems, there are some things on which we can come together. I want to pay tribute to the kindness Bill Kent Hughes showed me in a personal approach to life and i wish to extend my sympathies to Lady Kern Hughes. </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">In doing so I present the Budget proposals for the financial year 1970-71. </para>
          <para>By these proposals the Government seeks: - to provide for a large increase in essential expenditures, especially on payments to the States, welfare, development and assistance to industry, including emergency relief for wool-growers hard hit by drought and low prices; - to make reductions in personal income taxation, especially on lower and middle income earners, estimated to have a value to the taxpayers concerned of $289m in a full financial year and $228m in 1970-71; we thereby make good - indeed more than make good - our undertaking to give substantial income tax relief to this large body of people; - notwithstanding these large commitments, to produce a responsible budget, a balanced budget, a budget shaped to the requirements of an economy that is dynamic and fast-growing - but an economy still threatened by disruptive inflation. </para>
          <para>I should like to enlarge upon that last point. In 1969-70 the economy again achieved a high rate of growth. Gross national product at constant prices increased by about 5.5% - this despite the trials and setbacks of rural industry. The number of wage and salary earners increased by no less than 4%. Even though wool prices fell sharply, there was a remarkable increase of 24% in the total value of exports. But the strong lift in activity that lay behind these achievements brought developing stresses. By March, notwithstanding the big inflow of migrants and the entry of more and more married women into the work-force, the labour situation had become very tight, with job vacancies well above the number of registered applicants for work. </para>
          <para>The surge in demand for labour reflected a quickening in demand generally. Consumer spending, which increased by 7.2% in 1968-69, moved up by 9.6% in 1969-70. All branches of private fixed capital expenditure - that is to say, on dwellings, other forms of building and construction, plant and equipment - rose strongly until the final quarter of the year when, through tighening of finance, there was a moderate check to housing starts. Public authority spending also rose strongly throughout the year. </para>
          <para>In brief, notably though output was increasing, demand was increasing faster. These are typically the conditions in which inflation breeds. Signs that it was active became more evident as the year went on. Cost and price increases gathered pace. Average weekly earnings rose by about 8% in 1969-70. The consumer price index rose at an accelerating rate throughout the year, reaching an annual rate of growth above 5% in the June quarter. </para>
          <para>The end-year downswing in liquidity, reinforced as it was by sharp increases in interest rates, produced a marked monetary tightening, although its severity was moderated to some extent by a revival of capital inflow. The most evident effect it had on the demand situation was seen in housing activity; but there was also some general easing of the labour market. Even so, at the end of June the number of registered applicants for jobs did not exceed 1% of the work-force. </para>
          <para>The current year thus began with the economy pretty much at full stretch. Prospects for growth are very good provided the call on resources is kept within reason. Certainly, it is entirely possible that the year will see real gross national product increase again by 5.5% or thereabout-. With immigration flowing strongly, there should be a further large addition - more than 3% - to the work-force. The farm outlook is not encouraging but we can reasonably expect a good rise in non-farm productivity. Oar external outlook is promising - in particular, there should be a further large rise in exports. Meanwhile, the fact that Bass Strait oil is coming on stream in a big way will hold down imports quite considerably. Capital inflow has been fairly strong lately though, of course, we cannot be sure of its trend throughout the year. </para>
          <para>It is the demand side that will bear watching. Consumer spending is currently very buoyant and that situation seems likely to continue. Private spending on plant and equipment and non-residential building and construction seems set for continued strong growth - there is a wealth of investment opportunities, and such forward indicators as we have clearly suggest this. The earlier strong upward trend in dwelling construction has been checked for the time being but an upturn there is likely before long. </para>
          <para>Herein lies the core of our Budget problem, seen from the economic standpoint. With economic activity running, as it has been, and in all probability will continue to be, close up against the limit of resources, there is an inherent tendency for wages, profits and other forms of income to rise faster than output - on the one hand, giving rise to cost increases and, on the other, generating excessive demand. This is not just a matter of theory; it is borne out by a wealth of experience. Hence, in framing the Budget, we have had to assess most carefully its potential influence on the economy. </para>
          <para>There could be no gainsaying the need for a large increase of expenditures in this Budget. From the analysis 1 shall make later it will be seen that all of the increases we propose are in the high priority class. But the Commonwealth&#39;s expenditures, directly or indirectly, add to demand and we have had to scrutinise them carefully from that standpoint. We have also taken as mandatory a sizeable reduction in personal income tax - we propose to meet that obligation squarely and unequivocally. But the increase in disposable incomes that will ensue must tend to stimulate demand. </para>
          <para>Plainly, economic prospects being what they are, the Government must ensure that, in its overall effect, the Budget does not give additional impetus to demand. Accordingly, we have avoided any significant acceleration in the rate of increase in domestic outlays and, as the cornerstone of our policy, 1 am bringing in a balanced Budget - indeed, one in which total receipts will more than cover total expenditure. As overseas expenditures this year will again greatly exceed overseas receipts, this Budget will produce a considerable surplus of domestic receipts over domestic expenditures. From the standpoint of impact on resources and liquidity that will be all to the good. </para>
          <para>It may be said that we could equally have achieved the same Budget result by drastic pruning of expenditures or by postponing personal income tax reform. We do not believe these were practicable alternatives. We have chosen instead to pursue high priority objectives on the expenditure side and to do something decisive on personal income tax; to make this possible, we have decided to introduce a number of taxation measures, which I shall outline presently. Here I may say that they are of kinds that, in general, should have a steadying effect on spending. </para>

        <title>THE EXPENDITURE ESTIMATES</title>
        <page.no>11</page.no>
        <type>miscellaneous</type>
      </debateinfo>
      <para class="block">Total expenditure this year is estimated at $7,883m, an increase of $795m or 11.2%. The increase last year was $5 19m or 7.9%. More important for the domestic economy, however, is the fact that the rate of increase in domestic outlay this year - estimated at 11.4% - is not greatly above the increase of 10.7% last year. </para>
      <para>The prospective increase in expenditure this year owes much to the fact that, particularly over the last 12 months, the Government has entered into a number of major new commitments. Notable amongst them are the new and much liberalised financial arrangements with the States, but other examples include the improvement of the health scheme, introduction of the tapered means test, and measures to assist primary producers. </para>
      <para>All of these increases have importance for the economic and social wellbeing of the community. But having already undertaken these large commitments, we could not, responsibly, put forward further&#34; large expenditure proposals at this juncture. Accordingly, the new expenditure proposals which I shall announce presently are estimated to add no more than about $70m to our expenditures this year. As usual, detailed analyses of the estimates are to be found in statements attached to the Budget Speech. </para>
      <para class="block">Payments to the States </para>
      <para>Outstanding in this year&#39;s estimates is the very large increase in payments to the States. These payments, including the funds required for the State works and housing programmes, are estimated at no less than $2,708m or $29 lm more than last year. </para>
      <para class="block">They will absorb one-third of this year&#39;s Budget and account for more than one-third of the estimated increase of $795m in our total expenditures this year. This represents a massive diversion of the nation&#39;s material resources to help meet the needs of the State Governments. </para>
      <para>An important factor in this increase is the new financial assistance arrangements we have entered into with the States and which commence this year. These will give the States $70m more Commonwealth assistance in 1970-71 than if the previous arrangements had continued. The financial assistance grants are estimated to increase by approximately $170m in 1970-71. A further $10m will be added to these grants under an agreement we have reached with the Premier of Tasmania whereby Tasmania&#39;s special grant for 1970-71 will be correspondingly reduced. We shall also be meeting debt servicing charges on $200m of State debt this year at a cost of $12m, and on a further S200m of State debt in each of the next 4 years. This will lead to the formal transfer of $ 1,000m of State debt to the Commonwealth in June 1975. </para>
      <para>It was agreed at the recent Loan Council meeting that the State works and housing programmes should be increased this year by $65m, thus bringing them to $823m. Within this figure, the Commonwealth will be providing, for the first time, an interest-free grant of $200m that will help to relieve the States of debt charges on their non-revenue-producing works. </para>
      <para>Other specific purpose payments to the States are estimated at $539m or $69m more than last year; these cover a wide variety of both revenue and capital payments, including SI 2m for drought relief assistance to Queensland in continuation of the widely extended measures introduced last year. The Commonwealth will also as usual give sympathetic consideration to any further approaches the States may make for assistance of this nature where the cost involved would place an undue burden on their finances. Over the past 5 years the Commonwealth has provided the States with drought relief assistance totalling $94m. </para>
      <para>Much has been said in the past year about the working of our Federation. May I suggest that the very magnitude of the provision we are makins in this Budget for additional payments to the States is proof of our real desire to ensure effective working of the Federation. </para>

        <para>The Defence Vote proposed is 4 1,1 3 7m which is 3.1% greater than the 1969-70 expenditure of $l,103m. Defence expenditure overseas - estimated at 1.233m - will be about the same as last year. </para>
        <para>During the past year, our national security policies have had particular and continuing attention from the Government. The challenge they present is that of understanding the changes occurring in international relationships, especially as they affect South East Asia and Australia, and cf developing defence policies which will serve us in the strategic circumstances of the future. Perception of the long term - indeed of the very long term - is necessary when ordering weapons systems and developing the infrastructure for our forces. </para>
        <para>The estimates contain some provision for expenditure on major capital equipment projects for the Services announced in the Budget Speech last year and by the Minister for Defence in March but the full impact of expenditure on these projects will not be felt until next financial year or later. Other major items of equipment are under study. Provision is made for expenditure of $13m in 1970-71 for the lease of 24 Phantom aircraft from the United States Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Major works</inline> projects include the RAN receiving station at Darwin, the continued development of the Army Aviation Centre at Oakey in Queensland and the development of the airfield at Learmonth in Western Australia. </para>
        <para>It is planned to increase the strength of the Permanent Forces during 1970-71 by about 1,400. These additional personnel are required to man new ships and aircraft coming into service, meet operational commitments and provide supporting elements in Australia. Conditions of service are under review and several adjustments in these conditions have already been made. </para>
        <para>As to Vietnam, progress in the general security situation has been such that, as announced by the Prime Minister earlier this year, the Government has decided that one Australian infantry battalion and some supporting personnel will be withdrawn. It is planned that this will take place within the next few months. </para>
        <para>In respect of our forces in Malaysia and Singapore, we are continuing to develop arrangements required by the situation where British force dispositions are being greatly altered. Our planning is being coordinated with the defence policies of the British Government which has pledged itself to retain some forces in the area after 1971 as a contribution to regional security. An amount of 55.5m <inline font-style="italic">m\\</inline> be provided this year under the current programme of defence aid to Malaysia and Singapore, while defence aid for South Vietnam in 1970-71 is estimated at S3. 3m. </para>

          <page.no>13</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>Next to our payments to the States, the largest element in the prospective increase in our expenditure this year is welfare. These expenditures on social services, health services, repatriation, and housing benefits are estimated to increase by $157m to SI, 820m. Details are given in Statement No. 10. Of this increase, about $31m relates to decisions I shall detail presently, t further $35m arises from recent modification of the health scheme and about $35m from the full-year effects of various measures announced in the 1969-70 Budget or introduced during 1969-70. The balance is due to normal growth in expenditures arising from existing commitments. age, invalid, widows&#39; and service pensions </para>
        <para>The Government proposes to increase the maximum rates of all age, invalid and widows&#39; (tensions by 50 cents a week. This will mean that, in terms of the maximum weekly rate of pensions, a married couple who are both pensioners will receive $27.50 a week. When they are living apart because of illness or infirmity they will receive $31 a week. A single pensioner will receive $15.50 a week. A widow with one child will receive at least $22 a week and a widow without children $13.75 a week. In addition, supplementary assistance of up to $2 a week is payable to each eligible pensioner. Persons in receipt of service pensions - which are repatriation benefits - will receive similar pension increases. So will tuberculosis sufferers in receipt of allowances :.nd handicapped persons in receipt of sheltered employment allowances.  sickness benefits </para>
        <para>The rate of sickness benefit for adults, married minors and minors without a parent in Australia will be increased after 6 weeks to $15.50 a week, that is, equivalent to the standard rate of invalid pension. The benefit rate to apply after 6 weeks in the case of an unmarried minor will be $10 a week. In addition, a supplementary allowance of $2 a week will be paid where the beneficiary pays rent and is entirely or substantially dependent on his benefit. Persons who are in hospital and have no dependants will not qualify for these increased and additional benefits.  sheltered workshops </para>
        <para>Sheltered workshops incur additional costs in providing training and supervisory staff, doctors, social workers, counsellors and others necessary to help handicapped employees overcome their disabilities. A $1 for $1 subsidy will be paid towards the salaries of staff engaged to provide these special <inline font-style="italic">services;.</inline> lt is also proposed to encourage sheltered workshops to graduate more of their employees to work in open industry by paying the organisation a training fee of $500 for each eligible employee who is placed in open employment for nol less than 12 months. This payment will also serve to compensate sheltered workshops for the considerable time and effort spent in training handicapped workers. </para>
        <para>It has been found that inability to obtain suitable residential accommodation is one reason why some handicapped people are unable to accept normal employment, lt is therefore proposed to extend the $2 for $1 capital subsidy now available towards the cost of hostels for handicapped people in sheltered employment, to hostels for those disabled persons who are able to engage in normal employment but still require special accommodation.  repatriation benefits </para>
        <para>We propose a number of improvements in repatriation pensions and benefits. </para>
        <para>The totally and permanently incapacitated war pensioner is (o receive an increase of $2.00, to raise the pension to $38.00 a week. </para>
        <para>The intermediate rate war pension, payable to those able to work only part-time or intermittently because of a war-caused disability, will be increased by $1.50 to $28.00 a week. </para>
        <para>The special compensation allowance, payable to certain of the more severely disabled general rate pensioners, will be increased. The increase is to be $1.00 a week for those eligible at the 100% level, grading down to 75 cents at the 75% level. The allowance at the 100% level will be $6.00 a week, bringing the combined payment of allowance and general rate war pension to $18.00 a week for most of those receiving pensions at the 1 00% rate. </para>
        <para>Benefits for war widows are to be increased. The pension for war widows is to rise by 50 cents to $15.50 a week, and the domestic allowance that is payable to most war widows will also be increased by 50 cents, to $8.00 a week. The new maximum level of combined benefits for eligible war widows will thus be $23.50 a week. </para>
        <para>War pensions payable for children of ex-servicemen who have died as a result of war service are to be increased by 60 cents to $6.00 a week for the first child and by 75 cents to $5.00 a week for the second and each subsequent child. The rate for a double orphan, that is, a child who has lost both parents, will be increased by $1.85 to $12.00 a week.  mental health institutions </para>
        <para>The Government has decided to continue for a further 3 years from 1 July 1970 the provision of assistance towards capital expenditure incurred by the States on mental institutions. The Commonwealth assistance will remain on the basis of one-third of the total expenditure by the States on approved projects.  home nursing subsidy </para>
        <para>The Government intends to increase, from I September, the subsidy at present payable to approved organisations providing home nursing services. For organisations established before September 1956, the annual subsidy for each nurse over and above the number employed at 30 September 1956 will be increased from $2,600 to $3,200. For organisations formed after that date, the subsidy for each nurse employed will be increased from $1,300 to $1,600 a year. As at present, the amount of Commonwealth subsidy payable to an organisation will not exceed the amount of </para>

        <para>The Commonwealth continues to make a significant contribution to the expansion and improvement of Australia&#39;s education services. The greatly improved system of general revenue grants to the States over the next 5 years should enable them to do much more for education which is, of course, one of their major activities. Besides this indirect assistance, Commonwealth expenditures specifically related to education are expected this year to exceed $3 12m - which would be an increase of $63 m or 25%. </para>
        <para>Much of this Commonwealth expenditure takes the form of specific purpose payments to the States. These are expected to rise this year by 29% from $148m to about $191m. The principal items in this category will be - payments for universities $78m; for the developing colleges of advanced education $35m; for special purpose unmatched grants for school facilities, technical colleges and teacher training colleges $48m; and for per capita grants towards running costs of independent schools $24m. </para>
        <para>Schools and technical colleges in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory will together receive almost $30m, while grants to the Australian National University and to the Canberra College of Advanced Education will be about $30m and $5m respectively. </para>

A payment of $30.5m in respect of exports from the 1968-69 wheat crop is expected to fall due late in the year. No such payment was necessary last year. Under revised arrangements announced in June by the Minister for Primary Industry, bounties on dairy products are estimated to cost $45m in 1970-71, $ 17.5m more than in 1969-70. There will be a partly offsetting decrease of $7m in payments of devaluation compensation to the dairy industry. Devaluation compensation payments to other rural industries are expected to decrease by Sim.

        <type>miscellaneous</type>
      </debateinfo>
      <para>Woolgrowers&#39; income fell steeply in 1969- 70 because of lower prices for wool and, in some areas, because of drought. Those growers particularly affected by these circumstances, and who are heavily dependent on income from wool, are to be assisted by a one-year scheme of emergency relief. Within a total amount of $30m, the Commonwealth will make payments to wool-growers based on the fall in their gross proceeds from wool between 1968-69 and 1969-70 beyond a certain percentage, and subject to a number of conditions. Details will be announced shortly by the Minister for Primary Industry. </para>
      <para>The scheme is regarded as an interim measure pending consideration of other possible action appropriate to the longer-term problems of the wool growing industry. In particular, the Government is examining the need for reconstruction in the wool industry, including as one aspect of reconstruction the question of growers&#39; indebtedness, and of ways in which the Commonwealth can most effectively assist. The Minister for Primary Industry will submit a report to the Government on these matters. The Government will also examine all aspects of the setting up and operation of the proposed statutory wool marketing authority. These investigations will be pursued as matters of urgency. </para>
      <para>Provision is made for Commonwealth expenditure of $2.9m in 1970-71 towards costs of handling and brokers&#39; administration charges relating to the price averaging plan that the Australian Wool Marketing Corporation Pty Ltd has now commenced to operate. In addition, the Commonwealth has offered to meet for three years any losses incurred by the Marketing Corporation on resale of wool purchased at the end of a price averaging period. </para>
      <para>The selling of wool by samples, the properties of which would be scientifically measured and made known to buyers before sale, is considered to offer the prospect of substantial economies for the wool growing industry. We have decided to support a programme of research and trials on pre-sale objective measurement of wool. The estimated cost over a period of about 2 years is nearly SI. 5m, of which about $650,000 will be spent in 1970-71. Commonwealth contributions towards the costs of wool promotion and research in 1970-71 are expected to total $29m, compared with $13m in 1969-70; growers&#39; contributions have been reduced, as from 1 August 1970, from 2% to 1% of the value of wool sold. </para>

        <type>miscellaneous</type>
      </debateinfo>
      <para>I turn now to the revenue estimates for 1970-71 and the measures for raising more revenue that I mentioned earlier. </para>
      <para>On the basis of existing rates of taxation it is estimated that receipts in 1970-71 would total $7,922m, an increase of $840m or 11.9%. This estimate is based on the expectation that 1970-71 will see a continued strong rise in incomes and general buoyancy in spending. </para>
      <para>I said at the outset that the Government judged the needs of the economic situation to be such that, overall, we should aim to balance the Budget - indeed to budget for a small surplus. To run significantly into deficit would be to step on the accelerator when the safe speed limit has already been reached. </para>
      <para>Total expenditure in 1970-71 is estimated to be $7,883m. This is $39m less than the estimate of revenue I have just cited. But I have already said that the Government proposes to reduce personal income taxation at an estimated cost to revenue in 1970-71 of $228m. Especially on grounds of equity, we consider a reduction of this magnitude to be justified and we do not think it should any longer be deferred. Obviously, therefore we have to raise additional revenues if a balanced budget, which I have described as the corner-stone of our policy, is to be achieved. </para>
      <para>At this point also I wish to state that the Government will introduce, as part of the Budget, legislation to impose receipts duties, the revenue from which will be for the benefit of the States. The history of these receipts duties is well known to Honourable Members. It should be enough for me to say here that, unless receipts duties are imposed by Commonwealth legislation, there will be a heavy loss of revenue to the States with crippling effects on State Budgets. </para>

          <page.no>17</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>We propose to increase the rates of customs and excise duty on cigarettes and cigars by 50 cents per lb and on manufactured tobacco by 20 cents per lb. It is estimated that these increases in duty will yield $20m in 1970-71 and $31m in a full year. </para>
        <para>Along with tobacco, alcoholic beverages have been a traditional source of revenue both in Australia and in many other countries. In Australia, however, there has been one type of alcoholic beverage which, with a minor exception, has not been subject to excise duty at all. I refer here to wine. Consumption of wine has been rising strongly from year to year and, in the light of this trend the evident profitability of wine production and the heavy taxation levied on other forms of alcoholic beverage, we have decided that a moderate excise duty of SO cents per gallon should be placed on locally produced grape wine and that there should be a corresponding increase of SO cents per gallon in customs duty on imported wine. This is equivalent to a duty of just over 8 cents a bottle. The excise duty will not be levied on small amounts of wine produced by home wine producers&#39; for their own use. Concurrently, we propose to remove the duty on spirit used to fortify wine. It is estimated that these customs and excise duties on wine will yield $ 12.7m in 1970-71 and $15.2m in a full year. The removal of duty on spirit used to fortify wine is expected to reduce revenue by $850,000 in 1970-71 and $lm in a full year. </para>
        <para>Finally, within the customs and excise field, we propose to increase duties on certain petroleum products currently subject to excise duty. Demand for petroleum products has been growing strongly. Moreover, I think it is fair to say that the taxation of such products in Australia is much lighter than in most comparable countries. We propose to increase by 3 cents a gallon the excise and customs duty on motor spirit, automotive distillate used in road vehicles operating on public roads, aviation turbine fuel and aviation gasoline. The yield in 1970-71 is estimated at $63 m and in a full year at $79.6m. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>In 1969-70, company income increased by about 14%. As in the two previous years, this was a faster increase than occurred in total wages and salaries. During 1969-70 also, non-farm business investment increased faster than consumer spending and competed particularly vigorously for available resources. </para>
        <para>The Government appreciates that gains in productivity depend in large measure on business investment and that prospects of good profits have a big part in incentives to investment. Nevertheless, in current circumstances in which investment opportunities abound and profits are generally high, we think it reasonable to levy a higher tax on company profits and thus help to raise revenue to bring the Budget into balance. This will, moreover, spread more widely throughout the community the benefits of the generally profitable outcome of companies&#39; operations. </para>
        <para>Our proposal is to add 2.5 cents in the dollar to the rates on taxable incomes of companies. The general company tax - on all except the first $10,000 of taxable income - would then become 47.5 cents in the dollar for public companies and 42.5 cents for private companies. It is estimated that the proposed increases, which will apply to incomes derived by companies during the income year 1969-70, will add $76m to revenue in 1970-71. </para>
        <para>I might add that the investment income of a superannuation fund that does not invest a sufficient proportion of its assets in public securities is taxed at the same rates as the mutual income of a life insurance company. As the latter rates are being increased by 2.5 cents in the dollar, the rates for a superannuation fund whose investment income is taxed in 1970-71 in this way are being increased by a corresponding amount. </para>

The Postmaster-General will give details in a separate statement. </para>
        <para>To help meet the rising cost of providing marine navigation aids, it is proposed to increase charges to shipping - known as light dues - from 18 cents to 20 cents per net registered ton per quarter.

        <para>The increases in taxation and charges 1 have outlined are expected to yield, in total, $196m in 1970-71 1 now come to personal income taxation. </para>
        <para>On other occasions the Government has expressed its concern at the way in which the present graduated rate scale has shifted a growing share of the weight of taxation on to personal income taxpayers. Between 1960-61 and 1969-70, for example, the proportion of our total revenue collected by way of pay-as-you-earn collections from wage and salary earners increased from 20% to 29%. In his Policy Speech last year, the Prime Minister stated our intention to improve the situation and the Governor-General also referred to this matter in his speech at the opening of Parliament last February. </para>
        <para>With rising incomes the present scale has brought about a relatively rapid increase in personal income taxation. The revenue so obtained was needed to meet our commitments, but there is no doubt that, in the process, inequity has grown into the system. In real terms there have been increases in effective rates of tax at most levels of taxable income, but the increase has not been the same at all levels, and that is the particular source of inequity which concerns us. </para>
        <para>To provide relief on a equitable basis it has been necessary to prepare a new general rate scale. As is at present the case, tax payable will be the sum of the amounts calculated at the general rates and a 2i% levy. Tables will be made available in which tax payable under the new and the old scales is compared at various levels of taxable income. The new rates will apply to 1970-71 incomes and a new scale of tax instalment deductions from wages and salaries will operate from 1 October 1970. </para>
        <para>On taxable incomes up to $10,000 there will be a reduction of some 10% in tax payable. Above $10,000 the percentage reduction in tax will taper off, reaching 4.4% at $20,000 and cutting out altogether at $32,000. </para>
        <para>In deciding on this kind of revision, we have had regard to the way in which the incidence of the effective burden of tax has been altered by past rises in incomes. Effective tax rates have increased more on lower and middle incomes than on higher incomes, and in giving some relief from the effects of the past trends, there is a clear case for ensuring that most of the relief will go to lower and middle income earners. In the result there will be increases in the takehome remuneration in the income ranges where it is most needed. This should serve to strengthen incentives for people in those groups; this is an objective to which we attach great importance. </para>
        <para>For some time past, we have had the whole of our taxation system under close review, lt became quite apparent at an early stage of that review that we should give first priority to relieving the burden of income tax on the middle and lower income groups. Now that we have honoured our promise to do this, we shall be looking in more detail at other aspects of our taxation system. </para>

      <para>We propose to increase the relief given through the income tax age allowance to residents of Australia who are of qualifying age, that is, sixty-five years for men and sixty for women. At present no tax is payable by an aged person whose taxable income does not exceed $1,300 or by a married aged person unless the combined taxable income of husband and wife exceeds $2,262. In line with the proposed increase in maximum pension rates, these exemption levels will be raised to $1,326 and $2,314 respectively. Some further relief will also be given by adjustments to the &#39;shading-in&#39; arrangements which limit the tax payable by an aged person with a taxable income somewhat greater than the exemption level. The changes in the age allowance are estimated to cost $2m in 1970-71 and $3m in a full year. </para>

        <title>THE BUDGET AND THE ECONOMY</title>
        <page.no>19</page.no>
        <type>miscellaneous</type>
      </debateinfo>
      <para>Let me now sum up the Budget. After bringing to account the changes in taxation and charges I have described, total receipts in 1970-71 are estimated to be $7,887m, or 11.4% more than last year. Since total expenditure is estimated at $7,883m the Budget shows a surplus of $4m. </para>
      <para>Within this overall result there would, on present figuring, be a surplus of domestic receipts over domestic expenditure of the order of $550m which would be about $50m greater than the actual domestic surplus in 1969-70. lt is of course not possible, at this early stage of the financial year, to predict with certainty and precision what the ruling trends and events will be through the months ahead. We know something of the forces now at work in the economy and can form judgments as to their future strength and duration. But other forces and tendencies not now evident are bound to emerge and assert themselves in one direction or another as time goes on. For these reasons it would be rash to claim that the Budget will prove to be exactly suited to the requirements of the Australian economy through 1970-71. In any case, strong and pervasive though its effects can be, the Commonwealth Budget does not determine the whole course of our economic affairs. A multitude of initiatives and decisions on the part of others have a share in that. In particular, excessive demands for increases in money wages and other incomes - especially when pushed ruthlessly in conditions of full employment - could jeopardise prospects of balance growth. There is a need for responsibility and realism on the part of all in the community here; the problem of containing costpush inflationary pressures is a large one confronting all Western economics and it cannot be tackled effectively if there is not a general will to do so. Certainly, no Budget framed consistently with a full employment policy can do the whole joh. </para>
      <para>That being said, however, in the light of our present knowledge we have formed the view I have described earlier as to prospects for the year and have shaped our budgetary scheme accordingly. In general, we see the probability of further strong growth, the one exception to this being the rural sector where highly adverse conditions could to some extent offset the rise in both output and demand which is likely to occur elsewhere. There has been some check in recent months to the over-expansive conditions of the preceding period. We do not want those conditions to return - as they undoubtedly could in the absence of restraint. </para>
      <para>Whilst, therefore, we are in no sense trying, through the Budget, to slow down the rate of growth, we are seeking to ensure that the Budget will not add impetus to demand in general. We do not think it will. Domestic outlays have been kept to much the same rate of increase as last year while the net effect on demand of the taxation changes will not be significant. Moreover, we calculate that the domestic surplus for which it provides will work against the development of excessive liquidity. Perhaps 1 could put it we have sought to make this a precautionary Budget but not a repressive one. </para>

      <para>Implicit in these financial proposals is a belief that we now have a unique opportunity in Australia to promote not only strong growth but continuous growth, varied, rich and self-enhancing growth. It must be the highest aim of economic policy to preserve and develop that opportunity. In introducing a balanced Budget we have kept firmly in mind the need to help create conditions under which sound economic growth may proceed. </para>
      <para>In this Budget we have sought to assess the needs of the nation as a whole. In doing so, we have made provisions which secure to the State Governments a larger and growing share of our gross national product. At the same time this Budget helps to achieve other great national objectives in important areas such as defence, social welfare and the economic welfare of industry - including our great wool growing industry that is currently beset by special problems. </para>
      <para>Finally, we have made a great effort in this Budget to provide substantial income tax relief to those in the lower and middle income groups. In doing so we have been concerned both to relieve the inequity which had developed and to stimulate initiative, thus promoting conditions which are significant also for our future economic growth. The opportunities are there if we all accept our responsibilties as members of this society. </para>
      <para>I commend the Budget to honourable members. </para>

      <para>The Budget estimates for 1970-71, in &#39;conventional&#39; terms provide for: -  an increase of $795 million, or 11.2 per cent, in Commonwealth expenditures, following an increase of $519 million, or 7.9 per cent, in 1969-70;  an increase of $806 million, or 11.4 per cent, in Commonwealth receipts, after allowing for new revenue measures announced in the Budget Speech, which are estimated to reduce receipts by a net $34 million in 1970-71. In 1969-70 Commonwealth receipts increased by $897 million, or 14.5 per cent, and that increase included the effects of measures announced in the Budget Speech for 1969-70 which were estimated to reduce receipts by a net$14 million in that year; and </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The Budget for 1970-71 has been prepared in the expectation that consumer and private business spending will continue to increase strongly in 1970-71. It is expected that gross national product at constant prices will increase at about the same rate in 1970-71 as in 1969-70. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In 1969-70 gross national product at constant prices increased by 5.5 per cent. There was continued very vigorous expansion in the gross product of the non-farm sector, but a setback in the rural sector was a retarding factor in the overall growth of the economy.

Average employment in 1970-71 is expected to increase by a little more than 3 per cent; the rise in non-farm productivity is expected to be a little less than 3 per cent. As usual, considerable uncertainty attaches to the likely course of farm output but this forecast takes account of the recent deterioration in seasonal conditions. The forecast increase in gross national product is in line with the strengthened underlying rate of growth evident in the economy in recent years. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Demand seems set to rise strongly in 1970-71. In the light of recent and prospective trends in personal disposable income, consumer spending seems likely to continue buoyant in the year ahead. Gross private fixed investment on plant and equipment and on nonresidential building and construction is expected to continue to rise strongly. Gross private fixed investment in dwellings is expected to reverse its recent easing tendency as the current half-year goes on. The financial position of the State sector will facilitate a very substantial lift in its current and capital expenditures. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In recent years the rate of increase in average weekly earnings has accelerated from year to year; it has been assumed, however, that in the current year the rate of increase will be less than in 1969-70. Nonetheless, the rate of increase assumed for the purpose of setting down a figure for pay-as-you-earn tax collections (7 per cent) is a very high one reflecting, in part, the high level <inline font-style="italic">already</inline> attained by average weekly earnings in relation to their average level in 1969-70. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Increases in Budget expenditures, including payments to the States and provisions for additional benefits and services in the various fields referred to in the Budget Speech, will contribute substantially to the growth of demand and activity within the economy. The reduction in personal income taxation will also add to capacity to spend within the economy. In the light of prospective trends in public and private spending and after taking account of the proposed increases in Commonwealth expenditures and reduction in personal income taxation, excessive pressures on resources could be expected if a sufficient degree of counteraction to the expansionary effects of those Budget provisions was not taken. Accordingly, a range of taxation increases is provided for in the Budget to produce a small Budget surplus. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">The estimates for 1970-71 include provision for the new expenditure proposals announced in the Budget Speech. These new measures account for about $70 million of the estimated increase in expenditure of $795 million in 1970-71. Of the balance, about $300 million arises from the full-year effects of measures announced in the 1969-70 Budget and new commitments entered into during 1969-70. Among the items in this latter class are the new financial assistance arrangements entered into with the States; the increase in State works and housing programmes and the associated introduction of capital grants to the States; the new medical benefits plan; and the establishment of the Australian Industry Development Corporation. The balance of the increase in expenditure, over $400 million, arises from commitments previously entered into by the Commonwealth. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The main elements in the estimated increase in expenditures in 1970-71 and in the actual increase in 1969-70 are as follows: - </para>

        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The main feature of the expenditure estimates is the very large prospective increase in payments to or for the States and works and housing programmes, which are estimated to increase by $291 million, or over 12 per cent in 1970-71. These items together represent 34.4 per cent of Commonwealth expenditure - that is , about a third of the Commonwealth Budget. A major factor contributing to the large estimated increase in these expenditures in 1970-71 is the revision to the financial arrangements with the States and the increase in Loan Council borrowing programmes agreed to with the States. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The payment to the National Welfare Fund and expenditure on repatriation services is another large group of expenditures accounting for 22.7 per cent of total Commonwealth expenditures. They are estimated to total $1,786 million in 1970-71, an increase of $148 million, or 9 per cent. Measures announced in the Budget Speech are estimated to account for $29 million of this increase, the new medical benefits plan, which was announced during 1969- 70, for $35 million and the full-year effects of measures announced in the 1969-70 Budget for a further $30 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The increase in expenditure on defence services is estimated to amount to $34 million, or 3.1 per cent, bringing total expenditure in this field to $1,137 million in 1970-71. Expenditure on defence services is estimated to amount to 14.4 per cent of total Commonwealth expenditure in 1970-71. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Commonwealth payments to industry are estimated to increase by $81 million, or 42.3 per cent. The proposal announced in the Budget Speech to provide emergency assistance to wool growers is estimated to cost $30 million in 1970-71, increased assistance to the dairy industry announced during 1969-70 is estimated to cost an additional net $11 million in 1970- 71 and it is estimated that a payment of $31 million will be made to the Wheat Industry Stabilisation Fund in respect of the 1968-69 wheat crop. Further information on Commonwealth payments to industry is set out in Statement No. 9. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Advances for capital purposes are estimated to increase by $78 million, or 21.3 per cent, to $443 million. Advances to the Australian National Airlines Commission and to Qantas Airways Limited, mainly for expenditure on aircraft, are estimated to increase by $52 million. Provision has been made for an initial contribution of 125 million towards the capital of the Australian Industry Development Corporation. The amount to be advanced to the Post Office is estimated to rise by $7 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Further details of the 1970-71 estimates of expenditure are given in Statement No. 2. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Before taking into account the proposed revenue measures, total Commonwealth receipts are estimated to increase by $840 million, or 11 .9 per cent, to $7,922 million in 1970-71. Though this estimated increase is smaller than the increase in Commonwealth receipts in 1969-70- actual receipts rose by $897 million, or 14.5 per cent, in 1969-70- it is a high rate of increase by comparison with most previous years.

The reduction of $2,745,000 in expenditure on accommodation and technical facilities is mainly on account of the approaching completion of construction of facilities for the Joint Defence Space Research Facility near Alice Springs. </para>

          <inline font-style="italic">Customs Duty.</inline>On the basis of existing legislation, collections of customs duty are estimated to increase by $45,513,000 in 1970-71 to $460,000,000. This estimate allows for a further increase in recorded imports in 1970-71, though less rapid than that which occurred in 1969-70, and for some increase in the proportion of imports dutiable at higher rates. After allowing for the effects of the measures announced in the Budget Speech, it is estimated that collections will increase by $48,313,000 to $462,800,000 in 1970-71. </para>

On the basis of existing legislation, excise collections are estimated to increase by $48,288,000 or 5.1 percent, following an increase of $38,698,000 or 4.3 per cent in 1969-70. After allowing for the effects of the measures announced in the Budget Speech, it is estimated that collections will increase by $140,288,000 to $1,080,000,000 io 1970-71.

On the basis of existing legislation, sales tax collections are estimated to increase by $54,641,000, or about 9.6 per cent, to $622,000,000.

In 1969-70 average weekly earnings increased by about 8 per cent and the average number of employees in terms of &#39;male units&#39; by slightly more than 3.5 per cent. For the purpose of setting down a figure for pay as you earn collections, an increase of 7 per cent in average earnings has been assumed for 1970-71. This assumption, which takes account of the rise in average weekly earnings which has already occurred, does not imply that the trend in earnings from this point of time can be forecast with any reliability. Nor does its use imply that it is a Budget objective. The increase in the average number of employees assumed for 1970-71, 3.5 per cent, is about the same as occurred in 1969-70. Refunds of tax instalment deductions are estimated to increase by $69,546,000. so that at existing rates of taxation, net pay-as-you-earn collections are estimated to increase by $371,781,000 to $2,456,000,000. </para>

Income, other than wages and salaries, in 1969-70, which is subject to tax in 1970-71, is estimated to have been only slightly greater than in 1968-69 largely because of an estimated decline of about 22 per cent in the incomes of primary producers in 1969-70.

After allowing for pay-roll tax rebates under the export incentive scheme, which are estimated to increase by $8,418,000 to $42,000,000, net pay-roll tax collections are estimated to increase by $21,531,000 to $252,000,000 in 1970-71. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">For the financial year 1969-70 as a whole, the Commonwealth&#39;s domestic transactions appear to have subtracted about $500 million from liquidity. There was also a comparatively modest increase in Rural Credits advances (before allowing for the Commonwealth&#39;s funding of an .advance to the Wheat Board) and a substantial private sector balance of payments surplus, both of which added to liquidity. These factors, together with some other minor elements, produced a much smaller than usual increase in &#39;primary liquidity&#39;(a). The effects on the money supply were offset in part by a relatively strong increase in bank advances and a lower than usual level of net purchases of Commonwealth securities by the non-bank public. The net result was that the money supply increased at the comparatively slow rate of about 6.2 per cent. Percentage increases in the money supply over the last five years have been as follows: </para>

        </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Although the moderate rate of increase in the money supply in 1969-70 was partly attributable to the Commonwealth&#39;s domestic surplus, other policy measures reinforced the effects of that surplus. There was a two-stage Statutory Reserve Deposit call-up early in the year and during the period of seasonal tightness later in the year the higher Statutory Reserve Deposit ratio was maintained. The resultant pressures on bank liquidity, supplemented by higher interest rates on bank advances, influenced the rate of increase in bank advances. The increase in interest rates on Commonwealth securities had the effect of discouraging holders from selling their securities directly or indirectly to the Reserve Bank during the seasonal downswing in liquidity. But for these factors, there would have been a considerably larger increase in the money supply. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In 1 969-70 there was an accentuated seasonal swing in the Commonwealth&#39;s domestic financial transactions. In the first half of the year, there was a domestic deficit of over $700 million which <inline font-style="italic">added</inline> to liquidity. However, because of a net deficit in the private sector balance of payments and net repayments of Rural Credits advances for the period, there was a comparatively small build-up in liquidity for the economy as a whole. Partly as a result of the high level of their advances and of the Statutory Reserve Deposit call-up in the first half of 1969-70, the L.G.S. ratios of the trading banks at the end of this phase were low by comparison with previous years, and this limited the extent to which they were able to meet the increased demands for advances in the latter months of the year. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In the latter half of the year, mainly in the June- quarter, there was a Commonwealth domestic surplus sufficient to offset the domestic deficit of the first half of the year and to produce an overall domestic surplus of about $500 million for the year as a whole. Although there was a marked improvement in the private sector balance of payments position, the money supply declined by about $270 million in the June quarter. Increases in interest rates on Commonwealth securities and the increases in bank interest rates associated with high demand for money complemented the seasonal swing in Commonwealth domestic transactions and produced some monetary restraint on the economy. </para>

          <inline font-style="italic">Financing Transactions</inline>lt is estimated that Commonwealth receipts will slightly exceed Commonwealth expenditures in 1970-71. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Drawings under the credit arrangements for the purchase of defence equipment in the United States of America are estimated to be $78 million while repayments are estimated to be $59 million. Drawings on overseas loans to finance advances to Qantas Airways Limited and the Australian National Airlines Commission are estimated at $63 million, while repayments of previous loans for the airlines will be approximately $28 million. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In the present state of international capital markets, it is not possible to make a reliable estimate of new borrowings overseas for purposes other than defence and aircraft. Maturities falling due and other payments to reduce indebtedness overseas are likely to amount to about $93 million in 1970-71 compared with $160 million in 1969-70. Despite this reduction in commitments, it seems likely that there will again be net repayments overseas, although they will be less than in 1969-70. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Under the <inline font-style="italic">International Monetary Agreements Act 1970,</inline> Australia will subscribe about $147 million to the International Monetary Fund in 1970-71 to meet an equivalent increase in its quota at the Fund. Finance will have to be provided for one-quarter of this subscription, about $38 million, which will be payable in gold, while the remainder is payable in non-negotiable, non-interest bearing notes. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Net loan proceeds and the change in the Treasury Note issue in Australia cannot be estimated in advance with any degree of assurance. The value of securities due to mature during 1970-71 held in non-official hands is estimated at $774 million, compared with $486 million of securities in non-official hands which matured in 1969-70, but it is difficult to estimate the extent to which these securities will be redeemed rather than converted. It is also not possible accurately to predict what changes will occur in holdings of Commonwealth securities by the public, on the one hand, and by the banking system, on the other. These will reflect monetary and other developments during the course of the year. However, on the basis of the interest rates currently being offered on Commonwealth securities and with the prospect of a build-up in liquidity in the first half of the year, a significant increase in sales of securities can be expected. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Loan Bill.</inline>Because of the difficulty of estimating the net amounts available from loanraising operations in Australia and overseas there remains, in each year, the possibility that some borrowing from the Reserve Bank may be necessary to complete the Commonwealth&#39;s financing transactions. Accordingly, authority will be sought in a Loan Bill to borrow for defence purposes such amounts as are necessary to complete the Commonwealth&#39;s financing transactions. The Loan Bill will also seek authority to expend the proceeds on any borrowings made under it on Defence Services. The effect of charging expenditure on Defence Services to Loan Fund is to increase the amount paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve. </para>

        <para pgwide="yes">It appears that the Commonwealth&#39;s domestic surplus for 1970-71 as a whole will be about $50 million greater than in 1969-70. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">By contrast with the first half of 1969-70, the indications are that there will be a private sector balance of payments surplus in the first half of 1970-71 and a moderate increase in Rural Credits advances - each of these elements showed a small decline in the first half of 1969-70. There will also be a large Commonwealth domestic deficit in this period. As a result, there will almost certainly have been a relatively large build-up in liquidity by the end of the first half of 1970-71. Against this, a substantial increase in holdings of securities by the non-bank public is likely to occur in this period. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The Commonwealth&#39;s domestic financial transactions will again draw in funds in the latter half of the year, but, at this stage, there are too many uncertainties to attempt to forecast what the monetary situation will be then. Given, however, the prospective large build-up in liquidity in the first half of the year, the possibility of acute monetary stringency would seem to be less than in 1969-70. </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">The estimated increase of $802 million in total outlay in 1970-71 is $247 million greater than the actual increase of $555 million in 1969-70.

      <para pgwide="yes">The effects on the economy of particular classes of outlays and receipts, within these totals, differ significantly one from another. The more important distinctions for purposes of assessing the implications of the Commonwealth&#39;s transactions for demand and incomes within Australia and for the balance of payments are considered in the following sections. &#187;&#39;) A Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin entitled &#39;National Accounting Estimates of Public Authority Receipts and Expenditure&#39;. being published concurrently with the Budget, provides corresponding data for Commonwealth authorities outside the Budget and additional information on various aspects <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> the national accounting presentation employed in this Statement. </para>

        <inline font-style="italic">Payments in Australia and overseas</inline>
      </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">On the outlay side of the Budget there is an important distinction between payments made within Australia and payments made overseas. The immediate effects of overseas outlays are on the balance of payments(1); such outlays must therefore be deducted from total outlay as a step in the process of assessing the impact of the Budget on the domestic economy in the year immediately ahead. This is done in the following table: </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The table shows that a considerable part of the greater increase in total outlay this year is attributable to the trend in the overseas component. Following a decrease of $83 million in 1969-70, overseas outlays are estimated to increase by $52 <inline font-style="italic">million</inline> in the current year(2). </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">After deducting overseas outlay the estimated increase in domestic outlay is $750 million compared with an actual increase of $638 million in 1969-70. This represents an estimated increase of 1 1 .4 per cent this year, compared with an actual increase of (0. 7 per cent in 1969-70. The increase in Budget outlays within Australia is estimated to be greater in 1970-71 than in 1969-70, but it is smaller than the concurrent increase in receipts. The implications of the domestic surplus for liquidity conditions are discussed in Statement No. 4. </para>

        <inline font-style="italic">Composition of domestic outlay</inline>
      </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Within the domestic component of outlay there is a further basic distinction to be made between expenditure on goods and services, and transfers and advances from the Budget. Expenditure on goods and services adds <inline font-style="italic">directly</inline> to demand within the economy (gross national expenditure), while the impact on demand of transfers and advances depends on their effects on the spending of the recipients^).  (&#39;) Such payments do not add to domestic incomes and the demand for locally-produced goods and services. Payments within Australia may add <inline font-style="italic">indirectly</inline> to overseas rather than Australian incomes, because orders met by local suppliers may include an import content Although it is not possible to make reliable estimates of the import content of Commonwealth expenditure within Australia, the proportion would not be large, and it may be assumed that it is unlikely to change markedly between one year and lbc neil. By contrast, direct payments overseas by the Commonwealth may fluctuate widely between one year and another (*) The main overseas components are shown separately in Table 2 on page. 9 of the Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin, entitled &#39;National Accounting Estimates of Public Authority Receipts and Expenditure&#39;, being published concurrently, with the Budget.  (*) Whether payments from the Commonwealth Budget are themselves a source of demand for domestic resources, or add to demand indirectly by transferring purchasing power to other public authorities or the private sector, the initial impact of Budget outlays on expenditure can bc expected to induce further increases which are financed out of the incomes earned in meeting the initial change in demand. As the <inline font-style="italic">relative</inline> sizes of the total increase in demand in two successive years would depend largely on the relative sizes of the initial increases which supported them, these &#39;multiplier* effects are not considered explicitly in the discussion which follows. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The following table compares, for each main component of domestic outlay, the estimated increase in 1970-71 with the actual increase in 1969-70. </para>

      </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The estimated percentage increase in domestic, expenditure on goods and services is greater than in 1969-70. This is true also of two of the main components distinguished in the table - war and defence, and capital expenditure; the estimated percentage increase in other current expenditure, on the other hand, is expected to be marginally less than in 1969-70. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Although a rather larger increase than in 1969-70 is expected in domestic transfer payments and net advances, the estimated percentage increase in the total for this category is almost the same in both years. As noted above, the impact of these payments on demand and incomes depends on their effects on the spending of the recipients. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Grants and advances to the States are estimated to rise by 12.5 per cent in 1970-71, compared with 11 .9 per cent in 1969-70. The larger rise in these payments in 1970-71 will increase the funds available to finance the expenditures of the States and their authorities, which are predominantly expenditures on goods and services. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Cash benefits to persons are estimated to increase by 9.2 per cent in 1970-71 compared with 13.7 per cent in 1969-70. For the purpose of judging the influence of such payments on <inline font-style="italic">rates</inline> of income or expenditure <inline font-style="italic">within</inline> a year, these increases should be adjusted to remove the effects of variations in the incidence of pay-days and to allow for the &#39;full-year&#39; effects of changes in rates of benefit^). After these adjustments, the estimated increase in cash benefits in 1970-71 is 9.5 per cent compared with 12.7 per cent in 1969-70. These payments would largely be spent by the recipients on goods and services. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The smaller increase in the advance to the Post Office results from a larger increase in capital expenditure on goods and services^ being more than offset by a prospective increase in internal resources associated with the increased charges for postal and telephone services. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The larger estimated increase of $120 million in other transfer payments and net advances in 1970-71 compared with the increase of $42 million in 1969-70 is mainly attributable to expected payments of $31 million under the wheat industry stabilisation scheme and $30 million in emergency assistance to wool-growers in the current year. (&#39;) A table snowing bow this adjustment is derived appears on page 10 of the Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin being published concurrently with the Budget.

          <page.no>63</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para pgwide="yes">As on the expenditure side of the Budget, there are differences in the significance which different classes of receipts may have for prospective trends in the economy. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The distinction drawn on the outlay side between transactions within Australia and transactions overseas does not have the same practical importance here. With relatively few exceptions, the budget receipts are derived from within Australia. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Another distinction is between movements in receipts which are expected to emerge as by-products of evolving trends in incomes and spending in the economy and those which are consequential on changes in rates of taxation or other charges. Any estimated rise in receipts of the former class will reflect expected increases in incomes and spending and cannot therefore be regarded as an independent factor capable of varying those expectations. The second class of movements in receipts can be regarded as a source of influence on evolving trends(1) </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">It is not, in practice, easy to classify all increases in receipts in this way. For the most part, movements which would be expected in gross collections of P.A.Y.E. instalment deductions, indirect taxes and the income of public enterprises, at existing rates and charges, fall within the former class. But the position as regards movements in taxation collections at existing rates from individuals subject to provisional tax and from companies can be somewhat blurred; it depends on past trends in income and on the spending and saving habits of various classes of taxpayers. As mentioned above, the second class of movements in receipts is most clearly exemplified by new revenue measures which involve changes in rates of taxation or in other charges. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In 1970-71 there is a large increase in estimated receipts which is expected to be induced by the prospective growth in expenditure and incomes in the economy. However, the main factor on the receipts side, as regards the economic influence of the Budget, is in the changes in taxation rates for which provision has been made this year. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The reduction in personal income taxation rates at a full-year cost to revenue of $292 million will, in itself, add to spending. However, there are expected to be lags between the increase in disposable income and the changes in spending it induces; thus there will be some increase in short-term saving and, possibly, a longer-term lift in saving. There will also be lags before the disposable income of persons subject to provisional tax reflects the effects of the new tax provisions. But certainly a sizeable part of the $292 million will go to add to demand in the year ahead </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The changes in excise and customs duty and sales tax - estimated to add $134 million to revenue in a full year - can be expected to have a near commensurate effect on purchasing power and hence demand. In terms of influencing the trend in demand, changes in indirect taxes of these sorts have a more immediate effect than changes in other forms of taxation. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">The increase in rates of company tax, estimated to yield $81 million in a full year will, other things being equal, reduce the funds available to companies for investment and distribution to shareholders; however, the actual effects on spending and in particular the timing of those effects depend on a variety of circumstances including the ability of companies to compete for alternative sources of funds or to &#39; pass on &#39; the increased tax rates in the form of higher prices. Eventually, the increased revenue collected by the Commonwealth (&#39;) Both classes of movements m receipts will, of course, be reflected in the expected overall Budget outcome. Il might be noted that revenue estimates may sometimes reflect prospective trends in some particular areas of activity which are not the most desirable from the point of view of economic balance and reasonable price stability but which cannot, in practice, be corrected fully or quickly enough by fiscal or monetary means. An example relevant to the revenue estimates for 1970-71 is the very large increase which has been assumed in average earnings. Should average earnings rise less than assumed, taxation revenue would be less than estimated and a budget deficit would emerge (although the extent of such a deficit would not reflect the full extent of the shortfall in receipts, because some components of expenditure - for example, financial assistance grants to the States - could also be lower than estimated if average earnings rose more slowly than assumed). It would not follow, however, that the Budget objective of maintaining an environment conducive to balanced economic growth would be adversely affected by such a development; on the contrary, such a result would be more likely to serve the broad economic purposes to which budget policy is directed. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">A somewhat similar observation can be made about any movement in receipts which emerges as a consequence of developments in the economy which were not foreseen at the time the Budget was framed. For example, if an increase in receipts were to result, say, from an unforeseen rise in wages, it would be misleading to say (hat. because of thai increase in receipts, the Budget bad exercised a more restraining influence than originally envisaged. as a result of the increased tax rates will be at the expense of alternative uses of the funds concerned but the chain of causation is much more complex than in the case, say, of indirect tax increases. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">In summary, then, changed taxation rates will lead, in 1970-71, to an increase in indirect tax collections at an annual rate of $154 million with a quick consequential effect on spending; to a reduction in personal income taxation in a full year of $292 million with a slower and less complete effect on spending; and to an increase in company taxation of $81 million, with a fairly indirect and possibly slow effect on spending. The net effect of all these changed taxation provisions on aggregate spending in 1970-71 is likely to be very small. </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">Tables 1 and 2 on pages 52 and 53 show Commonwealth expenditures and receipts and financing transactions since 1960-61 in &#39;conventional&#39; terms. Subject to the qualifications outlined later in this Statement, the figures arc broadly consistent with the figures for 1969-70 and the estimates for 1970-71 set out in Statements No. I to 5. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Table 3 on pages 54 and 55 shows figures for each year since 1960-61 in national accounting form. In this form, transfers between different parts of the Commonwealth&#39;s accounts are eliminated so that the figures shown relate to the transactions which occur between the Commonwealth Government and the rest of the economy or overseas. These transactions are classified into economically significant categories, corresponding with those for which similar information is provided, in respect of past years, for the entire economy in the White Paper on National Income and Expenditure. The figures contained in this table are comparable with those set out in Statement No: 6. Notes on the composition of the figures are set out later in this Statement. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">In each of the past years covered by the tables there was a Budget deficit. However, the size of the deficit varied from a peak of $642 million in 1967-68 to comparatively small deficits at the beginning and the end of the period - there was a deficit of $32 million in 1960-61 and a deficit of $7 million in 1969-70. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Total expenditures increased by 120 per cent to $7,088 million between 1960-61 and 1969-70. The larger items of expenditure, defence services, payments to or for the States and Works and Housing programmes and the payment to the National Welfare Fund, increased, respectively, by 175 per cent, 105 per cent and 103 per cent. The most rapid increases were 323 per cent in Commonwealth payments to industry, 257 per cent in expenditure on territories (excluding Papua and New Guinea), 21 6 per cent in departmental running expenses and 204 per cent in expenditure on external economic aid (including Papua and New Guinea). </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Total receipts increased by 122 per cent to $7,08) million between 1960-61 and 1969 -70. The main factor contributing to this increase was a rise of 224 per cent in net pay-as-you-earn collections of income tax on wage and salary incomes. In 1960-61 these collections accounted for 20 per cent of total receipts; in 1969-70 they accounted for close to 30 per cent. Other income tax collections from individuals rose by 96 per cent and income tax collections from companies by 104 per cent in this period. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">A feature of the financing transactions for the period as a whole is that the $402 million of Treasury Bills outstanding at 1 July 1960 were redeemed by 30 June 1970! Of these redemptions, $255 million is accounted for by funding operations in 1964-65 and 1966-67 in which Treasury Bills held by the Reserve Bank were converted to longer term securities. The balance is accounted for by the net excess of loan raisings and other financing transactions over Commonwealth deficits in the period. Though the Commonwealth&#39;s indebtedness to the Reserve Bank represented by Treasury Bills declined by over $400 million, its indebtedness represented by other securities held by the Reserve Bank rose by about $650 million in this period. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Over the period 1960-61 to 1969-70 Commonwealth Budget outlays increased as a proportion of Gross National Expenditure, rising from 21.4 per cent in 1960-61 to 23.6 per cent in 1969-70. The composition of Commonwealth Budget outlays in 1960-61 and 1969-70 is shown in the following table. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The main feature of these figures is the strong growth in Commonwealth outlays on goods and services which, since 1960-61, have increased almost twice as rapidly as Gross National Expenditure. Transfer payments and net advances grew faster than Gross National Expenditure over the period, though at a slower rate than outlays on goods and services. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The composition of Commonwealth receipts, in national accounting terms, in 1960-61 and 1969-70 is shown in the following table. </para>

        <page.no>74</page.no>
        <type>miscellaneous</type>
      </debateinfo>
      <para pgwide="yes">It is not possible to calculate precisely the total amount of financial assistance which Australia provides to developing countries, including Papua and New Guinea, by way of aid from the Commonwealth Budget each year. There is also scope for differences of opinion about what constitutes &#39;aid&#39;. Nevertheless, it can be said that, all told, the Commonwealth Government will provide well over $200 million for aid of one kind or another to developing countries, including Papua and New Guinea, in 1970-71. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The table below lists various items of expenditure which can be fairly readily identified as economic (i.e. non-military) aid to developing countries: </para>
      <quote>
        <para pgwide="yes">The totals shown in this table differ from those quoted in Statement No. 2 - Estimates of Expenditures, 1970-71 by virtue of the inclusion of direct expenditures of an economic nature by various Commonwealth Departments and instrumentalities in. or in connection with, Papua and New Guinea which are classified under other headings in the Budget. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">On this basis, official economic assistance to developing countries, including Papua and New Guinea, is estimated to total 8183,996,000 in 1970-71. This is 818,270,000, or 11 per cent, greater than actual expenditure in 1969-70. The estimates provide for an increase of $7,054,000, or 13.9 per cent, in expenditure on multilateral and bilateral programmes, excluding Papua and New Guinea, in 1970-71. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">It should be emphasised, however, that no allowance has been made in this figuring for the large subventions which the Commonwealth and State Governments provide each year for various educational institutions in Australia which are attended by several thousands of private and officially-sponsored overseas students, most of whom come from developing countries. The imputed costs involved in this indirect aid &#39;subsidy&#39; are believed to exceed $10 million per annum. Moreover, the foregoing figures do not allow for the fact that parts of Australia&#39;s contributions to the regular budgets of a number of international organisations not listed in the above table are used to finance aid projects in developing countries. The annual amount involved is currently estimated to exceed $600,000. Similarly, some official institutions (e.g. the Reserve Bank) which are not financed from the Commonwealth Budget provide aid to developing countries, especially Papua and New Guinea. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Over and above this, Australia is providing substantial amounts of defence aid to certain developing countries in Asia, not counting expenditures directly associated with the presence of Australian forces in those countries. In 1970-71, for example, military and para-military aid to Malaysia and Singapore is estimated to total $5,500,000. In addition, $3,304,000 has been provided for a new defence aid programme for South Vietnam in 1970-71. Considerable amounts are also being expended on the Pacific Islands Regiment in Papua and New Guinea. To the extent that this defence aid releases domestic resources which would otherwise be used for the same purposes, it may indirectly help to promote the economic development of the countries concerned. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Some brief comments follow on the more important items shown in the above table: </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">International Development Association.</inline>Australia has pledged a total of $57,125,000 ($US63,980,000) to IDA since its inception in 1960, comprising an initial capital subscription of $US20,180,000 and successive contributions of $US19,8O0,0O0 and $US24 million to help replenish the Association&#39;s resources. The function of IDA, which is an affiliate of the World Bank, is to provide long-term, interest-free loans to finance high priority development projects in poorer member countries which have a limited capacity to service overseas borrowings on commercial terms. Negotiations for a third replenishment exercise have recently been concluded, as a result of which the Commonwealth Government has agreed that, subject to the approval of Parliament, Australia will make available a further SUS48 million to IDA over the next three financial years, 1971-72 to 1973-74. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">Contributions to IDA are initially made available in the form of non-negotiable noninterestbearing promissory notes which are encashed as and when funds are actually required. In the nature of things, there is a lag between commitments and disbursements by IDA. To the end of June 1970, actual cash payments to IDA totalled $32,753,000. It is expected that Australia will be called upon to pay $3,320,000 to the Association in 1970-71, compared with $2,820,000 last year. </para>
        <para pgwide="yes">
          <inline font-style="italic">Asian Development Bank.</inline>Australia has agreed to subscribe $75,893,000 ($US85 million) to the capital stock of the Asian Development Bank, one-half of which is to remain at call as security for borrowings by the Bank on international capital markets to finance its own lending operations. The balance is payable in five equal annual instalments, half in convertible currency and half in domestic currency: use of the latter has been tied to the procurement of goods and services from Australia. Provision has been made in the Budget for the fifth and final instalment ($3,795,000) of the convertible currency portion of Australia&#39;s capital subscription to be paid in 1970-71. The corresponding domestic currency portion will, as usual, be paid in the form of a non-negotiable non-interest-bearing promissory note which will be encashed as and when the Bank requires funds to purchase goods and services from Australia for use in its normal lending operations. </para>
      </quote>
      <para pgwide="yes">At the Third Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors of the Asian Development Bank in Seoul last April, it was announced that, subject to the approval of Parliament, Australia would make available the equivalent of SUS10 million to Special Funds of the Bank over this and the next two financial years to help finance loans on concessional terms to developing member countries. Provision has been made in the Budget for expenditure of SI million against this contribution in 1970-71. Details are now being worked out with the Management of the Bank. Enabling legislation will be introduced in Parliament in the near future. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">
        <inline font-style="italic">Other Multilateral Programmes.</inline>The increase in the estimate for the UN Development Programme provides for the full-year effects of the decision to increase Australia&#39;s annual contribution from $US 1,45 1,000 to $US2 million in 1970. The higher estimate for the World Food Programme allows for freight and insurance costs to be paid on a shipment of 10,000 tons of wheat which Australia has agreed to channel through the World Food Programme as part of its food aid commitment under the International Grains Arrangement in 1970-71. (Normally, such gifts of wheat and flour are provided on a f.o.b. basis.) The increased estimates for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the United Nations Children&#39;s Fund provide for a change in the form and timing of payments in respect of calendar year 1971 : the basic contributions to these organisations remain the same as they were in 1969-70. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">
        <inline font-style="italic">Colombo Plan.</inline>This is by far Australia&#39;s largest bilateral aid programme. It covers- a wide range of activities, including the training of overseas students and officials in many different subjects in educational institutions, government services and private industry in Australia as well as the assignment of Australian experts in various fields to work and teach in developing countries overseas. It also embraces the provision of heavy machinery and equipment for large construction projects (for example, highways, bridges, dams and town water supplies) undertaken in collaboration with foreign governments. In addition, it includes the installation of radio telecommunication systems, assistance in the rehabilitation of telephone and railway networks, and gifts of such diverse items as trucks, buses, landovers, irrigation and farm equipment, railway wagons and sleepers, dredges, pumps, hospital and broadcasting equipment, wool, bakery equipment, and lathes and teaching aids for vocational training institutes. Various other commodities and manufactured goods have been given to developing countries under the Colombo Plan in the past. Further details of the present programme are given in various official publications of the Department of External Affairs. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The total provision for the Colombo Plan in 1970-71, at $26,397,000, is $3,330,000, or 14.4 per cent, greater than actual expenditure in 1969-70. Most of this increase relates to Indonesia and South Vietnam, although there are, of course, variations in the allocations for other countries as a result of the completion of old projects and the commencement of new ones, etc. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Australia has undertaken to provide the equivalent of $US60 million ($53,570,000) in bilateral aid to Indonesia over this and the next two financial years. The amount to be provided in 1970-71 is $17 million, compared with expenditure of $14,637,000 in 1969-70. This will be financed from various votes under the Colombo Plan and also from the provision for Australia&#39;s food aid commitment under the International Grains Arrangement. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The total amount of aid to be provided to South Vietnam in 1970-71, excluding purely military aid, is $3,500,000, compared with expenditure of $2,012,000 in 1969-70. This will be spread over the votes for the Colombo Plan, the SEATO Aid programme and the new item, Special Aid to South Vietnam. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">
        <inline font-style="italic">International Grains Arrangement.</inline>An amount of $1 1 ,600,000 has been provided in the Budget to meet Australia&#39;s commitment under the International Grains Arrangement to supply 225,000 metric tons of wheat or flour equivalent as food aid to developing countries in 1970-71. The bulk of this wheat and flour will again be distributed to traditional recipients of aid from Australia in the Asian and Pacific regions. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">
        <inline font-style="italic">Indus Waters Scheme.</inline>Australia has undertaken to contribute a total of &#167;23,269,000 to the Indus Basin Development Fund to help finance the construction of dams, link canals and barrages on various tributaries of the Indus River designed to divide the waters between India and Pakistan in an equitable manner. Total expenditures for this purpose to 30 June 1970 amounted to $16,659,000. It is expected that the World Bank, which is responsible for administering this scheme, will call up $115,000 against Australia&#39;s outstanding commitment in 1970-71, compared with $293,000 in 1969-70. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">
        <inline font-style="italic">Other Bilateral Programmes.</inline>The estimates provide for $500,000 to be spent on each of two new items in 1970-71, viz. Special Aid to South Vietnam, which will be devoted to the construction of houses for dependants of members of the Regional and Popular Forces in that country; and Special Aid to Cambodia, much of which has already been supplied in the form of landrovers and radio equipment. The estimate for the SEATO Aid programme has been increased by $402,000 primarily to accommodate expenditures on a proposed new road-building project in southern Thailand. In recognition of Australia&#39;s growing interest in, and responsibility for, developments in this part of the world, the estimate for the South Pacific Aid Programme has been increased by $205,000, or more than 40 per cent, to $700,000. In each of the last two financial years, flour costing in the region of $690,000 has also been supplied to Fiji as part of Australia&#39;s food aid commitment under the International Grains Arrangement. An increased provision of $200,000 has been made for the recently established Australian/Asian University Aid and Co-operation Scheme to enable academic exchanges with participating countries, especially Indonesia, to begin in 1970-71. A new scheme to provide practical training in Australia for Papuans and New Guineans in certain fields where similar facilities are not available in the Territory was introduced recently and is expected to involve expenditures of $148,000 in 1970-71. Except in the case of the non-recurring grant of $250,000 which was provided in 1969-70 for emergency relief for refugees in Nigeria, the estimates for other items show only minor variations on expenditures in 1969-70. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">
        <inline font-style="italic">Papua and New Guinea.</inline>A new form of presentation has been adopted for assistance to Papua and New Guinea in this year&#39;s Budget. Instead of a single, all-purpose cash grant, as in the past, the Commonwealth Government will provide a basic grant-in-aid of S33 million in 1970-71 to supplement local Territory revenues and generally assist the Administration to finance its normal recurrent expenditures. Expenditure of this sum will be basically under the control of elected Ministerial Members and the Administrators Executive Council in the Territory. In addition, $37,750,000 will be provided in the form of a &#39;Development grant&#39; to help meet expenditures by the Administration for certain well-defined purposes of a developmental nature. The Commonwealth Government will continue to oversight expenditure of this sum. The Commonwealth Government has also accepted responsibility for meeting the extra costs above the salary scales of local officers incurred by the Papua and New Guinea Public Service in employing overseas officers. An amount of $29,250,000 has been provided in the Budget for this purpose in 1970-71. The total of these three items is $100 million, or $3,001,000 greater than the comparable figure for expenditure in 1969-70. This increase will be offset by a reduction of $3 million in respect of the payment which the Commonwealth Government made to the Papua and New Guinea Trust Account (for budget equalization purposes) in 1969-70: a similar payment is not envisaged this year. The Administration drew $3 million from this Trust Account to avoid a budget deficit in 1969-70 and is required to recoup this sum in 1970-71 in case a similar need arises in future, in which event the Administration will be permitted to draw on the Trust Account again. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">In 1970-71 the Administration expects to draw $8 million of the loan of $20 million which the Commonwealth Government has agreed to provide to help finance the construction of a new township at Arawa and other capital costs in. connection with the Bougainville copper project: this is $6 million greater than the drawings made in 1969-70. The Commonwealth Government was also called upon early this financial year to subscribe $3,600,000 from the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve to make up the shortfall in a recent borrowing in Australia by the Administration to finance the first instalment ($12,500,000) of its 20 per cent equity interest in the Bougainville copper project. Finally, as a result of the quickening pace of developments in Papua and New Guinea at the present time, direct expenditures of an economic nature in the Territory by various Commonwealth Departments and instrumentalities are estimated to increase by approximately $1,615,000 in 1970-71. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">All told, expenditures from the Commonwealth Budget in, or in connection with, Papua and New Guinea in 1970-71, excluding purely military expenditures from the Defence Vote on the Pacific Islands Regiment, are estimated to exceed $126 million. This is more than $11,200,000 greater than expenditure in 1969-70. </para>
      <para class="block">Growth in Australia&#39;s Aid </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">Excluding defence aid, official assistance provided from extra-budgetary sources, indirect educational subsidies to overseas students and those parts of Australia&#39;s contributions to the budgets of certain international organisations which are used to finance aid projects in developing countries, Australia will have provided well over $1,600 million in official aid to developing countries, including Papua and New Guinea, by the end of the current financial year. Of this total, approximately two-thirds, or a little more than $1,050 million, will have been devoted to Papua and New Guinea. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The estimates for 1970-71 represent approximately a three-fold increase on expenditures in 1960-61, and reflect an average annual rate of growth over the intervening years of more than 12 per cent. As a consequence, external aid to developing countries has increased as a proportion of both Gross National Product and total government spending since 1960-61. Details of the growth in various types of aid expenditure over the last ten years are set out in the table below: </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">Assistance to Australian industry is provided through the Budget by way of bounties, subsidies and other payments, and by way of contributions to promotion and research. In addition, services and facilities are provided by the Commonwealth for which no charge is made or for which charges fall well short of covering the costs incurred. A large part of the current expenditure of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, for which it is estimated $43 million will be provided from Consolidated Revenue in 1970-71, is on activities undertaken for the benefit of Australian industry. Commonwealth Departments providing assistance in the form of services and facilities include Primary Industry, Trade and Industry (including the Australian Tourist Commission), National Development (Bureau of Mineral Resources, and Forestry and Timber Bureau), Civil Aviation and Labour and National Service. A number of the specific purpose grants to the States also assist primary industries - for instance, payments for beef cattle roads, brigalow lands development, water resources investigations, softwood forestry and so on. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">In addition, a very considerable amount of assistance is being provided through the Budget by way of special taxation concessions which, as they result in a reduction of Commonwealth revenues and a corresponding increase in the funds available to the recipients, are as much a call on the Budget as direct payments which add to expenditures. Assistance of this type is mainly provided by way of income tax concessions which permit firms and individuals to make deductions from their incomes for taxation purposes beyond those normally permitted under the income tax law. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">In total, the Commonwealth assistance specified under the following three headings, which does not include all the forms of assistance referred to above, amounted to $493 million in 1969-70. </para>

      <para pgwide="yes">The preceding table does not include the cost of the averaging provisions applied to incomes of &#39;primary producers&#39;. These provisions involve assessment at rates of tax which may differ from those otherwise applicable to the taxable income. They have the effect of reducing the tax otherwise payable in a year when taxable income exceeds the average of that year and the four preceding years. It may exceed the average because of fluctuations in income, or because incomes had generally risen over the period, or both. Conversely, if taxable income falls below average income, tax payable under these provisions is higher than it would otherwise be. Options allowed by the law to withdraw permanently from the averaging provisions or to re-enter them, have enabled &#39;primary producers&#39; to have applied either tax at general rates or taxation under the provisions, whichever is more favourable to them. The provisions are estimated to have involved a cost to revenue of approximately $1 10 million in the five assessment years ended 1969-70, of which approximately S30 million relates to revenue forgone in 1969-70. </para>
      <para pgwide="yes">The table also excludes the cost of the drought bonds scheme which commenced in 1969-70. This scheme enables eligible pastoralists to reduce their taxable incomes in some years, by the amounts they subscribe to drought bonds, and increase them in later years, by amounts of redemptions. By evening out fluctuations in taxable income, the scheme can enable them to make an overall saving in tax. The cost of the scheme to revenue in 1969-70 is estimated at $600,000. </para>

While the provisions in question do not allow any greater total deduction over the life of (he plant and equipment than do the normal depreciation provisions of the income tax law. they result in a deferment of tax which involves a cost to the Commonwealth Budget and a benefit, namely, the provision of interest-free finance, to the taxpayers concerned. Normal depreciation allowances are designed to allow taxpayers to write off the cost of plain and equipment against income as the plant and equipment is used up in producing that income. The value of accelerated depreciation allowances to taxpayers depends on how much sooner they receive savings than would be the case if the allowances had been based on the usage of plant and equipment, and on the value to them of having the use of these savings. Where there is a constant or increasing rate of investment in plant and equipment subject to accelerated depreciation, the concession virtually provides the taxpayers concerned with a revolving or increasing credit in their account with the taxation revenue. </para>

          <para class="block">I shall now outline for the House the main variations proposed. Without an adjustment in charges the trading results for 1970-71 would show an anticipated loss of $llm made up of a loss in postal of S30m and a profit in telecommunications of $19m. This situation has developed as a result of increased wages of $58m in this current year, of which $45m will be a charge against trading operations. The proposals for increases in tariffs I am now presenting to the House are expected to provide about $42m in 1970-71 and $53m in a full year. The estimated overall profit for 1970-71 will then be $30m with S39m profit in telecommunications and a $9m loss in postal. The profit will be used in the expansion of Post Office facilities. </para>
          <para class="block">Telegraph Services The public telegraph service is at present operating at a loss, estimated at about $5m a year. The present rate for ordinary telegrams is 36c for the first twelve words and 3c for each additional word. For urgent telegrams double the rate is charged. An increase of lc per word is proposed in the rate for ordinary telegrams bringing the charge to 48c for the first twelve words and 4c for each additional word. The urgent telegram rate will be double the new rate for ordinary telegrams. Notwithstanding these increases the public telegraph service will continue to operate at a loss. </para>
          <para class="block">Telephone Services </para>
          <para>The current rentals for telephone exchange services do not nearly cover the recurring annual expenses borne by the Post Office in relation to the facilities provided and it is proposed that the existing rentals be increased throughout by $7 per annum. The one-third reduction in rentals which is given to blind persons and certain classes of pensioners will be maintained. In association with the adjustment to the rental charges, the service connection fees will be increased by SIO- from $30 to $40- -for new services and by $3--from $2 to $5- for in place&#39; services, that is, services already in the premises which are taken over by the new occupant. </para>
          <para>Notwithstanding the heavy rises in costs since 1964, this will be the first occasion on which exchange service rentals and connection fees have been adjusted since that time. Certain other rentals for miscellaneous telecommunications facilities are also to be adjusted in the light of the need of those services to provide a better rate of return on investment. Typical of the services involved are intercommunication equipment and private branch exchanges. It is estimated that these variations to telecommunications tariffs will bring in additional revenue of about $24m in 1970-71, and $28m in 1971-72. </para>
          <para>Provision of Lines for Country Telephone Subscribers </para>
          <para>In order to bring the benefits of an automatic telephone service to country subscribers as quickly as possible, the Post Office is pressing ahead with the replacement of manual exchanges by automatic equipment. This, however, means that the private sections of country subscribers&#39; exchange lines must be constructed to a higher standard than is acceptable for manual exchange working. Because of the need for good quality construction on private sections of exchange lines, the Government decided late in 1968 that it would assist subscribers concerned by making funds available for the purpose at the current long term bond rate and allow the subscribers to make repayments in instalments. Under these arrangements, minimum repayments are $100 a year plus interest and the maximum period over which repayments may be spread is 10 years. Moreover, normal maintenance on private sections of exchange lines constructed to departmental specifications is undertaken by the Post Office at its cost and subscribers are required to pay only for any necessary main items of replacement materials. Notwithstanding these funding and maintenance arrangements, country people located well out from their exchanges are finding the cost of private sections of good quality telephone exchange lines to be beyond their means, particularly where rural communities are facing a period of economic strain. </para>
          <para>The Government has therefore reexamined the policy relating to the provision of exchange lines for country telephone subscribers in the light of the more stringent construction standards necessary to enable a modern automatic telephone network to be extended effectively and economically in the interests of subscribers as a whole. The Government has decided that the Post Office will construct and wholly maintain all subscribers&#39; telephone exchange lines from the appropriate exchange to each subscriber&#39;s premises. This will include line plant on subscribers&#39; property. It has also been decided that the Post Office will bear more of the cost than it has been responsible for in the past. The Post Office will in future meet the cost up to a radial distance of 15 miles from the appropriate exchange, irrespective of the route distance of the line. This compares with the existing policy under which the Post Office provides line plant for varying distances from the exchange on a formula basis, the length of the &#39;departmental section&#39; depending on the extent of development along the particular route. On average, &#39;departmental sections&#39; of lines have been about 3i miles. Even in the case of subscribers who are located more than 15 miles radially from the exchange, the Post Office will still construct and maintain their exchange lines for the full distance. However, for the distance beyond 15 miles&#39; radius, the subscribers concerned will be required, unconditionally, to pay for the line plant beyond that radius at a standard rate of $40 per radial quarter-mile. This should provide a clear and easily understood basis in the few cases where contributions are required from subscribers, and it will enable the Post Office to quote subscribers immediately on application without the need to prepare detailed estimates of actual line plant costs. In accepting responsibility for the full costs of maintaining lines beyond the 15 miles&#39; radius, the Post Office will regard such lines as being its property. </para>
          <para>The revised conditions will be extended to upgrading or reconstructing private sections of existing subscribers&#39; exchange lines as opportunity permits, particularly in association with the conversion of services to automatic operation. In addition, the revised conditions will apply retrospectively to subscribers who have either provided or upgraded private sections of their lines to full departmental specifications in accordance with the policy introduced on the 1st January 1969, to which I referred in a statement to the House on 28th November 1968. Officers of my Department will be in a position to deal with inquiries from interested subscribers or applicants within the next few weeks. </para>
          <para>Postal Services </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline>I will now turn to the postal service. Increases in the charges for most postal services are proposed but, at the same time, new features are being introduced with the object of further improving the range and quality of services available to business and the public generally. It is expected that the increased charges will bring in $ 18.5m in 1970-71 and $25m in a full year. Three years have elapsed since the last increase in the basic postage rate. In that period, the wage rates payable to postal staff have been increased by an average of 29%. These have had a particularly adverse effect on the postal service because some 70% of its costs are associated with labour. Viewed in perspective, since 19S9 the basic postage rate will have risen by 45% compared with increases in postal wage rates of 100%. Naturally, the Post Office has been able to absorb some of these increases by improved productivity. In 1969-70, for example, postal staff rose only by 1.1% to cope with an increase of 6% in business. However, with estimated postal losses of $19m in 1969-70 and $30m in 1970-71, at current tariffs, a general tariff increase is unavoidable if rising costs are to be recovered. The tariffs proposed would reduce the estimated postal loss to $9m in 1970-71. Statements setting out the changes to postal rates in some detail have been circulated to honourable members but I propose to refer briefly to the more important of these. </para>
          <para class="block">Letters and Postcards </para>
          <para>The existing rate of 5c for the first ounce will be increased to 6c. The incremental charge for each additional weight step will also be 6c, instead of 4c as at present but this increase will be offset to some extent by the combining of several weight steps to simplify the rate structure. The number of weight steps will be reduced from 7 to 5. This simplified structure is identical to that adopted recently by the Universal Postal Union. </para>
          <para class="block">Other Articles </para>
          <para>The existing rates of 5c and 4c, for the first and successive weight steps respectively, will also be increased to 6c. The effect of introducing the simplified Universal Postal Union structure will be to reduce the number of weight steps from 5 to 4, by combining the present steps of 8 oz to 12 oz and 12 oz to 16 oz. </para>
          <para class="block">Publications Registered at the GPO </para>
          <para>The existing general rate for registered Australian books, newspapers and periodicals of 5c for the first 6 oz and 4c for each additional 6 oz will become 6c for the first 6 oz and 5c for each additional 6 oz. The concession rates on registered newspapers and periodicals posted in bulk require special attention because of the substantial difference between present concession and normal printed matter rates and the resulting considerable loss involved. The annual loss on the 158 million copies posted by the 7,600 newspapers and periodicals registered is about $9m, half the estimated postal loss in 1969-70. About 75 million copies are charged between lc and lc and the overall average revenue from all registered newspapers and periodicals posted in bulk is only 1.7c. </para>
          <para>These concession rates represent, in effect, a substantial subsidy to the publishing and printing industry and to many organisations, ranging from religious, charitable and welfare organisations to social and recreational clubs. Whilst the fostering of a strong publishing and printing industry in Australia is important, this function is not appropriate for the Post Office. Similarly, the activities of the many organisations helped may be desirable, but again it is not the role of the Post Office to support religious denominations, charitable bodies, educational, scientific and technical institutions and the like. It is proposed, therefore, to continue the action taken in recent years, to reduce the extent of the concession. Newspapers and periodicals published by Commonwealth and State government departments and authorities will no longer be eligible for the general and bulk rates of postage for registered publications but will pay normal printed matter rates. </para>
          <para>Registered newspapers and periodicals published by religious, charitable and welfare organisations, consisting in substantial part of news, information and articles about their activities or about religious, charitable or welfare subjects; and by educational, scientific, technical and agricultural organisations whose principal object is the dissemination of knowledge, consisting in substantial part of news, information and articles on such subjects, will pay 6c for each 12 oz, on the total weight of the consignment, subject to a minimum per article charge of lc. This means that a registered newspaper or periodical of the above type weighing up to 2 oz will still be paying only lc postage per article compared with 6c at normal printed matter rates. These days lc pays only for15 seconds of a postman&#39;s or mail sorter&#39;s time, and any item must be handled a number of times between posting and delivery. </para>
          <para>The same rate of 6c for each 12 oz, on the total weight of the consignment, with a minimum per article charge of lc, will apply to newspapers and periodicals consisting in substantial part of news, information and articles about country subjects. The expression of this principle is included in paragraph 2 of Part 1 of the Schedule to the Bill shown as Category A, but is more clearly stated in the Schedules that are in the hands of honourable members. These newspapers and periodicals will have to satisfy certain conditions as regards circulation in country areas. This will be clarified in the second Bill mentioned in my opening remarks which will be available to honourable members before the second reading on this Bill is continued. </para>
          <para>Other registered newspapers and periodicals, including those published by professional, business, union, commercial, social, recreational and motoring organisations and associations will pay the following rates: </para>
          <para>For delivery from the office of posting - 1&#189;c first 2 oz &#189;c each additional oz. </para>
          <para>For delivery elsewhere - 2c first 2 oz &#190;c each additional oz up to 6 oz &#189;c each additional oz thereafter. </para>
          <para class="block">The registered publications will still enjoy  a  substantial though reduced concession. </para>
          <para>The posting of registered publications to New Zealand and the domestic rates of postage is under discussion with the New Zealand Post Office. The Universal Postal Union Convent.on requires such special arrangements to be agreed to by the country of destination. In addition, from 1st July 1971, Australia will have to pay New Zealand an amount towards the cost of its internal handling of our mail, just as we in turn will be paid by other countries for our internal handling of their mail, where we receive more than we send. The amount payable to New Zealand per lb of mail will be not much more than the bulk rate. I will make a further statement on postings to New Zealand as soonas I am able. </para>
          <para>Similar conditions have applied on postings to Fiji but when Fiji becomes independent shortly the arrangements made in earlier days will be invalid. It is not considered that there are any logical grounds for treating Fiji differently to other countries in the area and it is proposed that the usual overseas rates will apply. The only other major postal administration still providing a domestic bulk rate for newspapers and periodicals is the United States of America, which incurs an annual loss of millions of dollars on this type of mail. </para>
          <para class="block">Bulk Pre-sorted Mail </para>
          <para>The postage rates for letters, other articles and registered books posted under the bulk pre-sorted mail service will also be increased and will generally maintain their present relativity, in abolute terms, with full rates. Many customers are taking advantage of these lower rates and the Post Office is benefiting from the economies of higher mail volumes and compliance wish preparation, pre-sorting and other condition. The rates for bulk pre-sorted mail to New Zealand are also still under discussion with the New Zealand Post Office. </para>
          <para>Other Postal Adjustments </para>
          <para>Other variations, details of which are set out in the statement available to honourable members, will be effected by amendment of postal regulations or executive action. These variations include the commission on money orders, the minimum commission for which is being increased from 15c to 30c because of the substantial loss incurred on this service. The minimum charge proposed is the same as the charge commonly made by banks for a bank cheque where the remitter has no account. Postal orders can provide a suitable alternative to money orders in many cases, at less cost to the customer and the Post Office, and additional $9 and SIO postal orders will be introduced as soon as possible to widen the appeal of this service. Postal orders fees also need to be adjusted to cover the small loss experienced on these items and re-grouped to simplify counter operations. </para>
          <para>The rates for parcels posted to places within 30 miles will be increased by Se each and lighter weight intrastate parcels will be increased by the same amount in order to cover costs. </para>
          <para>When the fees for the clearance of private posting receptacles were adjusted in 1968, it was indicated that they did not cover costs. This is a very expensive service to provide, and parking problems in inner capital city areas are also accentuating the difficulties associated with this facility. As a further step to placing this facility on an economic basis, a doubling of the fees is proposed, except that clearances on holidays will cost the same as clearances on Sundays. </para>
          <para>The fees for the registered post, cashondelivery post, and messenger delivery service will rise. Special services such as these are particularly labour intensive and increases in their tariffs are required to ensure that costs are covered. </para>
          <para>Regarding overseas mail, the Tokyo Congress of the Universal Postal Union in 1969 made a number of changes to the categories and tariff structure of the International Post which have been embodied in the attached schedule, including: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman">
            <item label="(i)">
              <para>fewer and larger weight steps for heavier items; </para>

            <item label="(ii)">
              <para>merging of the sample and phonopost categories into the small packets category; and </para>

            <item label="(iii)">
              <para>abolition of reply paid postcards. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The basic letter rate for overseas surface mail are being increased by 2c to 7c for British Commonwealth, Asian and Oceanic countries and 9c for other countries. A substantial loss is incurred on international mail and this would continue to exist even after the introduction on 1st July 1971 of the payments by other countries of amounts towards the cost of our internal handling of the imbalance in the quantity of overseas mail received as against overseas mail dispatched. </para>
          <para>Comparative international rates in overseas countries, expressed in Australian currency are: </para>
          <para>Britain: 8c (4.5c for British Commonwealth countries) </para>
          <para>Canada: 10c (5c for British Commonwealth countries) </para>
          <para>France: 13c </para>
          <para>Germany: 12c </para>
          <para>United States: 12c </para>
          <para>The relativity of the upper weight steps to the basic rates is fixed under the Universal Postal Union Convention. As far as the general public is concerned, the increase in the letter rates will have relatively little effect as the most common form of surface communication overseas is greeting cards, which may be sent at the 6c printed papers rate proposed, and aerogrammes which are unchanged at 10c but which will shortly be increased by more than 20% in writing area. </para>
          <para class="block">New Services </para>
          <para>Two new services are to be introduced as part of our programme for meeting the changing postal needs of the business community, government organisations, and the general public. The White Paper T have just presented to Parliament contains details of our progress in the last 12 months in such fields as priority paid mail, parcel post, philately, and customer advisory services. From 1st October 1970, under a new international service, printers and publishers who have bulk consignments of printed matter, such as magazines and books, for the one address will be able to send them by surface mail in direct bags at 30c per 2 lb. provided they weigh between 22 lb and 60 lb. This will be much more convenient and reliable for customers who at the present time must break such consignments up into separate packets and parcels and forward them separately. The service will be known as &#39;Printpost Direct Bags&#39;. Up to this point, the Post Office has not provided a competitive domestic air parcels service because the norma! airmail fee of 3c  peT  ounce has been added to the surface parcel rate to arrive at an airmail parcel rate. This has resulted in such high rates, compared to the airlines&#39; parcels service, that virtually no business has been obtained. </para>
          <para>New tariffs for air parcels have been developed which are closely related to distance. A &#39;per lb&#39; basis of charging, with a minimum charge, as we have for interstate surface parcels, is proposed, for each 4 zones which are based on air route distances. The zones and tariffs proposed are: </para>
          <para>Zone 1 (0-500 miles) 20c per lb: minimum charge 80c. </para>
          <para>Zone 2 (501-1,000 miles) 35c per lb: minimum charge 90c. </para>
          <para>Zone 3 (1,001-1,500 miles) 45c per lb: minimum charge 90c </para>
          <para>Zone 4 (1,501 miles and over) 65c per lb: minimum charge 90c. </para>
          <para class="block">These charges are cheaper - in many cases much cheaper- than the present charges for airmail parcels except for very heavy parcels in Zone 4 where the charges are fractionally higher because it is desired to have the new rates per lb expressed in multiples of 5c for ease of working. </para>
          <para>The new service will be introduced on a progressive basis, beginning with the capital cities and the larger provincial centres served by air, on 1st January 1971. Further routes covering other provincial centres served by air will be included as the necessary arrangements are made. On routes not included in the zones for the time being, the present airmail fee of 3c per ounce rounded off to <inline font-style="italic">50c.</inline> n&#176;r lb will be applied to parcels for which air conveyance is required. Priority Paid parcels will be charged an additional fee of 30c. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline>the Post Office is an integral part of the community and is subject to the same pressures in relation to wage variations, increasing costs of services, materials and so on. Awards announced last year will add $58m to the total Post Office wages bill. This is mo&#60;-e than 10% of total wage payments to staff. Such a situation makes it impossible to absorb costs and creates a circumstance whereby increased charges are inevitable unless the Post Office is to totally disregard business considerations. There can hardly be disagreement that prices generally in the community have an upward trend, and the consumer price index reflects this. I have had a look at some individual charges for well-known services in the community and find a similar pattern of increase over the past 10 years. For instance the labour charge for repairs to home appliances, motor vehicles, etc., has gone up by more than 60%; taxi, rail, bus and tram fares have averaged increases above 40% and some daily newspapers have gone up by 40%. A look at the movement in typical fees for basic professional services has shown rises of 40% to 60%. In common with business generally we have found no means of avoiding revision of charges from time to time. However, rises in our charges have been moderate over the past 10 years when viewed against the backdrop of increases in the business and professional fields. </para>
          <para>The view is held in some quarters that all the financial problems of the Post Office would be solved by converting it to a statutory authority. In this regard, I must say that the British Post Office which recently changed from Department of State to corporation status has found itself faced with similar problems to those confronting the Australian Post Office. </para>
          <para>On the telecommunications side, telephone rentals, the service connection fee, and some local and trunk call charges have been increased in Britain this year. The increases were designed to provide sufficient revenue in the telecommunications service to achieve a financial return of 10% before interest on net assets against the previous target of 8i%. Tn Australia, the return on net assets, before interest, in the telecommunications field in 1969-70 was only 51%. </para>
          <para>Honourable members may be interested to know that a businessman in Britain has had his telephone rental increased from $A34 to SA52 and a previous service connection fee of $A43 has been increased to SA54. These are typical of increases made in other telecommunications charges in Britain during 1970. </para>
          <para>These steps were taken so that the telecommunications service in Britain could conduct its affairs on the lines of an efficient commercial undertaking in seeking an adequate return on invested capital - to ensure an adequate investment programme to effect improvements in service, and so that its capital investment programme should be of sufficient stability to permit effective long-term planning. </para>
          <para>Many honourable members will have read recently of the problems being encountered by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company - operators of the Bell Telephone System. In its efforts to keep pace with rising demand for telephone service and increasing costs, the quality of service in a number of major cities has severely declined. Massive quantities of capital are required to meet expanded demands for service. Much of the new capital required by the Bell System companies in 1969 was raised by debt financing and at the end of 1969 debt represented some 39% of total Bell System capital. This compares with the situation in the Australian Post Office where 98% of capital is financed by long term debt. </para>
          <para>Turning to the postal side, the proposed basic postage rate of 6c would compare favourably with rates in overseas countries, especially when allowance is made for their much greater density of population and reduced distribution costs. Comparative rates in other countries, expressed in Australian currency, are: </para>
          <para>Britain : 4.5c with an increase to 6.3c proposed </para>
          <para>Germany : 7.3c </para>
          <para>Canada : 5.0c </para>
          <para>United States : 5.4c with an increase to 7.1c proposed </para>
          <para>France : 6.4c </para>
          <para>Sweden : 9.5c. </para>
          <para>Most of these overseas postal administrations are experiencing similar problems to the Australian Post Office - a rapid increase in wage rates in a highly labour intensive operation. The United States Post Office deficit now exceeds$A1.16 billion annually, the British postal service lost $A37m in 1969-70, and the Canada Post Office lost $A47m last year. </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">The purpose of these Bills is to give effect to the proposal announced by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bury)</inline> in the Budget Speech to increase the 25% rate of sales tax to 27&#189;%. The 9 amending Bills are necessary because the sales tax is imposed by 9 separate Acts to meet the requirement of the Constitution that an Act imposing taxation shall deal with one subject of taxation only. </para>
          <para>The goods affected by the increase are those listed in the Second and Fifth Schedules to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. Motor cars such as sedans and station wagons which are specified in the Fifth Schedule are the principal classes of goods affected by the2&#189;% increase. It will not apply to motor cycles, motor buses or other commercial type vehicles such as utilities, panel vans and trucks. </para>
          <para>The Second Schedule embraces a fairly wide range of goods. The more important of these are radio and television receivers and record players; toilet and beauty preparations and shaving requisites; cameras, films and photographs; watches, jewellery and furs. A comprehensive statement listing the goods which are to be taxed at 27&#189;% is being circulated for the information of honourable members. </para>
          <para>The present rate of 2&#189;% applicable to household furniture and appliances remains unaltered. So also does the general rate of 15% which applies to a broad field of goods not specified in any of the sales tax schedules. As the Treasurer mentioned when announcing these proposals the increase in rate is expected to yield additional revenue amounting to $29m in a full year. The new rate of tax is to be effective from tomorrow, 19th August 1970. This accords with the normal practice under which changes in rates of sales tax take effect from the day following their introduction into Parliament. I commend the Bills to honourable members. </para>

        <para>The Government has decided to grant an exemption from the new wine excise to persons who produce wine for their own use in quantities not exceeding 400 gallons annually. I think honourable members will agree this is a reasonable concession to home wine producers. However, it should be clearly understood that it applies only to wine produced for non-commercial purposes. If a home producer sells any of the wine he produces under this concessional arrangement, he will be regarded as a commercial producer and will be liable to pay excise duty on the total annual quantity he has produced. </para>

        </talk.start>
        <list type="decimal">
          <item label="(1)">
            <para>I have been advised that in 1961 a &#39;Royal Commission to Inquire into and report upon State Services in New Zealand&#39; was appointed to investigate and report upon the organisation, staffing and methods of control and operation of Departments of State and agencies. In 1968, a Committee on the Civil Service, chaired by Lord Fulton, reported on the structure, recruitment and management, including training, of the United Kingdom Home Civil Service. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(2)">
            <para>In 1919 a Royal Commission on Public Service Administration was appointed to inquire into and report upon the various Acts relating to the administration of the Public Service, and particularly in relation to the effect of such Acts upon the management and working of the Departments and the steps necessary to adjust the position that had arisen by reason of the various authorities in existence for the regulation and working of the Public Service. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para>Since that date there have been Committees of Inquiry into Systems of Promotion and Temporary Transfers (1943-44) and Recruitment (1957-58). </para>
        <list type="decimal">
          <item label="(3)">
            <para>The Public Service Board and the Permanent Heads of departments have a joint responsibility to ensure efficiency and economical administration of the Commonwealth Service, including appropriate use of new managerial techniques, technological advances and specialised training. The Public Service Board&#39;s annual reports to Parliament indicate the continuous action that is taken in these matters by departments and the Public Service Board, assisted where necessary by outside consultants. By way of illustration of this, I invite the honourable member&#39;s attention to the Board&#39;s Annual Report for the year ended 30 June 1969 and in particular. to those sections of the Report which cover Methods, Systems and Management Techniques (pages 5/12), Automatic Data Processing (pages 13/19), Staffing Aspects of Technological Change in the Service (pages 62/65) and Training (pages 71/77). In addition, arising from its examination of the expenditure of public funds, the Parliamentary Joint Committee of Public Accounts reports to the Parliament on a wide range of matters associated with the administration of the Service. The responsibilities of the Service arise from the functions it is required to perform as prescribed by laws made by the Parliament and by the executive decisions of the Government. In view of this and of the nature of the processes that are followed to ensure efficiency and economical operation of the Service, as I have outlined, I do not see any need for the establishment of a Royal Commission or Committee of Public Inquiry into the responsibilities and administration of the Commonwealth Service. </para>

            <para>Statistics that would permit accurate estimates to be made of the value of tax remissions granted to foreign owners of equity in Australian firms in the classes specified in the honourable member&#39;s question are not availabl e. However, some statistics of overseas participation in the manufacturing and mining industries in Australia are available and these statistics, taken in conjunction with estimates of revenue forgone as a result of taxation concessions to industry, have enabled broad estimates to be made of the order of the revenue forgone attributable to overseas interests in manufacturing and mining companies in Australia. </para>
            <para>The following estimates are based on estimated revenue forgone in 1968-69 in respect of various concessions to these industries included in Statement No. 9, Commonwealth Assistance to Industry through the Taxation System, attached to the 1969-70 Budget Speech. In these estimates, the categories of overseas ownership used are those shown in the Commonwealth Statistician&#39;s bulletins, Overseas Participation in Australian Mining Industry and Overseas Participation in Australian Manufacturing Industry. Although not identical, these categories correspond broadly with those specified in the honourable member&#39;s question. </para>

                <para>The High Court&#39;s judgment in the case to which the honourable member referred seems to have overcome the apparent fault in the system of registration of organisations under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act mentioned in the judgment. In this case the High Court decided that if an organisation has validly enlarged its eligibility conditions so as to represent a group extending beyond the particular industry in or in connexion with which it is registered, the fact that the description of the industry is not wide enough to cover the classes of employees who have become members of the organisation does not deprive the organisation of the capacity to represent and formulate industrial claims in the interests of that group. In the 13 years which have elapsed since the High Court&#39;s decision, the &#39;apparent fault&#39; does not appear to have been a cause of concern to either employer or employee organisations. No representations have been made to my Department about it and my Department is not aware of any reason for disturbing the existing situation. </para>

              <para>The Attorney-General has advised me that it would not be true to say that the Acts of the six States relating to third party insurance are all completely different*. The Acts are by no means identical, but most, although not all, of their important provisions are based on common principles. These principles and the reciprocity incorporated in the legislation ensure that motorists travelling anywhere in Australia have third party insurance cover at all times. One important difference in substance is in respect of the amount that the third party policy must insure. In most States the amount is required to be unlimited in relation to all persons. In Tasmania, however, the amount required to be insured in respect of any one claim of any one person in the case of passengers in the insured&#39;s vehicle or members of the insured&#39;s family living with him is only $4,000. Another important difference is that in one State, Western Australia  a  special tribunal has been established (the Third Party Claims Tribunal) with exclusive jurisdiction in respect of claims for death or bodily injury caused by or arising out of the use of a motor vehicle. </para>

              <para>The Attorney-General has advised me that there are no doubt occasions when a plaintiff suffering injuries in road accidents has waited for  a  lengthy period before his case is heard and, in  a  number of cases, the plaintiff fails because he has not established negligence on the part of the defendant. In the usual order of things, a person suffering injuries in a road accident will, in  a  proportion of cases, be so injured as the result of his own negligence. </para>

At the meeting it was noted that the New South Wales Government was conducting an inquiry into all aspects of third party insurance in that State, and the Council decided to defer any further discussions on the matter until the report of the inquiry was made available. At this stage, the report of the inquiry is not yet available. </para>

              <para>and (2) There is not provision for members of the judiciary akin to sabbatical leave. There are no holders of statutory offices under the Commonwealth receiving sabbatical leave. All members of the continuing full-time teaching and research staff of the Australian National University receive study leave. The leave which may be taken varies according to the post held, from one year in every seven years&#39; service to one year in every four. A grant towards the expenses of the leave may be made, provided costs are not less, of an amount varying from $1,000 to $3,200. Study leave cannot be accumulated and cash in lieu is not payable on resignation or retirement. </para>

              <para>Sabbatical leave and long service leave are provided for quite different and unrelated purposes and it is unreal to draw comparisons between the different provisions of these two conditions of employment. Long service leave is provided as a reward for staff who complete a lengthy period of service and is designed to allow an extended paid break from employment for the purpose of rest and recreation. Sabbatical leave, on the other hand, is provided to enable academic staff to better equip themselves for their academic duties, and is recognised as a necessary means by which academic staff may keep abreast of developments in their fields of study in other centres of research and teaching. In a number of Universities academic staff receive long service leave in addition and unrelated to their entitlement to receive sabbatical leave. </para>

              <para>I have been informed by the  President  of the Superannuation Board that, at present, there are practical problems involved in making a full review of the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund more frequently than under the present quinquennial arrangements. I understand that these problems have arisen in part because of the accumulation of arrears as a consequence of the detailed work necessary to enable distribution of the surplus of over$40m to pensioners and contributors. Recent major changes that are of benefit to contributors, such as the introduction of noncontributory units, have aggravated the situation. Nevertheless, I have been informed by the  President  of the Board that these problems are being overtaken through the further development of the computer system in the Office of the Superannuation Board. On present indications, more frequent reviews should be practicable within 2 years. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>When the practical problems referred to in (1) have been overcome, it would be possible for an annual review to be made. However, I have been informed by the Commonwealth Actuary that it would not be possible to ascertain meaningful actuarial trends by reviewing what has happened in only 1 year. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>The actuarial examinations as such are not protracted in relation to the amount of work involved. As indicated in (1), the problem lies in the up-dating of records and the extraction of data for the examinations. A disadvantage would be suffered by superannuitants only if significant surplus assets were revealed by a quinquennial investigation and appropriate adjustments were delayed. Such a situation arose in connection with the investigation as at 30 June 1962 and the disadvantage was offset by making the adjustments effective from 1 July 1962. </para>

            <para>The Australian Wheal Board is currently paying off its debt of $250m to the Commonwealth Government in respect of the 1968-69 pool. It is expected that this debt will be liquidated about March 1971. The time taken for the Board to discharge its 1969-70 pool indebtedness will depend upon a number of factors including the Board&#39;s selling performance, the prices received and extent of sales on credit terms. At this stage it seems unlikely that the 1969-70 pool debt can be cleared before the end of 1971. This being the case, it will not be possible to make a second payment until sufficient credit funds have been accumulated some time in 1972. </para>

        <para>It might be noted that the value of opals exported exceeds considerably the value of opals mined in any year. In many cases stones, after being mined, pass through several stages before export and considerable value might thus be added. Most stone at export are in a different condition to the raw state when they left the field, and the statistics do not make a clear distinction of the various grades. </para>

              <para>During the recent hearing by the Coal Industry Tribunal of an application by Australian Iron and Steel Limited for an extension of multiple shift longwall mining operations a submission was advanced by the Miners Federation that there should be a reduction in weekly hours of work in mines where such operations are introduced. This submission was rejected by the Tribunal in a decision handed down in Sydney on 5th March, 1970. However, the Tribunal did decide, in granting the employers application, that an extra week of annual leave plus added remuneration should accrue to any employee in a mine working these multiple shifts. I am advised that the Combined Mining Unions and the mineowners are now to enter into private discussions on the question of shorter hours. </para>

Until 1959, in accordance with sections 32 to 35 of the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act 1948-1958, the share of each pension met by the Fund out of the Pensions Account was related to the capital value of the pension payable and the accumulated value of the contributions paid by the particular member, the balance being met by the Commonwealth. Surpluses of $271,392 and $312,456 were found in the Pensions Account by the first and second quinquennial investigations and, as provided for in the legislation, were used to reduce payments by the Commonwealth to the Fund. When the Pensions Account was discontinued in 1959, the Commonwealth was meeting, on average, 85% of each pension. </para>

            <item label="(1)">
              <para>In each State there are requirements for the routine inspection of poultry processing premises, and registration of premises is required by most States. In addition to the inspection of premises for the purpose of ensuring the maintenance of acceptable standards of hygiene, the State Public Health authorities exercise a general surveillance over the wholesomeness of all foodstuffs at the retail level. Similar requirements and procedures operate in Territories within Australia. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>Many countries have standards for poultry established by legislation, and these usually apply to both the domestic and imported product In the U.S.A., for instance, the Wholesome Poultry Products Act specifies minimum standards relating to the preparation and wholesomeness of poultry, inspection supervision, and so on. This Act requires that standards in exporting countries be the substantial equivalent of those contained in the Wholesome Poultry Products Act. In Canada, standards for poultry, whether domestic or imported, are contained in the Meat Inspection Act, and poultry must comply also with the Animal Contagious Diseases Act The foregoing examples are illustrative, and virtually every country to which Australia exports poultry requires certification as to the hygienic processing, packing and general soundness of the product. Individual countries require particular certifications as to freedom from specified fowl diseases. </para>

              <para>State authorities responsible for standards in the poultry industry are unanimously of the view that there is no evidence of any high degree of disease in poultry food in Australia.

              <para>If so, in view of his answer to question No. 667 (Hansard, 5th May 1970, page 1632) indicating that no such fare reimbursement is payable to an indigenous agreement worker in Papua and New Guinea, will he take steps to remove the present discrimination between indigenous and expatriate workers in the Territory. </para>

            <para>-  The answer to the honourable member&#39;s question is as follows: </para>

          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(1)">
              <para>Some European workers employed in Pupua and New Guinea are granted leave fares between the Territory and Australia when they proceed on leave after a specified period of service. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>Arrangements for leave fares are one of the inducements offered to attract skilled or experienced manpower to the Territory and are not prescribed by award or legislation. It is known however that leave fares are reimbursed on an annual basis in some cases, on a biennial basis in others. Such arrangements are not comparable with those for indigenous agreement workers, for whom minimum conditions are set down by legislation. Their terms of contract are generally for 2 years and their fares between their villages and places of employment are paid on engagement and repatriation. The terms and conditions of rural agreement workers are at present being inquired into by a board of inquiry. </para>
