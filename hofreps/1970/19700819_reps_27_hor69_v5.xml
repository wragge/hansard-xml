After the presentation of last year's Budget, the honourable gentleman told me that the single age pension rate announced in that Budget represented 22.3% of average male weekly earnings for the March quarter of that year, which was the period covered by the most recent figures then available. The new rate announced in this year's Budget represents only 21.7% of the average male weekly earnings in March of this year. Will the honourable gentleman confirm these figures? If not, will he state how much the drop has been in the last 12 months? </para>

I do point out to the honourable gentleman that the figures that he quotes would seem to indicate that average male earnings have risen faster than prices.

            <para>- It has been quite widely reported in the last few days that the claims of Royal Australian Air Force flying personnel regarding flying pay had been ignored or rejected. I do not think that those reports are accurate, and because this is important to an understanding of Royal Australian Air Force personnel in different bases, I wanted to say what had happened. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It has been alleged that the reasons for the decision which led to an increase of 100% in flying pay were not divulged. The reasons were known to the head of the Department of Air who, of course, is a party to the decision and on the committee making the recommendation. It has been alleged also that the advice of uniformed personnel had not been sought before the decision was made. In fact, before the recommendation was a recommendation - when it was still just a proposal - the advice of the Chief of the Air Staff was sought. He concurred in the figures. It is the figures which are important. He should well know the position in his own service. I am quite certain that he does. It has been alleged also that the rates that were agreed finally were below those which were considered reasonable by the Department of Air. I find this allegation difficult to understand when the Permanent Head of the Department of Air was party to the recommendation, which was a unanimous one, to the Treasurer and myself and when the Chief of the Air Staff had known previously of the figures, had been consulted about them and had concurred in them. </para>
          <para>I can well understand the morale problem and the difficulty that people in the RAAF would have with the reports that have been circulated widely - and not only in the Press, because I understand that the Press reports were based on messages which had been widely circulated throughout Royal Australian Air Force bases in Australia. It has been suggested that the rates should have been the same as those for the Department of Civil Aviation personnel. 1 do not wish to comment in detail on the reasons for this, but I wish to make one point. </para>

              <para>- This is a matter in which I think quite a number of people have an interest. Royal Australian Air Force pilots and Department of Civil Aviation pilots have one ability in common, that is, an ability to fly sophisticated aircraft. But Department of Civil Aviation personnel also have other responsibilities not generally found in the duties of Royal Australian Air Force personnel. These responsibilities include forming, maintaining and policing the rules and standards of civil flying. These are duties additional to those related to RAAF pilots. However, the increase that the RAAF pilots gained was a 100% increase. </para>

            <para>- I ask the Minister for Shipping and Transport: Does the Australian National Line operate at a satisfactory profit level and has it substantial reserves? If so, why was it necessary to impose a 12±% freight rise on the Line's operations? Is the Minister aware of the severe impact this increase will have on the cost structure of Tasmania? Is it considered jost that the Line should maintain its profit rate at the cost of dislocating Tasmanian industry and trade? Will the Minister vary the provisions of the Australian Coastal Shipping Commission Act to emphasise effective services and not the maintenance of the ANL profit rate? </para>

            <para>- Unfortunately, the profits of the Australian National Line are not at a satisfactory level and it is as a result of the decline in profitability that it has been necessary to adjust the freight structure throughout Australia. It is interesting to note that since 1959, when there was an initial reduction of some 45% in the tariff charged by the Australian National Line which was followed in 1961 by a further 15% reduction, the freight forwarders, who are the largest customers of the Australian National Line in servicing the Tasmanian trade, have seen fit to increase their freight by some 441%. Over the period during which the ANL through the introduction of new types of cargo vessels and unit cargo handling has been able to stabilise the freight structure between Tasmania and the mainland, freight forwarders have found it necessary to increase their rates by some 441%. There must be some limit beyond which the ANL can no longer absorb these cost increases. In only the past few years increases in the wharfage dues, levied by the port authorities on both sides of Bass Strait which mean an average additional 13c per 40 cubic feet of cargo have been absorbed by the ANL. There is also the problem that the wharfage dues levied by the Tasmanian ports are substantially higher than those levied by the mainland ports. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>None the less, the Government does recognise the peculiar significance of the trans-Bass Strait service to the shippers, producers and people of Tasmania. It is for that reason that the increase in freight passed on to other trades in the ANL service was not immediately applied to the Tasmanian service but instead was deferred so that discussions could be held with the Tasmanian Government and interested Tasmanian persons to determine the impact. Only on Monday of this week the General Manager of the ANL, the permanent head of my Department and I went to discuss with the Premier of Tasmania, the Tasmanian Minister for Transport and with interested persons in industries there the general question of the impact of the freight increases. There were quite a number of anomalies which, having been discussed, have now been removed. There were in some instances areas where the impact was apparently higher than the 12i% increase but this has now been reduced so that overall substantially only a 12i% increase applies to the Tasmanian trade. It is recognised that shipping costs and, indeed, costs of all sorts must have an impact on producers and consumers alike. However, to the extent to which the ANL has maintained the freight rate at a stable level in Tasmania over a long period of time it has itself been suffering and it cannot continue operating as it does under a charter which requires it to operate on a commercial basis and sustain losses incurred in any sector indefinitely. </para>

            <para>- I answer the question in the affirmative. The question of legislating to overcome the difficulties created by Worthing's case received close attention at the last meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in luly. At that meeting 2 committees were set up. One was a committee of draftsmen or - on a Commonwealth level - parliamentary counsel, and the other was a policy committee. They are committees representative of the Commonwealth and of the States. They have met frequently both alone and together. Indeed, I understand that there is a meeting of both committees in Melbourne this week. Out of their deliberations I expect that there soon will come to me and to my colleagues in the States proposals for legislation. I shall consider those proposals as a manner of urgency, of course, because a situation of very considerable difficulty is posed by the decision in Worthing's case. </para>

The Minister will recall that losses incurred on the Darwin run and on our entry into the overseas trade are clearly indicated in the last annual report of the Australian National Line. Will the Minister inform the House of the profits made by the Australian National Line on the roll-on roll-off services between Melbourne and northern Tasmanian ports which offset the losses to which I have referred and resulted in an overall profit for the Australian National Line of some $lm? </para>

            <para>- The operations of the Australian National Line in overseas trades are divorced entirely in the Line's accounting system from operating costs, and profits incurred in the coastal sector. There are substantial difficulties in the provision of the exact costing of the different sectors of the trade although it is as a result of a general assessment of the costs of operating to Tasmania in the past 2 years that it is possible to demonstrate that there has been a decline in profitability to the point where in the last 2 years there has been an increasing loss. The general system of freight charged in relation to Tasmania is based on the averaging the sea freight legs and the averaging of port charges which are then absorbed in a total freight charge. It is in regard to the content and manner of this averaging system that the Tasmanian Government has suggested that there might be some consideration of a change in the future. Whether the people of Tasmania would be better served by divorcing port charges from the sea leg charge - a divorce which would mean a reversion to a system which operated pre- 1959 - I would doubt. However it is easy to demonstrate the increase of 13c per 40 cubic feet in the port charge component as averaged out around the Tasmanian trades. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As to the actual operating charges of the Australian National Line, it is a bit difficult to assess the extent to which, for example, the losses incurred as a result of the delay in the construction of the trader vessels should be apportioned to the Tasmanian trade, and if so, to which trade and to what extent. Now that the trader vessels are in operation it certainly should no longer be necessary to maintain the same tonnage of conventional ships operating across Bass Strait. This, 1 believe, gives promise of a better service and, one would hope, a stabilising of costs in the future. </para>

            <para>- There is no doubt that as Australia heads into the 1970s we face a far greater challenge in recruiting a skilled work force from the various countries from which we have drawn migrants during the postwar period. This is so because of several critical factors. In the first place, migration from a number of our traditional postwar sources is flowing far less strongly than it did before because of their developing socio-economic buoyancy. In the second place, many of those countries are themselves so short of skilled workers that throughout Europe they are in competition with Australia, particularly in relation to their development of the guest worker concept. Thirdly, because of the prosperity of much of Europe today, migration to other countries, including Australia, has grown progressively less attractive. What this means is that we must continue to be responsive to changed circumstances. This has certainty been the case to date. Hie House will be aware of a wide range of new initiatives which have been taken through my Department to ensure that we continue to attract the skilled work force we require. I think initially of the extension of the employer nomination service, the extension of our counselling services to migrants and the extension of our advisory services to skilled and professional migrants. At the present time, as for the past 10 years, of the total worker component of migrants, we attract to Australia some 40%.I would expect that in the future, because of the initiatives that have been taken, we will at least maintain the 40% intake of skilled workers. </para>

            <para>- I did notice that the Leader of the Opposition expressed the view that the Australian Government should have protested to the British Government or expressed some opposition to the British Government's considering the provision of maritime arms to South Africa under the Simonstown Agreement. The Simonstown Agreement of course is designed to protect the sea routes from England into the Indian Ocean and should Great Britain come to the conclusion that those sea routes can be protected by the actions she considered and that she would thereby be enabled to have safer sea routes and be better able to maintain in this area and supply in this area her forces, then the Government would not dream of expressing opposition to Britain. If Britain does finally come to some conclusions of this kind we have no intention of expressing opposition. </para>

The Greek police informed my officers that he had been placed under supervision because of his strenuous actions at a basketball match between Greeks and Poles. He was in fact strenuously supporting the Poles against his native country. My officers also interviewed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Vrettos,</inline> who said that there seemed to be far more worry back home about his welfare and whereabouts than he had himself.

Our embassy was also told to do all in its power, to ensure that his civil rights were protected. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Vrettos</inline> could not be contacted then, because it was 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning. Nonetheless, at daybreak or as soon after as possible my officers would see him and ask him whether he wants any protection. The only other information I can give the House is that I have been informed by some members of the.

            <para>- My question to the Minister for Shipping and Transport is supplementary to the questions which were asked of him by my colleagues the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Braddon. The Minister is no doubt aware of the intense feeling of the people of Tasmania with regard to the impost of a 121% freight increase on ships of the Australian National Line which trade between the mainland ports of Australia and Tasmania. I ask: Is the Minister aware of the fact that the whole economic fabric of Tasmania is now in jeopardy as a result of this increase because the State depends almost entirely on sea communications for its continued survival? Will he indicate, by reversing this decision, that the welfare of all the people of Tasmania is far more important than the profitable trading of the ANL? </para>

            <para>- The honourable member for Franklin has demonstrated an irresponsible attitude towards the way in which the Government should try to assist the people of each of the States of the Commonwealth. Over the period in which the Australian National Line has reduced its freight rates - initially by 45% and then by 15%  -  the freight forwarders have -increased their charges by 441%. Port authorities in Tasmania average nearly twice the port dues - in fact, in some instances it is nearly 3 times - of the port of Melbourne in relation to the same services. However, within other sectors affecting the movement of goods from Tasmanian producers to the mainland and goods purchased on the mainland by Tasmanian consumers there are elements which have moved against the cost factor at a rate substantially higher than the 121% increase which is being applied to goods carried by the ANL. Some dispensations are available within ANL charges in areas of specialised stacking. I would refer in particular to a method of cargo handling referred to as top stocking which, if it is used by shippers - and I have been told that it is available to many shippers but it is not being used to any extent at the moment - we will more than negate the present increase in freight charges. While it is true that Tasmania has substantial disadvantages compared with the mainland States in the movement of goods to and from its principal market, it is also true that other elements in the freight chain have moved substantially against the interests of Tasmanians, and. speaking comparatively, to a greater extent than has the Australian National Line. Indeed, it is only because of the stabilisation that the Australian National Line has produced through the introduction of new types of cargo handling that the freight charges to Tasmania - and hence the interests of Tasmanian industry - have been protected for so long. </para>

            <para>- It is regrettably true that in the movement of goods around the Australian coast the general unreliability of waterfront labour has created substantia! difficulties in the turn round time for conventional vessels. Because of this uncertainty in turn round time an accelerated move has been made into new forms of cargo handling. This has involved a lessening in the work force but at the same time has provided a more specialised nature crf employment and, by giving the opportunities for more specialised training, it has provided opportunities for more remunerative employment for waterside labour. The 'Darwin Trader', the new vessel operated by the Australian National Line to Darwin, was introduced specifically to try to accelerate the turn round in the port of Darwin and so contain the escalation of costs which affect the provision of the Australian National Line's services there. The 4,500-odd tons of cargo for Darwin on the maiden voyage of the 'Darwin Trader' were discharged in about 38 hours at the port of Darwin, which was a very effective effort. But unfortunately, through industrial trouble at the port, the ship was delayed for about 9 days, making an additional cost of about $31,000 to the Australian National Line. Imposts in freight charges must necessarily reflect any undue burden of costs. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Darwin and Tasmanian trades unfortunately suffer by the movement of costs and the residents of Darwin in particular are being prejudiced in their enjoyment of an economic and reasonable level of freight structure by the general unreliability of the waterfront labour in the port of Darwin. Accordingly, I will be happy to discuss with my colleague, as the honourable member for the Northern Territory has suggested, what methods might be adopted to improve the general position there. It might bc mentioned that the Government, through my colleagues, the Minister for the Interior and the Minister for National Development, is committed to a very substantial expenditure in the upgrading of the facilities in the port of Darwin. Without doubt this also will be prejudiced if the waterfront labour is not prepared to adopt a responsible attitude to ensure a quick turn round of both coastal ships and those operating into and out of Darwin from overseas. </para>

            <para>- I think that the sura was rather more than that which was mentioned by the honourable member, but we can look up the actual figures ourselves. I have no recollection of any undertaking being given. There is a transcript of the proceedings, but 1 have no recollection of such an undertaking. On the other hand, it must be fairly clear that should the measure not be passed then those who voted against it would be placing the States in an entirely untenable position and would be attacking the capacity of the States to carry out their responsibilities for schools, hospitals, roads and the other things which the community wants, and that would obviously require responsible people to see whether such irresponsibility could be repaired. </para>

              <para>- To come to the other parts of the honourable member's question, may I say that it should not be assumed that the Government has been adopting a passive attitude towards questions of upholding and maintaining law and order. I can inform the House that there are presently pending in Melbourne a number of prosecutions against various people for alleged offences against Commonwealth laws arising out of demonstrations. Two of those charges, together with some other charges that have been remitted to the magistrates court after the hearing of an order to review in the Supreme Court, concern alleged offences against section 7a of the Commonwealth Crimes Act, that is, the incitement section. I have considered personally, as is my duty, every case of alleged incitement, that is, of alleged breach of section 7a of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. </para>

              <para>- I have personally examined every case of alleged incitement that has been brought to my notice. In considering the question which arises in each of such cases, whether a prosecution should be undertaken, I have at all times endeavoured to exercise a judgment based on caution, moderation and restraint, bearing in mind that a number of factors affecting the public interest are wrapped up in any question whether a prosecution should be launched for something in the nature - as these cases may be thought to be - of a political offence. I hope, and I firmly intend, that I shall continue in the exercise of my duty as Attorney-General to exercise the same caution, moderation and restraint because that is the only proper way to approach any question which is a question of exercising a semi-judicial discretion. However, I do assure the House that for my part I am determined that in cases that in my judgment are proper for prosecution in relation to alleged offences against Commonwealth laws, a prosecution will take place. I think I should inform the House that during the last few weeks I authorised investigations into a number of activities. Those investigations have been in progress and are continuing and may lead to situations in which 1 will consider it proper to prosecute for an offence or a number of offences against Commonwealth law. I share fully the concern of the honourable member for Balaclava in this question of law and order. I think all responsible members of the community do. I am very conscious of the public need for the preservation of law and order by all proper means. </para>

The honourable gentleman is aware that there are over 200,000 migrants eligible for naturalisation who have not applied for same. Some of these people are willing to become naturalised but will not take an oath of allegiance to  Her  Majesty the Queen simply because they do not believe in monarchies. Would the honourable gentleman give permission to allow such migrants to take an oath of allegiance to the Commonwealth of Australia as a voluntary alternative? </para>

            <para>- I desire to ask the Minister for Customs and Excise a question which concerns a recent statement by the Minister that Australia is being subjected to rapidly increasing international drug peddling operations and that this tragic and obnoxious trade is not being deterred sufficiently by the light sentences often handed out by the courts to those convicted. Will he confer with the Attorney-General to see if the laws for drug peddling and drug pushing can be altered so as to set a minimum gaol sentence for this offence as well as the present maximum sentence? While these laws are being reviewed, will he also consider amending the law so as to prevent people arrested with drugs in their possession from obtaining bail so that they will not be able to warn the distribution ring of their arrest? </para>

            <para>- I am unable to say to the honourable member after looking at all the cases over the last 2 years that in balance the sentences have been too light, too strong or satisfactory. What I can say and what I have said is that it is causing me deep concern that in a number of decisions recently where the evidence seemed to scream for some severe penalty very light penalties were imposed. In fact, in one case only a fine was administered. Whether or not the Government should consider imposing minimum penalties is a very serious matter. I know that the Attorney-General would share the view I have, and I suspect that the Opposition would also share the view, that responsible Government would impose minimum penalties for offences only where there are overwhelming reasons for so doing. I know that at least some of my State colleagues are becoming concerned at the statistics of the increase of drug smuggling. For example, in the 12 months ended this July we will have seized 20 times more hashish and marihuana than we seized in the preceding 12 months. Only a few weeks ago we seized 50,000 tablets of LSD imported from America, all of which were pre-sold. We have evidence that the importation and consumption of heroin is increasing in Australia. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As far as bail is concerned, this too causes us concern. We regard bail as a right of an accused under the British form of justice. But it is a right that is given to a person after a judge has, I believe, sensibly viewed all of the situation. Not only have the rights of the accused to be protected but the rights of the community must surely take some place in the judge's mind. I am dismayed - I use that term strongly and advisedly - that notwithstanding strenuous opposition by the narcotics squad before the courts, in certain cases where we suspect collusion and that the accused will alert his colleagues and so on, our investigations have been upset because not only has bail been given but also bail amounting to $100 or S200 has been granted for offences that can bring 10 years gaol or a fine of $10,000, or both. For this reason I have asked my Department to submit to me a comprehensive report of the charges, convictions and sentences over the last 2 years so that I can make a balanced judgment on this and consult with my colleague the Attorney-General and the Stale Ministers. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industry. I ask: Has the New South Wales Government yet entered into a formal agreement with the Commonwealth under the terms of the $25m dairy farm reconstruction scheme legislation? If the answer is in the affirmative, when will the scheme begin to operate in New South Wales and what amount of finance will be available in the current financial year for this important rural reconstruction work? I further ask: What can be done to speed .up this important phase of rural reconstruction? </para>

            <para>- There has not been any agreement reached with New South Wales on the dairy farm reconstruction proposals. So far 3 States have accepted the proposals and arrived at mutual conditions. They are Western Australia, Tasmania and Queensland. After negotiations with the Queensland Minister for Lands about 2 weeks ago we reached complete agreement on all aspects and 1 hope that this agreement will be put into effect as soon as possible. A lot of noise has been made in New South Wales either for or against the scheme. In fact, at times I. wonder where that State stands on the proposal. There have been areas of difference between the Commonwealth and New South Wales. One of the areas of difference has been that the State has wanted to apply this money right across the whole dairy industry in New South Wales, including the whole milk area. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">The Commonwealth, which has the responsibility in the manufacturing area of the industry, has rejected this proposal. However, the Commonwealth has been prepared to accept that there is a marginal area where people may have small quotas and it has allowed this money to be available to farmers who have 50% or more of their dairy products sold at manufacturing prices. Therefore, this will overcome quite a bit of the grey area. However, we have said to New South Wales that we would have no objection if moneys which it uses in its present farm build up scheme are applied exclusively to the milk zone. In fact, we would be prepared to make a grant to that State to assist it to use these moneys to write off some of the redundant improvements on properties. However, as yet, I have not been able to get even to negotiating terms with New South Wales. I only hope that I get word shortly so that some satisfactory conclusion can be arrived at. </para>

            <para>- I would like to add something to the answer I gave to the question asked by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. I was not sure of the basis of the question. I do recollect a meeting of the Premiers - not the last one but the one before - in which the Premiers were assured by me that should their Budgets for the financial year which has just ended be severely damaged by failure to collect the money which they had budgeted for and expected to get from receipts duty then the Commonwealth would have to provide assistance to them in some way or find some means of assistance so that they would not have to sustain those losses. I will look at the transcript of the subsequent meetings but it occurred to me that that might have been what was in the honourable member's mind. For the rest, I can only repeat what I said, that I have not a recollection of a subsequent meeting. But I will look at it. </para>

            <para>- During question time today in answer to a question asked by the honourable member for Bennelong I said that I would let the House know as soon as f could what transpired at the interview between embassy officials and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Vrettos</inline> in Athens. Embassy officials spoke to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Vrettos</inline> in his hotel this morning at 5.20 a.m. Athens time. He was not under guard. He accompanied officials to the embassy and informed them that on 3 occasions he bad been interviewed by the Athens police and that he was asked to interview them again at 9.20 this morning. An embassy official will accompany him at the interview. He also informed us that basically he was all right.  His  main problem was associated with his passport which at that moment was not in his possession, lt was in the possession of the Soviet Embassy to which it had been banded in order that a visa could be given so that he would be able to go to Moscow.  His  main worry at the moment was that the visa had not been given because be wanted to leave for Moscow on Friday of this week. The only other information I can give is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Vrettos</inline> is not under guard and is apparently free to move. </para>

During question time, when the Attorney-General was answering a question, i interjected to ask if his remarks included the Press and television personnel who were present during and prior to the entire episode and apparently took no action to prevent the invasion of his home, nor did they come to his assistance.

            <para>- by leave - I wish to provide the House with some further details of the Government's education programme for 1970-71, as outlined by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bury)</inline> in the Budget Speech. In total the programme amounts to an estimated expenditure of $312,357,000 which is a 25% increase on the expenditure of $249,453,000 during 1969-70. This increase in Commonwealth expenditure on education results both from the introduction of new measures as well as the development of programmes which are already in operation. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>This Budget marks the commencement of further assistance to the States for the construction of teachers' colleges. Over the 3 year period to June 1973 $30m in the form of unmatched grants will be provided by the Commonwealth. This is an increase of $6m over that which was made available during the past triennium. An amount of $llm has been allocated to this programme in 1970-71. It is expected that the funds made available during the first stage of the programme will provide 5,500 teacher training places with a further 6,000 places becoming available as a result of the grants during the triennium now commencing. </para>
        <para>Whilst these funds are for construction and extension of State teachers' colleges, at least 10% of the places attributable to the expenditure of these grants will be made available to students not bonded to State Education Departments. The arrangement, therefore, ensures that places are available to students who may wish to teach in non-government schools. I would like to provide honourable members with some details of the projects which will benefit from this extension of the grant. New South Wales proposes to use funds to complete stage 2 of William Balmain, Newcastle and Goulburn Teachers' Colleges. In Victoria, in addition to extending a number of existing colleges, the new La Trobe College will be commenced. In other States the projects will include the commencement of stage 2 of Mt Gravatt College in Queensland, the construction of Murray Park College in South Australia, and of Churchland Teachers' College in Western Australia. In Tasmania the Launceston Teachers' College will be completed. </para>
        <para>The programme forms only part of the Government's policy to improve the size and quality of the teaching force. Honourable members will recall that the Commonwealth is now supporting teacher education in colleges of advanced education in New South Wales, Queensland, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory. Furthermore over 40% of government teacher trainees are in universities for which the Commonwealth shares fully both capital and recurrent expenditure. Expected sharp increases in primary enrolments from 1975 onwards, together with the increasing retention rate in secondary schools and the continued steady reduction in the pupilteacher ratios create a pressing need to increase substantially the number of places available to educate teachers for both government and non-government schools. The Government's policy in teacher education will make a significant contribution towards meeting this need. In addition to supporting teacher education at the primary and secondary levels, the Government is, of course, making grants for the erection of pre-school teachers colleges. </para>
        <para>I have already referred to Government support for teacher training in colleges of advanced education. Teacher education at the Canberra College of Advanced education begins in February 1971. The present plan is for an intake of approximately 100 students in a 3-year course of preparation for pre-school and primary teachers and a somewhat smaller number of university graduates to follow a 1-year course leading to a diploma of education which would prepare them for teaching in secondary schools. </para>
        <para>As a further measure to meet the demand for trained teachers, the Government is establishing, for an initial period of 5 years, a programme of scholarships to encourage students to enter teacher education courses at the Canberra College of Advanced Education. These will be unbonded awards. The recipients will be free to make up their minds at the conclusion of their course as to where they will teach and whether they will teach in government or non-government schools. In addition to payment of fees, the scholarships will provide, subject to a means test, living allowances at the same rate as for Commonwealth advanced education scholarships. A sum of $50,000 has been included in the 1970-71 Budget for this purpose. These various aspects of the Government's policy in teacher education clearly show our preparedness to join with the States in producing an increasing supply of highly qualified teachers. </para>

          <title>Scholarships</title>
          <page.no>144</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>Since the introduction of the Commonwealth scholarship scheme in 1951 the Government has pursued a policy of providing financial assistance for able students to further their studies. Its programme of student assistance has grown and diversified with the development of the Australian educational pattern; this year 27,150 new awards were available under 5 main scholarship schemes. These schemes cover a wide variety of courses at universities, colleges of advanced education, and technical colleges. The courses being taken by scholars range from the final years of secondary schooling to research studies leading to postgraduate degrees. The total number of students receiving assistance under these schemes in 1970 is 61,000 and scholarships expenditure in the last financial year was in excess of S32m. </para>
        <para>The Government regularly reviews the adequacy of its scholarship schemes both in terms of the number of awards available and the scales of benefits provided. An increasing proportion of the appropriate age group is completing secondary schooling and proceeding to tertiary studies and scholarships available have for some years been increased in almost every Budget. The number of students holding Commonwealth university scholarships has risen by 50% from 20,570 in 1966 to 30,510 in 1970. Nevertheless, as I have mentioned, there is an increasing proportion of secondary school students obtaining matriculation qualifications. The continuing high standard of competition among these students for open entrance awards has made it apparent that there are many applicants of high quality at this level who merit assistance. To meet this demand the Government has decided to provide a further 1,000 open entrance university scholarships for 1971, bringing the total number of these awards to 8,500. Taking into account the 4,000 later year awards also available, new Commonwealth university scholarships available in 1971 will now total 12,500. In addition, of course, the Government will be providing 2,500 new advanced education scholarships in 1971. </para>
        <para>Over the years the Government has also had regard to the level of benefits payable under the 2 tertiary schemes, both for scholars at universities and those at colleges of advanced education. Under these 2 schemes all compulsory tuition and other statutory fees are paid on behalf of each scholar. In addition, a living allowance is payable subject to a means test. At present the maximum rates of living allowance are $620 a year for scholars living at home and $1,000 a year for scholars living away from home. I have received representations that a further increase in benefits is desirable, and have studied a detailed report on this matter prepared by the National Union of Australian University Students. I expect to be able to make a statement on this matter before the end of the year. The growth in university enrolments at the undergraduate level has increased the numbers qualifying for and desiring to proceed to postgraduate training in research. </para>
        <para class="block">The Government recognises the value of these studies in providing a flow of highly qualified personnel into academic careers and into positions of responsibility in industry and to meet the need has established a Commonwealth postgraduate scholarship scheme. To date more than 3,800 students have received assistance under this scheme and at 30th June this year there were 1,730 holders of these awards. The Government has decided to increase by 50, to 700, the number of awards available in 1971 under the Commonwealth postgraduate awards scheme. </para>
        <para>Within recent years there has been an important new development in universities not only in Australia but also in Britain and New Zealand in the form of the provision of high level specialised courses related directly to the needs of industry, commerce and government. These courses are at postgraduate level and generally lead to a master's degree; they are normally of 1 year's duration, although in some cases they extend over 2 years. They cover a wide range of fields, such as applied science, engineering, education, business administration, hospital administration, building science, architecture and economics. The Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee has proposed to me that the Commonwealth provide assistance for students taking these courses. The Government agrees that this is now the appropriate time to give additional encouragement to students to take these courses. The Government has therefore decided to establish a scheme of postgraduate awards for students undertaking full time study leading to a master's degree by course work. In 1971, 100 of these new awards will be available. They will be tenable at Australian universities and the benefits payable each year to holders of these awards will be the same as those now provided under the existing Commonwealth postgraduate awards scheme. Students will hold the awards for the duration of the course which they enter, normally from 1 to 2 years. </para>
        <para>It has also been decided that the number of awards available each year under this new scheme may be increased to 125 in 1972 following the establishment of a national school of business administration. I will be saying something of the proposed school of business administration later. The benefits at present payable to holders of Commonwealth postgraduate awards comprise a living allowance at the rate of $2,350 per annum and, where appropriate, a dependants' allowance at the rate of S450 per annum and contributions towards the cost of thesis preparation, travel between cities and settling into new accommodation. As with university and advanced education scholarships, I hope to be able to make an announcement on allowances before the end of the year. Taken together, changes in the scholarship schemes are estimated to cost $ 1.69m in the financial year 1970- 1971 and $3.13m in the full year 1971. The total expenditure on the Commonwealth scholarships schemes is expected to rise from $32.21m in 1969-1970 to an estimated $37.39m in 1970-1971 and $39.45m for the full year 1971. When the effects of the new measures are fully operative, the total cost of the schemes is expected to approach $50m per annum. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>This financial year schools and technical colleges in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory will together receive almost $30m. This expenditure is necessary to meet the need arising from a rapid expansion of enrolments. Tn 1969 enrolments in Government primary and secondary schools in the Australian Capital Territory were 50% above those for 1965 while the comparable increase for the Northern Territory was 60%. These rates of increase are well above that for Government schools in the 6 States which rose by 14% over the period. Honourable members will be aware of the decision of the South Australian Government to withdraw, over a period of 5 years, from the staffing of Northern Territory schools. I hope to be in a position later in the year to outline to Parliament the steps we believe are necessary for the Commonwealth to take as a result of this decision. We are working closely with the South Australian authorities to ensure that the interests of pupils and teachers are safeguarded. </para>
        <para>The Government is conscious of the need to provide for a wider range of educational facilities in the Northern Territory and with this in mind it has accepted the recommendations contained in the first report of the Planning Committee which was established last year to advise the Government on the development of a community college in Darwin. I believe that the college will provide great assistance to developing industries in the Northern Territory and will also enable the technical and professional knowledge of Territory workers to be regularly updated. Significant expenditure on the college will not be incurred in this financial year but, as honourable members realise, the development of the college has substantial implications for the future financing of education in the Northern Territory. </para>

        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>The proposed Commonwealth expenditure during the financial year on universities and colleges of advanced education reflects its support for the continued expansion of tertiary education facilities. Grants to colleges of advanced education are expected to total almost $40m, which is more than 75% above the figure for 1969- 1970, while those to universities will total approximately $1 10m, as compared with just under $94m during the past financial year. With respect to the colleges, a significant development for which funds will be provided in the current financial year is the provision of residential accommodation at institutions in country areas. We are supporting the construction of these facilities at colleges in Toowoomba and Rockhampton in Queensland. Wagga and Bathurst in New South Wales, Bendigo and Ballarat in Victoria, the Roseworthy Agricultural College in South Australia and at the Kalgoorlie School of Mines in Western Australia. Residential accommodation will also be provided at the new Agricultural College at Orange in New South Wales, which will be commenced during the financial year. This provision will enable colleges in country areas to be viable institutions and to serve regions rather than particular cities. </para>
        <para>I would like to take this opportunity to mention briefly the recent inquiry into the future provision of postgraduate education in business management and administration in Australia. The report of the Committee which undertook this inquiry has recently been made public. Among the Committee's recommendations was the establishment of 1 national school of the highest quality. The Committee considered that it would be unwise at this juncture to attempt to establish more than 1 national school because of the scarcity of first class teaching staff and the heavy capital and recurrent costs involved. It recommended that this national school be placed in the University of New South Wales. It proposes that the school should aim at a 2 year full time course producing approximately 70 master of business administration graduates annually and should conduct annually 2 or 3 executive programmes of 8 to 10 weeks' duration. The school should also conduct a small Ph.D. programme and maintain a significant output of research. The Commonwealth accepts the Committee's recommendations in principle and is proceeding to discussions with industry and with the New South Wales Government and the University of New South Wales, concerning the establishment of a national graduate school of business administration. </para>

        <para>During the autumn session I gave the House details of the new Commonwealth assistance for educational research. Under the programme support will be given for research projects, for the communication and application of research findings and towards measures for the training of research personnel. This will be the first year of the new scheme and a sum of $250,000 has been included in the Budget for this purpose. This will also be the first full year of the new Commonwealth measure for assisting the education of migrant children. Honourable members will recall that details of the scheme were announced early this year by the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch).</inline> Under it. assistance will be given in meeting the salary costs of teachers employed to teach migrant children in special classes and the necessary supervisory staff; special teaching courses for teachers in the method of teaching English as a foreign language; the provision of approved capital equipment of the language laboratory type for special classes; and the provision of suitable teaching and learning materials.

        <para class="block">Nation-wide Survey of Educational Needs </para>
        <para>It will be recalled that the Australian Education Council, which comprises the 6 State Ministers for Education, has during the past year been involved in a survey of educational needs over the next 5 years. Independent schools have also been involved. The Commonwealth has co-operated in the survey, in particular in respect of the future educational needs of the two territories. The results of the survey of needs of government schools were discussed at a special meeting of the Australian Education Council I attended in late May. The Ministers agreed to submit the findings of the survey to their respective governments. </para>
        <para>The States' needs in education formed a part of the Premiers' Conference and Loan Council discussions and reference was made to the survey. As a result of the new agreement for financial assistance grants from the Commonwealth, the States will receive almost $800m more during the next 5 years than would have been provided under the previous agreement. These additional funds will greatly improve the capacity of the States to meet their responsibilities in the field of education. The Commonwealth is prepared to discuss the information disclosed by the survey of government schools and teachers' colleges against the background of the intentions of the States themselves. These talks would be most appropriately at the Prime Minister/Premier level. Consideration requires to be given also to the needs of the independent schools, which are being assessed separately, and for which detailed material is not yet available. As to the publication of a report of the survey, I understand that the State Ministers are to meet on Friday of this week to discuss this matter and it is expected that a report will be released shortly after that. </para>

            <para>- The Opposition welcomes the statement that has been made by the Minister for Education and Science <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr N. H. Bowen).</inline> We welcome, of course, the 25% increase in Commonwealth expenditure on education but it may well be that the most significant part of the statement that has been made by the Minister occurs as late as page 11. There, under what is a very dramatic heading for anybody who remembers the controversies of the last decade, we have in a Government statement a heading 'Nation-wide Survey of Educational Needs'. I am sure all honourable members who have spent the last decade in this Parliament will know how frequently we on the Opposition side have asked for a nation-wide survey of educational needs. The Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Forbes)</inline> who will act as Minister for Education and Science during the absence of the Minister for Education and Science at a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation meeting told us in the House that the Commonwealth would not conduct a survey of educational needs because if it did it would commit the Commonwealth Government necessarily to heavy expenditures because of the expectations it would raise. We now have the State Ministers for Education forming a body which will make a survey of Australian educational needs and that, if it is actually implemented and carried out, redeems any weaknesses that there may be in this paper. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The standing weakness In the Government's statement on education is that it is another instalment in a series of piecemeal interventions into education instead of a systematic attack. It is true that as the Commonwealths intervention is increasing, the sporadic nature of its forays is ceasing to be a feature of its policy. It sporadically came into school libaries and it sporadically gave grants for private secondary schools. It has now come more significantly into teacher training. I hope that the Minister's expectations about teacher training will be realised. I have not the least doubt that the quality of teaching will be raised as a result of the action which the Minister foreshadows. However, I have the gravest doubt about the quantity of teachers. In some of the States 47% of those who get a tertiary education get a tertiary education in teachers' colleges and it is doubtful if a higher percentage of young people than that is attracted to the profession. The Minister has pointed out some of the difficulties in relation to this. There will be a sharp increase in primary enrolments. There will be an increasing retention rate of students in secondary schools. There is a continued steady reduction in the pupil/  teacher ratio. 1 feel that any additional teachers we get may well be cancelled out as a result of these other factors mentioned by the Minister. </para>
          <para>The Commonwealth is entering the field of MBA, Masters of Business Administration, through 1 university, the University of New South Wales. It has recognised by this action a special need - a special weakness, if you like - in Australian commercial education. I wish that in all its teacher scholarships it would look at other special weaknesses. A special weakness with a much more general effect is the shortage of teachers of science and mathematics, if the Commonwealth would grant special teaching scholarships in science and mathematics it would be remedying a serious weakness developing in high school education. Surveys of education around the world have shown that Australia is deficient in its scientific and mathematical education and I do not need to stress to the House that this has significance for all education and for industry afterwards, because weaknesses in scientific and mathematical education depriving us of the numbers of students who should be getting advanced scientific and mathematical education in universities do have adverse industrial effects quite apart from Australia's particular need for trained scientists. The teachers who can give the zest for that subject in the decisive secondary school period when many young people are making their decisions about the sort of courses they will undertake are extremely significant. </para>
          <para>The news given by the Minister about the South Australian Government's withdrawal from providing teachers for the Northern Territory is extremely important and it raises the question of the need for the Commonwealth to have its own teachers colleges, which it is doing to some extent with the College of Advanced Education, and to undertake seriously teacher training for its territories and for Papua and New Guinea. So long as the Commonwealth is beholden to the State of New South Wales for the staffing of schools in the Australian Capital Territory, and, even more importantly, so long as it is beholden to the State of South Australia for the staffing of schools in the Northern Territory, to that extent the Commonwealth's capacity to vary its educational policy is limited. It is significant that in the same breath as the Minister is announcing South Australia's gradual withdrawal from the staffing of schools in the Northern Territory he is announcing a very welcome diversification of Commonwealth educational policy and activity in the Northern Territory in the founding of a new educational institution in Darwin. If the Commonwealth has its own trained teachers and really takes full responsibility for education in its own territories it can make all the decisions that are needed for the type of education that should be offered in those territories. I think that there are special needs in the Northern Territory in particular because the children living there, in contrast with those living in the Australian Capital Territory, do suffer serious educational disabilities because of the very nature of the Northern Territory. </para>
          <para>The Minister's statement on the special aid being given to the States in relation to migrant children is also very welcome. The Commonwealth, of course, by its migration policy has created a crisis for the States. There is extreme difficulty in teaching children who do not have any English, children who do not have English as their background language yet come into Australian schools. However, the disabilities that the Minister mentioned also apply to another category of Australian children in many areas and special assistance to the States for them would have been very welcome. I am referring, of course, to Aboriginal children. They suffer great disabilities in coming from the kind of background that they have into schools which have the orientation that our schools have. They need special help, and in areas where there are numbers of Aboriginal children it would be good Commonwealth policy to give the States the special assistance that they need to help those children as well as migrant children. </para>
          <para>The Minister's remarks on teachers colleges follow very much along the lines of a statement he made earlier this year. His statement on scholarships is welcome. I hope that his remarks in relation to the National Union of Australian University Students, it having made certain submissions to him about scholarships, and his indication that he will consider them later in the year, do. not raise the hopes of the students falsely. The Minister said: </para>

Generally speaking, we welcome very warmly the Minister's statement. We add the hope that the nationwide survey of educational needs will mark the end of sporadic Commonwealth intervention in the field of education and lead to much more systematic assistance to education. </para>

            <para>- The latest available figures relating to the Australian economy show the very serious position of the rural sector of Australia, lt does not matter how much one might try to disguise it, the condition can be described only as serious. This fact was confirmed only last night in the papers released by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bury).</inline> As those papers will be discussed in detail at a later stage I shall 'refer only to the relevant figures to prove the point that the farming sector of Australia, as distinct from the non-farming sector, is in a serious plight. Taking the last 4 years as an example, the gross national product of the farming sector at factor cost has decreased by $200m. The contrast in the non-farming sector is remarkable. That sector has shown an increase in the gross national product in the same period of 4 years of close to $7,000m. Those figures alone show clearly the very serious position in which primary industry finds. itself and the widening gap between the rural sector and secondary industry. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Words cannot describe the incompetence which has been displayed by the Government in its overall approach to rural Australia. At no time since the depression 40 years ago has rural Australia been in such an economic mess. Positive and courageous leadership in primary industry seems to have disappeared. Despite the criticism of primary producers throughout Australia the Government has failed in a dismal and even in a shocking manner to face the problems which exist and to promote and implement positive policies. The blame for the mess in which primary industry finds itself today must be borne by the Federal Government. The Opposition cannot be blamed because this Government has been in office for over 20 years. One of the main reasons why primary industry is in such a mess is that the Government has refused consistently to face the facts relating to international trade and the policies of overseas countries with regard to agricultural marketing, as well as the facts relating to domestic policies in Australia and those factors which are causing an insidious increase in costs and the cost price spiral. </para>
          <para>The Government has allowed rural Australia to drift for year after year until now a crisis with frightening ramifications has emerged. We have a crisis in wool, a crisis in wheat, a crisis in dairying and, of course, a crisis in drought. Our export apple and pear industry is verging on crisis. Other aspects of primary industry are also involved. We have a crisis in the meat industry with regard to meat workers and meat inspectors which must be faced. This could grow into a very serious problem in the immediate future. The Government has a lot to say about strikes. There is one sector of the work force which would have every justification in striking. I refer to meat inspectors. Lel us hope that the Government will act positively to avert industrial problems in this field. </para>
          <para>My investigations have shown that the crisis that already exists in this industry could worsen. On Monday morning there were reports in the Press of another crisis. The statement by the Leader of the Australian Country Party who is Minister for Trade and Industry was perhaps the gloomiest I had read for many a day. He reminded us that one-third of our exports of sugar go to Great Britain. The Minister said that the sugar industry could face serious problems. He also mentioned meat and canned fruits. Is this Government to sit back and wait until Britain joins the European Economic Community before it acts to protect our rural industries? lt is all right to say that Britain may not join the EEC but the Australian Government and the industries which would be involved if Britain did enter the EEC cannot afford to sit back and wait. We should act now. After all, we have known for a long time that a decision on Britain's entry to the </para>
          <para class="block">EEC was pending. One of the first things that the Australian Government must have is a firm decision as 10 where Britain stands in regard to the Australian agricultural trade. The sooner this Government ascertains Britain's policy the better for all concerned. </para>
          <para>The Government's whole approach to primary industry is analogous to its approach to drought. In 21 years of power the Government has not formulated a constructive national drought policy. The policy of the Government is to wait until a drought occurs and then try to solve the problem by handouts to the States. 1 cannot stress too strongly the importance of the rural sector to the Australian economy. Over a long period of years primary industry has been the financial and economic backbone of this nation and it will continue to be the backbone in the future. To put it bluntly, the economic health of this nation is dependent on prima rj' industry and the mineral industry. Should Australia's export income sector fail the result would be wholesale unemployment in almost every major secondary industry in Australia, most of which are located in the cities. </para>

              <para>-  You are a supporter of the Government. The wool fiasco is a glaring example of this Government's attitude towards primary industry. Five years ago the wool industry experts recommended a reserve price scheme. The honourable member for Curtin has interjected and very shortly in this session I will test the morale and courage of the Country Party on the subject of wool. When the reserve price scheme was put forward it resulted in organised opposition by the vested interests and ruthless campaigns against the wool growers. Nothing was done by the Government after it was rejected. The Government has, over a number of years, consistently blamed the wool industry for not grasping the nettle and today we are in exactly the same position. After 5 years of study by the Government, and yet another expert report the Government still refuses to act on wool. We see the efforts of the Liberal Party to sabotage the wool marketing scheme just as it sabotaged the reserve price scheme. What will the Country Party do about this? Will it sit back and take it as it has done every other year when there has been a crisis in rural industry? </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The Country Party appears to be frightened by the numerically powerful Liberal Party which without doubt represents the vested interests, the middle man, the overseas cartels and the very big growers who are in a position to dictate their own terms. What does the Government propose to do about wool? Surely it will not again submit the question of a single marketing authority to a referendum. As I have said before, if the Country Party is not prepared to act the Opposition will have no hesitation in putting the Country Party on the spot at a later stage and testing it before the people of Australia. How far is the Country Party prepared to act in defiance of the Liberals, who are doing everything possible to sabotage the wool industry in the marketing field? </para>
          <para>Reconstruction of the wool industry is urgently required. Handouts simply delay the inevitable. What I mean by reconstruction is a complete re-organisation of the marketing and handling of wool and a forceful approach to the policies of overseas shipping companies with respect to freight rates. Let us not procrastinate any longer. The Government has had many years in which to act. It has had the advice of the best experts available, lt has the backing of the rank and file of the industry. Still we have no positive statement as to the Government's intentions. We are all aware that there is a crisis in the wool industry. There is an urgent need to face up to the future prospects of wool. Let us have the truth. If it is considered that we must scale down our level of production of certain courser classes of wool, the Government should say so. If we have to increase our production of finer wools let the Government say so and pursue policies which will achieve this objective. Whatever happens, we must have action; we must have policies. </para>
          <para>As I see the position, the greatest threat to wool and to every export primary industry are the vicious and insidious domestic policies which promote the cost price spiral and encourage the forces of inflation in this country. The wages and materials cost price problem is eroding the economic heart of our export industries. If costs continue to increase at their present rate the export minerals industry will be in trouble. The rumblings are already in evidence. Action to deal with the cost price squeeze in export industries must be regarded as one of our most important priorities. The Government has done nothing in the present Budget to control costs. Every manufacturer in Australia, heavily protected by tariffs, is free to raise his prices when workers obtain increased wages through arbitration. </para>
          <para>In no primary industry has the Government's failure to exhibit leadership been more apparent than in the butter industry. By his own admission the Minister for Trade and Industry has for 10 years warned the industry that it would have to do something to reduce butter production. But Australia is increasing its production of butter. The Government says that it does not have control over production. It controls the purse strings. It controls the level of subsidy, and under equalisation it has widesweeping powers. The Government must take action to curtail butter production. The wheat industry has had the same problem of over-production. For 3 years prior to the present crisis facing the wheat industry the rumblings were present. But the Government waited until the crisis occurred. </para>
          <para>Despite the current drought conditions Australia will have at the end of this year a carryover of approximately 280 million bushels of wheat and at the end of next season the carryover, notwithstanding the drought, will- be approximately 170 million bushels. What is the Government doing with these surpluses? The Country Party is desperately kicking the mythical Communist can at every opportunity. Yet that same Party adopts, the hypocritical attitude of selling wheat to Communist China at a price .lower than is charged to owners of starving stock in Australia. I challenge the Government to disprove my statement. The Labor Party's policy is to marry surplus grains production and our livestock. We all know that certain areas in Australia are susceptible to drought, yet we see hundreds of millions of bushels of unsaleable wheat attacked by vermin. At the same time as this is happening we find hundreds of thousands of sheep and cattle dying for the want of feed grains. It would appear as though my time has almost expired. I thought I had more time at my disposal. I conclude by saying that emergency grants are essential for the construction of desperately needed small scale water schemes for people, industry and established farmers whose economic livelihood is being threatened. I shall give 2 excellent examples. Day after day many people in Giru have had to fetch their water in buckets. Mt Morgan, where industry is involved, is another example. Large grandiose schemes are not needed at this point of time. All that is needed is a small scheme which will enable the people of these areas to survive economically. If any honourable member wants to ridicule my suggestion he should go to Giru and he will see what the farmers have to say. The wives of many farmers are going to the water points and carting buckets of clean water. This is an example of the sort of thing that is going on. Not a lot of money would be involved in overcoming this problem. A strategically located pipeline is a first priority. Why does the Government not act? </para>

            <para>-  We have just listened to the shadow Minister for Primary Industry speaking for the Opposition on this matter of public importance concerning the state of rural industries, the need for reconstruction and the drought problem. Although he spoke for 15 minutes I did not hear him offer any new suggestions or say one thing that we do not know already. Rural industries are facing serious problems. I think the most penetrating part of the speech of the honourable member for Dawson <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Patterson)</inline> is what he did not say. He did not offer one suggestion as to how these problems might be tackled. </para>

              <para>- I did listen. During the past 2 or 3 months the honourable member has been roaming around Australia waving his arms about and saying vaguely that we must have a national policy, but that is as far as he has gone. There cannot be one all-embracing agricultural policy because the problems are vast and differ from industry to industry. Therefore it is necessary to have a wide range of policies for each sector of primary industry. There is no relationship between eggs, beef, cotton, coarse grains, apples and wool. Each one has to be examined separately and given whatever assistance is possible. But there are limitations on the assistance which can be given. There are financial limitations on the assistance which can be given by the Commonwealth and the States and there are constitutional limitations on what the Commonwealth can do. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I think it is unfair to take the point of view that there has been no leadership shown or courageous action taken because there have been more radical moves in the field of agriculture during the past 2 years than this country has ever known. For example, a wheat quota scheme - but it did not get much support from the Opposition - has been introduced. In fact, the honourable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Grassby)</inline> did everything possible to try to sabotage the wheat quota scheme. </para>

              <para>- It does not seem as though this is the policy of the Australian Labor Party, but we will let the honourable member for Riverina speak for himself. The Government has brought about an international sugar agreement which will control the amount of sugar going on to the residual world market and it has limited Australia's production accordingly. The Government has brought about an international grains arrangement in an endeavour to achieve the orderly marketing of grain. It has also got the dairying industry together for the first time in an endeavour *o impose certain restrictions on production. A new system has been introduced whereby a quota is applied to each State in an attempt to limit the total production to 220,000 tons. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The Government has also entered into a new field - farm reconstruction - which has received little support from some members of the Opposition. I exclude the honourable member for Dawson because he has been a strong advocate right through for farm reconstruction, but whispering campaigns have been conducted against it by some honourable members opposite. These </para>
          <para>20734/70- R.2 </para>
          <para class="block">honourable members have gone round the countryside saying: 'The Minister for Primary Industry and the Government are only concerned about getting rid of the small farmers. They want to depopulate country areas. They do not care about the small farmers'. These honourable members have been saying this despite the fact that the whole objective of the Government's dairy farm reconstruction proposals has been to maintain in the industry those people who wish to stay and give those who wish to leave it an alternative to diversify to other forms of production. Many measures have been taken to attack the problems which exist in every area of agriculture. So, any remarks to the effect that the Government is not concerned, worried or sympathetic are not genuine. The Government is concerned and it will continue to do everything possible to meet the problems which arise whenever they arise. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Dawson said that all the Government can talk about is sir ikes. A very serious strike is pending amongst meat inspectors in the meat industry. I have acknowledged that this is a serious situation. In fact, the honourable member for Gellibrand <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Mclvor)</inline> has contacted me many times about the problems of the large number of employees who work in the many meat works in his electorate. We have gone to no end of trouble to 117 to resolve the problem of insufficient meat inspectors by trying to improve the working conditions and wages of meat inspectors. Recently the Public Service Board, after negotiations with the meat inspectors, declared that all meat inspectors would become permanent Commonwealth employees and that many of them would be upgraded to second grade employees. However, the one problem which the Government has not been able to resolve is that of their opportunity to take their recreation leave. The rather shameful situation exists whereby some meat inspectors have not been on recreation leave for 3, 4 or 5 years because the Government has not been able to recruit sufficient numbers to make up for those who have left the industry. </para>
          <para>Following recent negotiations between the Government and the meat industry agreement was reached to slow up the killing rate so that meat inspectors would be able to take their recreation leave and thereby avoid the national strike which was pending amongst the meat inspectors. The agreement of the meat industry was obtained. Unfortunately, the works and the unions are now complaining because some people have to work shorter hours and cannot have the same throughput. In fact, some employees have had to be put off. But the Government has done its best as a responsible government and the Department of Primary Industry has done its best as a responsible department to resolve this problem and to try to spread its impact as much as possible across Australia so that individual meat works will not be penalised. But to talk of the Government encouraging strikes is a case of the pot calling the kettle black. If there is one sector cf the Australian community which is putting an impost on primary producers it is the leaders of the industrial unions, who seem to call on strikes at any time. </para>
          <para>A big problem facing primary industries is the cost price squeeze. There are some areas in which it is impossible for the Government to rectify the problems. I refer to the decline in world prices, the lack of access to different markets in the world because of tariff barriers, quotas and embargoes and substitutes replacing some of our agricultural products. The green revolution has resulted in an increase in the production of certain types of grains for which there are no longer big enough markets. The Government cannot do anything about this sort of thing except try to buffer their impact. But a government and a nation should be conscious of the need to do something about the cost increases which are occurring. The Budget which was brought down in this House last night was a deflationary one. There is a very large domestic surplus in it in an attempt to reduce liquidity in the economy. We have been compelled, reluctantly, to increase interest rates, to make money tighter in order to dampen down the tremendous demand that is developing in the economy. Any party which supports a proposal for shorter working hours can only bring absolute disaster to the primary industries which are battling for survival today. They are being strangled by increasing costs. The  President  of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke,</inline> has publicly said that he is not going to take any notice of the wage impact on primary industries. What concern or sympathy for primary industries can there be amongst the Opposition when the leader of the unions which Opposition members come into this Parliament to represent takes this sort of attitude? It is sheer hypocrisy for members of the Opposition to get up and criticise the Government for the wage increases and the general cost increases which are having such an impact on the primary producers. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Dawson mentioned his concern about the drought in northern Australia, mainly in northern New South Wales and Queensland although it has also been very severe in Western Australia during the past 12 months. Fortunately in some regions of that State the situation has eased somewhat. To say that the Government has no national policy on drought is again quite unfair. For dealing with drought it has established a set routine which did not exist until 3 or 4 years ago when we had a very severe drought in New South Wales and Queensland. The understanding between the State governments and the Commonwealth Government is that the first impact of drought will be met by the States. The incidence of drought can be regionalised. When the drought spreads and takes in a large part of the State or is Statewide the State governments come to the Commonwealth and make a request and we match them dollar for dollar. When the position is reached that the States can no longer continue their contributions the Commonwealth comes in and provides all the necessary money. Last year in Queensland the Commonwealth provided $14m. This year already it is committed to providing $llm for Queensland. On both occasions the Queensland Government has had to provide only the first $2m to match $2m provided by the Commonwealth. </para>
          <para>The drought money is being provided to help relieve the freight impost on fodder and also the cost of moving stock into and out of affected areas. Loans are made available for carry-on finance. The amounts made available to Queensland farmers have been increased this year. In the case of a small farmer the amount has increased from $6,000 to $10,000. In the case of a larger farmer it has gone from $10,000 to $16,000. Re-stocking finance has been increased from $10,000 to $20,000. The Government has met every reasonable request from the Queensland Government. This year an additional request has been made for money for the reconstruction of properties in Queensland. So that it would be able to set up a reconstruction board or other authority the State requested the Commonwealth to amend the Bankruptcy Act. 1 would like to inform the House that the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hughes)</inline> has been examining this matter very closely in relation to amendments to the Bankruptcy Act. He has before the Government at the moment a submission that the necessary amendment be made. 1 hope that very soon - in the present session if possible - the amendment will be made, thus enabling the Queensland Government to proceed with the establishment of such a board to carry out the reconstruction. </para>
          <para>As mentioned last night in the speech of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bury),</inline> I and my Department have been given the responsibility of examining in detail the general indebtedness of rural properties in Australia and of coming forward with recommendations as to how this problem might best be tackled, whether through Commonwealth agencies or on a State basis. 1 assure the House that this matter will be handled as urgently as possible as I believe that it is the most important, immediate aspect of the problem of rural industries and it must be thoroughly examined. </para>

            <para>- 1 support the motion moved by the Opposition to direct the attention of the Parliament to the problems of the countryside. The honourable member for Dawson <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Patterson)</inline> put the facts and the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> said: We know them.' The Opposition then asked for further action and the Minister for Primary Industry said: 'We have done a great deal.' To illustrate the achievements of the Government and himself in the discharge of his duties he said: 'Look at what we have done with dairying. Look at our achievement there. Look at the progress we have made in reaching towards and achieving reconstruction.' That is an incredibly different story from the one that was put forward by the Minister for Lands in the Liberal-Country Party administration in New South Wales who, 1 might say. did not appreciate the reference by the Commonwealth Minister to the dairy industry being in absolute chaos, which the Minister for Primary Industry put down to gutless State politicians. In rebutting that, the Minister for Lands in New South Wales said: </para>

In fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony,</inline> either because of ignorance or rudeness, has ignored the Ministers in each Slate responsible for reconstruction schemes and keeps contacting . . . the wrong Ministers.

          <para class="block">So much for the problems of the countryside. They are dismissed in a single sentence and the nation is told in the next sentence that we are not to worry too much because everything else is really all right. One half of the countryside is in a state of depression because of drought and the other half because of the Government's disastrous policies on primary products. It is through scandalous incompetence that sheep are dying in the drought areas of Queensland and New South Wales for lack of feed while wheat is being left in temporary storages and in many cases providing a monumental feast for mice and weevils. Surely the Federal Government can use some of its technologies and sophisticated know-how to get to grips with the problems instead of saying that it will through the ludicrous and lengthy procedure of giving money to the States, which will give money to an agency, which will lend money to the farmer - who cannot afford any more loans - to buy wheat which is under the Commonwealth's control. This chain of bureaucracy causes tragic delays, means that money is eaten up in administrative procedures and the farmer is loaded with more d:bts, when all he wants in many cases is access to grain to feed stock. Surely to goodness we have enough know-how to break this chain and cycle of democracy and get the job done. </para>

              <para>- Yes. I do not really think it is democracy. I apologise for my slip of the tongue. I do not think it is beyond the democratic processes of the Government to break what I have just described as a meaningless chain of bureaucracy. After all, how can the Government claim to be helping drought areas when the need is for feed wheat and when feed wheat is available at prices higher than those we charge China? This is just not sound, it is not good and it is not just. The drought in some areas is the worst on record. It is worse than in 1965. But the financial position of the countryside is much worse. At the present moment, of course, we have a compounding of all the problems. We have drought and we have policies touching on wheat and wool. The Minister went on to defend his decision and the decision of his Government to introduce restrictions on wheat in the middle of a season. </para>

              <para>- I do not, and the honourable member should know that by the record in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales. The Minister brought in restrictions, 1 might say, based on a national wheat ration which we did not meet. Then he refused to take in what was available. He refused to face the facts of black market trading and still does not face them to this day. In doing this, of course, he opened a market at 60c, and this dragged down the price of every grain. Today that market is rising to 80c, which is an indication of need and demand. </para>

              <para>- The honourable member should just be careful. After all, I can say a few words about who will report whom for what. One of the things I think we ought to do in relation to wheat is to say quite bluntly and definitely that it is no credit to the Government that unpaid for wheat is being eaten by mice and weevils in major and temporary storages. It is there despite the fact that we did not reach our national quota last season. We will not meet it next season. But there is wheat there at the present time. If we take the Government's word that the surpluses are tremendous then surely to goodness the one thing the Minister ought to do - I talk to the Minister particularly - is to bring the feed wheat to the stomachs of the stock that need it. That should not be beyond our ability at this time. When we turn to the future, if he is asking me whether we should have an orderly development of the wheat industry, my answer is yes, but it should not be based on panic decisions which are made at the last moment in the middle of a season, and it should not result in bringing in a system such as the one in New South Wales which the New South Wales Minister admitted to a meeting of 300 growers was rotten to the core because of the haste in which it was conceived and implemented. </para>

          <para>The situation in relation to wool is extraordinary. We have wool and everyone has said it is still in great demand. After months of waiting a handout is being proposed which will average out at between $200 and S300 per head, which is not enough to feed the chooks on a good size property. If this is the solution to the problems of the wool industry I would suggest it would be rejected by the majority of the people in the wool industry. The wool grower has not asked for handouts. He has not asked for anybody's charity. What growers have asked for unanimously - I say it has been asked for unanimously by the rank and file, and I stand to be corrected on it - is a proper marketing system, a just price and an end to the exploitation of his product to enrich others at his expense. </para>

The honourable member who just interjected made one contribution to the wheat debate in which he advocated that people who had been to see Federal members of Parliament about problems of selling over quota wheat should be reported to the authorities. He should be thoroughly ashamed of himself. Let us have a look at the situation today in relation to wool. The Government promised urgent action back in </para>

          <para class="block">April. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> indicated this. What have we got? We have in fact no firm proposal before the Parliament now. We have in fact, apparently, a deaf ear to what the woo! growers have put up through their organisations and through major meetings. They have said that they want a change, a reformation, in the marketing system. In his reply on an urgent matter the Minister made no reference, no commitment, to it at all. Yet he comes here regularly and tells us: 'Whatever the industry wants we shall do.' We are waiting. Our policies are clear. They have been spelt out and I know the Minister has had the privilege of reading them in detail. 1 wanted to draw attention to the fact, in relation to wheat particularly, that because of the circumstances of the introduction of quotas last season we have a moral duty now to take in and to pay $1.10 first advance on all wheat that has been either delivered or is awaiting delivery. That should be done. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bury),</inline> who is not known for his generosity, at least has made sufficient money available to do this. There should be a tearing up at the present time of the bits of paper which say that people should be restricted this year when in fact the Minister has admitted that we have a roaring drought in most of the country. So those who are able surely to goodness should be permitted to grow and deliver with confidence and be paid. The 2 great needs of the countryside today are collateral and confidence. The Government could easily give the confidence by making firm decisions in relation to 2 matters alone, f will not comment on the dairy industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lewis</inline> in New South Wales put that to the Minister and the Minister may reply to him directly. The Government could deal with wheat in a courageous way. It could deal with the drought by breaking the cycle of bureaucracy to which I have referred and it could take its decisions to the wool industry by reforming it now. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- I was a farmer before I became a member of Parliament. I know from experience where the harrow tooth point goes. If the honourable members for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Grassby)</inline> and Dawson <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Patterson)</inline> had been farmers and known what it is like to make <inline font-style="italic">decisions</inline> on which a living depends they would scorn to come into the House today and make the kind of political capital claptrap that we have heard. These are grievous times in which we are living. The problems that face us can be faced by a people and a Parliament that tackle their problems and think about them but do not abuse the opportunities to do that by coming in and performing in this way. We do face a problem of reconstruction. I think I ought to try to help solve it instead of carrying on as if I was in a circus. We are facing real and serious problems. Land aggregation is one and debt reconstruction is another. The object of the exercise, I presume, is to make viable economic units. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Let us look at this problem of land aggregation, lt will mean bigger economic units. In simple terms, it will mean that farms will become bigger. One of the fundamental reasons for this is that tractors have become bigger. We had farms of a certain size when we had horse teams. Honourable members opposite would not know that, but this is the kind of thing that governs the size of farms. As tractors came in the economic size of farms became bigger. Anybody who does not recognise this is just blinking the facts of life. I do not think we will have any great big takeover by company farms. I know that the economic size family farms in Australia will out-perform, in animal production at least and often in grain production, any large scale company farm. There are lots of advantages to be gained from living on your own property, which honourable members opposite probably do not know about. We go out to see our stock in the morning and we do not say: '1 will conic in and have a look at that ewe tomorrow.' We go out and attend to it. We try to tackle the problem of reconstruction, and the dairy scheme is a gallant attempt by the Minister to do this. We have done it before in the marginal land scheme in the States. </para>
          <para>I think we all ought to take a little time off and go back and look at the problems and try to puzzle out how we can adjust our past performance to our present situation, instead of running around with our mouths open. It will be difficult. If it was not difficult it would have been done years ago. One of the really difficult parts will be the decentralisation that will have to accompany it, because one of the things that is inevitable in the process is that some of the people will leave the farm. Where will they go? I hope they will not go to the cities. If we as a Parliament settle down, instead of slinging mud at one another, to work out some way of getting people economically and sensibly out of the city and not forcing these people whose properties have been reconstructed into the city we will be making a contribution. </para>
          <para>We would also be making a contribution if we tackled the problem of credit adjustments. As with so many other things, it is easy to talk about this subject. But there is something fundamentally difficult about deciding what kind of credit structure would really suit the industry. I do not know the answer and I do not suppose many people in this House do. But I think that one of the things we should continually be turning orr minds to is a long term credit scheme, i do not think that subsidy of interest rates would be necessary in many cases. But let us have longer term finance for development and aggregations. It is easy to talk about these matters. It is easy to make a slick speech about what one would like to do. However, all I am saying is that the problems of the farming community are hard to resolve. The reason the problems still exist is that they are hard to solve. </para>
          <para>I should now like to say something about reconstruction. How big should a sheep unit be? I do not know. How big should a sheep and mixed grain unit be? No-one knows. As a community we have to get to work and ascertain what kind of model reconstruction scheme we ought to have. I recommend to the Government and to the House that as part of that process we ought continually to look to the establishment of a rural industries board. We have to examine this question. We need to get the same kind of economic advice on rural matters as is given to secondary industry by the Tariff Board. We need to know what basis should be adopted for reconstruction. I hope that the Government will examine again the question of establishing a rural industries board. We also have to consider the administration of the reconstruction scheme. It is easy to say: Well, someone has to do it'. Eventually someone will have to do it. However, I have said in this House before that this will not be a job for the Government; it will be a job for the Government to make finance available but an outside institution will have to implement the reconstruction decisions. </para>
          <para>One other thing ought to be said about reconstruction. It is easy to say that on one hand we should have a policy that farms ought to be bigger and on the other hand a policy that farms should be made smaller. I would like to quote an address given by Professor Lewis last Saturday at the National Rural Policy Symposium in Canberra. Professor Lewis said: </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">I add in brackets here the words 'and reconstruction' -  it would be difficult to improve on a programme of moving excess people out of agriculture with the one hand and, with the other hand, bringing new entrants into agriculture by means of closer settlement, land development and irrigation projects. </para>
          <para class="block">It is said that he is not a farmer. I did not know that academics are always wrong. The other thing we obviously have to be careful about is to use subsidies carefully when subsidies are given. Subsidies carelessly used may encourage people to stay in an industry when they may be tempted to get out of it. </para>
          <para>I would now like to get back to drought. I happen to live in the driest State of the driest continent in the world. I suppose I have made more ensilage than most people in Australia. I happen to recognise that the fundamental person to tackle the problem of drought is the farmer himself. He is the man best equipped to tackle it. It is the Government's job and duty to see that every possible incentive is given to the farmer. This can be done by way of taxation concessions and other forms of help. It is true that the farmer has had such help and I would like to compliment the Government on the wisdom of this assistance. Let us get away from the idea that anyone other than the farmer can tackle the farmer's problems and the problem of drought. In most instances he is the one best equipped to tackle them. However, the drought is our problem as well. I speak as one who knows the fundamentalproblems. What is a farmer to do with his stock? He has to decide whether to sell his stock straight away or to wait another 2 or 3 months and perhaps sell for half as much as it was worth before. But the fundamental problem of fodder conservation is a matter for the farmer. Drought is also the problem of the farmer, but he needs the Government's active and sympathetic consideration and help to overcome it. Do not let us try to pass this problem off on to people other than the farmer. We have to see that the incentive remains for the farmer to make his own judgments. We should help him where we can. </para>
          <para>We ought to be careful not to use the slick and easy argument that irrigation schemes are the answers to drought relief. We all know that they are not. We know that irrigation helps and that it takes the drought problem away from the man who farms the irrigation land. But to pretend that irrigation can solve the problem of feeding starving stock is to delude ourselves and prevent us from tackling the fundamental problems. </para>

          <para>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) </para>
          <para class="block">Act 1935-1967. The amendments proposed by the Bill will apply to the First Schedule to the Act which sets out the categories of goods that are exempt from sales tax. Two new exemptions which are proposed will exempt Australian-made motor vehicles for use by members of the armed forces of Canada and New Zealand stationed in Australia. The circumstances in which exemption will be allowable are to be prescribed by regulation, the intention being that they will parallel those in which exemption is currently available to United States and British servicemen. </para>
          <para>In conformity with Australia's obligations under the Status of Forces Agreement with the United States, the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act was amended in 1963 to enable United States servicemen stationed in Australia to purchase Australian-made vehicles free of sales tax. A similar exemption was subsequently provided in favour of British servicemen. The amendment now proposed will extend the exemptions to vehicles for Canadian and New Zealand servicemen. Comparable concessions are enjoyed by Australian servicemen stationed in those countries. </para>
          <para>The Bill proposes to remove the specific exemption of goods for use by British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines Ltd (an airline no longer operating) and Qantas Airways Ltd. Other provisions of the sales tax law exempt such items of equipment as aircraft and aircraft parts, servicing equipment and tractors for towing aircraft. But in respect of goods not so exempted, it is considered that Qantas Airways Ltd should be in the same position as other airlines Qantas already is liable to Commonwealth taxes other than sales tax. This amendment is to be effective from tomorrow. 20th August 1970, so that on and from that date the specific exemption in favour of Qantas will cease to apply. </para>
          <para>The Bill includes a provision to exempt goods for use, and not for sale, by the Anglo- Australian Telescope Board. This replaces a similar provision which was included in the earlier Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Bill 1970 which has just been withdrawn. The new exemption is supplementary to the AngloAustralian Telescope Agreement Bill 1970 under which it is proposed to set up the Anglo-Australian Telescope Board. This exemption is to commence on the date on which the Anglo-Australian Telescope </para>
          <para class="block">Agreement Act 1970 comes into operation. </para>
          <para>The remaining provisions are of a drafting nature designed to restore certain exemptions related to provisions in the Customs Act. The exemptions were inadvertently rendered ineffective by amendments to the Customs Act that came into operation on 1st October 1969. It is proposed that these sales tax amendments should be deemed to have been in operation since that date. An explanatory memorandum on the various provisions in the Bill is being circulated to honourable members. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

            <para>- by leave- I present the report of the Australian Branch delegation to the 15th Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference held at PortofSpain, Trinidad and Tobago, during October 1969 and move: </para>

            <para>That the House take note of the paper. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>In moving this motion I do so knowing that the task was originally to be performed by the late member for Chisholm, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfred</inline> Kent Hughes. I take this opportunity of joining with other honourable members who spoke yesterday in a tribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfred</inline> for the great work he has done for the Commonwealth of Nations. Over his lifetime he took a great interest in the Commonwealth and I know that he was glad to be present at the Trinidad conference last year. We remember also the way in which he took an interest in so many Commonwealth students who often stayed at his home in Melbourne when they had nowhere else to go. For that reason 1 pay a tribute to him. I wish that he were undertaking the task that I have been asked now to perform in his stead. </para>
          <para>The report deals with the conference that took place in Trinidad and Tobaga, the meetings of the General Council and the general meeting of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in October last year. I am glad that the House has given us an opportunity once again to mention the activities of the Association, because this has been a model for so many other Parliaments which are now following the example that was first set by Australia in tabling these reports and debating them. As I have moved around other branches of the Association I have said how important it is that members who go overseas at the expense of the taxpayer should return to their countries and by making reports to their parliaments on what they have learned and of the value it has been to their countries, justify the expenditure that they have incurred. So I am glad that we are doing this on this occasion. I am pleased also that the honourable member for Grayndler <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly),</inline> who has taken such an interest in the Association over the years, is prepared to join in this debate, because it is something in which both sides of the House are tremendously interested. We hope that we will, by this means, get a greater involvement in the work of the Association by the 7,000 members who now comprise our membership in 88 separate branches throughout the Commonwealth. </para>
          <para>At the Conference in Trinidad and Tobago a number of interesting debates took place. These are summarised in the report. I should like, however, to quote from the opening speech of the Right Honourable Eric Williams, the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, who said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Your Association is performing a vital task - that of maintaining a continuing dialogue . . . between the elected representatives of countries comprising  a  significant proportion of the population of the globe  . . the opportunities presented by your Association for the sharing of ideas and experiences as between diverse peoples are no less valuable than the more publicised discussions which take place in more formal international bodies. It is for this reason that we in Trinidad and Tobago consider this to be one of the most important international gatherings that we have ever been privileged to host. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">His</inline>words were echoed by the Governor-General a little later, during the opening ceremony. As always, the main debates were concerned with problems of the Commonwealth of Nations and world security. Here, of course, the Australian and Malaysian Government delegations spoke of the importance to the Commonwealth of the situation in Vietnam. There was also debate on whether Britain would maintain a force east of Suez. Other countries of the Commonwealth dealt with the importance of the Nigerian situation and particularly of Biafra. I think it is useful to remember that in the course of achieving independence many countries throughout the Commonwealth have each been split into a number of smaller countries. The dangers of Balkanisation are such that the whole world would suffer if this process went too far. This was one of the issues that we saw in the situation between the Federal Government of Nigeria and the attempted secession by Biafra. A similar situation is important in Kashmir. The issue of Kashmir to a great extent is whether parts of a country are to be allowed to secede at their own wish. If Kashmir seceded from India that might be the start of a process in which the whole of the present Indian nation would be split into a number of small countries. In the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association we have seen that the task is not to promote a splitting of countries but to try to see whether we cannot bring together in larger units some of the small countries that now exist as a result of independence movements that have taken place throughout the Commonwealth over the last 15 years. This was one of the main subjects that was debated in Trinidad. </para>
          <para>We heard also of the troubles between Guyana and its neighbour Venezuela, and between British Honduras and its neighbour Guatemala. On the subject of aid throughout the Commonwealth it was interesting to observe how much of the discussion related to the problems that developing countries are now facing with debt servicing. The amounts they have to pay in interest and in repayment of former debts almost cancel out the benefits of new aid provided in 1970 by developed nations. This is one of the matters that we must look at as an Association during the coming conference in Canberra. </para>
          <para>The new matters that had not been debated before in the Association dealt, first with the problem of race relations. During the debate that took place, of interest was not so much what was said as what was not said. For the first time Australia's immigration policies were not criticised at an international level. This has great interest for Australia because there is a gradual realisation that mass population pressures in some of the densely populated countries either in the Caribbean or in Asia, such as in India, are not going to be solved by mass migration movements - which might have been the idea current in the early <inline font-style="italic">1950s.</inline> Now, there is a realisation that population pressures must be controlled by family planning and birth control measures, and that if family planning is successful, the pressures on migration will become less and the Australian immigration programme, looking at it from our point of view, will be more widely understood. It is interesting to see what great achievements are being made already in places like Barbados, India and Fiji with family planning. Gradually, the elimination of population pressures, not in the immediate future, but over a 20 year period, will make a great deal of difference to some of the other major matters which affect those nations. </para>
          <para>We also had a debate on the whole issue of parliamentary democracy. So many nations, in Africa for instance, have faced the very real question whether parliamentary democracy would survive. Takeovers by dictatorships have occurred in places like Sierra Leone and Ghana. Those countries have suffered under dictatorships and have been able to re-achieve parliamentary democracy. Those nations realise how important it is to build up the parliamentary democratic system and they look to other nations like ourselves to help them. In the debates that take place at our meetings, we try to help them to look at the essentials of parliamentary democracy and to see what are the important tasks of a member of parliament. One of the reasons why a near-revolution occurred in Trinidad a few weeks ago has been said to be because there was a weak Opposition and because members of parliament were not making known to the executive the grievances of their constituents, so that the Prime Minister and his Ministers did not know the troubles that existed beneath the surface. When a country has a weak parliament and when weak members of that parliament are not doing their jobs properly, the democratic system cannot operate properly. This was one of the matters examined at the last conference. So many people said how important it was that private members should be allowed greater opportunities to take initiatives especially on issues arising between elections and on which no mandate has been given. </para>
          <para>Another vital debate took place on the subject of youth. We had a most interesting introduction by the honourable John Turner, Leader of the Canadian delegation. He called 1968 the 'Year of the Student' when a new phenomenon, the politics of confrontation, had been born in the universities. The root causes were the despair and crisis in values aroused in youth by the injustices which they saw in the established order. The politics of confrontation made them radical and communications media made the confrontation international. Confrontation and radicalism developed into the politics of demolition and gave rise to violence. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline>said that, approaching the 1970s, a new class was coming to birth, a counter-culture, which was youth in revolt. The distinctive features of the patterns of unrest could be characterised as, firstly, the influence of communications media in creating a generation consciousness; secondly, a crisis of legitimacy and a breakdown in the authority of any institution with which the youth generation disagreed; and thirdly, racial injustices and poverty. He said that it was essential, however, that the youth generation should feel that change was possible within the political process and by lawful means. The demand of the young was in particular for a political system that would create and preserve the individuality of man and the sense of community among men. What was seen at that meeting was the importance of involving youth in the affairs of society and the importance of seeing that parliament was able to incorporate the needs of youth without at the same time completely altering the parliamentary democratic system. These are matters which, I think, are important to all members of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and particularly to us in Australia. </para>
          <para>Reference is made in this report to the meeting of the General Council of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association at which the  President  of the Australian Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alister</inline> McMullin. was elected  Chairman  of the Association for 1969-70. Meetings of the Executive Committee, which 1 attended as its  chairman,  took place. I will refer to those meetings in a moment. The Association resolved to hold the 1970 annual conference of the CPA here in Canberra. Finally, this report gives very sincere thanks to the host branch, Trinidad and Tobago, and particularly to </para>
          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Rex</inline>Latour, the  Clerk  of the House of Representatives there, who provided such extremely good organisation for all the delegates who attended the meeting. </para>
          <para>Having dealt with the report, may I refer now for a moment to the forthcoming Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference to take place in this chamber commencing on 2nd October. As the House knows, after the Trinidad conference I visited Jersey to take the chair at the annual meeting of the Executive Committee of the CPA. The main thing that we did was to prepare the agenda for the Canberra conference. I wish to let honourable members know of some of the important matters that are to be debated here in a few weeks' time. </para>
          <para>First, on the international front, the situation in southern Africa will be considered and, in particular, the situation that has been developing as a result of Britain's decision to send maritime arms to South Africa. This will create a wide measure of debate amongst the nations of Africa as well as those outside the African continent. The delegates from Malta have asked us to put the situation in the Middle East on the agenda. It is interesting that the representatives of India no longer wish us to refer to that area as the Middle East but as West Asia. 1 think we are beginning to realise that the expression 'Middle East' is an odd term for us living in Australia. For us the area is, if anything, the Middle West. </para>
          <para>The second item for consideration is aid. The question of the effect on Commonwealth countries of Britain's entry into the European Economic Community is gaining in importance. Once again, we have asked New Zealand to lead off in the debate on that subject. We shall be dealing also in greater depth with the matters to which I have just referred as having been discussed in Trinidad; that is, the whole working of the parliamentary system and the role of members of parliament. As last year in Trinidad we saw the importance of youth in revolt and the effect that this will have on the workings of parliament, so now we must see to what extent members of parliament are able to withstand pressure groups, moratorium marches, television programmes, opinion polls and the like to make certain that we maintain the role of the ballot box as the reason why members of parliament are elected to enter parliament, and that the pressures from the ballot box are the chief pressures to which they should react. </para>
          <para>But, at the same time as we look at the way in which a member of parliament must be helped to withstand outside pressure groups, so also is it important to look at the whole structure of parliament and to see that parliament is moving with the times. We should not regard our Standing Orders always as so bound by tradition that they cannot be altered; we must see that we maintain in our Standing Orders and in our structure of parliament what is essential, while at the same time retaining the ability to move with the times. In this way, if moves come from outside for us to see whether we can improve the structure of our parliamentary system, we ourselves, as members of parliament, should examine that system. I think there is no better place for this to be examined than in the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association plenary conferences. India has asked us again to put on the agenda the question of population growth and the Caribbean has asked us to have another look at the problems of race relations, particularly the issue of Black Power in several countries of the Caribbean. This is certainly a matter of tremendous importance to them. I think the Canberra conference will be lively and topical and will be something that affects not only the 200 delegates that will be here but also most of the Australian members of the Association. </para>
          <para>In Jersey we looked at some new developments of the Association that are now taking place. They are developing as the result of needs that have been shown over the last 3 years. First of all, there has been the development of regional conferences in Africa and in the Caribbean and there will be one for the new Pacific nations to be held in Wellington in February next year. There we will see whether we cannot build up through regional association moves towards new federations through, for instance, CARIFTA- the Caribbean Free Trade Association - and the East African Community. As nations have been split through independence so there is a move now to make them realise that there are advantages in coming together again voluntarily in new forms of association and this could well be of importance to the new nations of the Pacific which are close to Australia's sphere of influence. </para>
          <para>We have through the work of regional representatives on the executive committee found ways in which we can bring together and involve many more members of the Association than has been possible in the past. We have developed also a new system of seminars. For some time the United Kingdom has carried out parliamentary courses for members of parliament in these new independent nations. Australia has been asked to do the same and I hope that in the next year or two the Australian branch will be carrying out similar courses for people near our shores. There have been requests from smaller nations such as Grenada to have seminars in their countries where they can be helped to learn something of how a member of parliament should do his job more effectively. In India now each year both the parliament at New Delhi and the State parliaments come together in a seminar instructing new members of parliament in the tasks that face them. More important than that, taking place in Nairobi this week is a seminar at which delegates from nearly all the African countries as well as experts - older members of parliament from the House of Commons in Britain and from India - are meeting to discuss the whole issue of the Westminster model and how it should be modified to meet local conditions, what is essential to be retained from the model and what can be done without. I think it is useful at times when new countries come to independence and inherit the Westminster model that we should as an Association ask ourselves what is important in this whole parliamentary system. It is important, for instance, that we should see how vital is the role of the private member of parliament in making known the grievances of his constituents. I have stressed already the danger when this did not occur in Trinidad. We should see that we make question time more effective. I have seen many different forms of standing orders for question time and I think it is useful that we should learn from the experiences of other countries also. </para>
          <para>Finally, in Jersey we looked at the work of this executive committee that has been operating for a period of 3 years. The committee was established as a result of moves by the Australian Branch and we should pay tribute to the Secretary of our Branch, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Alan</inline> Turner, for his wisdom in seeing the need for it. Now that it has been going for 3 years I should like to quote from the annual report which has just been published. It reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Indeed ils size and balance of membership had developed within the Committee a strong corporate feeling which had been a major factor in the efficiency with which it had worked and the broad imaginative approach which it had adopted in reviewing the activities of the Association. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">As Chairman, 1 have begun to realise that the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association has within its structure the seeds that Can be nurtured and, with imagination-, developed so that its international role can be truly significant. 1 have already referred to some of the developments that have taken place over these 3 years but in this period we have only gone part of the way towards making this Association a really effective force in world peace and security. 1 shall finish my term in October. I hope my successor will take this imaginative approach much further than it has been possible for me to do. </para>
          <para>As 1 conclude. 1 remember the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Desai,</inline> a man in India for whom I have tremendous respect, who said that an important phase of this Association has been during this period in which the Empire has been changed into the Commonwealth. As independence takes place a period of tension always develops between the new independent country and the former colonial power; but as one moves further away in time from that moment those tensions decrease and a new sense of understanding emerges. In the older nations of the Commonwealth the period of tension is obviously over. It is obviously over in India, Ceylon and Pakistan but still exists in some of the newer countries in Africa and the Caribbean. Our task as an Association is to try to hold the Commonwealth together during this period of change because we will emerge at the end of that period with an Association that will be of even greater importance in the international world than it has been in the past. Those of us who have been to these Association meetings realise what a great task is being performed. </para>

            <para>- I wish to support the motion moved by the honourable member for Casey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howson)</inline> and 1 do so in rather unusual and unfortunate circumstances. Two of the delegates to this Conference have now passed on, the Honourable G. C. McKellar and the Honourable <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Wilfrid</inline> Kent Hughes. I express my sympathy to the relatives of those distinguished gentlemen. The other 2 delegates, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harrison</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Peters,</inline> retired from the Parliament at the election that took place just after the Conference concluded. So today on behalf of the Parliamentary Labor Party I associate myself with the comments in regard to the activities of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and particularly the Conference at Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. I was not at the Conference. Although I have been in the Parliament a long time 1 have attended only 1 Parliamentary Association conference, in the Bahamas in 1968. I endorse the sentiments that have been expressed by the honourable member for Casey on the valuable contribution that conferences make towards better understanding amongst the parliaments of the world and. ultimately, the people. We are fortunate that as on this occasion delegates from this Parliament represented it with dignity, impartiality and non-politically. That has been my experience of conferences that I have attended and I do not doubt that the gentlemen who attended this meeting also acted in that way. The festivities arranged for us and the hospitality extended to us by the host country were of the highest standard. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The conference was a very notable one. At the Bahamas conference I enjoyed particularly the stimulating agenda for discussion. No holds were barred. As the honourable member for Casey has mentioned, all subjects were contentious and some were very provocative. To use a term in a friendly way, one could say that it was on for young and old in some of the debates that took place. That is all to the good because I believe that tame cat conferences, while they may look well and make everyone feel congenial, are not what we want. If occasionally someone throws in a dead cat it helps the conference and improves the spirit, and provided delegates part as friends not much harm has been done. Only by open honest discussion at these conferences can we understand the problems of member countries be they racial, be they economic or be they political. </para>
          <para class="block">That ls why I think that in recent times the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association has adopted its present policy. I believe that it is a very <inline font-style="italic">sound</inline> policy. There is a wealth of things to discuss in the field of parliamentary democracy - new concepts in race relations, Commonwealth and world security and so on. It is fascinating to attend conferences of this kind with people from many and varied countries, some of them wealthy and some of them poor, and to hear their points of view. By that means we get a better appreciation of them. </para>
          <para>We should place on record with a certain amount of pride our appreciation of the services rendered by the honourable member for Casey in his executive capacity in the Association. He retires from his position at the end of this year. He has followed distinguished Australians. I think that a former Prime Minister held a similar post on one occasion. My experience of the honourable member for Casey at the conference I attended was that not only was he a very good  chairman  and most impartial - he gave me the call on one or two occasions - but also that he was very well accepted by the delegates and that he upheld the high position he occupied, I think with great credit to himself and to this Parliament. I hope that the person who succeeds him will be able to live up to the high standard that he has set. </para>
          <para>I do not wish to speak at greater length except to say that with other honourable members I will welcome the opportunity later in the year to attend the conference to be held here, Australia being the host country. It will be a good thing for the Parliament and for Australia. It will give a lot of people from overseas who probably do not understand us too well the opportunity to see at first hand what kind of country we have and what kind of people we are. Judged by the previous conference that was held here, I feel that the forthcoming conference will be second to none so far as hospitality and administration are concerned. It is pleasing too that the honourable member for Casey will still be occupying his official position for that conference. I hope that if a ballot is held it will not be until the final day so that he will occupy his high position as a member of the executive committee of the general council for the whole of the conference. </para>
          <para>I understand that other matters are to be presented before the sitting is suspended so I shall not say more at this stage. It is to the credit of all governments in Australia that they have given great support to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, the Inter-Parliamentary Union and international parliamentary conferences. I hope that the practice will continue, whatever government is in office, because it not only gives people the opportunity to meet and understand others but it also leads to a much better understanding of world issues and the great problems that we have to decide in the Parliament. I support the motion for the printing of this report and congratulate all associated with the conference - our delegates on their representation and the honourable member for Casey for the part that he played. I hope that the conference to be held here will be as successful as those that we have attended abroad. </para>

            <para>- by leave - The 1969-70 season was an exceptionally difficult time for the wool industry. A drastic fall in wool prices combined with a continuing rise in costs was compounded by severe drought in large parts of Australia which in some regions had reached a calamitous stage. The Government has been concerned at the plight of the industry not only because of the hardship suffered but also because of the great importance of the industry to the Australian economy. If wool is to continue to provide a major share of Australia's export income as well as to remain the basis of livelihood for much of the rural areas of Australia, it is essential that the industry's viability be preserved. The present crisis in the industry requires a comprehensive approach which involves both immediate and longer term measures. Prolonged drought and low wool prices have placed many wool growers in an almost impossible position where they require emergency financial assistance. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Honourable members will be aware that wool incomes have fallen markedly over the last year. Aggregate realisation on shorn wool sold has declined by some $100m to $687.2m in 1969-70. However, the severity of the fall for individual wool growers is not generally appreciated. Some 90% of this decline occurred in Queensland, Western Australia and New South Wales. In Queensland the wool cheque was 36% down, representing an average fall of about $8,000 per property. In Western Australia wool proceeds were 23% lower or $3,000 per property. These are only average figures with many wool growers faring much worse. Although Government aid has been of material assistance in drought areas, many producers have also had to bear costs of drought feeding, losses from forced sales of stock at low prices and the death of a proportion of their flocks. The Government has been giving detailed consideration to the problems being experienced by wool growers and the ways which are open to place the industry on a sound basis. The Government has before it a number of proposals. However the total approach is essentially long term. Further improvements to wool marketing, research into industry problems and debt reconstruction and farm adjustment necessarily take time. Short term urgent measures are clearly needed to prevent a loss of confidence in the industry, which would reflect throughout the whole economy. </para>
          <para>The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bury)</inline> has announced the decision to provide emergency assistance for  I  year to those wool growers who are largely dependent on wool and whose incomes have fallen markedly in 1969-70. The assistance will be given by way of a grant within a total amount of $30m. Because individual entitlements will depend upon the number of applications lodged, it is not possible to announce the extent of entitlements. The payment to any individual will, as a maximum, be no more than $ 1 ,500. To assist in the4 speedy processing of claims, it is not proposed to pay those involving an amount of less than $50. The Government is most concerned to ensure that the assistance be directed primarily to those most in need. It is the intention to assist all growers who have been unduly affected by the drought and by low prices. On the other hand, it is reasonable to expect the wool grower to carry some of the loss as a normal hazard associated with the production of wool. With this in mind, the assistance will be based on half the average fall in wool prices in 1969-70, that is, 8%. The amount of assistance will be related to the difference between gross wool income in the year ended 30th June 1970 and 92% of the wool income for the previous year. </para>
          <para>In order to ensure that only those wool growers who are largely dependent on wool for their living receive a grant, assistance will be confined to persons receiving a substantial proportion of their total income from wool. Eligibility for full assistance will be limited to growers whose gross income from wool makes up at least 50% of their total gross income from all sources in the year ended 30th June 1969; but there will be a phasing out arrangement, with assistance ceasing where gross income from wool is 33i%. From the foregoing it can be seen that applications should only be made by wool growers who obtained at least one-third of their income from wool in the year ended 30th June 1969 and who suffered a fall in gross income from wool of more than 8% between the years ended 30th June 1969 and 1970. Under these conditions, a large part of the grant will be going to persons in Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia who have been affected by drought. The Government has been mindful of the views of the Advisory Committee of the Australian Wool Board that immediate relief was necessary, and has taken account of the principles enunciated by the Committee, in formulating the principles on which the assistance is to be given, subject to administrative feasibility and simplicity. As this assistance is to meet an emergency situation it is essential that it be made available as soon as possible. If we are to avoid any undue delay it is inevitable that some anomalies may well be unavoidable. Where these can be shown to have a particularly adverse effect because of the circumstances of an individual wool grower these will be considered as sympathetically as possible. Further details of the grant will be made available to wool growers in the near future. It is not possible to calculate the total entitlement of wool growers until all applications have been lodged. Accordingly it <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> proposed to make an early interim payment on each claim. </para>
          <para>In order to ensure that payments are finalised as soon as possible, wool growers must submit their applications by 30th November 1970. Claims for assistance received after this date will be considered only if the total fund has not been exhausted. Application forms for assistance will be available at post offices within the next few weeks. I must ask eligible wool growers to submit these promptly. This scheme should materially assist hard-hit wool growers to survive the immediate crisis. However the emergency assistance outlined here tonight can only be a first step. As 1 stated earlier, the Government will be seeking appropriate longer term measures to overcome the fundamental problems of the industry. </para>
          <para>As my colleague, the Treasurer, has said the need for reconstruction in the wool industry will be examined as a matter of urgency. The problem of debt and debt servicing is a critical one for many people particularly in the drought stricken areas. For some farmers such measures as debt reconstruction would offer a way out of present difficulties. Arrangements now being operated in some States or operated prewar illustrate some of the possibilities to be considered. The selection of appropriate arrangements needs to be carefully considered or the result could well be to put some wool growers into deeper trouble, with an even bigger financial millstone around their necks. Long term debt reconstruction would be of assistance only to those producers whose businesses are basically sound and have good prospects of servicing the capital value of their debt after debt reconstruction has taken place. The problems of many producers finding difficulty in meeting their debts can be solved only by more fundamental reconstruction of their properties. Debt restructuring must therefore be tied in with farm adjustment. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics has been asked to investigate and report to me on the immediate and longer term needs for debt reconstruction and farm adjustment. Whilst the necessary investigation of all aspects of these matters will require some time, I have asked the Bureau to make a preliminary report to me at the earliest possible opportunity for consideration by the Government. </para>
          <para>The Government recognises that any total approach to the problems of the wool industry entails close attention to wool marketing, lt has before it a proposal submitted by representatives of the wool industry for the establishment of a statutory wool marketing authority to administer the marketing of the Australian wool clip. The plan was prepared by the Advisory Committee of the Australian Wool Board at the request of the Australian Wool Industry Conference. The Advisory Committee was under a great deal of pressure to complete ils report. I had asked it to provide a quick picture of the total wool scene including reference to the marketing structure proposed by the industry. As the Treasurer mentioned in the Budget Speech, the Government has under examination all aspects of the setting up and operation of such an authority. A close analysis of the proposal is required and (his is being undertaken by the Government as a matter of considerable urgency. On behalf of the Government I will be in consultation with the industry on the marketing plan and when the details have been finalised it can then be put to the Government and the industry for consideration. In the interim I trust that the various sectors of the wool industry will not prejudge the issue but will wait until the details have been worked out. </para>
          <para>Close attention has also been given to the potential benefit of technical innovations in the marketing of wool. To assist the industry in its own efforts to reduce the present high costs associated wilh the handling and sale of wool, the Government has agreed to guarantee approved loans obtained by the Australian Wool Board for the construction and equipping of integrated wool selling complexes where these can be shown to provide benefits to the industry. Further, the application of objective measurement to wool prior to ils sale could well lead to the sale of wool by sample, which offers the prospect of considerable cost savings and other advantages. To this end the Government has agreed to provide a sum of about $1.5m over 2 years to finance research and trials into the feasibility of introducing pre-sale objective measurement of wool on a commercial basis. </para>
          <para>The measures which 1 have outlined will operate concurrently with the assistance which has been announced earlier, namely, the halving of the levy paid by wool growers for promotion and research and a doubling of the Government's contribution in this field as well as the financial aid given by the Government for the operation of the current wool marketing price averaging plan. All these measures, together with those which the Government has under immediate consideration, represent a concerted approach designed to deal with the real and pressing problems of wool growers and to restore confidence and prosperity in Australia's major rural industry. </para>

            <para>- It is my pleasure to speak in support of the report of the Fifteenth Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference which was held at Port-of-Spain, Trinidad and Tobago last October. I do so with a great deal of pleasure because I realise the importance of Commonwealth parliamentary conferences. It was my privilege to attend one in 1964 and I appreciated its value not only to myself and the other members of the Australian delegation but also to the members of the Commonwealth of Nations who attended it. The conference we are now debating would have been of particular value to the people of Kingston and Jamaica because they would have had the privilege of witnessing a meeting of parliamentarians of the Commonwealth of Nations. Many complex problems are facing the Commonwealth of Nations in this day and age. I believe that Commonwealth parliamentary conferences as they are constituted at present can make a tremendous contribution to the stability of the world because members of the parliaments of the Commonwealth of Nations are able to gather together and discuss matters which are of vital importance not only to our parliamentary system but also to the world. On top of that, the members of parliament who attend these conferences are given an opportunity to see the conditions which prevail in the countries in which they are held. They are also given an opportunity to get together and talk before the sessions of the conferences actually begin. I believe that these conferences are of value not only to the Commonwealth of Nations as such but also to the rest of the world because of the impact they have on world affairs. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Many problems are being experienced in the Commonwealth of Nations. These include such things as problems of trade and understanding. All of these problems, as well as discussions in regard to our parliamentary systems, are brought out into the open and debated in an atmosphere of tolerance and understanding. I believe that this report substantiates what I have been saying in support of its adoption. One has only to look through it and read some of the matters of discussion to realise its value. Such matters include the pattern of unrest - youth and revolt - regional development and economic development. The section on economic development would be of value on its own, even if there had been no previous discussion, because one gains a full appreciation of the economic problems confronting, in the main, many of the small countries. I do not say that there are no economic problems in the larger countries, but in particular the smaller countries, many of which have received their independence in recent years and many of which are trying to find their place in the scheme of world economics, are confronted with economic problems. From the discussions held at these conferences we can learn to understand the problems of these countries and they can understand the problems that we have in endeavouring to assist them. </para>
          <para>As I said, it is with a great deal of pleasure that I support the remarks of those honourable members who have spoken in regard to the report of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference. The honourable member for Casey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howson),</inline> who has had very close association with our Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, said that it also gives honourable members an opportunity to come back and report on the floor of this national Parliament on what they did at the conference and the value of it. This highlights the value of these conferences for many people who would not otherwise have an appreciation of their value. Today we have had the privilege of having members of a Japanese delegation here with us during their visit to Canberra. The value in meeting members of other parliaments was mentioned in the speeches of welcome to the delegation. Members of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association attend various conferences throughout the world. The associations that they make at these conferences and the understanding they gain provide a valuable contribution to the success of discussions that are held and which relate to many problems. </para>
          <para>As I say, I am glad that this report has been presented to Parliament and for the opportunity to discuss not only the report but also the wider sphere of activity of our Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. I am glad of the opportunity to have these discussions and this debate. J am sure that all honourable members on both sides of the House and in both Houses who have attended these conferences have an appreciation of their value not only to us as individuals, not only to Australia, but to the Commonwealth as a whole. </para>

            <para>- lt is not my intention to delay the House too long with my remarks on the presentation of the report of the 15th Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference. The title on the cover of the report should indicate to the House the manner in which air travel has removed all boundaries. When one thinks of the places where Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conferences have been held one cannot but wonder how these meetings could have been arranged without the modern travel facilities that we have today. Places like Nigeria, India and Bermuda come to my mind as places which in the old days would have been considered far out of the way places but which are now accessible because of the modern air travel that we are so fortunate to have today. Such places as Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago were in my younger days legendary places that belonged to the days of piracy on the high seas. </para>

          <para>While honourable members know that the decisions reached at these conferences are not binding on the governments of any of the delegates attending,  i  agree with former speakers that these conferences have tremendous value from a public relations point of view and serve to strengthen the bonds of understanding between countries in the Commonwealth of Nations and the parliamentary institutions in which delegates serve. The agenda set out on page 8 of this report indicates the high standard of the subjects discussed at the conference. As my colleague, the honourable member for Grayndler <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly)</inline> said, the discussions get very heated at times. Nobody is tied down to any particular range of policy. As the honourable member for Grayndler said, it is an open go for one and all. The matters under discussion cover a very wide range of subjects. They are matters of great magnitude to many of the developing nations and indeed to Australia. As 1 said before, it would be hard to assess the value of these discussions. 1 have had the privilege of attending CPA conferences. Apart from the benefit of touring the countries in which the conferences have been held I have been impressed by the quality of the debates that took place at these meetings. 1 gained a great deal of knowledge from them. 1 think that those who attended the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference in New Delhi came away convinced that there at that conference was laid down the pattern of apartheid, lt was evident that between the white delegates from South Africa and the black delegates from South Africa there was such a difference of opinion that at times they would not travel together on the same bus. Because of the mutterings we heard at the conference we came away firmly convinced that the near future would see such a policy as the apartheid policy brought down in South Africa. </para>
          <para>I think I would be truthful in saying that most of the delegates who went to Nigeria came away firmly convinced that the enmity that existed between tribes such as the Yorubas, the Hausas and the Ibos could not be contained and that it would break into open conflict before very long. The day that we left Lagos there were riots in the streets of that city and much of it emanated from the jealousies and the differences that existed between the tribes in those days. So it came to pass that there was a terrible conflict in Nigeria that practically wrecked the country and practically wiped out the tribe of Ibos in Eastern Nigeria, as we called it in those days. I think that the honourable member for La Trobe <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jess)</inline> who travelled to London with me in 1967 as a guest of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association of the mother country was impressed by the nature of discussions that went on and by the manner in which the delegates, particularly from the developing countries, were so keen to learn everything about our parliamentary institutions and to put forth their views on the problems associated with their own countries. So I conclude by saying that this report contains a wealth of information on the attitudes of many countries to the problems besetting the world today and Australia in particular. Therefore, like other honourable members who have spoken, I have much pleasure in supporting the tabling of this report in the House today. </para>

            <para>- Last night <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker</inline> presented to the Parliament a report from the Standing Orders Committee. After the presentation of that report I moved that the report be printed and I then moved the subsequent motion that the consideration of the report be made an order of the day for the next day of sitting; hence it appeared on the notice paper today. Honourable members will have seen that there are a number of items listed before it and will be aware that I have just moved for the deferment of those items so that this matter could come on. It is a matter which concerns every individual member of the Parliament. It affects him more specifically as an individual member than as a member of a party. For that reason, in the course of the discussions in the Standing Orders Committee, it was suggested that there should be a free vote on all matters contained in the report. I have been informed by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr</inline></para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Barnard) that the matter was considered in the Opposition caucus and that the caucus did agree to a free vote on all matters in the report. I have no doubt that it is also known to all honourable members that the joint Government parties met this morning and also agreed that there should be a free vote of every individual member of the House. So we approach this debate, which will be launched by the motion I am about to move, in the situation where each individual member will express his own views according to the way he sees the best operation of this Parliament for the passage of its business and its national duty. I move - </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(1)">
              <para>That the Report of the Standing Orders Committee in its relation to the general matters of (a) sitting days, (b) a reduction in time limits for debates and speeches and (c) a reduction in the quorum of the House, be endorsed in principle and </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">

            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">After this debate is concluded, I will put down a motion on sittings of the House which will be so framed as to allow discussion of times but not reopen the principle of the 4-day week on a 2-week sitting, 1- week off basis. I shall also present a motion to amend standing order 91, which relates to time limits for debates and speeches, not to reopen the principle of reduced time but to enable any particular speaking time to be discussed. I will say more about the issue of the quorum proposals in the report at a later stage. There is another matter in the report which relates to the sittings of the Parliament over the meal hours. 1 believe it will be necessary for much more investigation to be carried out before the House is in a position to consider the question of sittings continuing over meal times referred to in paragraph 5 of the report. When that investigation has been done I will circulate the information and then take the appropriate action for the Parliament to consider it. I would like to explain the reasons why I have put the motion in those terms. The report of the Standing Orders Committee deals with 5 matters. Three of them - the sitting days, the limitation of speech times, and the quorum - are matters on which I believe we ought to take a decision in principle. </para>

              <para>- I will circulate the motion. 1 am now explaining the procedure. 1 am informed by the  Clerk  that the motion is on the way and as soon as it comes it will be circulated. If honourable gentlemen will contain themselves and allow me to explain it while we are waiting for the motion to be circulated, 1 will do so. There are 3 matters which I think should be dealt with on an issue of principle. These are the sitting days, the reduction in time limits for speeches and the question of the quorum of the House. The reason why I propose it in this way is that the Standing Orders Committee has recommended a 4-day week, 2 weeks following, and then a week of recess. In the course of making that recommendation it also recommended the actual sitting hours. I am sure that honourable members will have the report in front of them. If they look at it they will find the times set out in the report. It proposes that the commencement of a day's sitting shall be at 10 a.m. on certain days and at 2 p.m. on other days. It may be that some of the honourable gentlemen in the House would feel that 10 a.m. was not the appropriate hour or that 2 p.m. was not the appropriate hour. There may be some very real discussion as to whether or not that is an appropriate commencing time. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>But I think the first thing we need to do is to look at the principle of a 4-day week for 2 weeks with a week's recess. That is the reason why the motion is moved in the terms in which it is, to endorse the principle of what I might term a 3-week cycle instead of a 4-week cycle. At the present time we have a 4-week cycle of 3 sitting weeks and a week's recess. Each of the sitting weeks is normally of 3 days. What is proposed by the Standing Orders Committee is a substitution of a 3-week cycle for the 4-week cycle, that is, a 2-week sitting of 4 days instead of 3 and then the week's recess. It is important in my view to look at the matter as an issue of principle so that honourable members can express themselves on this principle. Having expressed themselves on the principle, if there is a majority of the House in favour of it, then it will be necessary to put a specific motion as to the sitting hours so that honourable members can express their attitudes to the particular hours. That is the reason why I am adopting this procedure in relation to sitting times. As to the limitation of times for speeches, generally the Committee has recommended a reduction of time. </para>

              <para>- We have an illustration of the response: One honourable member says: 'Shame', and another honourable member says: 'That is good'. The purpose of the debate is to express an attitude to the House on the principle of reduced speaking time. Then we can look at a specific motion which deals with the matter as the Standing Orders Committee has dealt with it for the various categories of debates, and there will then be opportunity for individual members who may agree with (he principle but have some objection to a particular debate being shortened to express that view. The second part of the motion deals with 2 matters which are quite important in their own way but are not of the same category of interest to honourable members. Therefore my motion proposes that the recommendations for the amendment of those 2 standing orders be adopted now to have effect from next Tuesday, 25th August. As I run through the report to give it a brief description I will come to those in detail. </para>

              <para>- I rise on a point of order. The Leader of the House has outlined the procedure that he intends to adopt. Firstly he dealt with the days of sitting, the times of speeches and quorums. He is going to move that the recommendations on these matters be adopted in principle. This is his intention particularly in regard to the days of sitting. Having established the principle he then intends to move a substantive motion setting out the times of sitting on the days of a 3-weeks cycle. This has been set out in the report of the Standing Orders Committee. As there will be a free vote by members from both sides of the House I think we will be faced with a fait accompli. The principle would be established. The Leader of the House said there would be no argument about the principle of sitting times when he moved the substantive motion. We could argue only about times at that stage. Since there is to be a free vote. I believe that the discussion should take place on the report rather than that we should allow the Minister to lay down what he thinks without having given any notice to the House. If this is not done I believe we will be caught napping. Some of the decisions that are made may not meet with the general accord of the House after the free vote is taken because a number of members will not know what has been said. When these members come in to vote they will find they are voting on something they know absolutely nothing about. The principle will then have been established. It will then be just a matter of setting down times that might be suitable. Again, perhaps we will get major discussion on whether the sittings should commence at 10 a.m. and continue to 12.30 p.m. </para>

            <para>-Order! In reply to the point of order raised by the honourable member in regard to the report that has been circulated to members of the House, at any stage a member can move an amendment to a motion before the Chair. This means that a motion that may be moved by the Leader of the House or by another Minister can be amended by any member of the House. The moving of a motion by the Leader of the House does not restrict any member of the House from moving an amendment. </para>

              <para>- On the same matter, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> what I am afraid will happen is that we will get complete turmoil. The Leader of the House wants to get this motion through. He wants to establish some sort of arrangement of sitting days. He wants to set down a cycle of sitting days and times for sitting days. You could have in front of you, I suggest, 5, 6 or 7 amendments and instead of accomplishing what the Leader of the House has set out to do I am afraid that this will not be accomplished. I do not know with whom the Minister has spoken about the procedure he has adopted. However, I think it might be in the interests of the Minister, of you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker</inline> and of honourable members generally that further consideration be given to the course of action proposed. The ideas that the Minister has in mind should be circulated. If that is not done I am afraid that a debate that should take only a little time might take a very, very long time. </para>

              <para>- Whatever it is, there is no reason why the honourable member could not move an amendment to the part with which he disagrees. That is the reason that the motion is cast in these terms. It is to allow honourable members if they wish to move amendments which go to the main thrust of the recommendations. The motion is cast in this way so that there are 3 points. I expect that the honourable member for Newcastle is not in disagreement with amendment of standing orders 72 and 250. </para>

              <para>-Order! In the strict sense at this given moment we are not proceeding according to the Standing Orders. I have allowed a certain amount of question and answer in an endeavour to allow the House to place itself in a position where we might be able to get some appreciation of what is involved. What concerns me at the moment is that we are getting further into a state of confusion with the questions and answers that the Chair has allowed. I feel that the motion moved by the Leader of the House when it is circulated may answer some of the queries that at the moment are being raised by honourable members during this discussion. In regard to the point raised by the honourable member for Newcastle relating to sitting days, if the Chair can make an observation, I feel that honourable members perhaps have to decide on the sitting days before we go into the matter of hours. If this is not done the House may spend a great deal of time deciding on what hours the House will sit only to find then that the days of sitting might be rejected by the House, in which case the debate on the hours would have been wasted. </para>

              <para>-In regard to the point of order raised by the right honourable member for Melbourne I would say that a motion can be moved and the House can then debate that motion. In this case there is a motion before the House. As to inhibiting the debate that follows. I say that you would not inhibit debate because the House would already have made a decision by vote on that point. Therefore it would be exactly the same as the House not debating further something that it had already agreed to. </para>

              <para>- We are now discussing a procedural matter. There are 3 separate items in the Minister's motion. I ask whether the Minister would consider reframing his motion so that each of the items could be voted on separately rather than in toto, because some honourable members will be placed in the position where they will be forced to vote against the whole motion because they disagree with one of the 3 items and this would defeat the object of the present motion. </para>

              <para>- A point of order. We are discussing a point of procedure and I want to make a submission to the Leader of the House along similar lines to the matter raised by the honourable member for Corio. The Leader of the House has submitted 5 points to the Parliament and asked it to vote for or against them or to move amendments. I hate to think of the confusion that will follow as a result of the number of amendments which will be submitted to the House. For instance, I disagree with item (a) in part (1) which relates to sitting days. I am opposed to a 4-day sitting week. But 1 agree with item (b) which proposes a reduction in time limits for debates and speeches. I am opposed to item (c) which proposes a reduction in the number of members necessary to form a quorum. I agree with the whole of part (2). What sort of amendment would I move? It has been suggested that each of these 5 points be dealt with seriatim. This would overcome the whole problem and wrap up the debate quicker. </para>

              <para>- I take the point that has been made by the honourable member for Corio and the honourable member for Newcastle. There is provision under standing order 166 whereby the House or the Committee may order a complicated question to be divided. 1 do not think there is any need for me to alter the terms of the motion. What can be done is that the House can decide - and I would be quite willing to have it do this - to take, in terms of my motion, part (1), that the report of the Standing Orders Committee in its relation to the general matters of (a), (b) and (c) be endorsed and vote on each part separately. I do not think there is any need to separate the other two matters mentioned in the motion. 1 would be surprised if anybody wanted to separate the other 2 matters. </para>

              <para>- We have an implied understanding that we will be able to exercise an independent and free vote on every item in the report of the Standing Orders Committee. I sympathise with the objectives of the Leader of the House but the procedure he has adopted puts us in an invidious position. It is really impossible to sort out the position and decide whether we can insert something new in, or leave something out of, the Standing Orders, lt is my belief that the correct procedure, in accordance with the practices of the House, is that in the first instance the simple motion should be moved that the report be received. Then we can take each item separately and agree on the proposals we want and fight about the ones we do no! want. The motion should be that the report be received and not that it be adopted. </para>

I presume the Standing Orders have been amended from time to time in the past. What has been the usual procedure? If the Leader of the House comes along with a list of proposed amendments in precise terms and makes some explanation of those amendments in a general way with arguments as to why these should be adopted in principle and so forth, then the House has the opportunity to vote on each specific proposal to amend the Standing Orders. We have a general debate and we are able to vote on the particular matters. It seems to me that the same procedure ought to be followed as on other occasions when the Standing Orders are amended. </para>

              <para>- I thank my colleague, the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth),</inline> for the extension of time granted to me. The report of the Standing Orders Committee was circulated to all honourable members in July. The matter has been considered in the Party rooms of Parties on both sides of the House. So that the debate may proceed in a composite form, 1 shall set out briefly what the Committee has recommended. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The first recommendation of the Committee is that the sittings of the House be based on a cycle of 3 weeks - Tuesday through to Friday in the first week, Monday through to Thursday in the second week, with no sittings in the third week. Commencing times would be, as the report recommends, variously 10 a.m. or 2 p.m. with rising times at 10.30 p.m. or such later time as may on occasions be necessary, except that on the Friday of the first week the anticipated rising time would be about 4 p.m. It is that matter - the actual hours of sitting - which 1 feel ought not to be intruded into the debate at this stage because the variations could be minor, such as a 10.30 a.m. start instead of a 10 a.m. start, or something of that kind. I feel that, if these issues came up, the matter that we are deciding now would be clouded. The matter I refer to is the proposal for a sitting of 2 weeks, of 4 days a week, with a recess of 1 week, as distinct from our present system of a 3 weeks sitting of 3 days a week followed by a recess of 1 week. The motion is in these terms so that the issue will not be clouded. </para>
          <para>I should make it clear that new standing orders will be required to achieve this end and that it will be necessary for me actually to move the new standing orders. I will move them in the terms of the report of the Standing Orders Committee. Certain honourable members may oppose different recommendations. For instance, an obvious matter which may come up for discussion is the 10 a.m. commencing time on the Tuesday of the second week. This is a matter with regard to which honourable members will consider the needs of standing committees, joint committees, statutory committees and so on. We do not wish to cloud the issue tonight by debating that point. I should point out also that it will be necessary to put these new standing orders as a specific motion because we will need to make consequential amendments to the Standing Orders to deal, for instance, with Grievance Day and General Business Day. The Standing Orders now provide specific times for those days, but those times are related to a different sitting programme. Those specific times would need alteration. Therefore, a composite motion dealing with that matter will be proposed. </para>
          <para>Standing order 72, as at present written, prevents references in the House to any debate or proceedings of the current session in the Senate or to any measure pending in the Senate. This was no doubt a useful provision in the days when the debates of one House were not easily known to the other. But the Standing Orders Committee is of the opinion that the daily publication of debates and the expansion of the news media make the rule unnecessary. In fact, the recent practice in the House has been to allow reasonable reference to debates and proceedings of the Senate. </para>
          <para>The Committee therefore proposes that the Standing Orders be amended to allow reference to Senate debates or proceedings, provided it be relevant to the matter under discussion. As a corollary, it is proposed also that the Chair should allow reference to the Senate and senators by name although this would not prevent members from using the former oblique reference such as another place' and 'member of another place' if they so desire. The parliamentary history of this matter is dealt with more fully in the report. Under the terms of my motion, this proposal would be adopted by vote tonight in terms of the recommendation of the Standing Orders Committee and would operate from next Tuesday. I would not think that any member of the House would find any objection to it at all. </para>
          <para>The next recommendation of the Committee relates to time limits for debates and speeches. As honourable members will see from the report, these proposed changes are fairly comprehensive. A number of amendments to standing order 91 are recommended. But, in the main, it is proposed that speech times be reduced by 5 minutes in debates such as second readings, censure motions, resolutions relating to tax or duty, and consideration in Committee of the Whole of the main annual Appropriation Bill or a Tariff Bill. The Committee feels that these proposed changes are reasonable in present circumstances and will not prejudice in any way the opportunity for or the ability of a member to deal with matters before the House. The Committee felt - and I agree with it - that the time that a  speaker  will be permitted in the debates that I have mentioned will enable each member to mobilise the facts and arguments that he wishes to present to the House and so contribute to a coherent debate. </para>
          <para>Standing order 250 sets out the procedure which may be followed where a Bill is returned a second time from the Senate and where the Senate insists on its original amendments to which the House has disagreed. When a Bill is returned a first time by the Senate, the Standing Orders permit the House to make a further amendment in the Bill, provided it is relevant to a Senate amendment rejected by the House. That  is.  the House respects the Senate amendment but. in place thereof, makes another and relevant amendment. The Committee thought that this ability to make a further amendment in the Bill  on an  occasion when the Senate returns the Bill a second time should  be  written also into standing order 250. This is consistent with the modern practice in the House  of  Commons and will expand the area  of  deliberation between the Houses. A sap has been identified and the Standing Orders  Committee rr»&lt;: recommended  'hat it  be  filled. Under the terms  of my  motton - and I  would not  think that members  of  the House would object to this - the change  would  operate as from Tuesday next. </para>
          <para>The next change proposed  by  the Committee is that legislative action be taken to reduce the quorum  of  the House from one-third to one-fifth  of  its members. The present quorum  of  one-third is fixed  by  section 39  of  the Commonwealth Constitution which provides: </para>
          <para>Until the Parliament otherwise provides, the presence of at least one-third of the whole number of the Members of the House of Representatives shall be necessary to constitute a meeting of the House for the exercise of its powers. </para>
          <para>The case for the proposed alteration is well documented in the report. But, if the House will listen to me, I would like to deal with some of those factors. </para>
          <para>The Committee recognised the importance of ensuring that the House acts responsibly in carrying out its constitutional and parliamentary functions, particularly when the House is voting in division. It was clear, however, that this would not be at risk as, for many years, the number of honourable members voting in a division has been well in excess of the quorum required and the Committee had no reason to think that this would not continue. For instance, over the last 5 years, when the quorum has been either 41 or 42 depending on the total number of honourable members, the number of honourable members voting in division has varied between a maximum of 115 and a minimum of 66 but the average number of honourable members voting in a division has been between 93 and 96, an extremely high figure. There have been only 4 occasions in the years since 1901. the last being in 1934, 36 years ago, when there was a lack of quorum on division but on each of these 4 occasions the question was the purely formal one for the adjournment of the House. </para>
          <para>That the quorum requirement for the House of one-third is out of step with provisions which have been found realistic and acceptable in other parliaments is established by the table on page 8 of the Committee's report which shows that the bigger the membership of the legislature the lower the percentage required for a quorum. For instance, the Tasmanian Assembly with a membership of 35 has a quorum requirement of 40%; the Ceylon House of Representatives with a membership of 157 has a quorum requirement of 13%; the Canadian House of Commons with a membership of 263 has a quorum requirement of 7i%; the United Kingdom House of Commons with a membership of 630 has a quorum requirement of only 6i%. The changed circumstances of the House since federation have made a reduction in tha quorum necessary and reasonable. The considerable growth in the scope and volume of Commonwealth affairs has increased the demands on honourable members to the point where they have to make the maximum effective use of their available time, particularly while they are in Canberra. Meetings of committees, of sub-committees. of the parliamentary political Party to which they belong, together with correspondence and discussions with constituents visiting the national capital are among the many things which impose calls on the honourable member's time, apart from attendance in the House itself. </para>
          <para>I think it is fair to say that never has this House been more dynamic than it is at the present time - I use the term 'dynamic' in the proper sense of the word - and this is as it should be. A quorum is not the test of the effectiveness of the Parliament except perhaps inversely. There is now a complexity in legislation, there is involvement, there is a very real sense of the need to service the Australian electorate by all honourable members. [Extension of time granted] In all the circumstances the Committee reached the conclusion that although there may have been good reason for a requirement as high as one-third in the early years of the House this is no longer the case and a reduction to one-fifth would serve the best interests of the House, honourable members and the electors whom they represent. The Committee recommends that legislative action in accordance with the Constitution be taken to effect this reduction. Depending on the outcome of the vote in this debate 1 will arrange for the introduction of a Bill to reduce the quorum. One final point 1 make is that the Committee also recommended that the quorum requirement in the Committee of the Whole should continue to be the same as the number required in the House. I have moved the motion and the House has agreed to the adoption of the procedure of voting separately on items (a), (b) and (c) of the first part of the motion. If honourable members want to vote separately on the amendments to standing orders 72 and 250 I have no objection, although I would not expect there would be any opposition and perhaps they could be carried together. </para>

            <para>-  I oppose the proposition that we adopt a 4-day sitting week. I consider that there are many reasons why honourable members should not commit themselves to a 4-day week. Firstly, we have no guarantee from the Government that the sittings will continue for any length of time or that honourable members will be given the opportunity of debating at length measures brought before the Parliament. Let me state a hypothetical example. Suppose that in the autumn or spring session of Parliament there is sufficient business for 60 sitting days. If a 4-day week is introduced the Parliament will sit for 15 weeks. If there is a 3-day week the Parliament will sit for 20 weeks and that will mean that the Parliament will be in recess for a much shorter time. For 20 weeks honourable members will have access to Ministers and will have the opportunity to raise matters of national importance in this Parliament during the 3-day week. If business is completed in 15 weeks Parliament will be in recess for a much longer period. Then the only way honourable members will be able to raise matters of importance to their electorates, their parties or the people as a whole will be by writing to the Prime Minister or the Minister in question. We will not be able to subject Ministers to continuous questioning, raise matters of urgency, speak on adjournment motions or do other things that honourable members are entitled to do under the Standing Orders to bring to the attention of the Parliament matters which concern them and their electorates or the nation as a whole. For that reason alone we should dispose of the proposition for a 4-day week which has been put before us on the supposition that honourable members will travel less, that it will involve less travelling between their electorates and this place. On one occasion a senator stated in my company that one would think that the sitting hours of this Parliament were framed to provide business for the airlines. I am not concerned with the airlines; I am concerned with doing a job in my electorate and doing a job in this place. With a 3-day week we will be in a much better position to bring matters continually before the Parliament. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>If the Government had proposed to us tonight: 'Whether it be a 3-day week or a 4- day week we will sit from the first Tuesday in February to the last Thursday in May' - 'that is a silting extending over 4 months - I would agree to a 4-day week. If the Government were to say also: 'In the Budget session we will sit from the first Tuesday in August to the last Thursday in November' - that would be the minimum sitting period - yes, there would be some sense and logic in a 4-day week. But the way I see it - I emphasise this - is that this is an attempt to close this Parliament as quickly as is possible so that the Executive will be able to continue to rule and dominate the affairs of the Parliament. We would become increasingly a rubber stamp for the Executive, whether a Labor Government or a Liberal-Country Party Government was in office. </para>
          <para>There are many other points to be taken into consideration. I see a member's responsibility as something more than attending in this place. If you consider the number of members who speak in the Parliament you will agree with me that some honourable members rarely participate in debates. In fact a former member of this House had the proud reputation of having made only 1 speech during the whole of his time in the Parliament. It is not a matter of the number of times that a member speaks in this place. If some honourable members want to become a rubber stamp for the Executive, that is a matter for them. As I see it, a member has 2 responsibilities. Firstly, he is required to be here as often as he can while his health permits him to do so, and if his health deteriorates to the extent that he cannot be here then the sooner he resigns the better. Secondly, a member has a responsibility to his electorate and to his constituents. I know that most honourable members attend their offices daily when the House is in recess. </para>
          <para>Another matter concerns me greatly. I have established an understanding in my electorate that I am in my office every Monday except in exeptional circumstances - one such occasion arose when my Party held a meeting on Monday of this week - or should a committee of which I am a member meet on that day. I might add that when a Monday sitting is suggested I always try to use my influence with the committee not to sit on that day. The proposal before us is to sit on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of the first week and Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of the second week. That will throw members out of their routine in their offices. At present their constituents know the days on which their member can be interviewed. Whether it be a Monday, as in my case, or a Friday is immaterial but at least let us have some set days on which we can be in our offices so that our constituents will know when they can interview their member. With the present 4-day sittings my secretary and 1 rarely leave my office before 8 p.m. on Mondays and there have been occasions when we have not left until 9.30 p.m. I do not think this is a fair go. Under the proposed arrangement we will not be in our electorate offices for a period of 10 days. Further, according to the programme which has been outlined a member will not be in his office on ordinary working days which I classify as from Monday to Friday. </para>
          <para>If honourable members decide to change the Standing Orders to provide for the proposed sitting days we will have to look at the question of the payment of overtime for the staff we engage. At present the payment of overtime is not permitted. Ministers are all right. They can bring their staff on duty whenever they wish to do so and pay them overtime, but as far as other honourable members are concerned the position is different. If the 4-day sitting week is introduced we should be given authority to bring in staff on a Saturday and a Sunday to clear the business which has accumulated in our offices while we have been in Canberra, and to pay the staff overtime. 1 suppose most people try to stick to a S-day week, but in industry if it is necessary to work overtime on a Saturday and a Sunday the staff concerned is paid overtime. I cannot see any reason why, under the circumstances which may be created here tonight, we should not have the opportunity and the right to bring in staff over the weekend to dispose of correspondence and other business which accumulate in our offices while we are away, and to pay the staff overtime. These matters must be taken into consideration. </para>
          <para>Another matter which has been raised is that if we sit on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of the first week and Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of the second week honourable members who have to travel long distances will stop over in Canberra on Saturdays and Sundays. I have spoken to a few honourable members who live in Western Australia and other far distant places and they all have indicated to me that if the House rises on Friday afternoon of the first week they will pack up and go home. I know that I will go home. I have no intention of remaining in Canberra on Saturdays and Sundays. If that is what the Standing Orders Committee has in mind, I am one who will not cooperate with it. As far as I am concerned 1 will be going home as soon as I can get out of this place. Travel will not be saved by the introduction of a 4-day week. Possibly things will only be complicated for members. I oppose the proposition. We cannot move an amendment. There will be a straight out vote for or against it. But if the proposition is adopted, when the Minister proposes his next motion at least let us look at the possibility of working on the same 4 days in the 2 weeks that we might sit. </para>

            <para>- I do not pretend that in weeks gone by I did not adopt the same policy as that enunciated by the honourable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones).</inline> In fact I do not suppose it is breaking a confidence to say that in my Party room some time ago I spoke in the same vein as he did. But I wonder whether the honourable member and perhaps some members of his Party have stopped to consider the ramifications of the recommendations of the Standing Orders Committee. Although they represent some inconvenience to me, as they would to the honourable member for Newcastle, I am now convinced that this is a move in the right direction. I should like to try to explain my reasoning to the House. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>First of all, whether we accept it or not, Canberra is regarded by the community in general as something of a white elephant. There is no question in my mind that in time to come members of Parliament, whether they like it or not, will be here for the majority of the year putting in their time on committee work, as has been suggested by honourable members, particularly the younger ones, on both sides of the House. I regret that this will occur but I believe that it will. In looking at the proposed amendments to the Standing Orders we have to take into account the fact that it might well prove to be the position in the future that members of the Commonwealth Parliament will be anchored here for the majority of the dme working full time on committees and on other jobs with staff supplied for that purpose. </para>

              <para>- It is up to each honourable member to make up his own mind as to the reasons why, and the reasons will be diverse. The point I wish to make is that as a stop gap, pro tempore measure I regard these recommendations by the Committee as being of importance to the Parliament. When we consider these recommendations let us stop for a minute and look not at our own personal convenience entirely but at the function of this House and determine in what way we can get better performance because it is largely on performance that this place will be judged by the people of Australia. I remember very clearly 2 recent debates, one on the Council of Egg Marketing Authorities and another on Meals on Wheels. During those debates honourable members for one reason or another - I do not deny for a minute their interest - took part and put their views to the Parliament, very largely I suppose on behalf of their constituents. But in the national order of priorities those Bills were very low in importance and of very low financial significance and yet this House wasted an extraordinary amount of time on such simple measures. Whilst all honourable members may be in agreement with the principles involved other major issues will crop up even more frequently in time to come which will be of major importance to the nation. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Any move which will give additional debating time to honourable members which this recommendation will achieve in terms of approximately 30 days compared to 27 days in a normal sessional period, must be of advantage to the back benchers because it will permit more time for debate and there will be less wastage of time on individual debates. It will also remove some of the onus from the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> and the 2 Whips on the Government side in regard to the use of the gag. Obviously any administration of Parliament must be elastic otherwise we would not be able to deal with the emergencies which arise from time to time. I would earnestly deprecate anyone who did not think seriously enough of this Parliament and its performance - whether he be on the Opposition side or the Government side - and who did not take into account the necessity for the Government and the Executive to produce performance. </para>
          <para>Whether the Labor Party is in government or whether it is the Liberal Party which is in government, the performance of Parliament will very largely be measured by the community on the ability of Parliament to put through timely legislation - not 2 years too late or 6 months too late, but at a time when it should be passed. </para>
          <para>The incongruity of the situation is precisely this. Honourable members on the other side of the House have for many years been on the Opposition benches. I have not had that experience. However, I have a genuine regard for the rights of the Opposition to fight. In this context I would not have a bar of mechanisation to facilitate the counting of a division, because I regard it to be an inherent right of the Opposition to fight back on divisions, and, as it were, to waste time by fighting back. I do think that in the interests of the Parliament and the people of this country we need some reform. I do not personally regard these recommendations as a very great reform. As I said I regard this matter as a stop gap, pro tempore measure which is necessary at this point of time. I remind honourable members and those who sat on the Committee that there are many more important things that need to be considered in the future before we can streamline our methods and obtain performance on behalf of Australia and the people of this nation. </para>
          <para>I spent a few days in the House of Commons 3 weeks ago and a few days in other parliaments during my journey to London and it may well be that in order to get a proper priority in debates we need a great deal more consideration from those on the Opposition benches. There are ways and means by which this can be encouraged and there are ways and means which I have in mind by which we could gain more influence as a Parliament to try to achieve these effects, although the whole principle of the House of Commons with 630 members and room for only slightly more than 200 is the opposite of our position in Australia. On the other hand we have honourable members who are virtually in a hostage position in Canberra. I believe that there are great lessons to be learnt from experiences of a Parliament such as the House of Commons, which has functioned effectively for many years and which has altered 98% of its standing orders since the end of World War II. This is something which we have not done. However, the Standing Orders Committee is in the process of considering alterations to our Standing Orders. The Committee has produced for the first time since I have been here a list of recommendations. I hope that these recommendations are looked at in a commonsense fashion by honourable members. I also hope that regardless of the convenience to us as members of Parliament they will remember that other issues are involved. Firstly, there is regard for an Opposition. Secondly, there is regard for the effective functioning of an executive. Thirdly, there is the image we give to the Australian people. </para>
          <para>I would deprecate the day when Canberra and the Federal Parliament become matters of no regard in the eyes and minds of the people of Australia. If I may I will finish as 1 started. If we are to spend more time in Canberra and less time in our electorates it will be a bad thing. Surely the commonsense way of looking at this matter is to try to move as rapidly as we can so as to achieve a more effective use of the time that we have in this place and where possible to provide more hours for the sake of the Executive, the Opposition, the back benchers on the Government side and the people of Australia whom we represent so that we can hold up our heads and feel we are doing a job which is worthwhile and to the advantage of the nation as a whole. </para>

            <para>- All Western democracies are under challenge. The parliamentary institutions of the United States of America, Great Britain and Australia are subject to pressures which 20 years ago would not have been thought to exist. We have to move with the times. What would have satisfied the democracies of even 20 years ago would not suffice now. This reform about which we speak is only a minor contribution to reform as such, but it has something which commends itself to me. I believe in a 4-day week. I believe that we were elected to serve the people of Australia in Canberra and we should not run away from Canberra as the honourable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones)</inline> admits he does whenever and as soon as he can. The honourable member for Angus <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Giles)</inline> said much the same thing. I think it is our duty to be here 4 days a week. </para>

              <para>- My heart bleeds for the honourable member for Newcastle because he has to work until 8 o'clock at night. He would not have to work until 8 o'clock at night if he stayed here and did his work. I believe that all honourable members - young and old - should be in Canberra as much as possible. It is all very well for the honourable member for Newcastle, who is in the full bloom of middle age, to say that those honourable members who are too old or too sick ought to resign. I think anybody who comes to Canberra only to draw his salary and who gets out of it as if it were fever-ridden should resign first. To get back to our muttons, I believe that the House should sit 4 days a week. I believe the House ought to sit on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of the first week and Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of the second week and then have a break of 1 week. 1 think the House should sit for 2 weeks and then have a break of 1 week instead of sitting for 3 weeks and having a break of 1 week. That is a fair proposition which should be acceptable to everybody. Generally speaking, the honourable members who want to rush out of Canberra are those who come from Sydney and Melbourne. They do not have any concern for the honourable members who live in the cities of South Australia, Western Australia, Queensland and Tasmania or in the country districts surrounding these places. </para>

          <para>I have been accused by honourable members sitting around me of being a stirrer. I have devoted the last 3 or 4 years of my life to stirring the possum and I intend to stir it again on this issue. It is impossible for each member of a parliament of 125 members to debate every piece of legislation which is introduced. We would be talking into eternity if every member of the House were to speak on every Bill. There has to be some reason used in regard to this sort of thing. We should adopt the practice of the House of Commons in the United Kingdom of a set time being fixed by the Government for discussion on each piece of legislation which is introduced, with a vote being taken at a certain time. That is the only way in which the House of Commons can work with its more than 600 members. We should adopt this practice. It seems to be to me somewhat idiotic to set aside a fortnight to debate the Budget. The case to be put on the Budget can be stated very well by, say, 10. 20 or 40 speakers. The public should be able to make up its mind on the merits of the Budget after such a debate. I believe this is the next matter which should be considered. </para>
          <para>Although it may be somewhat irrelevant to the proposal we are discussing at this stage, I would like to say that 1 do not like the idea of cutting down the time allowed for each speech. Those honourable members who are called upon to speak should be given more opportunities to say what has to be said instead of their time being cut so that everybody will have an opportunity to say something. Some people can say a lot in a very short space of time. Abraham Lincoln took only 3 minutes to say what he wanted to say at Gettysburg and what he had to say won a deserved immortality. A lot of people can cut down the length of their speeches. We do not want to be depicted in the public eye as a parliament of babbling brooks, and we do not want to be all talking on only 1 or 2 subjects. I have no objection to what the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> has proposed, that we have a break of 1 week after the House has sat for 2 weeks of 4 days each. I am in favour of the proposal. </para>
          <para>I am sorry that I have had to disagree with the honourable member for Newcastle, but I believe that the Commonwealth Parliament is the most important parliament in Australia. T am not going to reflect on the State parliaments, but I once heard a Minister in a State government say that members of the Commonwealth Parliament regard State politicians as glorified shire councillors - in fact, Gus Kelly said that. I was impetuous enough to say 'Hear, hear' and I meant it. The eyes of this nation are on the Commonwealth Parliament. We live in dynamic and very challenging times. As we enter the era of the permissive society the challenges will be greater and more fundamental. I would not mind sitting as they did in the days of the French Revolution, when the Legislative Assembly was in constant session. </para>

            <para>- As a member of the Standing Orders Committee which brought down this recommendation 1 want to make sure that honourable members have their arithmetic correct. I wish to point out that the Standing Orders Committee examined this proposal for some time. I am in sympathy with those honourable members who would like the sitting to be on the basis of a regular 4 days a week so that they can put aside a particular day in order to do whatever it is they wish to do in their electorates for their constituents, but the fact is that there are members of this Parliament who come from places such as Alice Springs, Broken Hill and Bunbury whose activities we are in duty bound to consider. Those honourable members who live, say, 150 or 200 miles away from an airport are also in a particularly difficult position. The Committee has recommended that the 4 days be dovetailed, if that is the correct term, at each </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>My suggestion - I hope it will be written into the Standing Orders - is that the 2 sessional periods should commence every year during a particular week in, say, February and August. I believe that the House should sit during February, March, April and May and then again during August, September, October and November. In this way the House could easily sit on 96 to 100 days, or even more if necessary, and all honourable members would know where they stood. It seems to me that the great penalty which we inflict upon each other is that the eccentric nature of sittings means one cannot plan to do anything in particular. I believe that this is the important issue which is before us. The other point I wish to make is that my experience in this place is that the present idea of a 2i-day week results in a continual disintegration of one's life. At present we are not remaining in this chamber for a long enough period to complete some matters. We manage to get a debate launched in some way only to find that on Thursday evening we are banished until the following Tuesday. A 4-day sitting week would give us much greater continuity of work. Therefore I appeal to honourable members to support the proposition which is before the House. I believe it will assist in the working of the Parliament. I hope it will make life a little more comfortable for those honourable members who have to travel long distances, regardless of whether they do so by aeroplane or some other means. </para>

          <para>The electors of Canning elected me to represent them in this place. When the House is sitting I propose to be here as often as possible. It is much easier for me to be here for 2 weeks straight, as proposed, than it is in the present circumstances especially if we are sitting 4 days a week anyway which is the programme at the moment and which I understand will be the programme for the next 6 weeks of sitting. We shall be sitting on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday and the same days next week. If I return to my home State at the weekend I arrive in Perth on Friday sometime after midnight according to Eastern Standard Time on which I started the day. 1 return to Canberra again on the Monday. This, in my book, is quite crazy although honourable members often have to do it. It is far too many miles even with jet travel. </para>
          <para>I support the recommendations of the Committee for a sitting of 2 weeks straight on the terms and conditions contained in the report, with 1 week off, in preference to what we are doing at the moment, sitting 4 days a week 3 weeks running and having a week off. </para>

            <para>- 1 do not want to take up too much time of the House but 1 thought, being one of the newer members, a few comments might be in order. I think that the honourable member for Canning <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hallett)</inline> was being a little unfair on the honourable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones).</inline> Those who know him know that he is one of the most dedicated members of this House and one of the hardest working and most consciencious members in his own electorate. Having met his charming wife, I am not surprised that he wants to get home as quickly as he possibly can. I was rather astonished when I came here to find that 1 seemed to be travelling all day and every day. I estimated that at least I day in each week was a complete and utter write-off. I found also that my life was very disjointed. No sooner did I get to the House, start to settle in and learn some of the format and start to think that I was prepared to make a speech or make a statement on some subject, than I found that I was flying home again. This went on, and I could not settle down in the very short stay. But I found in the last few weeks of the last session that the longer sittings enabled me to concentrate better, to prepare work and to make better speeches. </para>

          <para>I represent a seat just outside Sydney, but I felt sorry all the time for members like the honourable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Calder),</inline> the honourable member for Gwydir <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt),</inline> the honourable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Collard)</inline> and the honourable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Katter)</inline> who had to travel for such an enormous amount of time. If 1 was spending half a day getting here and getting back then they must have been spending a full day or 2 full days a week in travelling. To me this seemed an onerous task that should not be placed on anyone. That is one of the reasons why I am supporting the proposal. I think it is wrong that parliamentarians, particularly in marginal </para>
          <para>20734/70- <inline font-style="italic">R.3</inline></para>
          <para class="block">seats such as mine, have to dash back to their electorates and go to the Bandiwallop picnic races or some such thing because it is going to win a few votes. I believe, as the honourable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Giles)</inline> and the right honourable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Calwell)</inline> stated, that we have a responsibility to be here even if it means losing a few votes because we could not go to this fete or that ball. I think that Parliament takes precedence over these functions, much as we know their importance to us in getting elected. I think we ought to spend more time here. </para>
          <para>I would like to say a few words about one of my favourite subjects. We ought to inform the people of Australia what sort of role we play while we are here. There is an appalling ignorance throughout this country of what a parliamentarian does. I said this before during the debate on the Parliamentary Allowances Bill. 1 have never seen the gallery of the House as full as it is tonight except at Question Time or during a Budget speech. For a normal Bill one might see 15 or 20 people there. They sit up there and then they go home to their friends and say: 'I walked in and 1 saw that there were a dozen of them, and one of them was asleep'. We ail know who that would be - the honourable member for Wave Hill. Those people do not understand what is going on here. They do not understand that we are at Committee meetings, out talking to constituents, preparing speeches or in the library doing research. They do not understand that we do not stop from the minute we walk in at 9 o'clock in the morning until 1 o'clock the next morning. They expect us to be here. It is important that the House at a later stage considers educating the people of Australia as to the role of a parliamentarian, not only here but also in his electorate. </para>
          <para>I am going to support the proposal for two 4-day weeks mainly on the basis that I think it is only fair for those members of Parliament who have to travel from outlying country areas. </para>

            <para>- I find myself in agreement with the honourable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones).</inline> I was inclined earlier to think that this poor, miserable, paltry measure of reform <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> Parliament, as far as it goes, had some merit. But listening to the honourable member for Newcastle and considering what has happened in the past I realise that there is immense merit in what he had to say. I think that the proposal would make Parliament simply into a quicker rubber stamp. Let us have a look at a little bit of history. Let us first of all think about a few statistics. This Parliament sits fewer days and fewer weeks in the year than any other comparable parliament, far fewer than Westminster and far fewer than Ottawa. We sit very few weeks and very few days of the year, much fewer than either of those other parliaments. At the end of last year the House sat for - a day, was it? I was not here. Then the autumn session started rather late this year, later than usual, and it ran through for a long time because the Government lost control of the House. It tried to steamroller measures through. It met with turbulence and opposition and then was too timid to gag when the gag should have been applied. So we dithered through that period. This session in which we are now engaged has started later than any Budget session than I can remember, on 18th August. My recollection is that the Budget session usually started on about the first Tuesday in August. This time it started on the 18th. Let it not therefore be said that there are not enough weeks in the year. Let us look at the proposal and see what it is. Let us get down to detail. </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">Let us have a look at the question of sitting days. It is not just a matter of sitting on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday in 1 week and on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday in the next. The recommendation about sitting days also involves sitting hours; let us be clear about that. In the past the major parliamentary committees - I refer in particular to the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Public Accounts Committee - have sat on Tuesday mornings. Under this system it will be impossible for them to do that. When will they sit? Nobody has told us. Not only that, but the hours of sitting involved in this little matter of '(a) the sitting days' involves snatching an hour here. an hour there, cutting back meal times and things of this sort. I am not so much concerned with meals but it so happens that this Parliament has the heathenish practice of having party committees at meal times. If the meal times are cut short, so are the opportunities for party committees. So under this system it will be made very difficult for the parliamentary committees to sit. The time in which party committees can sit will be cut down. </para>
          <para>Now I come to the point that there is no guarantee whatsoever that at the end of the fortnight's sitting under this new proposal - this new cycle, this bicycle that the Minister has referred to - we shall know what is to be the business for the next fortnight. If we could use that week in between to prepare speeches for the fortnight that follows all would be well, but experience teaches me that we shall never know what is happening from day to day. </para>

              <para>- I may want to know too much, f know. Under the present system at least sometimes one has the opportunity of knowing one week what is coming on the next week. If you are not quite as assiduous as, I think, the honourable member for Robertson, then you may even find a day in the weekend to make some preparation of a speech for the following week. With these things in mind - and these are the results of history and bitter experience of what happens - I believe, with the honourable member for Newcastle, that all that would happen as a result of this change is that the Parliament would sit for fewer weeks in the year, there would be less opportunity to question the Executive and we would rush through legislation with even less notice of what was coming than we have had in the past. I believe this would be to the detriment of Parliament.

          <para class="block">I would expect it would be offensive to the great Australian public. The conditions of employment we are proposing are to work for 2 weeks and then have a week off. This would surely be the envy of any group within Australia. I am happy that we have this opportunity to speak as individuals and not be bound by party discipline. I feel strongly on this. I expressed my opinion quite forcibly within the executive meeting of my party a few mornings ago - I was not the sole one to do so - along the lines on which I am now proceeding. </para>
          <para>I believe we are elected to Parliament to represent the people of this country in our electorate and, as national representatives, the people of Australia on the great national issues which are discussed here. Our return to our electorates is not associated with the great national issues which are discussed here. Our return to our electorates - we often forget this - and the work we do in our electorates is connected with political self survival. We want to move about our electorates to look after ourselves, to maintain our vote, to see that we come back at the next election. Frankly, that is a thoroughly commendable purpose. I for one want to return at every election. But on the other hand I increasingly feel as I serve more time here that I want to play a more influential and positive role on behalf of this country. I have grave doubts about just how influential is the role I play in this Parliament. Perhaps this is through personal deficiencies, but certainly not the least of the causes of this are the deficiencies in the way in which Parliament is operated. There is room for deep seated reform within this Parliament, and we are tinkering at the very distant periphery in that area of reform needed when we deal with hours of sitting and the period of sitting. </para>
          <para>I frankly believe that once we commence sitting we ought to be sitting continuously without a week's break every 3, 4 or 6 weeks until we complete the business of the Parliament. This is the important reason why we are here. This is our responsibility to the public. It is because of these breaks that we run into the problem which is apparently the cause for the change in Standing Orders to be recommended to this House, that we are here over too many months in the year, ft would not matter if we were here for 12 months. If there is work to be done then we ought to be here. This I firmly believe. 1 want to mention our role in this Parliament. I believe it is a greatly diminished role, if in fact it was ever a greatly influential role. I do not know. I do not believe that back benchers in this Parliament on the Opposition side or the Government side have been greatly influential, despite any theories expressed to the contrary by political scientists or political commentators. I am speaking of the time since I have been in this Parliament. It may have been that back benchers were influential at some stage in the history of federation, but I doubt it. The influential role of the back bencher in Parliament goes back- </para>

              <para>- 1 will relate it to the motion in about 2 seconds. 1 was saying perhaps if we went back far enough in history of the development of the parliamentary system of government in Great Britain that significance may be discovered. 1 do not know. 1 am not an historian in this area. But in any event I am reluctant to make any concessions to the Government because we operate under a system of Executive autocracy. The Cabinet makes decisions. They are brought into this Parliament and the back benchers on the Government side pretty much have to rubber stamp them. The great decisions are not made in this Chamber under the parliamentary system today; they are being made in the councils of parties outside the Parliament. They are being made in the party committee meeting rooms. They are not being made in this chamber. This incidentally is one of the reasons why I welcome the opportunity to express one's individual feeling on this issue. Because of this autocracy we find that the influence of private members is a greatly diminished one in this Parliament. It has diminished in the short time that I have been here, so 1 will make no concessions to the Government until there is some sort of equivalent concession made to back benchers, until the role of Parliament and the role that back benchers play in this Parliament becomes an influential one. I am as concerned about this situation of which I am so critical under a Liberal Government as 1 would be in the event of a Labor Government coming into power. I would hope that we would operate better than the Liberal Government has done. We have no guarantee, and so I speak about the rights of back benchers. I want to see something written into the Standing Orders to preserve the rights as they should be. We need a system of standing committees which will allow back benchers to play a positive role on behalf of the people of Australia. </para>

          <para>I have been here 9 years and I find increasingly that I am suffering recurrent periods of gloom and depression because 1 am not playing as positive a role as I feel I am capable of playing in this place, because in spite of the work which I do - regardless of the value which honourable members might place on it, I do work hard at the speeches 1 present - I find that after 20 minutes or 30 minutes, whatever the speaking time might be, it is over and finished. No notice is taken except perhaps for a line in one of the newspapers which is looking rather desperately for something to fill up a spare column. But nonetheless this happens. But surely the role we are supposed to play is more a important one than it is. I am being completely candid about this. I am not being hypocritical. I am trying to reach into the core of the real problems of Parliament. If back benchers are prepared to go along with these superficial changes which only tinker at the periphery of the real problem of the Parliament then that is their prerogative. But in the long term they are the ones who will suffer, and so too will the Australian public. </para>
          <para>What I am concerned about is to see an uplifting in the standard of our performance in this Parliament and of government of Australia. What impresses me tremendously is that in bipartisan standing committees or select committees most often we have found that the rigid party differences have been broken down. Presented with the facts of the particular issues by experts as evidence and advised by an expert staff, the committees have come down most frequently with unanimous decisions. The recommendations have been of outstanding value. This is what I am talking about and this is the area we ought to commence from - not from the other end. I will make no concessions on Standing Orders until we back benchers are given some countervailing power to try somehow to bold the autocratic power which the Executive is currently able to wield in this Parliament. It is true, I repeat, that our role has diminished; the only power we have at the moment is to stand on our feet and talk. It is limited power. But at least it represents some sort of influence, albeit extremely moderate, for us. I do not want to give this away. The more we give away the less influence we will have. Frankly, all I can see out of these recommendations is further regression. This is one of the critical issues of parliamentary government. </para>

              <para>- It is a unanimous report, that the hours and days of sitting be changed. There are two duties of honourable members in this Parliament. One is to act in the Parliament in regard to matters of policy and the major matters which come before a national parliament and the other is their duty to their constituents. All of us know that there are things that we can and should from time to time do for our constituents but, more than that, contact with our constituents does enable us I think to be better members because, after all, we are trying to represent them. Honourable members may differ among themselves as to the relative importance of these two functions. They are both important. I for one would think that the former - the policy function - is the more important. But both of these functions are important and we need as much time as we can to perform them. One thing that is certain is that while we are travelling we are performing neither function. We are wasting time while we are travelling. If we can find some way of spending more of our time on these two functions, whichever one we may think the more important, we will be increasing our efficiency as members of Parliament. I take the point I think originally made by the honourable member for Wills <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant)</inline> and echoed by the honourable member for Robertson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cohen)</inline> that travelling in itself has some disorienting effect and may diminish our own efficiency in this Parliament when we are here. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>For those reasons 1 think we should support the proposition that has been brought forward by this bipartisan Committee. There is only one other thing I would like to say, and that is that I feel my friends, the honourable members for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones)</inline> and Bradfield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Turner),</inline> have not sufficiently considered the figures and details of the proposal because if they had done so they would not have spoken as they did in regard to one important matter. They said that the recommendation before the House would diminish the times in which the Parliament was in session. This is not quite true. If they looked at the figures they would see that under existing arrangements of a 3-day week the Parliament sits approximately 24 or 25 hours in a week. Under the suggested new arrangements the Parliament would sit 60 hours in 2 weeks. But including the proposed week off in the calculation, the weekly average would be just on 20 hours - almost exactly the same as under the existing arrangement - under the new proposal. So the length of the session would not be affected materially either way. I can assure the honourable members that if they look at the figures they will see they have made a slight arithmetical error in this regard because they have forgotten that the times we are speaking of are a 4-week cycle of 3 on and 1 off and a 3-week cycle of 2 on and 1 off. I would also say to them that they should look in more detail at the matter of hours, which we are not at the present moment considering but of which we will be speaking in a moment. There will then be ample opportunity to discuss not only the conduct of Committee business as it is at present but indeed ample opportunity to discuss how Committees can be conducted in a more efficient way. Indeed, anything which reduces travelling time and provides for members a greater total of time - which they can divide as they choose between their duties as policy makers in this Parliament and in preparing for their work in this Parliament and their duties in representing their electorates and keeping in contact with their electorates will increase also their efficiency as members, however, they may see their duty. </para>

            <para>- I am vehemently opposed to any alteration in the sitting times of this House. I say this not because I want to act as a brake on progress but rather the reverse because as I see the position it is quite a simple one. The more weeks and the more occasions on which we can visit Canberra the better for our constituents and the better for this nation. The net result of the proposals that have been submitted for our support is this: We will be here less frequently and we will have less opportunity to observe the bureaucracy. I have every respect for the men who dedicate themselves to the Public Service. But by the same token we have 3 generations of civil servants and they have developed an intellectual elitism which needs to be watched. Parliament is being progressively downgraded. If we were to probe into the fundamental philosophy today of civil servants, not only in Canberra but in most countries, it would be: 'Parliamentarians come and go, but we continue forever till the day of our retirement'. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I happen to be rather old-fashioned in one respect. One thing I do believe in is decorum. On many occasions I would be ashamed to bring my constituents to this House and to see the bear garden that exists here. We are here to do business, to speak, to listen and to be listened to.  A  good deal of the time that is wasted here is to be offset further by implementing a 4-day week. With what intensity are we using our time when we come to Canberra? We are not using it efficiently. If we were to ask an efficiency expert to pass judgment on us he would not give us a 15% pass for the way in which we used our time. For example, take yesterday. With all due respect to the deceased gentleman - and proper and glowing tributes were paid to him - should we have adjourned for the rest of the afternoon? I doubt it. Possibly an hour's adjournment would have been an adequate expression of sympathy. </para>

          <para class="block">Education and Science <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr N. H. Bowen)</inline> groan on this afternoon. The subject of his address was of importance. But how many of us were in the House? What are we doing with our time? </para>
          <para>I would like to revert to the question of the Public Service and again I will deal with the question of committees. I come here periodically when Parliament is in recess. I am looked on as one of the rarer forms of animal life. What am I actually doing in Canberra? This is Parliament House; this is where I get the information I want. It is from this point that, fundamentally, I operate. For most of us Parliament is a place of casual resort to get out of as quickly as we can - and that goes for Canberra too. Three days a week is plenty, particularly with the commitments that I might have. </para>
          <para>But let us consider the assistance that we are given by the Government. The Government - to put it in brutal terms - is not going to help us to put it out of office, and for that reason it will give us as little assistance as possible to dig ourselves in and to criticise it. We are here for the purpose mainly of rubber stamping what is put before us. The whole ritual and procedure of Parliament today are archaic. They are 3 centuries old and it is time we wiped them out utterly and completely. We live in a completely new age, so let us face up to it. Before anyone has the impetinence to put to this House, or to any individual member of Parliament, a suggestion of this type, let us examine ourselves. The results will not be to our credit because of the way that we are behaving. </para>
          <para>Committees should not sit while the Parliament is sitting. It is like a 3 ring circus at times. Members are trying to dart around, scuttle around, between 3 committees while there is something else of importance going on in the House. Do not let us flatter ourselves that everything that is being discussed here is being discussed by us as statesmen. I have heard matters discussed here - and seen time wasted on tinpot parochial issues - that I would not be proud to have discussed in a local or parish pump council. Tonight is a case in point. If this is the national Parliament, let it be the national Parliament. How much time has been wasted? I have seen it here. I have seen debate groaning on day after day on customs proposals, and have realised the time that is wasted on them. </para>

Why cannot we have proper electronic devices to deal expeditiously with recording our votes? Why cannot we abandon the archaic procedures that have been thrust on us? Every new member who comes here takes it as part of the deal - part of the routine. I have had 20 years experience in Parliament, both State and Federal, and I have seen a pretty tight ship run in the New South Wales State Parliament, and I want to see it here. I am not here to waste time. When I have finished my duties here I have corresponding duties like my colleague, the honourable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones),</inline> and I deprecate the attack that was made on him by the honourable member for Melbourne. </para>

It is time that we took a pull on ourselves. We come here; we waste time. It is part of the deal. We are wasting time utterly and completely. I have heard repetitious debates that achieve nothing and make no contribution. Three centuries ago the major issue was one between the King and the Royal Prerogative on the one side and Parliament on the other. Today the major issue is between Parliament and the Executive, and Parliament is being progressively downgraded. A proposal of this nature will do more to downgrade it. Let us come here for as many weeks as we need. Let us come here for a 3 day week and, above all, let us have a fair go at the bureaucracy. </para>

I have found it difficult, however, to listen to such argument as was put forward by the honourable member for Oxley who regards the week away from Canberra as a week off. There would not be another member in this building - in this House or in the other place, which we still have to refer to it as - who would regard the time away from Canberra as a week off. However it is not my intention to continue with this type of debate. </para>

          <para>I rise to discuss a simple matter relating to committees. I agree with the honourable member for Bradfield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Turner)</inline> that the proposals as put before us make it very difficult for joint statutory committees to meet. The Public Accounts Committee, of which I have the honour to be  Chairman,  cannot meet while the House is sitting. One of the problems we have already faced with the 4-day sittings arrangements we have until October is that by conducting the public sessions of the Committee, which we are required by this Parliament to conduct, certain members, who have to come from all States, have to stay in Canberra for at least 2 weeks at a stretch. I believe that we have to give greater consideration to the work of the existing joint parliamentary committees. If the proposals contained in the other paper that was tabled by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker</inline> come into effect then I suggest that the hours as mentioned in paragraph 7 of the paper being discussed will not fit in with the correct and proper functioning of those committees. </para>
          <para>I agree with the honourable member for Cunningham that one of the great jobs of this Parliament is that we, as parliamentarians, should have our eye on the effects of administration by the bureaucracy. It is something that is creeping on us so quickly that we should be concerned about it. In any rearrangement of times, days, and timetables we must consider very emphatically the role of the committees that this Parliament itself appoints. If I have understood the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden),</inline> I believe this is the time for me to give notice that the question of the sittings on the second Tuesday morning of the 2-week sittings will be the subject of an amendment from myself.

            <para>- I should like to reply to one or two of the points that have been raised, mainly by members on this side of the House. The honourable member for Cunningham <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor)</inline> said that if the proposals were accepted we would be sitting for less time. In my view, and on the figures that have been supplied to us, we would be sitting for more time under the proposal that is before the Parliament than under the existing hours. The hours have been set out not in a report that was submitted to the Parliament but in a report that was submitted by our own committee, and they reveal that this is so. Under the proposal we would be sitting longer hours than we would be sitting under the normal hours of sitting in the present circumstances. The honourable member for Cunningham said there are corresponding duties to perform over the weekend - that members had corresponding duties to do. That is only natural. But, for God's sake, give those who have long distances to travel an opportunity to do those duties. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>How can a member carry out correspondence duties when he must travel for more than a day to and from Western Australia. Take as an example the case of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Collard).</inline> After he lands at Perth he must travel 300 miles to Kalgoorlie and then return over that same distance to Perth. The honourable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kirwan),</inline> after he arrives in Perth has to travel 100 miles or so lo Bunbury on a Friday or Saturday and then travel that distance again on a Monday back to Perth to return to Canberra. What about giving some thought to them? We do not get just a bus ride home to our State. It is not a trip of half an hour or an hour. It is a trip of pretty well a day. When Parliament sits on Friday, a member returning to Western Australia arrives in Perth very late on Friday night and gets home in the early hours of Saturday morning. Then, in the case of those honourable members I have mentioned, additional travel is involved in going to their home districts. For God's sake, give some thought to those members. My remarks do not apply only to members representing Western Australia. The position of each of those members is bad, but other honourable members who live in country areas are affected as well. </para>
          <para>I was surprised to hear the honourable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> say that, if we adopted this proposal, we would be making a concession to the Government. Where is the concession to the Government? I look at this proposal as a concession to ourselves and to those whom we represent in our electorates. If we can sit for more time here and spend more time at home in our electorates, surely this should be our objective. Is this a concession to the Government? The proposal does not come from the Government. I see revealed before me the names of II persons who are members of the Standing Orders Committee. I see that 5 of those persons are members of my Party, 5 of them are members of the Government Parties and the remaining member of the Committee is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker.</inline> This decision was a unanimous one. So, where is the concession to the Government? Also, I was surprised to hear the honourable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones)</inline> say that the majority of members from Western Australia would still go home of a week-end if the new proposed sitting procedure were adopted. He said that they were opposed to this proposal. Well, I have not seen one Western Australian member rise and say that he is opposed to it. All those to whom I have spoken support it. I do not know of one member from Western Australia who has revealed himself to me as being opposed to this new proposal. So, when the honourable member for Newcastle says that there is a majority of them, or some of them opposed to it, he should say who they are, because I do not know of them. </para>
          <para>I think that we ought to look it this proposal realistically. We should be reasonable about it. We should adopt this proposal, which is something new. The honourable member for Bradfield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Turner)</inline> raised another issue in regard to this matter. He referred to sitting hours. We are not even discussing this matter at the moment. </para>

              <para>- Yes, he said that this is a separate proposition. If the honourable member for Bradfield wishes to move any amendment on the subject of sitting hours, he will have the right to do so just as the honourable member for Cook <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Dobie),</inline> who sits alongside the honourable member for Bradfield, said he would do when the time comes. I will leave it at that. The issue that we are deciding is whether we will adopt the new proposal as far as days of sitting are concerned. The remainder of the matter will be decided after that. I ask the House to support the proposal. </para>

          <para>I support it very strongly. Even when I leave here on a Friday, I do not arrive home until Saturday afternoon. I cannot go to Darwin which is at the other end of my electorate. As regards Katherine, to which the honourable member for Sturt <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Foster)</inline> has referred, that is out of the question. So, I support this proposal very strongly indeed. 1 suggest that those honourable members who are against this proposal, while they may have other reasons, live in close proximity to an air terminal.

During those hours, members have no chance to read, to do research work or to carry out any of the things that can be done by members who arrive home on a Friday afternoon and who are able to go to their offices, as bright as larks, on Saurday.

The week that was referred to as a week off by the honourable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> is in my electorate a week going around the traps.

The thought that we will be able to stay here over the weekend and possibly spend some time in the Parliamentary Library and do reading and research which other honourable members are able to do, is something that appeals to me.

            <para>- Apparently every honourable member is speaking to this proposal in regard to how it affects him individually. Speaking as the member for Sydney, I indicate that I intend to oppose any alteration in the sitting hours. I do so because of the fact that in my electorate of Sydney I interview my constituents on Mondays - as I did for 15 years in my former electorate of Watson - with an occasional break when I have to come to Canberra, say once in 3 months or 4 months, to attend a meeting of the Joint Committee on Public Accounts. According to the latest redistribution figures, my electorate has the largest population of any New South Wales electorate. Let us not forget that politicians have a responsibility not only to the Party which they represent but also to their constituents. For the purpose of interviewing people in my electorate, I travel to several points. This is for the simple reason that quite a number of age and invalid pensioners come to see me. They cannot afford the money to travel into the city to my office there. </para>

              <para>- Do not talk rot, Fred. You are asking the impossible. I have advertised already the points at which I will be conducting interviews in my electorate. People do come to see me on Mondays at those points. Naturally, every honourable member is speaking from his own point of view as to the way in which this proposal will affect him. In addition to these interviews, I have 28 Labor branches in my electorate. This, I believe, is the largest number of branches in any electorate in Australia. They need quite a lot of attention. 1 hear a few interjections from members representing electorates in States other than New South Wales, lt is strange to hear those interjections coming from members from States where those members are appointed by their Executives. I would remind those honourable members, now that they have brought this matter up, that it is only in New South Wales that a democratic method of electing members is followed. </para>

          <para>Let me say also that 1 am a member of an organisation in my electorate called South Sydney Community Aid. It meets on a Monday night. I attend it as often as I can. This organisation does a very good job for migrants. My friend, the honourable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Grassby),</inline> addressed it last Monday. He knows that what I am saying is true. </para>

            <para>- 1 am in favour of the change. 1 want to speak as Chairman of the Public Works Committee. I have consulted some members of the Committee and we can see no difficulty in the change. I would ask the House to have some regard to the position of honourable members who come from far away States, particularly the Queenslanders and the Western Australians. I think it is unreasonable to expect them to be shuttling uneasily across the face of Australia continually unless they have to. I do not think they have to and I have much pleasure in recommending the change to the House. </para>

            <para>-  I just w.mt to raise a couple of points. We are not discussing the total number of hours that are to be sat in any particular year. The number of hours that are to be sat in any year has nothing to do with the passing or opposing of this resolution. This is in reply to points raised by the honourable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> who said that if we pass this resolution we will spend less time in Canberra. The parliamentary sitting time is quite irrelevant to that. The amount of time we spend sitting in Parliament is surely solely related to the amount of business that the Government has before us. We are not discussing the total amount of parliamentary sitting time. We are discussing how we will best use our day. We have had a number of reasons put up by the honourable member for Cunningham <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor)</inline> and the honourable member for Oxley. I do not think they are relevant. The honourable member for Oxley said that if we passed this resolution we would not spend enough time in Canberra. The honourable member for Cunningham said that if we passed it we would not spend enough time in our electorates. I think they have both missed the point. It is dependent on the amount of business the Government has before us. There is no relationship between the amount of sitting time and this motion. They have nothing to do with each other at all. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I wish to raise a couple of other points. The honourable member for Bradfield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Turner)</inline> expressed concern about the sittings of committees. 1 think it is something that can be dealt with when we consider the times of sitting as a separate matter. Even apart from that, is this not one of the points of being here over the weekend? I hope that we are going eventually lo make the committee system more meaningful and that some of the time we spend in Canberra over the weekend, at least on Saturdays, will be devoted to committee work. Otherwise there might not be any point in being here. Surely that is one of the most important matters. Another point has not been mentioned by any honourable member. I hope that consideration will be given by the Library Committee and the Joint House Committee as to what facilities will be available to honourable members when they stay over the weekend. There are a lot of things we can do apart from normal parliamentary duties and committee work. I would appreciate the opportunity to be in Canberra a bit more. Sometimes 1 think it might be better if honourable members lived in Canberra. We would at least have a better idea of what is going on. Usually when I get here as an itinerant I have to ask one of the Press gallery what is going on in the corridors of power. When we are here a bit longer we might be able to find out for ourselves. Apart from that, I hope we can spend some time on research, committee work or library work and that the Library Committee and Joint House Committee will see to it that if we pass this resolution we will be able to spend time over the weekend in the library and making use of the facilities in the House. </para>

            <para>- I have not been influenced by anything I have heard here tonight. I want to refer to one or two things that have been said. While it is in my memory I wish to refer to what the honourable member for Kingston <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Gun)</inline> has just said about committees sitting on Saturday. Surely this is only a dream. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chifley</inline> was Prime Minister in the time Labor was in office the House had to rise because on occasions there was not a quorum. We were supposed to sit till 4 o'clock on Friday but because there was not a quorum the House had to rise. Things are just about getting to that stage now. After all, everybody wants to get away early on a Friday. No-one is prepared to see it through. There are a handful of people here on Friday so what chance has the honourable member for Kingston got of getting honourable members here on a Saturday. It is just a dream that you cannot take into consideration. I have been here a long time and have seen what happens. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Let me refer to one or two other things that have been said. The right honourable member for Melbourne <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Calwell)</inline> said that this proposal suits Sydney and Melbourne members; it suits them admirably. He proved it suited Sydney and Melbourne because he supported it. Apparently most honourable members say they will not remain in Canberra. I would like to ses a show of hands to know how many would stay in Canberra but that cannot be done. Other honourable members say we could have committee meetings at the weekend. As far as their electorates are concerned, honourable members do not lose votes by being here. They lose votes by not being here. If I went to some function in the Mallee electorate when Parliament was sitting I would have - without exaggerating - a dozen people come to me and ask why I was not in Canberra. Apparently members say they are very pleased to be in their electorates because they are not important enough to be in Canberra to attend to their job. This is the way things work out. As the honourable member for Cunningham <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor)</inline> said, this is the place. It is also our place to be in the chamber as far as quorums are concerned. How often have I heard honourable members come into the chamber when there is a vote to be taken and say: 'What are we voting on?' No-one tells them. They just follow whatever" is happening. This happens all the time. </para>
          <para>I listened very carefully to the honourable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden),</inline> who decided against the proposal for a reason that has nothing to do with the subject. My colleague, the honourable member for Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Calder),</inline> said that I do not live near airports. I do. I live near 2 airports located 30 and 68 miles away but the planes always run in opposite directions from the way I want them to. That is how the timetables work out. I heard honourable members say that the Western Australians have to sit in an aeroplane for 3i or 4 hours. That is a luxury. It is said that everyone puts his own case. Let me put mine. I have put it here often; let me put it again. The railway goes to the town where I live but it is impossible for me under the proposed system to go home at the weekend by public transport. Why should I not have the same opportunity as honourable members who live in Sydney and Melbourne? As soon as the House gets up on Friday - they will be asking for leave to get away early - they will go home. There is no doubt about that. Do honourable members think that of those from Sydney and Melbourne more than 2 or 3 will stay here? I think not. They will go home and there is not the slightest doubt about that. </para>
          <para>When I think of sittings since I came here, when the Chifley Government was in office and whilst this Government has been in office, the main thing I think about is the late nights. They are the things we should overcome. After all, if we sit till 3 o'clock in the morning for 3 or 4 days and until 4 p.m. on Fridays what good are we in our electorates? I find the young men are the first to go to sleep in this House so do not blame the old men. I am speaking of the average. I would not have a chance of getting home. That would not matter very much. I want to say very definitely that I am against the proposition. I will vote against it because if I looked at what it says I could say: 'This is fine - Tuesday 2 p.m. to 10 p.m.' But this can be changed afterwards. It would be fine if it were 2 p.m. to 10.30 p.m., 10 a.m. to 10.30 p.m., 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. If that were right I would vote for it. But 1 turned the page of the report and found that this is subject to what the Government may decide to do. It could decide to sit, not till 10.30 p.m. hut till 5 o'clock in the morning because at 10.30 p.m. or 11 p.m. the question relating to the adjournment of the House would be put and if the Government wanted to carry on it could negative the question and the House would continue to sit just the same as ever. Therefore, that proposal will not overcome late night sittings and that is one thing that I want to overcome. 1 am an individualist in this job and I think I have some supporters. I want to do away with late nights. I am opposed to the proposition for a number of reasons which 1 will not detail tonight. When the proposition comes to the vote I will vote against it and that will prove my sincerity. </para>

            <para>- I oppose the proposition. I should like to deal with a few of the points that were raised earlier this evening. The honourable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Giles)</inline> stated that there was a very great need for the reform of the procedures of this House. I do not think that too many honourable members would disagree with that. He referred to committees and said that the day would come when the committee system would be instituted, but when I asked him by interjection whether he would support the committee system and would vote for it - he will get the opportunity pretty soon now - be did not answer. I do not think he is being fair dinkum in his remarks. Either he believes that this is a reform or he is trying to make it out to be a reform. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Let us look at the proposition. The most important thing is for this House to sit for as many months of the year as is possible as a forum and as a watch dog to ensure that the Executive does not have unbridled rein and unbridled opportunity to govern for the greater part of the year. I think we must look at the history of recent events. As the honourable member for Bradfield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Turner)</inline> said tonight, the Government tried to be too rigid in its method of handling the House during the last sessional period and it was faced with revolt. Accordingly it lost control and the House sat for 4 days a week instead of the traditional 3 days. The Government has suddenly realised that if it can continue the 4-day week sitting cycle the House, in normal circumstances, will meet for fewer months of the year than it has been meeting in the past, given the same amount of legislation to handle. The proposal is to concertina the sittings of the House so that the period in which we will be able to act as a watch dog on the Executive and determine the government of this country will be reduced. That is the motive behind it. lt is true that we would sit for the same number of days in a 12 weeks cycle if we sat for 4 days a week for 2 weeks on and I week off as we would if we sat for 4 days a week for 3 weeks on and t week off. But the important thing is that 4 sitting days a week would become a permanent arrangement to enable the Government to concertina the business of the House and to sit for fewer months of the year, thus depriving the public, the Press and this Parliament of the opportunity to act as a watch dog on the Executive. That is the base motive behind this proposal before the House. That is why the Ministry is so keen to see it implemented. </para>
          <para>Without doubt there are other aspects to be considered. If the House met on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of the first week and Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of the second week difficulties would be created such as those mentioned by the honourable member for Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cope)</inline> and other honourable members who have set days for interviewing constituents and for meeting the normal commitments that a member of Parliament has to meet. If the proposal were adopted it would be far better to sit for the same days on each week and for us to have the same day off, whether it be a Monday or a Friday, so that we would be able to make long term commitments. However, I repeat that the most important thing to look at is the way in which this proposal for a 4-day sitting week arose and the motive behind it. It will mean that overall the House will be in session for a shorter period and will be in recess for a longer period. The Government wants to concertina the sittings by meeting for 4 days a week instead of 3 days a week. The Executive has suddenly realised, as a result of the circumstances which arose during the last sessional period, that it has an opportunity to govern for longer periods by virtue of the fact that the Parliament will be in recess for longer periods. For those reasons I oppose the proposition. </para>

            <para>- A number of honourable members have indicated their support for the motion so 1 shall be reasonably brief. I believe that a certain amount of obscurantism is involved in what has been stated by the honourable member for Chifley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Armitage)</inline> and I think we should get one or two simple facts of the matter straight. The proposal is that we sit on a certain number of days on what is essentially taken to be a 12-week cycle. It is true, as the honourable member for Kingstom <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Gun)</inline> has pointed out, that we are not held to that 12 weeks cycle and that, if necessary, we could increase the number of sitting weeks. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Let me draw some simple facts to the attention of those who do not appear to have them straight. The system under which we operated in the past was for a 3-day sitting week repeated 3 times and then we had a week off. The result was that there were 27 sitting days in a 12 weeks cycle which involved 18 trips to and from this place. For reasons which have been put forward, some of them specious and some of them correct, that developed into a 4-day sitting week repeated in the same cycle which, if we had gone the full term on it, would have given us 36 sitting days which still involved 18 trips to and from this place in a 12 weeks cycle. What is now proposed is 4 sitting days in 2 successive weeks with 1 week off making a 4 times effort for 12 weeks instead of 3. That will result in 32 sitting days and a mere 8 trips to and from this place. </para>
          <para>I suggest that the most relevant aspect brought forward when the specific matter was under discussion was that brought forward by the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth).</inline> He took up the points which had been made variously and at variance by several honourable members that they saw their main function, on the one hand, to be here and, on the other hand, to be back in their electorates. I think it was Duncan Sandys who once said that he was elected by the constituents of Streatham, if that was the electorate, to represent them in Parliament, not to represent the Parliament in Streatham. </para>
          <para>I think that is true although I allow the fact that the honourable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones)</inline> or whoever else feels the same way, may hold the view that working for the electors in the electorate is his prime function. The fact of the matter is that some people hold that view and some people hold the other view. Both views relate to the proper work of people elected to this place, and therefore the point made by the Minister that the system now proposed will make the most efficient use of the time, whether it is here or there, is the best point that has been made in this whole debate. We cannot make a direct analysis of the travelling time involved without taking up a lot of time. Let us assume that the average travelling time is half a day. We would be proposing 32 sitting days with 8 half day trips. That is 36 days out of the electorate in a 12 weeks cycle. Under the system operating at the end of the last session we would be using 45 days. </para>
          <para>This proposed arrangement is a compromise. There is no correct amount of sitting time. Presumably the logic of the honourable member for Chifley is that we should sit 2 days a week each week of the year and we would then be able to watch the Executive very closely indeed. I do not have quite the same fears. However, I understand his point of view even though I may not agree with him. I have used a little more arithmetic than most honourable members have tonight. In terms of a compromise We have offered to us now the best compromise. It seems to me that the honourable member for Chifley has not been very informed or else some of us are more stupid than we look. He could have been told that he has several more honourable members - and notably new members - on h!s side of the House who have been independently involved in trying to evolve a system such as this which will increase the efficiency of the operation of this place and thereby, some of us think, the workings of the Parliament and perhaps even the furthering of democracy in at least one of its manifestations. I regard it as absolute nonsense to suggest that the Executive has suddenly decided that it has not enough power and it wants to get more by putting up a system such as this. I think that is utter balderdash. </para>
          <para>I take a point with the honourable member for Cunningham <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor).</inline> I cannot see that he can in any way substantiate his assertion that Parliament is being downgraded by the system which has been put before us. J cannot for the life of me see on any statistical or other count how that statement can be substantiated. If it can be I look forward to the point being made later during this debate. As to the matters of being here or in the electorate the question of compromise comes up again. I find myself totally unmoved by the remarks of the honourable member for Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cope)</inline> and one or two other honourable members. I think he put his position most explicitly. He is used to meeting his electors on a Monday morning. He may be used to taking bath on a Saturday night but that is no reason For not having it twice a week or changing the time to Thursdays. That sort of inflexibility is something which the honourable member for Sydney should not be particularly proud of however long he may have practised meeting his constituents on a Monday, lt would be a simple mat'.er to change the meeting day to a Friday or a Saturday or some other day which will he suitable because of the result of the propositions which are now before us. </para>
          <para>It is not often that I have found myself in disagreement in the short time that I have been here with my colleague the honourable member for Bradfield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Turner)</inline> but I cannot help commenting on his introduction of basically relevant - and I think specifically irrelevant for the moment - factors such as the number of days other people meet in Ottawa <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> in Westminster, where, in the cast of the Mouse of Commons, there are three or four times as many members as we have here and everybody lives in and around London. 1 cannot see that that is relevant to a negation of or opposition to the current proposition. I cannot help but feel with due respect that he may have a slightly jaundiced view of this matter. </para>

              <para>- That may be so. 1 can sympathise with the point of view of the honourable member. I hope that 1 will nol have to hold it in 15 years time. I do not believe that there is anything more of real consequence which I can add except to take up a point which I think is relevant, even though we may debate this again on another section of this question, and that is the question of daily times. Obviously this matter affects people such as the members of standing committees. Honourable members will . see that it is proposed to have 2 days which begin in the afternoon. There are 2 days proposed to commence in the morning. Essentially that is the position which we now have. With a small fluctuation of half an hour or an hour or so at the end of the day as is now proposed the position is essentially the same. Even though the Minister raised the matter of hours as distinct from sitting days, these are of secondary importance compared with sitting days and the mechanics of their compression into <inline font-style="italic">2</inline> weeks. I put that point very strongly and I hope that there will be at least a majority, as there appears to be so far in this chamber, who hold essentially that point of view. </para>

          <para>I do not know if it is of consequence to this debate but I might say that 1 do not think I have ever seen more than half as many people voluntarily in the chamber at this lime of the night in the time thai I have been here. Perhaps this means that there is some amount of interest in the procedures of the House as distinct from some other matters which appear to be more substantive. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr CLYDE</inline>CAMERON (Hindmarsh) 111.5]  -  Although 1 have not had many opportunities to say this I have always said that the Parliament is at its best when it can debate any subject on a non-party basis, with each man being free to speak as he wishes and to vote as his conscience directs and dictates. This is one of those rare occasions when this has happened during the 20 years I have been a member of this Parliament. This proposal was first put to members of this Parliament, but not to Parliament, 12 years ago by the then honourable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth).</inline> I supported the proposal then and I support it now. The Caucus of my Party by majority vote supported it then and I am glad to know that the Caucus of my Party has decided by majority vote that it will not bind all of its members to vote for it now when some members in the Caucus now, as was the case 12 years ago. disagree with the proposal. 1 think that this is a proposal that ought to be decided according to how each honourable member feels. I think that the Parliament should always deal as a Parliament with any proposals affecting its own </para>
          <para class="block">Standing Orders and not as a rubber stamp for a government or a rubber stamp for an Opposition or any other party. </para>
          <para>On this subject we are surely speaking as parliamentarians and as individual parliamentarians. We are speaking for or against the proposal according to the way in which we see the proposition as it will affect us - 1 hope not as individuals but as parliamentarians - and as we think it will affect us as representatives of our respective electorates. The present proposal is now inescapable because the Government has decided that it will use its numbers to alter the number of sitting days from 3 to 4 until this matter is determined. Therefore the present proposal is not the proposal we have been accustomed to in previous sessions. The present proposal for the purpose of this debate ought to be at once recognised as a proposal which envisages the sittings of 4 days each week, sitting from Tuesday to Friday with each Friday in Canberra for 3 consecutive weeks, followed by 10 days in the electorate each 4 weeks. The proposal is that we sit 4 days a week - the same as will be the case if this is defeated - for 2 consecutive weeks instead of 3, which will require honourable members to be in Canberra for only 1 Friday and 1 Monday, to he followed by 10 consecutive clays in their electorates each 3 weeks instead of each 4 weeks. Now we have 10 consecutive days in our electorates every 4 weeks. Under the proposal before us we will get 10 consecutive days in our electorates every 3 weeks. I would most certainly favour the second of the two proposals because, as one who believes that the electorate is entitled to proper attention, I can see that it will give me an opportunity to give my attention to my electorate on 10 consecutive days in every 3 weeks instead of 10 consecutive days in every 4 weeks. The only questions which remain are: Will I be neglecting my parliamentaryduties by giving my electorate this additional time? Does the proposal mean that I will have fewer sitting hours in the Parliament? If it does. I would hesitate to support it; but it docs not. If one examines the proposal one will see that, although it will allow us to spend more days in our electorates than is now possible over, say, a 12-week period, it will also allow us more sitting time in the Parliament. </para>

            <para>- Yes, we will spend less time in aeroplanes, as my colleague points out. Even though this proposal may require some of us to remain in Canberra for 1 weekend in every 3 weeks - I refer to those honourable members who live in distant States and isolated localities, a fact which would make a return to their homes on Friday night impossible - we still have our own private secretaries to hold the fort while we are away, although they could not do it as efficiently as wc would do it ourselves. This could perhaps produce a situation which the electorate would be entitled to complain bitterly about. However, if a matter of great urgency arose during our absence, regardless of whether it was on a Monday. Tuesday. Wednesday. Thursday or Friday, we would be fortunate in that we would have the facilities available to us to handle it. Our secretaries would be able to contact us and tell us of this matter of great urgency and wc would be able to attend to it either by dictating a letter by telephone or, on the other hand, taking down the particulars of the matter to be dealt with and dealing with it promptly in Canberra. </para>

          <para>If the new programme results in some honourable members remaining in Canberra on 1 weekend in each 3-week period instead of travelling back to their electorates - as mo«t of us now have to do - it will force those honourable members to make a choice on that 1 weekend in every 3 weeks between wasting the Saturday or Sunday in idleness or resting - if the hours are to be as late as they have been in the past some honourable members might need the rest - or of using the 2 free days in each 3-week period in catching  up  with one'« reading or curving <inline font-style="italic">out</inline> research One of the main troubles with our joh is that we spend loo much time travelling hackwards and forwards between our electorates and the Parliament. Too much of our time is a'so wasted at weekends attending to things which do not improve our capacity to represent our electorates in the Parliament or improve us as parliamentarians </para>

              <para>- I agree with the honourable gentleman. This is something to which I will refer in a moment. I could not agree more. I agree with many of the things which the honourable gentleman said a moment or two ago. The trouble is that we cannot find enough time to do the reading and research which we ought to be doing. At least under this proposal we will get 1 free weekend in which to do them if we find that we cannot return to our homes because of the difficulties involved. The trouble is that too many of us are forced to throw away material which is posted to us for our reading. I would suggest that very few, if any, of us could honestly say that we have read every piece of material which has been sent to us through the post. Perhaps we should not be expected to read all of it. but T venture to say that in the process of throwing material in the waste paper basket because we do not have 'he time to read all of it we have on many occasions thrown away material which it would have been to our own advantage and the advantage of the electorate to have read. We have In this place an excellent library and an excellent library research system. T would suggest that not one of us is so knowledgeable on any subject as to be unable to learn more from the material which is available to us in Canberra. When we are in our electorates on Saturdays or Sundays we are rarely free from the constant interruptions of telephone call"!, interviews and social engagements which do not improve our capacity to represent our nation in the national Parliament. </para>

          <para>Unfortunately my good friend, the honourable member for Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cope),</inline> is not present in the chamber. No doubt he is listening on the blower up top, which is one of the facilities we have in this place. The honourable member said that each of us in our vote on this proposal will decide the question according to our own individual interests - the innuendo being that we will not care two hoots about our colleagues. Of course, this is not what the honourable member meant to say. Nobody is more unselfish than the honourable member for Sydney. I have never known a more dedicated member of this Parliament than the honourable member for Sydney. It was not his intention to suggest that each of us would be so selfish as to determine our vote by how the proposal would affect us as individuals, and not to care two hoots about the position of our colleagues who live in distant States or isolated localities. This is not what the honourable meant. I did not quite understand exactly what he did mean, but I know that he did not mean that. I know that the honourable member for Sydney is one honourable member who has always had a very sympathetic and kindly understanding of the difficult position in which his colleagues who live in distant States or isolated areas, such as the honourable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fitzpatrick)</inline> and the honourable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Grassby),</inline> are placed. Looking around the chamber I also notice the honourable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Collard).</inline> All of the honourable gentlemen who come from Western Australia are in this category. Looking further around the chamber I can see some honourable members from Queensland, such as the honourable member for Dawson <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Patterson)</inline> and the honourable member for Leichhardt <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fulton),</inline> who come within this category. All of these honourable members are entitled to expect their colleagues to have some regard for their position. I have every regard far their position. I also know that nobody is more kindly and more considerate of another person's position than the honourable member for Sydney. </para>
          <para>I want to say that I agree with most of what the honourable member for Bradfield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Turner)</inline> had to say. He was completely right when he said that we have to stop sitting late hours. It is crazy to go on like we have been doing, sitting in this chamber until after midnight each night. We cannot do our job next day if we are required to sit as late as that. But the honourable member for Bradfield and I part company at that point, because he does not recognise in this proposition, as I do, an opportunity to escape sitting the crazy late hours that we have had forced upon us under the old system. 1 see in this proposition an opportunity to get rid of the necessity to sit such hours. I do not think that we should have such short sessions. The honourable member for Bradfield and I are again in perfect accord on this aspect. I do not like to see the Budget session begin as late as it did this year. I do not like to see the Parliament called together for only 1 day. which  is what happened after the last general election. 1 do not like to see the Parliament get up in November while a lot of business has still to be done. I do not like to see important matters forced through in the dying hours of the last day of a session without debate in order to finish a week earlier. I know, as does the honourable member for Bradfield, that the Government loves to get the Parliament out of the way so that Ministers can make policy statements without having to face the Parliament the next week. </para>
          <para>The cure does not lie in retaining the kind of hours which we have had in the last 20 years. I hope the kind of hours and the kind of sitting days we have had in the last 20 years will be replaced now by this proposition. During the whole of the past 20 years we have complained about the hours of sitting. This has not forced the Government to have longer sessions, it has not stopped the Government from sitting late- into the night, and it has not stopped the Government from closing down the Parliament, getting away from it all and treating Parliament as a rubber stamp. Perhaps the new proposal will achieve this. If it does not do so it will not have achieved any less than the old proposals and there is a good chance that it will achieve more. 1 remind the Parliament that everyone of us knows that the Government parties and Opposition Party have specialist committees operating. On our side we have 14 specialist committees. However, a great problem is to find enough spare time when the House is not in session to enable the committees to get down to the subject that we ought to be dealing with and to grapple with the programme or problems that we ought to be facing. </para>
          <para>Last session while the House was sitting I was never able to give proper attention to the industrial committee's consideration of the Workers Compensation Bill. The only time when we were really able to grapple with it was on 1 Saturday and 1 Sunday when most members of the industrial committee and expert advisers from interstate travelled to Canberra and we were able to spend the whole weekend working on the problem. The industrial committee got through more work in that 1 weekend than we had done for the whole of the year. I venture to suggest that if all committees recognised the great value of staying here for 1 weekend every month or 6 weeks - please yourself how often - occasionally to grapple with the problems that they should be considering they would find that their committees would do more work than they now do while munching a sandwich during meal breaks and hoping to give intelligent consideration to the matters which they have before them. </para>

              <para>- 1 think they will sit on Saturdays and Sundays, lt will happen only once in 3 weeks, i believe that our parties would be a lot better for this and that all of us would serve our respective parties better if we could set aside a weekend for this sort of work. 1 strongly support this proposition. 1 do so not only because it suits me personally. From the point of view of transport 1 can get to Adelaide and back almost as quickly as one can travel to Sydney and back, and perhaps more quickly than one can travel to Newcastle. 1 am not supporting the proposal for any particular personal reason associated with travelling, but I do have - 1 mean this and 1 know 1 speak for all honourable members on this side of the chamber - some consideration for our less fortunate colleagues who are separated from this place by greater distances. Although the honourable member for Grey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wallis)</inline> lives in South Australia, it will take him longer to get to his home from this place than it would take the honourable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Berinson)</inline> because of the unusual and awkward travelling schedules in South Australia. For those reasons I have much pleasure in supporting the proposition which has been put forward. </para>

              <para>- The honourable member says that he will do so again, yet he is complaining about people going home for the weekend. Another matter which people seem to have forgotten very quickly relates to the honourable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> who very early tonight was making comments about the Parliament and the way it should work. I think it is very appropriate to remind the House that the honourable member, with all due credit to him, obtained his degree in economics during the hours that Parliament was sitting. In those earlier years when he had a somewhat shaky seat he applied himself diligently to his electorate. But now that the boundaries, through redistribution, have given him a favourable seat he can see everything wrong with honourable members wishing to work in their constituencies. I realise that the time is passing very quickly and in any case I can see no reason why this debate has been prolonged to this hour, but I must say that contact with the people in one's electorate means a lot. lt enables honourable members to come to this place ably representing the views of the people. </para>

          <para>Tonight's debate has, to a degree, been free from political tones. On occasions there has been political undercurrent. I am able and free, as a member of the Liberal Party, to use much more discretion in the casting of my vote than honourable members opposite can. I am always pleased to come here with full knowledge of how the constituents of my electorate feel on a particular subject. The views put forward by the honourable member for Chifley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Armitage)</inline> and the honourable member for Cunningham <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor)</inline> are the views of men who have been here for a long time. They think that what went yesterday is good enough for today. Perhaps this type of policy characterises all their contributions to the Parliament. It is appropriate to remind honourable members that, comparing the session that has just passed with the session of last year, we have sat for over 100 hours more than we did in the corre sponding period 12 months ago. There has been a need to discuss further legislation and more Bills have been introduced. I hope that the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> at 11.27 p.m. will see fit to call it quits for tonight to avoid many of the things honourable members have been complaining about, such as staying up late, and set a good example on the second night of the parliamentary sitting, because everyone has made up his mind anyway. </para>

            <para>- I want to add a few brief words to what has already been said. Firstly, I think that the real trouble with hold-ups in business started in this Parliament when the break of 1 week was introduced in the first place. I am one who favours sitting 4 days a week from the commencement of the session until it finishes. That does not suit the Government because it cannot work out its business on more than an hourly or a daily basis. In other words, it does not know what is going to happen in the Parliament from day to day. I think that the Government should set certain days on which the Parliament will commence and finish each year. As the honourable member for Bradfield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Turner)</inline> said, it should be able to announce the business for the session and, once having set it, Parliament should sit for 4 days a week, or 5, right through until the session is finished. What happens now is that we sit for a week, a fortnight or 3 weeks and then lose all track of the business. This is particularly so if Easter intervenes. A session may extend over months whereas if we had sat on a 4-day week or S-day week basis we could have finished it within a reasonable time. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Members of this Parliament - be they new members or older members - are very fortunate to be here at this stage of their political careers. When I first came to this Parliament and when air travel was introduced a member had the privilege of travelling once each week to Parliament and back. There was no going to Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide or Perth every weekend as one wanted. I remember one Western Australian member whose son changed from short pants to long pants and who did not see it happen because he was here for so long. When I first came to Parliament we sat from February to November! without any breaks. I might say that I held a borderline seat at that stage. By never going down to any functions I actually increased my majority. Let that be a lesson to a lot of honourable members who want to rush back to their electorates. The less they see of you, the bigger the majority you may get. I know because it happened to me. I mention these things because I think they are important. </para>
          <para>It must be remembered that every member of the America Congress is allowed only  2  visits to his electorate per year when the Congress is sitting. A member must be at Congress whenever it is sitting. He cannot go back to his electorate over the weekend. Members can place too much importance on being in their electorates over the weekend for the simple reason that the public realises that they have a responsibility here. If the Parliament is sitting no elector desires his member to be absent. Honourable members will find that, if a telegram is sent in reply to an invitation to some function or other saying that they cannot attend because of parliamentary duties, it is twice as good as being at the function so far as votes are concerned. The greatest reputation one might have in a Parliament is that one is always there. </para>
          <para>When there are breaks in the sittings from time to time one loses track of the business of the Parliament and cannot keep up with it, particularly if the break is an extended one. J do not know why members would want a break in the session except for the reason that the Government docs not have any business to bring on. Committees could then meet in the recess. As it is now, it is practically impossible for the committees, including party committees, to meet because of the sittings unless they meet during the lunch hour, which is not satisfactory. </para>
          <para>All in all, I think it would be better for the Parliament to sit right through for 4 or  5  days a week and to finish the session. If we also had set times when we knew the Parliament would be sitting we would have a much better and happier situation. Because I know an amendment along those lines does not have much chance of being carried I do not intend to sponsor such an amendment. I intend to support the present proposals that are before the Parliament, not that I think they suit my point of view or are the best. I think we are lax in our duty in not sitting right through until we finish the session, as was done until comparatively recently. In that way we would be more satisfied. Our electors would see more of us and we would be better able to attend to our parliamentary duties. </para>

            <para>- I do not wish to detain the House long but I feel that I should make some reply to the honourable member for Griffith <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Donald Cameron).</inline> He suggested that the honourable member for Bradfield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Turner)</inline> had, when he felt strongly on certain issues, taken certain action.  1  think his electors would support the action he has taken. He took the action he considered to be in the best interests of the Parliament as he saw what was occurring. I am also sure that the views that have been put forward tonight by the honourable member for Cunningham <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor),</inline> who is a man of long experience in the Parliament, are genuine ones and are based on experience. Those who have not been here for such a long time, including myself, do nol have that experience. I certainly feci that what he put forward was reasonable and justified. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I support the motion before the House but I must say that after listening to some of the speeches  1  have reservations. Like the honourable member for Bradfield, I wonder whether these committee meetings will take place at the weekend. I have seen and  1  am sure the Opposition has seen the situation where it is decided that a committee will sit on Friday or Saturday. Always the Queenslanders and the Western Australians are only too keen to stay because they do not go home but the Victorian or New South Welshman says that he has a function in his electorate to which he must go. The result is a very half hearted committee. </para>
          <para>There are other small matters with which I am not in agreement. I do not particularly approve of private members' speeches being curtailed by  5  minutes or whatever it may be. lt is up to the members themselves to exercise self-discipline in respect of their speeches. I agree with the criticism of members - they may include myself - who go on repeating the same thing just to see out  30  minutes. But most of the problems complained of in the running of the House appear to have been in the hands of the members themselves for a very long time. One of the things that has been forgotten is that most of the wrongs can be rectified if members of Parliament themselves act as I contend they should act. There are occasions where honourable members complain that the House is being detained beyond a reasonable hour. If they can persuade the majority of the members of the House that this is so, the decision is in the hands of the House itself. It can dictate when the sittings should terminate on a particular night. I heard the honourable members from South Australia say that they have been forced to sit late hours in the night. All I can say is that I and members on this side of the House have been forced to sit late hours in the night primarily because the Opposition wants to go on and on, mainly with the idea of forcing the Government to implement the gag so that the Press will be able to say in the morning newspapers that the Government gagged a certain issue. </para>
          <para>I support the motion before the House. Quite frankly 1 do not think it will achieve anything. I do not think it is necessary. I do not think it will do the things that some of the newspapers contend it was intended to do, and that is to make the House more effective. The House in my opinion will become more effective only when the members of the Parliament decide that they have a responsibility and are prepared to accept that responsibility whatever their Party. I think one of the things that has been proved tonight, as the honourable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron)</inline> illustrated, is that, when members of Parliament are allowed to get up and speak on an issue without being bound by Caucus or by some decision from somewhere else, even perhaps by some other men, the Parliament is able to get down to a discussion and is perhaps able to reach a solution that may be to the betterment of the people of this country. I support the Issue but I do not think it will solve the problems. I think those problems will be solved only when members of Parliament, including myself, decide that they have a right and responsibility to act on certain issues, perhaps above and beyond the decisions of Caucus. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Australians are concerned. They are not unanimously in support of the proposal. There are those, such as myself, who oppose this motion. I represent, as does the honourable member for Stirling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Webb),</inline> a Western Australian metropolitan electorate. I oppose this motion because I feel that what is before us is quite futile. It does not offer a solution to the problem. In fact, it represents a reduction in the hours of sitting which we experienced in the last session when we sat for 4 days a week. If it proposed that we sat for 3 weeks of 4 days or that we sat from the beginning of the session to the end of the session, I would support it. I am not naive enough to believe that there will be committee meetings on week ends. For example, in the football season honourable members will return to their electorates, saying that they have to attend to electorate matters, but we will find they will go to the football. </para>
          <para>Even with the commitments set out here it will be possible for a Western Australian to return to his electorate for the week end. Of course, the honourable member for Forrest <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kirwan)</inline> or the honourable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Collard),</inline> because of their country commitments, will not be able to do so. But it will be possible for honourable members with metropolitan electorates to return to Western Australia for the week end. No doubt if this motion is carried I will be returning because I feel that I should be there to attend to my electorate commitments. A lot has been said about the time spent travelling. In Western Australia the amount of time some school children would spend travelling each day would be equivalent to the amount which some honourable members are protesting about spending weekly. Even some of our school buses I believe take 2 hours to get to and fro each day. No doubt, with this modern transport by which some of our members are travelling to the various States, they would return to their homes in the same time and with the same liability as the school child would experience in Western Australia. It is no great burden to have to travel long distances because of the modern transportation that we have, and I appreciate the facility. </para>
          <para>I want to see the record straight because some honourable members were saying that they would support the resolution because they understood ail Western Australians were unanimously in support of it. I want to make it quite clear that they are not. Probably I would be the one exception. In a particular instance this proposal would give you 10 days away if you stayed away from your electorate for the weekend and 12 days if you travelled the day before and the day after. I do not intend to commit myself to this, because I feel I should be in my electorate. Not everybody agrees with me. The hour is late. I just wanted to make that point. I leave it at that. </para>

            <para>- I do not want to detain the House for long but I want to make a couple of comments first of all to dispel any idea that it might be the wish of the Executive to bring in this new proposal to sit for 2 weeks and then to rise for a week. I do not support the proposal. I oppose it because I do not believe it is a practical proposition or that it will achieve what it is aimed to achieve. Since I have been in the Parliament I have seen various changes. When I first came here we sat continuously with 3-day weeks. I believe a 3-day week is the best sort of week for the Parliament. I believe we all become a little strained if we sit for 4 days a week. I think the performance of the last session, when we sat for 4 days a week, was undersirable and the best was not obtained from this Parliament. However experience showed that if we sat continuously for weeks, be it for 7, 8, 9, 10 or 11 weeks, everybody became a little irascible and cranky. People from distant areas were not given the opportunity to visit their electorates or to attend to them so it was decided - I think in about 1958 or 1959 - that we should sit for 4 weeks and then have 1 week off. Somewhere in the 60s it was decided that we should sit for 3 weeks and then have a week off. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I have noticed that on this sort of performance, sitting for 3 weeks then having a week off, we could not cope with the amount of work that was coming forward. Last year and this year it has been necessary to sit on Fridays - that is, to go into a 4 day week. This new proposal does have certain virtues. I think some of the other proposals, that is for altering the time of speakings, the sittings of the House and the quorum of the House, have great virtues; but to try to confine the work to 2 weeks and then have a week off, and to do that for the term of the session, would mean that we just could not get through the work. Parliament is the most unpredictable place imaginable. One is never certain when it will start or finish or what work will come forward. 1 believe the most important thing with Parliament is that if topics of national importance or of urgency come up there should be ample time for discussion so that all honorabe members can state their point of view. Although this proposal might give more debating hours, before long we will find ourselves having to sit on the second Friday in the 2 week period. That would mean that we would sit for 5 days in the second week, which I think is completely untenable. </para>
          <para>The suggestion that honourable members will stay here over the weekend and participate in committees is quite unrealistic because anybody who can get home at the weekend will get home. When there has been a 4 day week everybody has been scrambling to get away on Fridays as soon as possible. To anybody who was here on Friday afternoons the place was almost like a morgue with barely a quorum to keep it going. If honourable members accept this new proposal it will not be long before there will be an extension and they will bc sitting on the second Friday and they will sit for more weeks. The trouble Ls we cannot always sit for more weeks because of periods when there are Senate elections or House of Representatives elections, or we come up to Christmas time. People think you can sit continuously. Honourable members would not accept that, because there is a need for breaks. There is a need for parliamentary teams to go overseas and to travel around Australia. For those reasons I am afraid that I cannot accept the proposal put forward. </para>

            <para>- I will not detain the House for long. However, I am opposed to the motion. I am a country member. Many other honourable members have benevolently said that the motion is being moved for the country members. Let me say that if the Parliament sits on Friday I do not get home until Saturday afternoon. With all due respect to honourable members who come from Perth they can get home on Friday night, even though it is late at night. I take the same view as does the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> that a person's responsibility is to the Parliament and to those people who elect him. An average of 30 to 35 people come into my office daily for 5 days a week. When I get home on Saturday or Friday I have enough work for 1 day and sometimes 2 days to try to catch up with because of the weekI have been down here. It is all right to say: 'You can do this by telephone'. But I find that after 3 days and 3 nights in this Parliament one needs a break. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I agree with the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony).</inline> It is not often that we agree on something; it is very strange that we seem to be agreeing on this proposal. As the Minister said, if we sit for 4 days, before we know where we are we will finish up sitting for 5 days. One has only to witness what has happened in this Parliament when we have sat on a Friday. It is the greatest scramble to get pairs and to get out of the place as fast as possible. I am not going to fall for the argument that we are all going to stay here as a happy family over the weekend and do committee work. I have never heard anything so nonsensical. I guarantee that there will be few members here at the weekend whether the Parliament sits for 3 days a week or 4 days a week. Those who will be here for the weekend in most cases would be staying here anyhow. </para>
          <para>I oppose the motion. I can see no advantage in it except in some cases where there is a problem of travelling, as in the case of the honourable member for Darling <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr FitzPatrick).</inline> The honourable member has a major problem in travelling to and from his electorate. It takes him a far longer time to get here than it takes me and practically every other honourable member who lives in a country area. But I am not going to accept this benevolent attitude that we all stay back on Saturday and Sunday, that the Library will be open on Saturday and Sunday and that we will all have our committee meetings on Saturday and Sunday. Just watch the flights out of here on Friday afternoon. There will be no-one left in Canberra on Saturday or Sunday. </para>

            <para>-  I will not keep honourable members for very long. I think honourable members know that J am a very kindly and co-operative person. I like to fit in with what people desire. I have been torn between the ideas of the honourable members who live a long way away and want to get home and those who do not. 1 think what convinced me was when my friend the honourable member for Swan <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bennett)</inline> disclaimed the idea and said that he would go home anyhow. I think this attitude is pretty right. I think honourable members will find that this will happen in any case. I do not think there is any real merit in the scheme now before the House. Perhaps honourable members are attracted to it because it is a new idea and they may gain some benefits here and there. But I believe that what appeals to most honourable members who are going to support the motion is that they will get home for a week every second week instead of every third week. Of course, these honourable members want to get home. But I cannot see that we are going to carry out any further parliamentary duties under the proposed scheme. I think that the proposed scheme will disorganise the arrangements in our electorates that have been carried out for many years. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is not easy to get people to change attitudes and patterns that have been adopted over many years. They wonder why a change is necessary. I would not mind sitting in the Parliament for 4 days over a period of 3 weeks, in the same way as we have been doing, but even that is not a very effective method. I would not mind sitting for 3 days a week right through the session, as has been suggested. More work might be done in that way. However, I agree with the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> that that does involve difficulties for some members and it might not result in efficiency. I have given a great deal of thought to the matter. Frankly 1 do not see any great benefit in the propoasls.

              <para>- I ask for the indulgence of the House for a few minutes, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker.</inline> I wanted to take the first point, point (a), to a vote tonight. Honourable members have spoken about it and all honourable members have the points in their minds, lt therefore seemed proper to take it to a vote tonight. However, time has gone on and it is now 11.50 p.m. I therefore asked the Government Whip to move the adjournment of the debate. However, as we are not voting on party lines but as individuals, I would be very happy to ask the Whip to withdraw the motion for the adjournment of the debate so that we could take it to a vote tonight. </para>

            <para>- I wish to take only 2 or 3 minutes of the time of the House. I do not know how many Ministers nave spoken in this debate. Some very interesting points have been made. Personally, I am opposed to the proposals. I do not believe that they will assist the general working of the House or make the working of the House more satisfactory from the points of view of private members and the Ministry. The proposals involve virtually 8 consecutive days of sitting. This would establish a very crowded schedule and a very busy 2 weeks. Whatever may be the intention of the 10.30 p.m. rule, I am sure that the result would be a large number of late nights without any relief for members. 1 believe it would make it very difficult to provide time for parliamentary committees and for Cabinet to meet. This would be even more difficult to achieve than is the case at present. It has been said that one of the facts of life is that as soon as Friday arrived, under the proposals many members would be pressing for pairs in order to get away. It may be that some would be pressing not to return on the following Monday when the House would again be sitting. </para>

          <para>Another point arises which is of importance to private members. I refer to the number of weeks in a year in which private members have access to Ministers because the House is sitting in those weeks. I believe that the proposals we are considering would reduce the number of weeks in which private members would have that kind of access to the Executive of the Government. I believe that this is a significant reason for opposing the general matter which is before the House at present. </para>

            <para>- No doubt it will surprise you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> to learn that I intend to support the proposition before the House. I have listened with a great deal of interest to honourable members from both sides of the chamber who have put their views in this debate. The honourable member for Cunningham <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Connor),</inline> the honourable member for Newcastle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Charles Jones)</inline> and the honourable member for Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Cope)</inline> expressed their views as to the convenience they would wish all honourable members to enjoy. 1 feel quite sure that those members who spoke early in the debate will support this proposition now that they have heard of the difficulties and misfortunes that face some of us who are not fortunate to live closer to Canberra than we do. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>J am not naive enough to believe that just because this motion is carried we will not sit the hours and days in this Parliament that the Government decides it wants the Parliament to sit. The Government will make the decision because it has the numbers, and I suggest that when we are the Government after the next election and we have the numbers the House will sit the times we want it to sit. Therefore, in that particular situation, I think that those members who have spoken as though this would not be the case are drawing red herrings across the path. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> and others have said that there are 2 particular points concerning the work of a member. They have said that a member is elected to represent, in this Parliament, the people of his electorate. I agree with them completely. This is so, but I suggest that if a member is to represent all the people of his electorate and not just the electors themselves he has to give the people the opportunity of presenting cases to him and of discussing their problems with him to make him aware of how he is going to represent them in this House. At present with the existing sitting hours many members who represent far flung electorates which extend for many miles do not gel the opportunity of seeing their constituents nor do their constituents get the opportunity of seeing their members and presenting cases to them. This is one of the reasons why I support the motion. </para>
          <para>Personally I would be no more inconvenienced by the proposed sitting times than I am by the existing situation. 1 have become accustomed to getting home on Friday nights or Saturday mornings and leaving again on Sunday nights. The people of Kalgoorlie have become accustomed to seeing me on Saturdays or Sundays when the House is sitting. Perhaps if I adopted the attitude adopted by the honourable member for Newcastle, who objected to his schedule enabling him to see people on Monday being upset.. I would object to the motion because I might be wanting the people of my electorate to see me during the week when I was not in Parliament. 1 am a bit diffident about putting this because I may be accused of being somewhat selfish. But if I want to go to the far north of my electorate it takes me 2 days travel to get there and back. In other words it is impossible for me to undertake such a journey over the weekend. If I want to go to other parts of my electorate where there is no air travel available it takes me 2 days by motor car to get there and back. Honourable members will appreciate that I will find it easier to contact the people of my electorate under the proposed sitting times than I do under the existing arrangements. </para>

              <para>- I do not know. It may be, as the honourable member for Grayndler <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly)</inline> said, that if I am around the place too long I will not be around here very long. Irrespective of whether that is so, I think the House should take some cognisance of the fact that the people of Australia should have an equal right, if they live in the country, to see their members, to discuss with them their problems and to present cases to them, as do people who live in city electorates or in electorates where members can get to them or they can get to the members more frequently. For that reason I support the motion. </para>

              <para>Tenders for the Jervis Bay nuclear power station closed on15 June, 1970. They included tenders for the CANDU and SGHWR types but it will not be possible to give accurate up-to-date relative costs for these two types until the tenders have been fully' evaluated. </para>

              <para>No. It is not possible to give an estimate of the number of these types of nuclear stations which can be constructed in Australia. When generating authorities decide to install nuclear power plants in their own systems they will almost certainly call tenders on a world wide basis as the Australian Atomic Energy Commission has done in the case of the Jervis Bay project. Decisions regarding the type and number of nuclear stations to be selected will be based on technical and economic grounds. </para>

            <para>No exact data comparing the standards in the four countries is available and in any case accurate comparisons of this nature between countries, particularly as regards education, arc very difficult to make. The medical classification used by the Australian Army is derived from the standards developed in Canada and also adopted by the United Kingdom. Standards in the USA are similar, by and large, to ours. In USA. the educational level is set at 'high school graduate'. This is the level generally attainedat the age of 17 or 18 years. No formal educational standard is set in the United Kingdom. Applicants are psychologically tested and if a satisfactory Selection Group Rating (approximately SGR3) is attained he may be enlisted. This system is similar to the Australian method. Canadian entry standard is Grade Vlll, or the educational level reached by a child of 13 years. It is the entry qualification for high school. In summary, the minimum medical standards for enlistment are about the same in the four countries, the minimum psychological standard is higher in Canada and the minimum educational education level higher in USA and Canada. </para>

              <para>1 understand from representatives of the Tasmanian industry that substantial purchases of hops from both the 1969 and 1970 Australian crops could reduce the quantity taken up from next season's crop. In addition, the conversion of hops to extract by a major brewery resulting in a considerable lessening of hops used and the move by growers, both in Tasmania and Victoria, from the low alpha resin varieties to Pride of Ringwood and similar high alpha resin types could also have an effect on brewery requirements. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>Importations of both dried hops and hop extracts have substantially decreased in recent years as the supply of Australian grown hops has been approaching brewers' requirements. It has been the practice of brewers to import only hops required for specialised beers and relatively small quantities of extract. The value of imports of hop cones and lupulin has declined from about Sl.lm in 1965-66 to $129,000 in 1968-69 and to $38,000 for the 9 months ended March 1970. Import clearances of hop extract were valued at only $1,642 for the 10 months ended April 1970. </para>

        <para>Imports of hops and hop extract at present levels do not appear to pose a major threat to the local growers nor would prevention of imports do much to alleviate their problems. However, in the event of it being the industry's view that the current level of tariff protection is inadequate the way is open for an approach to be made by the industry to my colleague, the Minister for Trade and Industry, seeking an investigation by the Special Advisory Authority. I believe that, in 1968, when industry problems were discussed by Victorian and Tasmanian hop grower representatives with officers of the Department of Trade and Industry, the possibility of a combined approach by hop producers and factors to the Departments of Trade and Industry, Customs and Excise and Primary Industry for assistance in combating low priced imports of hops and hop extract was a method of action considered. However, no such approach along these lines has been made. </para>

          <item label="(5)">
            <para>The Government has not considered the payment of a subsidy on exports of hops. To do so could encourage an expansion of production which would be contrary to efforts by the industry to regulate production to a level compatible with domestic requirements and to rationalise distribution and prices. It is also regarded as important not to encourage growers to produce for export in view of the difficulties that have been encountered in finding suitable overseas markets for the quantities and types of hops presently available. </para>

The percentage of full blood Aborigines may well be much lower, possibly less than half this figure. There is no really reliable way of determining mortality rates in Western Australia for the Aboriginal section of the community since the basic data are absent. As the results of investigations performed on small groups of people, figures reported from an analysis in Western Australia of deaths in the 2 year period 1967 and 1968 indicate that over 20% of infant deaths are contributed by persons identified as Aboriginal or part Aboriginal. </para>

Prematurity and dehydration are additional causes. Other problems exist, but the extant to which they contribute to the mortality rate are difficult to define. Some of these factors are: nutritional deficiencies, insanitary living conditions, overcrowding due to frequent pregnancies and the congregation of many members of a family into 1 residence. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="1)">
              <para>From an examination of available data it can be estimated that in the Northern Division of the Northern Territory for1968 the Aboriginal infant mortality was 75.0 per 1,000 live births, and the mortality rate in the 1-2 years age groups 32.8 per 1,000 children in this age group. In the other age groups the number of deaths, amounting to 2 or 3 only, are so small as to make calculation unrealistic. There were 3 deaths of children aged 2-3 years, one in the 3-4 years group, none aged 4-5 years and 2 between the age of 5 and 8 years. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>In the Southern Division of the Northern Territory the infant mortality rates for recent years have been somewhat higher than in the Northern Division, being probably between 90 and 100 per 1,000 live births. </para>
          <para>Whilst it is not possible to give Aboriginal mortality rates for Queensland and Western Australia in the same detail it has been estimated that infant mortality calculated in respect of 10 Settlements in Queensland for the 5 year period 1962-66 was around 112 per 1,000 live births. </para>
          <para>From a survey carried out in 1967-68 in Western Australia, it is estimated that some 20% of infant deaths may be attributed to the Aboriginal population. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>The causes of death vary according to the particular age group and geographical area hut in general, prematurity, gastro-enlerilis. chest infections, malnutrition and dehydration, infections such as those causing meningitis and deaths by accident all play a significant part. The major role played by infections in causing death in Aboriginal infants between the age of 1 month and1 year in Western Australia was highlighted by figures indicating that around 92% of deaths in this age group were associated with infections of one sort or another. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>In Queensland for the years 1962-66 gastroenteritis, pneumonia, and prematurity were responsible for the majority of infant deaths whilst pneumonia and gastro-enteritis and meningitis caused a significant number in the1 to 16 age group. </para>
          <para>An analysis in the Northern Division of the Northern Territory for 1968 showed that prematurity and contributing factors were responsible for a large proportion of deaths in early infancy, while gastro-enteritis, pneumonia, malnutrition and dehydration accounted for the majority of deaths during the remainder of the first 2 years of life. Drowning was the cause of 2 of the 4 deaths in the 2-4 age group. </para>
          <para>In some areas malnutrition is almost certainly of greater significance than would at first sight appear due to its underlying effect in enhancing the development of terminal infections. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>The mortality rales for the population as a whole for the year 1968 showed an infant mortality rate per 1,000 live births of 19.83 for males and 15.61 for females. The mortality rate for the age groups under consideration when related to the estimated mid-year population for persons of the age specific group were 1-2 years - 1.44 for males and 1.41 for females. 2-3 year group  -  1.04 for males and 0.87 for females. 3-4 years  -  0.72 for males and 0.65 for females, 4-5 years  -  0.61 for males and 0.55 for females. 5-8 years  -  0.47 for males and 0.38 for females per 1,000 of population at risk. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>Comparing these rates for the whole population with the Aboriginal mortality rates shown in the reply to part (1) of this question, it may be seen that the mortality rate amongst infant Aboriginal children is much higher than for other children in Australia. </para>

            <para>On 26th September 1968, the Prime Minister tabled in the House a number of documents pertaining to the purchase by Australia of 24 F-111 aircraft. These documents included the Memorandum of Understanding dated 19th October 1963, and the associated Technical Arrangement dated June 1964. At the time, the Prime Minister stated that any document or part of any document which had security content applicable to both the U.S. and Australian Governments would not be disclosed. These limitations are still valid. </para>
            <para>There is also to be considered the long established practice of not making public the various advices provided to the Government by the public service. The public service in our system of Government cannot engage in public debate on Government issues. On this point I refer you to the discussion in 1958 by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Philip</inline> McBride, the then Minister for Defence, regarding the tabling of the Morshead Report, (Hansard of 27th March 1958, page 776). The reasons for not tabling that report are still valid and apply a further limitation to the limitation to which I have just referred in regard to your request. For both these reasons, I regret I cannot make available to you the types of paper you have requested. It is my belief that the Government has already made public as much as possible in regard to the F-111 project. </para>

            <para>I refer to your Question on Notice on 12th June 1970, regarding the issue of a special postage stamp to commemorate the 25th anniversary ot Rural Youth in Australia. </para>
            <para>My Department receives very many requests for the issue of special stamps covering a wide range of subjects. However, because our production facilities allow only a few .stamps to be issued each year, al) of these requests must be examined on a very selective basis. </para>
            <para>The many requests for stamps, particularly for the recognition of worthwhile causes and organisations, present special problems in distinguishing between the merits of the various proposals put forward by the interested parties. We <inline font-style="italic">have</inline> had to refuse many of these requests from worthy organisations, both Australian and international, and in recent years we have been able to issue stamps for only a few organisations, such as Rotary, Lions Clubs and the YWCA. In this connection, and because of the number of requests, we have had to stipulate that anniversaries of Australian significance, as a general principle, must be at least of 50 years, or multiples of  50  years. </para>
            <para>While I appreciate the position in the community of Rural Youth in Australia I am sorry that I am unable to meet this request for the issue of a special stamp. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <para>The question cannot be answered simply as there are many variable factors which influence the cost of a new public hospital. Estimates of cost can only be made after careful examination of respective features and components, and isolation of common and differing elements. Any estimate of costs per bed would therefore have to be made with a defined type of project in mind. For example, costs, excluding land, for a sophisticated 'acute' public hospital could rise to $36,000 per bed. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)(a) Informants and complainants are interviewed not for the purpose of discovering the merits of their cases, but to ensure that their causes are within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Industrial Court and. for that purpose, some indication of the facts may be necessary. </para>

              <para>Yes. On one recent occasion, the Deputy Industrial Registrar, Sydney, declined to issue a Summons on two grounds: firstly, that neither the information nor the summons stated the section of the Act against which the offence was alleged; and, secondly, that the affidavit filed in support merely stated that the facts in the information were true.

          <para>In no instance, of which I am aware, has this impeded the access of litigants to the Commonwealth Industrial Court. Since informants are invariably assisted by a solicitor from the beginning of the action, the additional cost of preparing an affidavit which, in any case, is required at the hearing before the Court, cannot result in any unfair or unnecessary burden of costs. </para>
          <para>In the instance referred to in answer (2) the replacement affidavit, which was provided within 24 hours, was a simple statement of facts involving the addition of six short paragraphs to the original affidavit. </para>

            <para>Figures for immigrant families arriving in Australia (a family being defined as a man and wife, or man, wife and children) do not take account of those cases in which the husband and wife migrate separately. Because of this, such figures underestimate the total number of families received. However, a reasonable estimate of the latter can be obtained by taking the total arrivals of married male settlers. In the past 5 years, the fieures for these were as follows: </para>

        </para>
        <para>Probably some of the married male settlers who arrived in this period were still awaiting their wives and families at the end of December 1969, but this would be offset by arrivals of wives and families of married male migrants who arrived before 1965. </para>
        <para>Estimates are not available for the number of family units expected to arrive in Australia in each, of the next 3 years (1970-74). Although the Australian immigration programme is planned broadly some years ahead, the actual composition and size of each individual year's programme is affected by current conditions in overseas source countries and by Australia's ability to attract and integrate new settlers. </para>

              <para>and (4) Vocational counselling is not normally a function of the Repatriation Department, but of the Department of Labour and National Service. If necessary, ex-servicemen may be referred to the Vocational Guidance Section of the Department of Labour and National Service, staffed by qualified psychologists with special training in vocational guidance. However, for ex-servicemen receiving treatment for incapacities due to war service (including Vietnam service), or who are eligible under the Repatriation Department's Scheme for ex-servicemen unable to follow a former occupation because of a war disability, vocational training is provided by that Department as part of the rehabilitation programme and, where appropriate, Repatriation Department psychologists are available to advise on vocations and training. </para>

The widespread adoption of fast breeder reactors is not expected to commence until about 1990.
