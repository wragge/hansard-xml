            <para>That the Commonwealth Parliament has acted to remove some inadequacies in the Australian education system; a major inadequacy at present in Australian education is the lack of equal education opportunity for all; more than 500,000 children suffer from serious lack of equal opportunity; Australia cannot afford to waste the talents of one sixth of its school children; only the Commonwealth has the financial resources for special programmes to remove inadequacies; and nations such as the United Kingdom and the United States have shown that the chief impetus for change and the finance for improvement come from the National Government. </para>
            <para>Your Petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives make legal provision for a joint Commonwealth-State inquiry into inequalities in Australian education to obtain evidence on which to base long term national programmes for the elimination of inequalities; the immediate financing of special programmes for low income earners, migrants, Aboriginal, rural and inner suburban dwellers and handicapped children; and the provision of pre-school opportunities for all children from culturally different or socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds.

This happening has drawn once more to the attention of the appropriate authorities the great necessity for the most intimate scrutiny and watching of all safety precautions in regard to these engineering projects. </para>

            <para>- The Prime Minister will recall telling the House nearly 2 years ago that negotiations for Australia&#39;s entry into the container shipping consortia were opened by the Minister for Trade and Industry. And he will recall saying that we would be inside all these shipping conferences which dominate our trade with Europe, the United States of America and Japan and we would participate in their management and that the information so gained would be of great value to Australia. I ask him: Was this his own view or the view of the Minister for Trade and Industry? In the light of the Government&#39;s failure to prevent recent increases in container freight and on-shore handling charges or to persuade the consortia to honour their undertakings in the matter of outports, does he now believe the view, whoever held it, was well-founded? If so, will he say in what way the situation would be different if the Government had not joined the consortia? </para>

            <para>- I think that any reasonable person must admit that if a company or a government or an individual is a member of an organisation carrying on some commercial activity and therefore has access to the costs of that organisation carrying on that activity then they must be in a better position to judge the accuracy or otherwise of cases put forward for increases in freights. I think that the Minister for Shipping and Transport might well elaborate if the Leader of the Opposition wishes to pursue the matter, but in my understanding of it, contrary to what has appeared in print, the costs of shipping in container ships are less than the costs of shipping in the conventional types of ships. </para>

              <para>- Very much lower, and many of the conventional ships are still engaged in the trade to which the honourable the Leader of the Opposition refers. The statement I have made that the cost of the sea freight on conventional ships is much higher than the cost on container ships has been questioned. That is a matter of fact. That is a matter on which the Minister for Shipping and Transport I think might well, as the Minister responsible, inform the Leader of the Opposition at this time if he extends his question to that responsible Minister and to the Minister for Trade and Industry. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister for Primary Industry. Is the Minister aware of the plight of the small poultry farmer - the family unit - who has a flock of up to 10,000 birds? Is it possible to establish a system of registration of farms and a quota system? Is there any other way in which the industry can be rehabilitated to ensure its survival, or is it just a matter of where the chicken got the axe? </para>

            <para>- I am very conscious of the growing difficulties of the small poultry farmer in obtaining a satisfactory net farm income. In recent years the governments of Australia have introduced a scheme controlled by the Council of Egg Marketing Authorities. This scheme has brought about a degree of stability and equalisation of prices, but the effect of the scheme in helping to stabilise prices has tended to create a decline as production has increased. There have been moves within the industry to try to bring about some control of production firstly, by the licensing of farms, and secondly, by the implementation of what is known as the French plan by which a supertax is imposed on anybody who produces more than his quota of eggs. Both of those proposals have been examined by the Australian Agricultural Council. The first proposal on the licensing of farms was rejected because there was no unanimity between the States on the proposal and a restriction on production could not work effectively unless all States were in agreement This agreement could not be reached. As to the second proposal, known as the French plan, it was shown to be unconstitutional for the Commonwealth to organise such a plan, so that was not workable. As a result of the Australian Agricultural Council having examined both proposals and deciding that nothing could be achieved, it felt that a firm decision should be taken and made known that there was not any likelihood of a quota system being introduced to control the production of eggs. The need to make a firm statement was to prevent people trying to boost their egg production level so that if a quota system did come into operation they would then be entitled to their higher quota. That is the situation obtaining at present. I have been told that New South Wales is again looking into some scheme of which I have no knowledge, but I do not know how any scheme can be brought into operation without the consent of all States. </para>

            <para>- I preface my question which is directed to the Minister for Trade and Industry by saying that he will recall telling us 18 months ago during the container shipping debate that he wanted to see the Government right in the middle of this business so that when an argument occurred as to what should be a fair freight we would know as much about it as would any other shipping operator in the world. I ask him whether the Government partnership in the overseas container consortia has convinced him that the recent freight increases are indeed fair, and if not, what effect the Government partnership has had in obviating or moderating such freight increases. </para>

            <para>- I make it clear that I accept the primary responsibility for having advised the Government and the Parliament in respect of participation of the Government in the container shipping service. Let me remind the Australian Labor Party that this was warmly applauded by that Party. There are factors in respect of shipping services that are beyond the control of the Government. For instance, there was an industrial dispute in respect of the container terminal at Tilbury in London which led to the whole Australian-British container service having to go to Rotterdam and Antwerp for, I think, almost 18 months, and bearing the cost of the tremendously expensive terminal at Tilbury which was not in use for the whole of that period. But within the freight rates of that period was absorbed the cost of transporting the container cargoes from the Continent to London or to other British ports. That matter was quite beyond the control of this Government or, as far as I know, any other government. I am informed that seamen&#39;s wages have increased over that period by 40 per cent. </para>

              <para>- There is no container service to America. So I do not know what the Leader of the Opposition thinks he is talking about. There has been an increase of 31 per cent, I am informed, in stevedoring costs in Australia. The increase in seamen&#39;s wages and the increase in stevedoring costs are primarily to the advantage of those whom the Labor Party believes to support it. I do not know whether the Labor Party believes that these tremendous expenses can be incurred without being reflected in the charges made by those who have to pay the higher rate. The truth of the matter is that higher wages have a vastly lesser impact upon a container ship than upon a conventional ship in the carrying of cargo, because we know very well that the proportion of manpower to tonnage is very much less in a container ship than it is in a conventional ship. </para>

          <para>It is not for the Government to say whether it enjoys the higher freight rates. The Government knows that the higher freight charges substantially are a reflection of the costs of the shipping companies. It was not the Government which approved of the freight rate increase; it was those who, to a large extent, owned the freight, thai is, the wool, the fruit and so on. It is true that the owners of general cargo did not approve the 10 per cent increase. I think it would be useful if on an early occasion, possibly today or on the next day of sitting, I were to make a short explanatory statement of the factors that bear upon the container service to Australia, the costs, and the advantages which have come or which we are sure are still in prospect </para>

            <para>- In answer to the last part of the honourable gentleman&#39;s question, unhappily there is evidence of school children being peddled drugs of certain descriptions by those creatures who seem to have no conscience about selling anything for money. Fortunately, to this stage, the situation has not reached alarming proportions; but, as I have said before, the trends are such that they cause us deep concern. Security in chemist shops is another matter that is causing us great worry. As the efficiency of the Narcotics Squad of the Department of Customs and Excise, working in co-operation with the State Police drug squads, increases and we manage to clean Sydney out of pot or marihuana, for example, or Melbourne out of marihuana for a period, the increase in the outbreak of robberies or chemist busts, as they are called, is comparable with the increase in the sale of ice cream when there is a rise in temperature. When one looks at the security arrangements that exist in most pharmacies in Australia one has cause to feel concern. In some States, for example, the law provides that all dangerous drugs should be locked safely in a certain place. I have inspected these certain places and find that they are simply cupboards which I, not experienced in safebreaking, could open with a screwdriver in about 10 seconds and there, conveniently exposed for any thief, are all the dangerous drugs ready to be parcelled up and taken away. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>But the National Standing Control Committee on Drugs of Dependence has asked each State Government to legislate for drugs to be placed in safes which would provide some deterrent to a thief. I understand that New South Wales already has some legislation on this question and that other States are following. It is my hope that they will follow as quickly as possible. As far as penalties are concerned, I have mentioned before in this House the deep concern that I and State Ministers charged wim this responsibility are showing for the lightness of penalties imposed by courts on drug pushers. I am now not speaking of those who are simply users but of drug pushers who are not users. It just goes beyond my comprehension how, when parliaments both State and Federal set a maximum penalty of 10 years for such an offence, a pusher who is convicted with virtually no extenuating circumstances can be released by a court on payment of a $1,000 fine or is sentenced to 2 months imprisonment. I have said before in this House that Parliaments are loath to introduce minimum penalties for any offence hut I must say that my personal view is that unless some more realistic action is taken by the courts on this national problem the temptation will be placed before parliaments to legislate in that way. </para>

            <para>- I frankly did not hear, nor was I aware,of the warning the Leader of the Opposition gave. I believe that the Leader of the Opposition, together with members of the Australian Labor Party, very strongly supported the participation by the Australian Government in overseas shipping trades. As to the substance of what I understand to be the question of the honourable member, that is. whether or not there would be a lesser increase in costs if the Australian National Line had not participated in the overseas trades, perhaps the honourable member might be interested to pursue the statement which the Minister for Trade and Industry has indicated that he will make in this House either later today or on the next day of sitting. In this statement we can set out categorically the several areas within which costs have moved very substantially against the ship owners. It is these costs, of course, which were recognised by Interlaine and the British Wool Federation, being the owners of wool at the point of shipment, and as a result of these increased costs they agreed to the establishment of the 4 per cent freight increase. There is no doubt that there have been cost movements but these have moved far more in the conventional sector than in the container sector. </para>

          <para>Over the past 12 months of operation there have been and in the next 12 months there will continue to be a very substantial percentage of cargoes and goods carried from Australia to the United Kingdom and Europe by conventional vessels. It is because of the industrial troubles at Tilbury, to which my colleague referred, because of the taint problems in refrigerated containers and of this blend of conventional and container vessels that the cost factors have moved so adversely against conference line freight rates in the United Kingdom-Europe trade. I believe that the participation of the Australian National Line in overseas shipping will give the Government some opportunity to follow the trends both on shore and in the sea legs in future freight negotiations. I believe this is very much in the interests of Australian shippers. I am surprised that members of the Australian Labor Party who initially came out in support of participation by the Australian Government in the overseas shipping trade are now so critical of it. </para>

            <para>- I ask the Treasurer a question which concerns the marked increase in demand by the farm sector of the community for bank loan accommodation. Is consideration being given to the need for long term bank lending through the Farm Development Loan Fund to which the trading banks have access, and term lending through the Development Bank for the purpose of making loans over periods of 15 years or more with suspension of repayments during seasonal difficulties where necessary? In view of the liquidity difficulties facing many primary producers could this means of assisting them be facilitated by the Government as a first step towards debt reconstruction foreshadowed in the recent Budget? </para>

            <para>- As the honourable member may be aware, the Farm Development Loan Fund and Term Loan Fund were recently replenished to the extent of $63m. This arrangement was announced recently by the Governor of the Reserve Bank. Loans from these Funds are directed towards farm development and improving productivity rather than debt restructuring or any other such end. The honourable member will be aware also that a number of farm development loans have been granted for a period of 15 years or more. My colleague the Minister for Primary Industry is currently engaged in a study of farm reconstruction problems which, of course, would include debt restructuring. But this range of problems is rather separate from the area covered by term loans and farm development loans. As soon as the studies being conducted by the Minister for Primary Industry have been completed - they are being pursued as fast as is practicable - the results will come up for examination and review. </para>

            <para>- I address a question to the Minister for Customs and Excise. How many drug pushers have been apprehended in the last 12 months? How many of these pushers have been selling drugs for a profit? How many have been selling drugs in order to provide themselves with drugs for their own addictions? Rather than talk of increased activity to clear Melbourne or Sydney of pot and then bemoan the increase in robberies of chemist shops, might it not be more intelligent and humane to offer supplies to drug addicts while they are medically examined and treated for their illness? </para>

            <para>- I am sure the honourable member would not expect me to carry in my head the statistics that he sought in the early part of his question. Might I say that a great number of pushers are also in fact users. But I think the honourable gentleman would be making a mistake if he said that these people deserve only sympathy - which they do - but that the community should not be protected from them. I think that a pusher who is not a user is a person without conscience and is wreaking havoc on his fellow man. The user-pusher has an even greater compulsion to sell drugs than the pusher because he must sell them to get money to feed his habit. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>If the honourable gentleman recognises that, I would readily agree with him that treatment is the proper course of action for that person. I doubt whether, to rush in to provide a solution by simply giving killer drugs to people who happen to be addicts would be an act of responsible government </para>

            <para>- The honourable member asks an interesting question. When talking with them myself, young drug addicts have put to me that stricter control should be placed on the sale of hypodermic needles and that they should be made available only on prescription. However, there are a great number of people in the medical profession who would oppose this. They believe that this stems from an artificial premise, that if you simply prevent a child from getting a hypodermic syringe that child will no longer take drugs. But such is the compulsion of a drug addict to administer a drug intravenously that the problem goes far deeper than simply cutting off the mechanics of administering the drug. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We have had evidence - I have seen it myself - of children who have an addiction to or a compulsion to take hard drugs - to mainline - and who when they cannot get  a  syringe use  a  most extraordinarily unhygienic and terrible implement to open up their arms and arteries to administer the drug. Whilst I acknowledge that the question has merit, there is by no means unanimity among members of the medical profession as to whether this is the best way to combat the problem. </para>

            <para>- The Minister for Customs and Excise has supplied me with an answer, anticipating that this question might come, because it is a question of some importance - certainly prima facie. The advice we have received is that <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Guise</inline> arrived at the Customs office carrying a number of gifts in a hessian bag. These gifts were for other persons. He stated that he did not know the nature of the gifts. Because of a strong and, I think, thoroughly reasonable presumption that quarantine problems might be involved, the bag was inspected by a Customs examining officer and one article was found to be a club with bird skins and feathers attached. That was referred to the quarantine officer on duty who informed <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Guise</inline> that it was subject to appropriate treatment before it could be admitted into Australia. </para>

          <para>I think that no matter from where anybody comes, or whatever position they hold, there is an overriding responsibility on the Department of Customs and Excise to see that diseases that could be introduced into Australia with disastrous effects should not be risked being introduced by allowing any subject matters of this kind. At that stage and not before it, as I am informed, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Guise</inline> informed the Customs officer that he was in fact only in transit and not seeking to come into Australia - in transit to Fiji. So the Customs officer advised him that he could take that club and take it to Fiji, which he did. No other baggage of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Guise</inline> or his wife was inspected in any way. </para>

            <para>- The Government does aid in maintaining a constant trade publicity campaign in the United Kingdom and, from the United Kingdom, largely in Europe. I do not recall immediately the amount that is set aside &#39;in this year&#39;s Budget to support this campaign, but it will be found to be of the order of some hundreds of thousands of dollars. The campaign is conducted by a committee known as the Overseas Trade Publicity Commitee. The funds provided by the Government, which, as I say, will amount this year to some hundreds of thousands of dollars, are supplemented by very substantial sums provided by the statutory marketing boards such as the canned fruit and dairy boards, and further supplemented by funds provided by either private commerce or expenditure by private commerce tailored to fit into the total publicity campaign. On the whole, this is an immense and very effective campaign. It is directed to drawing attention to the existence of goods and Australian food products and to the value of the food products. By and large it has been very successful. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I would think it improper for the Government to appear to be trying to influence a political decision in the United Kingdom by canvassing the fact that if Britain should join the Common Market food products there would be dearer. There is not the slightest doubt about this. They would be dramatically dearer. But that is a matter of controversy in the political field in the United Kingdom and it is not a matter in which we have sought or ever would seek to intervene and participate. We express our views, as I am expressing my own now, in this place. </para>

            <para>-I do not have a report on the particular case in Tasmania to which the honourable member for Wilmot refers. But I would point out that supplementary grants to assist in the payment of the increase in academic salaries recommended by the Eggleston Committee have been promised by the Federal Government. This is our share of the matching grant to assist the universities in meeting the increase in academic salaries. I hope to introduce a Bill, perhaps next week, on this subject. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The only other thing that has affected the triennial amounts which the university has, if it orders its affairs properly, is some rise in non-academic salaries. When the Australian Universities Commission plans for the 3-year period the amount that it is prepared to recommend to particular universities, it incorporates in the figure an amount for rises in prices and rises in the case of non-academic salaries. I have not seen any representations through the Commission in relation to the University of Tasmania on non-academic salaries. Academic salaries have risen following the Eggleston report and we have promised to supplement them. So, I do not see any justification at the moment for the proposed course of action of the University of Tasmania. </para>

            <para>- The question asked ii whether I think there would be any <inline font-style="italic">t&#62;.</inline> percussions in Australian sales of wheat <inline font-style="italic">ic</inline> China because Canada has now recognised her diplomatically. My answer is that I doubt very much whether it W1 make any difference. The fact is that we have been making very good sales to China since <inline font-style="italic">\\s</inline> first started making sales in 1960. During that period, Canada has talked of recognising China and of extending her diplomatic relationships with China, but this in no way has affected our sales. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Indeed we have made larger sales to Mainland China than Canada has. Although in the last 12 months, we have sold 2.2 million metric tons of wheat to Mainland China as against a Canadian sale of 2.3 million metric tons of wheat to Mainland China, if one looks at the period since sales first started to Mainland China in September 1960, one sees that Australia has sold 19.7 million metric tons of wheal and Canada has sold 17.5 million metric tons of wheat to that country. </para>
          <para>I believe that China buys wheat where she gets the type she requires and at the prices that she considers most favourable to her for that type of wheat. If one wishes to speculate as to what might happen, one also can ask: What will be the consequences to Russia&#39;s sale arrangements - they have expired - and will Canada&#39;s recognition of Mainland China have any effect on Russia? I do not know. I doubt whether it would. Members of the Opposition seem to take glee in speculating on this sort of thing, but I think they are wasting their time. </para>

            <para>- Imports which are in the form of &#39;literature&#39; - I use that word in inverted commas - and which are regarded as obscene can be divided into 2 parts. The first part consists of literature which is obviously hard core pornography, or rubbish as you might call it, and the other part consists of those works which do contain literary merit. Books of literary merit are referred by my Department to the National Literature Board of Review which is a body consisting of 9 people who are distinguished in letters - there is a poet, a publisher and people of that calibre - and who work in a part time capacity. Their recommendations are made to me and on the basis of those recommendations, I decide whether a work should be classified as a prohibited import or not. I understand the honourable gentleman is referring particularly to the first category I mentioned. These are banned at departmental level but only by an extremely senior officer. There are some who believe that customs officers all around the country can grab an importation and ban it. This is not so. There is no officer at State level who has the duty to do that. Everything is referred to the central office in Canberra and then to a senior officer who only after looking at it carefully makes the overt decision to declare it a prohibited import. </para>

Its greatest value is that it can resist temperatures of the order of 1,200 degrees centigrade. Will the right honourable gentleman investigate the possibility of introducing or producing this material within Australia for use inside aircraft, for pilots&#39; uniforms and in industry in relation to furnaces  and that sort of  thing? As this material is in distinct competition with wool which is largely used in those areas will the Minister look at the possibility of finding a manner in which wool may be treated to give it the same sort of qualities? </para>

They are very high indeed. To that extent it is turned to very much by the aircraft and other industries. It is really not the function of government to take the initiative in persuading industry and business to use a new product. It certainly is part of the function of government to see that every opportunity is made available for there to be knowledge of these products and then for business to make its own judgment in its own sphere on whether they should be used. </para>

        <quote>
          <para>The Government has allowed itself to be inveigled into this position at a time when the prospects for increasing competition in overseas shipping have seldom seemed brighter. Developments in train at the time the Government was reaching its decision would have brought up to ninety-six vessels into service on the Australian run. The Soviet Union was showing an interest. At the same time tensions within the Conference had raised the probability of a breakaway by some European operators. Such developments could not have done other than bring about a sharp reduction in freight charges. The Government&#39;s decision to ally itself with the Conferences inevitably strengthens Conference solidarity and weakens the impetus to independent operations. Its decision to favour container vessels of a particular type strengthens British shipping interests against their continental competitors. In these circumstances there will be no breakaway, no increase in competition and no reduction in freights. The Government&#39;s actions will bring about a result directly opposed to its professed objectives. </para>

            <para>- by leave - Honourable members are aware that I have been very concerned for some time to ensure that there is a detached and comprehensive review of some of the more fundamental aspects of the financial conditions of service of the armed forces. The Government has decided to appoint a committee of inquiry to make a thorough study of the duties and responsibilities of officers of the Australian armed forces and to recommend appropriate salary rates; to review the working of the group pay system whereby industrial award rates in respect of civilian employment are translated into rates of pay for skilled other ranks of the armed forces; and- no less important - to examine the demands and exigencies of Service life as they affect all ranks and their families in order to see whether any revision in financial recognition is called for. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Officers&#39; salaries have never been the subject of a comprehensive study as to their qualifications, skills, functions, responsibilities and the variety of conditions and circumstances under which they are called upon to serve. A short time ago, I announced some modifications to officers&#39; salary rates. But as I stressed then, this was essentially a restructuring of the officers&#39; salary scale within existing parameters to provide a more &#39;balanced and equitable pattern of pay and increments. It was not intended as a definitive job evaluation. On the other hand, there is an established rationale behind the pay structure for other ranks as this is based on the rates approved under industrial awards for the trade skills which are assessed as having equivalents in the armed forces. However, there are a number of important matters associated with the working of this system of paygrouping which produce anomalies and need to be examined. These problems are mainly those which arise in translating to a different Service environment rates which have been assessed in a civilian context. The questions deserving consideration are such matters as rank structures, and the significance to be accorded to military skills possesed by qualified Service tradesmen. </para>
          <para class="block">Nor have the demands and exigencies faced by all personnel as an integral part of their commitment to disciplined service been examined in sufficient depth by advisory machinery in the past. These demands and exigencies - the disabilities of commitment to service - are being compensated by allowances assessed on a fairly broad view taken some years ago. We shall ask the committee of inquiry to make a more exhaustive study of all aspects of the nature and incidence of disabilities of Service employment and recommend the most appropriate form of compensation. </para>
          <para>The structure of, and the way of expressing remuneration - although naturally not the level - have remained basically unchanged since the mid-1 940&#39;s. The pay code is complicated and quite difficult to understand. In announcing adjustments to Service pay last month, I referred to the Government&#39;s concern to have the present system translated into a form more comprehensible and recognisable to servicemen and civilians alike. There is a need for a careful and searching examination of all of these matters to reflect modern day principles applying to wage and salary fixation and the vast changes that have occurred in our armed forces. The Government has been considering ways in which detailed examination of all of these matters might best be sought. It has come to the conclusion that the Defence (Conditions of Service) Committee is not best suited to the task of large scale examination these matters require. Since it began effectively to function less than 7 months ago, the Defence (Conditions of Service) Committee has done much important and constructive work in the area of pay and general conditions of employment of Service personnel and it will continue to do so. I have announced in the last few months a number of substantial improvements and modifications across a broad range of terms and conditions which have been based on recommendations from the Committee. However, a major review would place intolerable demands on the time the permanent heads of the Defence and Service departments and a senior member of the Treasury, and of the personnel members of the Service boards. </para>
          <para>Moreover, the Government believes that servicemen and service women would wish to have the major aspects of their pay and financial conditions of employment given a thorough examination by a body sufficiently detached from their employing organisations in the government area and equipped to draw relevant comparisons with pay and conditions in the civilian community. The principles and concepts developed by the Committee will, I would hope, provide lasting guidelines for the determination of Service remunerations in future. Whilst the matters I have mentioned will constitute the immediate and primary areas of the Committee&#39;s work, the Government recognises that, in the course of its investigations, the Committee may find attention focussed on other conditions of Service employment which it may consider warrant examination. In that event I may, if it is considered desirable, ask the Committee to take up and consider such questions. </para>

          <para>The Committee will be under the chairmanship of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Kerr, C.M.G., a judge of the Commonwealth Industrial Court since 1966.  His  Honour has had extensive experience in industrial relations and wage fixing matters and has played an active part in a wide range of community affairs. He has been a distinguished member for many years of the legal profession and has held high office in legal councils and associations.  His  Honour was a member of the 2nd AIF from 1942 to 1946. I envisage a total Committee of 5 or 6. The remaining members will be selected with a view to producing a balanced, capable and experienced Committee. I will announce the full composition as soon as negotiations with individuals are complete. </para>
          <para>To assist in the inquiry, each of the Services has been asked to appoint a special consultant to be available full time to provide technical and specialist information on Service matters that the Committee may require. The Government expects that the inquiry will proceed with a minimum of formality in preference to the more procedural approach of industrial tribunals and that it will visit and inspect a wide range of Service establishments and installations and seek the views of interested persons inside and outside the Services. The Government has decided that the proceedings of the inquiry should not be open to the public. It is not desirable that servicemen or others assisting the Committee should be inhibited by the public nature of the proceedings in giving information or explaining themselves to the Committee. The investigation will be pursued vigorously. However, this is an inquiry of historic importance in the life of Australian Services and a very thorough examination is essential and necessarily time consuming. </para>
          <para>I stress that the process of examination of some aspects of conditions of Service employment by the Defence (Conditions of Service) Committee will continue during the currency of the inquiry. The Defence (Conditions of Service) Committee is well placed to consider and to bring forward prompt recommendations on a number of matters related to terms and conditions of service. The Committee will be taking up matters such as removal entitlements, disturbance allowances and rentals charged for Service housing unless otherwise referred to the inquiry. I add that, while the inquiry is processing, the process of applying variations in the pay of civilian classifications to aligned Service categories will continue. And, following on the Government&#39;s decision which I announced last month, any general movement in the salaries of the administrative and executive area of the Third Division of the Commonwealth Public Service will be extended to Service officers up to and including  Colonel and  equivalent ranks. Of course, senior officers are aligned with the Second Division of the Commonwealth Public Service. In short there will be no freeze on terms and conditions of employment while the inquiry is under way. </para>
          <para>The Government has made clear its belief that there is a need to continue the national service scheme. It is fundamental to the Government&#39;s position that all servicemen and servicewomen should be adequately recompensed for the service they give. The Government&#39;s decision to appoint a Committee of Inquiry further demonstrates the Government&#39;s determination upon this matter. Financial conditions, in the form of pay and allowances and related provisions, are but one aspect of the totality of terms and conditions under which members of our armed forces serve. I am very much alive to other aspects which have a marked impact on servicemen and their families. More needs to be done to meet the problem of providing housing in adequate numbers and of adequate quality in suitable locations. A high level interdepartmental committee including uniformed representatives has been established to give high priority to this task. When it has completed its work I will be submitting recommendations to the Government. Yet a further matter which is under close and active consideration is the effects of frequent reposting of servicemen in the form of family disruption and interruption to children&#39;s education. I am pursuing this matter with the Services. It is not an easy problem to solve. The Government&#39;s objective is to develop further the defence force Australia requires and in the words of the terms of reference &#39;to attract and retain men and women with needed qualities, skills and experience for the Australian forces&#39;. The Committee of Inquiry will make its contribution to that end in a situation of formidable competition from civilian employment. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> said in the opening sentence of his statement that the House is aware that for some time he has been very concerned to ensure that there is a detached and comprehensive review of some of the more fundamental aspects and financial conditions of service of the armed forces. The House is aware of no such thing. Certainly the honourable member for Herbert <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bonnett)</inline> is unaware of the Minister&#39;s determination to have such an inquiry. He gave notice as recently as 12th August that he would move that a select committee of this Parliament be appointed to inquire into and report upon the pay, conditions and housing of the defence forces. Earlier in this session a select committee to review the defence forces retirement benefits scheme was set up. On behalf of the Opposition I sought to widen the terms of reference of this committee to cover Service pay and conditions. This was rejected by the Government, although it provided an excellent test of the Minister&#39;s sincerity in wanting to have a comprehensive review of pay and conditions in the Services. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Minister&#39;s concern for such a review was not evident to the Returned Services League earlier this year when it pressed him to set up such an independent review. Honourable members will recall that the Minister for Defence begged the RSL to defer the matter for 3 months; in other words, to get the heat off him. Doubtless he hoped that a number of short term variations in pay and allowances would stifle the very serious criticism of his administration developing in the Services. The RSL reluctantly agreed to defer the matter. Some changes were made in pay and allowances. These did not deter servicemen from expressing their resentment at years of neglect of their pay and conditions. The Minister burned his fingers very severely in his intemperate and unwarranted comments of flying pay allowances. He had to resort to some sort of public relations compaign wandering around the messes and barracks of Canberra making atonement. </para>
          <para>In the past the Minister has always dismissed complaints about pay and conditions by reference to the Defence (Conditions of Service) Committee. According to the Minister this Committee would provide a cure-all for all complaints and conditions. He neglected the basic fact that any substantive result from this Committee would take years of work. He also neglected the fact that this Committee simply was not trusted by servicemen who believed they were not adequately represented on it. I make no criticism of the members of this Committee; undoubtedly they have done much devoted and dedicated work. But this Committee has the signal disadvantage that it is an internal committee of the Department of Defence; its functions are prescribed by the Department of Defence and this must limit its effectiveness. It has not the power to initiate inquiries or to make comprehensive assessments of conditions in the 3 armed services. </para>
          <para>This is why the Opposition moved for the setting up of a select committee of this Parliament to look at the whole range of service pay and conditions. What we had in mind was a comprehensive inquiry into the whole social enviroment of the serviceman and his family; into pay; moves and reposting, re-settlement and reestablishment in civil life, family separation and disruption, housing and education. I submit that the committee of inquiry envisaged by the Minister is no substitute for such an inquiry by a select committee. The basic flaws of the committee recommended by the Minister are firstly, that its terms of reference are not properly based, secondly, the inquiry will be conducted in secrecy, and thirdly, as an ad hoc committee it cannot be regarded as machinery for keeping service pay and conditions under constant review. </para>
          <para>The Minister has summarised the terms of reference in the opening paragraphs of his statement. I restate this summary rather than the fuller account of the terms given later in his speech. The first task of the proposed committee is to study the duties and responsibilities of officers and to recommend appropriate salary rates. The second is to review the working of the group system for skilled other ranks. The third is to examine the demands and exigencies of Service life as they affect servicemen and their families in order to see whether any revision in financial recognition is warranted. </para>
          <para>The Minister goes to some pains to emphasise that the terms of reference are flexible; that the committee can wander down whatever avenues of inquiry it likes. However, it is a pretty safe bet that the committee will not stray too far from the lines indicated by the Minister. This will confine the committee&#39;s lines of investigation in the main to a work value study of what servicemen do. Supplementing this would be a sociological examination of the day-to-day life of the serviceman and his wife and children with a view to making cash compensation. Despite the Minister&#39;s insistence that the terms of reference would not be frozen, it is likely that the committee would draw up its duty sheet on the lines I have indicated. </para>
          <para>No-one disputes the value of this kind of analysis. It would turn up as a mass of invaluable data about the peculiar nature of Service life. But it seems too wrong to me to link this sort of work value and sociological study with specific recommendations for improved pay, allowances and conditions. This sort of work could best be done in the form of pilot studies by universities, research foundations or industrial consultants. It is a matter for great regret that this work has not been done before but it should not be done in association with an inquiry into pay and conditions. It cannot be stressed too strongly that this is a very urgent matter. </para>
          <para>In the past few weeks we have seen the unique spectacle of what amounts to industrial action by groups of servicemen. I refrain from using the term &#39;mutiny&#39; to decribe what happened at Garden Island and at Williamtown air base. This terminology has been denied by responsible Ministers but by any standard of Service discipline these actions bordered on mutiny. There have been no comparable incidents in the Army but there has been a heavy rate of resignations, particularly among officers. This is the highly dangerous situation in which the Minister proposes this committee to remedy these problems. </para>
          <para>He has abandoned his reliance on the Defence (Conditions of Service) Committee. Now he proposes a committee which will undertake major in-depth studies of the Australian Services. It is in effect a Vernon report on the Army, Navy and Air Force. On the most optimistic assessment this committee would not be able to undertake the survey outlined by the Minister and recommend specific remedial measures in less than a year. From  18  months to 2 years is not improbable. Given the present inflammatory mood of the Services this is much too long to wait for effective action, even if other improvements flow from the Defence (Conditions of Service) Committee. </para>
          <para>In essence, this committee will be working on long-term solutions which will take a long time to prepare. This is not the way to solve extremely pressing problems which require action now. I suppose one solution would be to grant an across the board increase on the lines of the 25c increase in allowances the Minister announced last month. This would be regarded as an interim step until the committee reported and its recommendations could be implemented. </para>
          <para>It is impossible to believe that in the absence of such immediate benefits, the Services will be mollified by the promise of this committee. Furthermore, it will have no impact on the problems of manning and recruiting manifest in all services but principally in the Army. These difficulties must intensify if a solution is deferred until this committee reports and the practical results of its investigation start to be felt through the Services. This would take at least two years. It should be remembered that what servicemen say about their jobs is one of the major influences on recruiting. What they are saying at the moment would not induce many to the colours. </para>
          <para>The second criticism I listed earlier was the hearing of evidence in camera. I think this is a serious mistake. The Minister&#39;s reason for this is that servicemen and those assisting the committee would be inhibited by the public nature of the proceedings in giving information or explaining themselves to the committee. I would say that the chances of any witnesses from the Services being reticent or inhibited on the subjects of pay and conditions in the present climate are nil. If the Minister for Defence has any lingering doubts about this he should study again the letters columns of the &#39;Canberra Times&#39; in recent months. I am sure they have already provided him with considerable material for quiet meditation. </para>
          <para>If this committee is appointed, something on these lines will happen. The committee will start its hearings in a blaze of publicity and then go promptly into camera. It will hear evidence over the next  6  months or so but because the proceedings are not public it will quickly pass into the limbo of the forgotten. Ultimately the committee will produce a report which may or may not produce decisive action. In such an atmosphere of secrecy and uncertainty how can such a committee serve as a dampener on discontent and unrest in the Services? How can servicemen be expected to wait patiently for what may be illusory improvements when they do not have a jot of information about what is going on in the committee hearings? </para>
          <para>The third criticism I made was that this committee is conceived as a one hit exercise. It does not establish any sort of precedent or any sort of machinery for a continuing review of Service pay and conditions. Even if the report of this committee is an excellent one and it overcomes many of the existing difficulties, how can we be sure the improvements it makes will be consolidated and sustained? </para>
          <para>An off the cuff committee of this sort compares most unfavourably with the Standing Reference on the Pay of the Armed Forces established in the United Kingdom. This committee has linked annual reviews of salaries and conditions with recommendations for improvements and studies of Service jobs and Service life. </para>
          <para>Admittedly, this Committee has worked within the broad guidelines of a prices and incomes policy, a framework which is lacking in Australia. But it is the sort of model that should be considered by the Government. In summary, the Opposition does not think the approach adopted by the Minister is the correct one. </para>
          <para>He has made a tacit admission that the Defence (Conditions of Service) Committee is not up to the job of restoring equity and sanity to pay and allowances. But he has failed to put forward any remedies for short term improvement which will satisfy the Services until more sweeping and comprehensive reforms can be adopted. Undoubtedly, a committee of this sort would do much valuable work in assessing job values in the Services and the peculiar strains and stresses of Service life. </para>
          <para>This is work that needs to be done; it should have been attempted years ago. But the Opposition does not see why the Services should have to wait for these surveys to be made before pay and allowances can be increased or conditions improved. The approach favoured by the Opposition is the appointment of a select committee of this Parliament to examine pay and conditions. This could be done more quickly than the independent committee; with the Parliamentary recess coming up it would be possible to get a series of recommendations for short-term improvements within a few months. There is enough evidence available to assess pay and conditions and recommend changes which could be brought in quickly and effectively. With the public hearings of a select parliamentary committee, servicemen would be assured that their problems were getting the urgent attention of this Parliament. There would be palpable evidence that pay, allowances and conditions were under scrutiny and that changes would be made. I believe this is most important for the morale of the Services in the light of the present serious crisis in recruitment and manning. By all means let us have the sort of analysis the Minister envisages in his terms of reference. We must have this sort of information if future policies are to be correctly based and the errors of the past avoided. But this work could best be done by other agencies such as a university department of sociology or a firm of industrial consultants. This side of the investigation should be divorced completely from the immediate problem, which is how to stop serious unrest and dissatisfaction, in some cases bordering on mutiny, in the armed Services. </para>
          <para>Therefore, against this background I submit on behalf of the Opposition that because substantial improvements are needed and needed quickly, Service pay and conditions should be put under the immedi ate scrutiny of this Parliament. I move, as an amendment: </para>

            <para>- I have listened with great interest to the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barnard)</inline> and I am in agreement with many of the points that he has made. I think it may be admitted that during my period in this House one of my main interests has been the terms and conditions of service in the 3 Services. It is interesting to note the concern in the Services over the terms and conditions under which members serve. I believe it is necessary, as the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition said, to examine the morale of the Services today. In my opinion in the 10 years I have been in this Parliament and over a long period of parliamentary government in Australia the Defence Services have never been understood and have never had the consideration that they should have had from governments or from oppositions. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is interesting that the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition has now decided to take a great interest in the Defence Services. However, if one goes back over the debates during the years when the Australian Labor Party was in government and since that Party has been in opposition one can see how little interest members of the Labor Party have shown and how rarely, if ever, conditions of service have been brought up by them. In fact, the records show that the majority of their statements are almost aimed at lowering the conditions of services. Members of the Opposition have made reference to &#39;brass hats&#39; when talking about officers. They have referred to officers as people dressed in uniforms who glide around in cars. Therefore, I cannot take seriously the matter raised by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition. It is my intention in the Estimates debate today to speak about the terms and conditions of services. When I speak during that debate I intend to draw to the attention of honourable members the fact that a defence statement made by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> many months ago has not been debated. I have heard of no pressure from the Opposition to have it debated. It is claimed that this defence statement is the most far reaching that we have had presented in this House, but there has been no demand from the Opposition to discuss it. </para>
          <para>A ministerial statement was made last session by the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Peacock)</inline> on the Royal Military College. However, this has not been debated and I have not heard any interest in this matter expressed by the Opposition. Today during the Estimates debate we will be discussing the 6 Defence Services. Honourable members will each be allowed 10 minutes in which to debate those estimates. This means that we will have 1 minute 50 seconds to speak on each Defence Service. I have not heard the Opposition complain about this. When we look at the Notice Paper we find that there has not been one move by the Opposition to discuss matters relating to defence. I contend that there has been delay. I contend and I have contended over the years that I have been here that there has been a lack of understanding of what it means to be in the Services. There has been a lack of understanding of what it means to be an officer, an NCO or a serviceman who has to move from State to State and from theatre to theatre, with consequent disruption of family life. The Opposition has never objected to the fact that a serviceman has to live in housing commission houses while his counterpart in civilian life, who might have gone to school with him, is living in a nice home somewhere else. The Opposition has never raised this point. </para>
          <para>I give credit to the Minister for Defence - and I do not give credit when I do not think it is deserved. I think the Minister has done a good job. I think he has endeavoured to move the Defence (Conditions of Service) Committee to bring forward quick decisions. It is interesting to realise that already this year Service pay has been increased by $30m. This is not a bad record. I accept the contention that in the past there has not been sufficient Service representation on the various committees. I think this is a reasonable complaint. It has been pointed out that on these committees there is always a representative from the Treasury, from the Department of Defence or from the Department of External Affairs. If members of the soldiery are asked a question they are allowed to put in their oar but otherwise they sit on the sideline in silence. I have heard no objection to this from the Opposition. </para>
          <para>It fills me with horror and dismay to hear the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition talk about select committees. When he does this I do not think that he is speaking with the knowledge that he should have. When we look at this question of select committees we find that every senator in the Senate is a member of about two select committees and a member of one of the Estimates Committees which have been established. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition talks about the delay which may be occasioned by this inquiry being conducted by an independent committee, on which will be Service representatives and people who have served and have known or do know the factors and conditions which affect a serviceman&#39;s life. He says that a delay will be occasioned by the appointment of an independent committee because it will not be able to submit a report within 12 months. He claims that a select committee would be able to submit a report in a much quicker time. I think that is absolute rubbish. </para>
          <para>At the present time, together with the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, I am a member of the Joint Committee on the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Legislation. We are finding that it is difficult to arrange a full Committee meeting because senators and others are members of other select committees. We find that the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition - I do not blame him for this - has other duties to perform and that it is not always possible for him to be in attendance at Committee meetings. On the Committee are three senators who are standing for re-election at the forthcoming Senate election, and therefore their prime objective is to get re-elected. So the Committee cannot sit. If the Senate result should be as Labor hopes it will be, but I am confident it will not be, am I to believe that the Senate, with the present Opposition in control, will not endeavour to create chaos in this House? Is it not possible that next year could be one of the most vital years in parliamentary history? Do I take it that the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition will want the proposed committee to press on and that Labor senators will be allowed to be absent from the Senate in order to conduct inquiries which, of necessity, will have to be held throughout Australia? I think that is absolute rubbish. </para>
          <para>The Minister has decided that there should be an importial committee, not a political committee. Let us not think that politics do not enter into select committees; they do. It will be an impartial committee under the chairmanship of a distinguished judge. There will be businessmen and servicemen on the Committee and they will have one duty, and one duty only to perform - that is, to get to the hard core of the question of rates and pay and conditions in the Services. I accept one point which the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition has made, that is, that those things that are in the pipeline in respect of conditions of service and on which decisions are about to be made should not be delayed. If the Treasury or anybody else decide that because a committee had been set up we should delay a decision in respect of such matters as temporary rental allowances and educational allowances which are presently in the pipeline, I believe that this Parliament - I am sure the Minister and I would hope the Government - would see that the decision was not put into effect. </para>
          <para>This could be the most far-reaching inquiry into the Services ever conducted. I think that the method of endeavouring to adjust the pay scales between the Services and civilian industries has not been successful. I believe that it has created problems. It has not taken into account the facts concerning a servicemen&#39;s life. It has not taken into effect the officer-other rank relationship. It has not taken into effect the fact that at the present time certain engineers of non-commissioned officer rank, with diploma degrees, are receiving higher rates of pay than officers with graduate degrees. There are anomalies. Let it also be realised that we have the technical arms of the Services - the signallers, the medicos, the electrical and mechanical engineers and so on - who are given high rates of pay. But at the present time the infantryman, the rifleman, is to a certain extent at the lower end of the pay scale. But surely everybody realises that all these specialists are there basically in time of war to do one thing, that is, to service the rifleman who is in time of war the most important man in the whole team. I think that these are the things into which there has to be a deep and full inquiry. </para>
          <para>I welcome the Minister&#39;s statement and I think that the Services will welcome it. I think that the Services should be reassured that things such as allowances will not be held up pending this inquiry. There is no reason why they should be held up. Let this be the fullest inquiry and let it be impartial. I agree that its findings should be made public. I would object if, at the end of the inquiry, the findings were not made public. I think that the hearings could well be held in camera, but the report must be made available to this Parliament </para>
          <para>I conclude by saying, as I said before, that the appointment of a select committee comprising members of this House and of the Senate, under the conditions which obtain in the Parliament at the moment, would be detrimental to the whole question. Although the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that it would take this independent inquiry 12 months to make its investigations, I guarantee that we would not get a convincing and realistic result from a select committee in under 3 years. Some of the select committees that are operating at present, such as the committee that is inquiring into aircraft noise, seem to have been going for an incredibly long time. I think that the servicemen should be reassured that this matter is now to be looked into and that the other matters - such as disturbance allowance and the educational allowance, about which I will speak when we are debating the estimates for the Defence Department - about which they are concerned at the moment are at present under review and close to a decision. I should like the Minister to stress that these matters will not be held up pending the overall review. </para>

            <para>- For quite a period now the Opposition has been condemning the Government for the inferior conditions of service for our men in the fighting forces. Today in the statement of the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> we have a confession of guilt.

We have too much evidence to indicate that the Government suppresses the reports of the various committees of inquiry which it has set up. The most recent one, of course, is the nationwide survey which was made into Australia&#39;s educational needs. That survey was conducted with the support of the 6 State governments. The findings of that survey have been completely suppressed. A condensation of some of the less salient points - certainly the criticism was exorcised from that report - has been submitted to the Parliament. Is this going to occur on this occasion, too? Again, there are other indications- </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline>you know that this has to be done at the end of a speech, and the Minister is using up my time. He said yesterday in the House that because the United States of America had unemployment it was able to have a  voluntary defence service. We do not have a great degree of unemployment, therefore, he says, we cannot have an all volunteer defence service. Does he think that only those people in the gravest financial, social and economic need in the community would stoop to join the Services? I find this obnoxious. I find it offensive. On behalf of the fighting men of Australia I reject it completely. The Minister then went on to say: </para>

            <para>If we were a country that sought to buy defence, which is what the Labor Party would do if it wanted any defence, we would have to pay higher salary and wage rates in an attempt to attract people into the armed forces to get the numbers we needed. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>It is likely to appeal to the underprivileged and to the worker who is in a less fortunate situation. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>So he argues that, if you improve conditions and pay, those people whose intellectual capacity has been developed - the better educated - would be too wise to join the defence forces even then. Why? Why does the Minister believe this? What is wrong with the defence Services under him, that the better educated people would not want to join even with better pay and conditions? If he argues that better pay and conditions will attract only the underprivileged of the community - this statement appears at page 2200 of Hansard - what sort of people does he argue will be attracted now to the defence Services when the pay and conditions are so gravely inadequate and totally unacceptable to <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> men of the fighting Services? I reject his statement. As I said earlier, I find it offensive. I find it objectionable. It is totally unworthy of the Australian Minister for Defence to regard the men of the fighting Services in this way. </para>
          <para>The intransigence of the Conservative Government at Canberra towards the reasonable and long standing claims of  the  armed services for improved conditions ha; undermined the morale and depleted the ranks of  out  fighting Services. The lamentable deterioration in re-engagement rates is frankly alarming. In 1963-64 the reengagement rate for the Royal Australian Air Force was 61 per cent. By 1968-69 it has fallen to 57 per cent - this is under the Conservatives; for the Army the fall was even more pronounced, from 60 per cent to 47 per cent; but the Navy&#39;s rate collapsed to a perilous level, that is, from 68 per cent, the highest, to 18 per cent, the lowest. In 5 short years Conservative neglect has wrought havoc on the confidence and elan of our serviceman&#39;s sense of professional self respect. The downgrading and erosion of the professional status of our armed Services have been caused by long spells of Government unconcern about conditions of pay and provision of reasonable benefits for our servicemen. </para>
          <para>The effect of this defenceless neglect by the Conservative Federal Government is dramatically revealed by its failure to meet recruitment targets; its unsuccessful, albeit expensive policy of seeking to pilfer manpower from the ranks of Britain&#39;s Services; and the dismayingly high and rapidly increasing resignation rate of commissioned officers below retiring age. In 1969-70 the recruitment target set for Australian defence forces was 2,864. The actual level reached was 758; that is, recruitment was nearly 75 per cent down on the projected goal. The Air Force actually suffered a loss of manpower. The Army gain to personnel strength of 462 men was less than a third of the intake target set. The Navy&#39;s extremely modest recruitment target was still 25 per cent down on its enlistment goal. Quite clearly the career prospects in our armed Services no longer attract the interest, confidence and support of young people. This comes about as a result of the inertia of the Conservative Federal Government towards a long overdue policy of improvement in conditions of service. I suspect that this may well be a cover up because of the points I made earlier. For the first half of this year overall recruitment has achieved only one-quarter of the target set. There is patently no abatement, indeed only aggravation of this serious problem. If this clearly apparent and distressing rundown of manpower is not halted  and reversed the capacity of our armed Services to maintain their function of a meaningful defence preparedness will be seriously impaired. </para>
          <para>Efforts to plug up the cracks in the system by attempted filching of manpower from the British Services have produced nugatory results, but at considerable public expense. This practice was introduced 2&#189; years ago, and up to the middle of this year fewer than 40 British officers had been enticed from their home Service. As Royal Australian Air Force officer strength alone is more than 440 down on quota, the meaninglessness of the overseas recruitment programme in comparison to need is forcibly illustrated. On the face of it, recent pay increases plus general conditions and benefits for married men seemingly make engagement in the British Services a superior proposition to the rundown in conditions of service in Australia. There is additionally the mass exodus of middle-rank commissioned officers from the Services which has become acute in the past 18 months. These men are resigning their commissions before reaching retiring age, through utter disgust and frustration with the conditions under which they labour and which, in many unhappy respects, affect their families. For them the idealism and dedication of the career officer  has  been shattered beyond repair. </para>
          <para>Between 1965 and 1970 there was nearly a 1,000 per cent increase in resignations of such Army officers below the rank of colonel. There was almost a three-fold increase in RAAF officer resignations for the same period. The trend is accelerating at a startling rate. For the first 6 months of this year, 80 RAAF officers left the Service. The Navy suffered, too, with a resignation rate in 1969-70 over 100 per cent greater than 5 years earlier. The rot is setting in here, too, for officer resignations for the first 6 months of this year, numbering 33, exceed the total for last year already. In a desperate effort to avert critical breakdowns in the operations of the Army this Conservative Government at Canberra has stampeded into pressing more than 100 Citizen Military Forces officers and nearly 80 retired list officers into regular service. This is a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul, and neither Peter nor Paul is satisfied with the result </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Major General</inline>Paul A. Cullen,  President of  the CMF Association,  is  on public record asserting that the CMF aimed  at  reaching a planned strength of 36,000 last year. It  in  fact lost strength and fell to 31,000 personnel. Even more startling is his declaration that this organisation should have a strength  of  40,000 to 50,000 men  to  fulfil a meaningful role  in  our defence arrangements. Depleting the CMF  in  this way not only undermines a gravely run down area  of  the services but also fails to plug up the gaps in the regular Services. Additionally, the practice is causing widespread resentment among career officers who find that the truncated training of CMF officers place the CMF officers  on  the same footing  as  4-year trained Duntroon graduates. In some cases the CMF officer ever becomes their superior. </para>
          <para>Again, justified and long standing complaints  on  pay, housing, transfers, retirement and family benefits have impaired many career servicemen&#39;s assessment of their chosen profession. It is  an  inexcusable exploitation  of  a Royal Australian Air Force pilot&#39;s dedication to expect him to bear with the present pay levels when he can earn 2 to 3 times  as  much with  an  international airline  in  a somewhat less onerous job. The Minister for Defence rose to unprecedented heights  of  arrogant offensiveness when he said of the RAAF claim  to  have pay rates strike parity with Department of Civil Aviation personnel: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>But the DCA people have responsibilities not required by RAAF personnel and that is performing and observing standards of civil aviation flying. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Minister thus displayed  an  alarming degree  of  ignorance concerning the duties demanded  of  our RAAF pilots. The recent pay increases give little relief. They mean $4 to $5  a  week extra to  a  lieutenant. Out of this contributions to the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund will claw off about $1. 50, tax will remain about the same, mess fees and rent will go up by about 15 per cent  of  the increase. The hapless officer will be fortunate to rescue  a  dollar out of the increase. What the Government is seemingly incapable of understanding is that top quality, well trained and experienced administrators - the qualities of middle-Tank officers - will not tolerate  long  a salary of $6,500 for  a  major, for example, when his skills can command nearly double that rate in civilian life. Officer engineers pay was supposed to be tied to that of a class- 5, engineer in the Commonwealth Public Service in 1964. An Army colonel engineer is now nearly $2,000 behind a class 5 engineer. May 1 have incorporated in Hansard this table? </para>

              <para>- But it will take mors than pay to hold manpower. A service&#34;man pays 15. per cent of &#39;his salary for Government housing while the Commonwealth Public Service pays only 10 per cent. The Serviceman is most likely to be pushed into unattractive, unsuitable accommodation after a long wait and after his selection by a lucky dip&#39; process. In moving furnishings are damaged and deteriorated. Some, such as floor coverings and curtains, become useless and have to be replaced at considerable expense, m contrast, vastly superior conditions are provided in the United States and the United Kingdom for servicemen. </para>

          <para>Again, Australian servicemen are blighted by too frequent postings. This, incidentally, disrupts home life and plays havoc with young children&#39;s education and their personality development. The contributory DFRB system as last is being investigated. It should be scrapped and replaced by a non-contributory scheme. Last year the Government&#39;s contributions to the scheme were $9.9m but gratuities paid out were only $1.8m. That is, the burden of a noncontributory scheme seems mild and the benefits in terms of satisfaction in the -Services far exceeding the cost. Britain and the United States have non-contributory schemes. Again, there seems to be a case for less civilian control of servicemen and less of their interference. The ratio of civilians in defence departments to servicemen is 73.96 to 100, a glaring lopsidedness. Further, the five man Defence (Conditions of Service) Committee - all members arc public servants - should have high level representation from each of the Services. There needs to be a development of benefit; for servicemen&#39;s dependants and for retired servicemen and their dependants along the lines of those available to the United States and British Services. .  </para>
          <para>A Labor government would promptly act to establish wage justice for our servicemen. It has pledged itself also to: Provide War Service home entitlements to all servicemen after 2 years regular service or 6 years of CMF service; minimise the incidence of postings so as to give more stability to home life; provision of health services from the Repatriation Department to servicemen and their dependants; scholarships to children whose education would be disrupted otherwise by shifts; availability of adequate life assurance and elimination of special loading charges which currently penalise our fighting men: injuries sustained other than on active service would be covered by the Repatriation Act and not the Commonwealth Employees&#39; Compensation Act which is less generous; and non-contributory pensions to all exservicemen to replace the present costly, unwieldly and unintelligible DFRB contributory system. </para>
          <para>The Labor Party proposes a practical programme of reform aimed at rooting out the grave debilitating defects which now impair and pose a critical threat to the operation of our defence forces. I suspect, however, that the Government intends to do very little, especially as the Minister has prejudged the case for salary increases in his statement in this House, which is frankly offensive to the righting men of Australia </para>

That is the appropriate time to raise the issues that he is raising now. They may well be valid. The fact is that what he is doing now in my belief has nothing to do. with the system of debate established in this House. If he wants to answer the points raised in that manner, he can do that later when he has the right pf reply. </para>

              <para>-The honourable member for Oxley claimed that I had rejected pay claims for the Services as a result of something that I said yesterday. I was only saying that yesterday I was rejecting the view that the only consideration the Government ought to have in mind is that it can buy defence, establishing a position in which the privileged can insulate themselves from the effect of defence. A question of equity is involved in this matter This is quite clear in the statement that I made today and in the terms of reference of the inquiry which point to the need to attract and retain appropriate personnel in the services. This is quite clear in the statement in which J said: &#39;This is fundamental to the Government&#39;s position that all servicemen and women should be adequately recompensed for the service that they give&#39;. That is the Government&#39;s objective- </para>

              <para>-Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. The honourable member for Oxley was in this House at question time today and should have noted the occasion when the Leader of the Opposition made a personal explanation and in order to explain the basis of the alleged misrepresentation read from a portion of a speech that he had made in this House. What the Leader of the Opposition did is exactly the same as the Minister for Defence is doing at the moment. If the honourable member for Oxley sees any difference between the 2 circumstances, I am afraid bis disagreement with the Chair again is incorrect. </para>

              <para>- At least it has not had the advantage of colliding with you. The honourable member for Oxley, who has set out to try to retrieve that position and stir up goodwill, -came along this morning with a speech that I have not -the slightest doubt he started to prepare a week after the last election when he looked at the  results and saw that his vote at Amberley was down. So he put his speech on the despatch box and read it funning almost as though he was in the Caulfield Cup on Saturday. I congratulate the honourable gentleman at least upon the fact that he contrived to finish his speech. But he roused my sensitive collection of feelings when he asked for leave to &#39; incorporate something in Hansard. I said: &#39;I have not seen it&#39;. He said: &#39;You have seen it&#39;. I am not in the habit of saying I have not done or seen something when in point of fact J have: </para>

              <para>- 1 hope the honourable gentleman will apologise. I have no doubt he could overhear the sob that came from me when he mentioned it. I had not seen the table and I did not wish to be discourteous to the honourable gentleman but 1 think it reasonable in the circumstances before one could agree to anything for one to have seen it. So much for the speech of the honourable member for Oxley. Perhaps I could make one or two other glancing blows in its direction before I leave it. The gravamen of the honourable member&#39;s complaint this morning was that the Government refuses to accept the proposal for a select committee. I thought that was handsomely dealt with by the honourable member for La Trobe <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jess).</inline> I could think of no more atrocious way of dealing with this problem than to set up a select committee. I invite my honourable friend, the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barnard),</inline> to reflect upon the fact that the Senate today is hopelessly engaged on committee after committee on a great variety of subjects. There are more select committees in operation today than 1 can remember in my time in this Parliament. Would the honourable gentleman seriously suggest that the wishes of the Senate should be ignored in this matter? 1 would be surprised if that were the point of view of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, if I may make the assumption that a select committee could be set up embracing the whole Parliament then I would say to the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition that it would be unreal to say to the Senate: &#39;You, of course, have no interest in this&#39;. I think it is &#38; pretty practical basis upon which to reject the proposal. What is more, . as the honourable member for La .Trobe pointed out, with a Senate election in the offing it would be impossible to expect candidates for election to attend to this business. </para>

          <para>While I am on that point may I advert to the suggestion made by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition that the universities should be consulted in this matter. I do not wish to cast the slightest aspersion upon the universities but 1 would respectfully submit to my honourable friend that universities would not be the best providers of competent people to deal with this matter. It is a matter which involves the Services and if there is Service representation by people who understand the Services 1 think this would be far better than to have someone with a mere academic approach. I do not wish to be offensive or insulting but if we were to have a purely academic approach I do not think the problem would be solved. With stronger force let me say that if we were to have a purely political approach the problem, far from being solved, would be grievously exacerbated. My colleague, the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser),</inline> has not attempted to disguise his and the Government&#39;s anxiety as far as the Services are concerned. It is one of the difficulties of our existence to be able to translate into the political arena the realities of Service life, ft has always been the case. Here is an attempt being made by the Government to establish a committee to examine in complete depth - 1 hope that is not a solecism - all the difficulties associated with Service life. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition has sought to reproach the Government because - I think he used this phrase - it will be a secret inquiry. </para>

              <para>- Well, in camera. I will look at that argument for one moment. Let us take the reverse of that and assume for the purposes of this examination that we were to have a public inquiry. Would the honourable gentleman suggest that witnessed should be paraded, that counsel should be there to assist the inquiry and that it should have all the accoutrement of a judicial inquiry? I have a preference for providing members of the legal profession with activity but it would seem to me to be an inept way of proceeding with this inquiry to give it all the trappings of a judicial inquiry. It is with infinite respect that I say that the man who will preside over this inquiry has one of the best furnished minds in this country. </para>

These are admirable qualities for anyone who is to preside over such an inquiry. I would not accept for one moment the view that because the inquiry proceeds in camera there will be the slightest suggestion of putting to one side any matter which may embarrass the Government.

              <para>- I find it difficult, therefore, to accept the honourable gentleman&#39;s view. I will proceed to deal with some of the other points which my friend has made. If we are to have the inquiry open to the public we could well have some person come along with a completely way out view on Service life. We must concede the possibility of that happening. This could be magnified in such a way as to disturb the morale of the Services and to give an impression of Service life which is quite eroneous. Do not say these way out views do not exist. Let me refer to one or two of them. There was an occasion when it was observed for the dubious benefit of the country that the best defence measure we could take would be to ensure we had a railways system of uniform gauge throughout the entire continent. That was a view on defence. Do honourable members know who gave that view? It was not a member of the public; it was the former honourable member for Parkes, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Leslie</inline> Haylen. I do not say this unkindly, but I thought that was a rather cranky view on defence. That brings me to a further view that was expressed. The honourable gentleman will recall on one occasion in this House - I rarely interject and when I do I try to do so with the utmost courtesy - the honourable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr James)</inline> was making a powerful forward-looking speech and he said that the country was spending &#163;204m on defence. In those days the country was dealing in pounds. I asked, with my customary courtesy: &#39;Would you cut it? The House will recall what he said to me. He said that he would cut it and expand his surgery in other directions. That was a rather odd view. </para>

          <para>What I put seriously to my honourable friend is that this will be a competent committee. The Minister for Defence has given that assurance. It is readily conceded on all sides that the one who will preside over it, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Kerr, is able, highly intelligent and a man of the utmost integrity and of wide and varied experience. Without making any commitment on the publication of the report I suggest that this will be a matter for decision at the appropriate time. I do not think any purpose is served by seeking to pre-empt a decision with respect to it. The. terms of reference of the committee are wide. I do not think this can be gainsaid. Take, for example, the first term of reference, which is: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>To inquire into and establish the principles and concepts which should apply in determining the remuneration of officers of the regular armed forces. . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I cannot, for my part, see any tether to that. That is a very wide expanse. What is the honourable gentleman&#39;s complaint about that term of reference? Let us go further and I turn at random to another term of reference. It reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>To review the practical working of the group pay. system applicable to other ranks pay. . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It would be no disturbance of the corporate existence of the Government if I said that for my part I think the group pay system is inclined to be over refined. It is a very complex system. I do not . know whether this is a view which may be substantiated or, indeed, refuted by an inquiry in depth. The group pay system never worried me in the Royal Australian Air Force, but it worries the Royal Australian Navy. And . why does it? Because the Navy was not used to it. The honourable gentleman will recall that in about 1947 the Dedman pay committee cut out the marginal differences that existed in the Navy. There was only something of the order of 6d between the remuneration of people of various skills and of various callings in the Navy. That committee cut. that out and set up, in effect, 3 broad bands of groupings within the Navy . lt became clear to the administration that as changes , were taking place in the civil society many people in the Navy were being disadvantaged, so in 1968 the Government made the decision to introduce group pay. I can well understand the sense of vexation that this caused. I have found anomalies as I have gone around ships and establishments. I have, quite deliberately, encouraged people in the Royal Australian Navy to tell me bluntly about their concern. Some of the anomalies I have discovered I readily concede are real and should never have been tolerated, &#39; but in abandoning the old system after so long and introducing a completely new, radical and quite revolutionary system so far as the Navy was concerned, it was inevitable that these problems would be created. I say to the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition and to my friend, the honourable member for Oxley, that their argument for a select committee is not a well-sustained or merited argument. This will be a competent committee. It will be a committee that will, I have not the slightest doubt, produce first class results. </para>

            <para>That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Wills making a statement on defence in reply to the Minister for the Navy as was arranged with the Government. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The fact is that there was an arrangement with the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> that the honourable member for La Trobe <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jess)</inline> and the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> from the Government side would speak on the statement that the Minister made this morning and that equal speaking representation would be allowed to the Opposition side. As has eventuated, however, three spokesmen from the Government side and only two from this side have spoken. The last spokesman for the Government having concluded his speech the Government, having had the opportunity of a luncheon break to deliberate on the dishing up that it has had in the course of the debate, is now seeking to slink off with its tail between its legs instead of facing up to the issue which was being debated. This is a horribly lopsided arrangement for a debate. The Government has autocratically decided to terminate the debate in complete denial of the undertaking that was given to the Opposition at the commence^ ment of the debate. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Wills <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant)</inline> is well known in this House as a man who has a keen and informed interest in defence matters. He served for 26 years with the Australian defence Services and saw 6 years of active service. He was at the landing at Balikpapan in the last World War. He has been wounded in the defence of this country. This man has an entitlement to speak on behalf of Service personnel.  His  background, his service to this country, his undoubted patriotism and the knowledge which he can bring to bear on this subject justify his participation in the debate, given the fact that the Government advised the Opposition that we would be entitled to three spokesmen. It is no excuse on the part of the Government to try to skid out of its responsibility because it has had a dishing at the hands of the Opposition in this debate. We are flattered to think that the Government concedes by implication that two Opposition spokesmen to its three spokesmen is more than an equal battle. Government supporters want to depart the battlefield in haste and with a lack of dignity. But this is completely unfair. We ask them to act as men of integrity and as men who honour their commitments and to. allow the honourable member for Wills, as a man who has served this country for 25 years, who has seen active service and who was wounded while he was serving his country, to put the servicemen&#39;s point of view. </para>
          <para>It is quite clear that we want to ventilate the issues which are at stake in this debate. The issue which has been debated before this House this morning and which the Government seeks to dampen down by its impetuous rush into this decision in complete contradiction of previous undertakings to this House is a vital issue. If we are to continue to have a rundown of the defence Services in Australia as we have seen occur in the past several years . because of the relative neglect df conditions of service and pay on the part of the Government, the capacity of our defence forces to represent suitably the interests of this country &#39;will be gravely eroded. This matter needs ventilation. The Government aims to shuttle off into some side track out of sight and out of mind and to establish a committee which will hear evidence in secret and which will give its findings to the Government to be amputated on an extensive scale. The Parliament will be presented with a gravely diluted report which will in no way upset the Government or distress it by exposing the truth of the causes for the dissatisfaction in the defence forces. This is what the Government is aiming&#39; at. This is what we are objecting to. </para>
          <para>We are entitled, as a matter of common justice, to equal representation with the Government on the speaking list. The Government at least should have the basic decency to uphold the previous undertakings it gave to this House,. Unless it is prepared to do this, its integrity and ethical standards are in grave question. The Minister for the Navy, who is attempting to interject, should restrain himself. He is like a fast starter at the Caulfield gates. The only ship he has seen .is a junior partnership in a legal firm. In any event, I ask the Government to uphold the undertaking it gave to us, and I ask the Minister for the Navy, who apparently is to reply to me, for this once, as an exception to the rule and as a personal favour to me, to stick to the facts in issue before the House and not wander off in fulminations and misrepresentation of the true issue. </para>

            <para>- I second the motion, and in speaking to it I want to make it quite clear to the House that since the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> made his statement this morning I have been preparing to participate in the debate. I have been a member of the Parliament for 15 years and a member of Party committees for all that time. The issue that the House had been discussing affects some 100,000 people, but apart from that a simple question of parliamentary ethics is involved. This morning the Minister for Defence made his statement, in accordance with long standing practice, without interruption and spoke for whatever length of time he thought was necessary. He was answered by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barnard).</inline> The honourable member for La Trobe <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jess)</inline> then made his speech and he was followed by the honourable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden).</inline> Subsequently the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> spoke, and then we were told that the gag was to be applied. - </para>

          <para>There will be very little opportunity for this matter to be raised again. It is an issue on which I believe there is a fundamental difference of approach between the Government and members of the Opposition. Yesterday the Minister for Defence had this to say: </para>

            <para>If we were a country that sought to buy defence, which is what the Labor Party would do if it wanted any defence, we would have to pay higher salary and wage rates in an attempt to attract people into the armed forces to get the numbers we needed. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Today he made a statement announcing the Government&#39;s intention to establish a committee to look into the pay rates and conditions of the Services. We on this side of the House believe that there is a fundamental contradiction between the announcement by the Minister yesterday and his statement today. Therefore the serviceman is unlikely to get from the kind of committee he has announced the answers which are necessary for the development of the Services. On the other hand there is a contradiction between the way we and those on the other side approach these questions. On this side of the Mouse we put forward a point of view that this was a question for the Parliament to decide, that we ought to involve the Parliament itself in this. So we proposed a parliamentary select committee. Honourable members opposite said: &#39;No, that will not do.&#39; The honourable member for La Trobe <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jess)</inline> sneered at the idea. - </para>

              <para>- I would think the virtues of the motion are obvious enough. The point I am making is that there is a question of parliamentary ethics involved here. This is a consideration of the discussion before the House and the way in which we deal with one another and make constant adjustments and compromises to fit in the needs of both sides. This is government by discussion and not government by the exercise of power. There is a decision to bc made in which the whole community is to be involved through its representatives in this place. This afternoon and this morning we saw an exercise of parliamentary authority by the simple use of numbers by the other side of the House. None of us on this side of the House, as far as I can recall, has ever resisted, except in moments of crisis, a Minister making a statement about anything and we on this side ask for the right to answer such a statement Ordinarily we are in a difficult position in this because the Minister comes in here with a brief prepared for him by bis staff and places it before the House.. It is unlikely that we have bad it for more than an hour or so, although on some occasions we may have received it the day before. On some occasions the whole Party committee - the team, as it were - is not as prepared as it could be. </para>

          <para>On this occasion there was enough time for preparations to be made and sp the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition followed the Minister for Defence. In the ordinary exercise of parliamentary procedure the honourable member for La Trobe spoke, which 1 think was appropriate enough. As he said, it is no good leaving a debate on this question for another 3&#34; months. W. want to get on with the job.&#39; &#34;!  hu  give and take makes for equality between the Government and the Opposition. This has been accepted ever since I came into this place. lt is only in the last 12 months that what I might call the parliamentary ethic has been ignored by the other side of the House. After my colleague the honourable member for Oxley spoke the Minister for . the Navy spoke and this gave the Government 3 .speakers to our 2. I believe that this Ls just part of the ethical behaviour with which we ordinarily, treat one another, that we hear equally from&#39; both sides. This, is the whole basis upon which we operate. </para>
          <para>This . afternoon some Minister may well come into the chamber, and ask for leave to make a statement on some important matter. Whilst the Standing Orders allow us as individual members to say no, it is only on very rare occasions that we have exercised that authority. If <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> did say no this afternoon the Government might not have enough members present to carry a motion for the suspension of Standing Orders. The Government relies absolutely on us accepting the right of Government supporters to speak on most matters when they wish, although the Standing Orders often give us an alternative power, but on every occasion in the last 12 months when we have asked the Government to apply the same ethic to us our request has been denied. 1 believe that we will be voting not so much on a motion to allow me to make a statement as on a principle as to how we are going to treat one another as parliamentary colleagues governing a country&#39; by discussion and not by the simple exercise of numbers. </para>

Indeed, it was not my intention to speak until the honourable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> had spoken. I am informed by my colleagues, the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Peacock)</inline> and the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden),</inline> that they are not aware of any arrangement that has been made. </para>

              <para>- Well, it is a pretty serious charge to make when honourable members opposite say that an arrangment has been made and broken. If an&#39; agreement has come into being then, of course, it should be honoured, but for an agreement to come into being there must be some demonstrable exchange of sentiment and views. I made no such exchange. I spoke to the honourable member for Oxley across the table, I spoke to the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barnard)</inline> and I think from memory, fragile as that may be, that they are the only 2 honourable members to whom I spoke. It is all very fine for the honourable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron)</inline> to sneer about these things. </para>

              <para>- The simple point I want to make is that for my part I am aware of no agreement or arrangement. This has to be expressed in some form. I know of no arrangement or agreement that was made, and if one had been made I would be distressed to think that it has been broken. But there is no evidence at all before us as to how it was made. It is all very well for the honourable member for Oxley to get up and say. that an agreement has been made. When was it made? By whom was it made? How was it made? These are the questions that have to be answered. The honourable member for Oxley had his opportunity to speak on this. He mentioned no 2 people in this place who had made an agreement or how they had made that agreement. The honourable member has to give grounds. He cannot simply make an agreement by sitting still like a toadstool. </para>

              <para>- I withdraw it. I just want to say that there has been no arrangement entered into at all. I would have thought that it would have been incumbent upon the honourable member to have said how the arrangement was entered into. If the honourable member had done that I think he would have had solid grounds for grouch. But as things stand at the moment I think that what basically disturbs him is that in my own gentle way I ran the shearing blades over his hide. </para>

What I said was that there were so many select committees in the Senate at this stage and so many Estimates Committees that most honourable senators were sitting on 2 or 3 and that a joint select committee in respect to this matter would take many years before it could reach any conclusions. That is not sneering at select committees. </para>

          <para>- I wish to raise two aspects of television in Australia. I refer to family and children&#39;s programmes on the one hand, and to the Australian content in television programmes on the other hand. Paragraph 478 of the most recent report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board states: </para>
        </talk.start>
        <quote>
          <para class="block">By far the greatest proportion of programmes in family viewing time consisted of general entertainment from overseas. Although many of these programmes attract the young audience it is clear that in family viewing time there are unused opportunities for developing a wider range of Australian programmes of both an entertaining and informative character to interest children and adolescents. The Australian -culture, in its broadest sense, should rank much higher than it does in subject matter presented by television to developing young Australians. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That observation by the Board raises this question: Whose responsibility is it to see that these sorts of things are done? It is my view that while the control of television is so much in the hands of commercial interests it is unlikely that there will be any improvement in children&#39;s programmes, at least at the commercial level, and it is unlikely that there will be any improvement in&#39; the Australian content. By Australian content&#39; I do not mean filling up time by replays of football and what are called sporting events. Some real attempt should be made to help creative drama. I do not know whether this will be done basically by the television stations, but I think there is some obligation on them to assist more in the promotion of opportunity for Australians to participate in programmes. I do not know whether this should be done jointly by the commercial television stations and by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. This is the sort of dilemma which we presently face in Australia. </para>
        <para>I should like to quote from a rather curious document which is issued by the Commercial television people themselves and entitled &#39;Facts of Australian Content in Television Programme Schedules&#39;. The 2 interpretations which have been placed, upon the same set of figures by 2 sources - the commercial television stations and by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board - defy analysis. According to the figures in the latest available report, last year Australian commercial television stations collected nearly $83m from advertisers and spent $67m, which represents a clear profit of over $15m. It is well said that when you give a television licence, in essence you are giving a licence to print money. When we look at an analysis of the programmes we see what has been done with this State-given right - the licence - when it has got into the hands of the commercial television stations. Paragraph 28 of this document rather glibly states: </para>

        <para class="block">I read an article recently in which a television set was described as a horror box. I do not go all the way with that view but, nevertheless, if ever there was a medium at the disposal of the community which is being misused it is the medium of television. I submit that to suggest, as the commercial television stations do, that the primary responsibility of television licensees is to the public and that it is in the public&#39;s interest, that programming is selected by the stations leaves a lot to be desired. </para>
        <para>On the question of Australian content in television programmes, I do not go all the way with the view of the actors. I do not say that they should necessarily call the tune, either. But I think that the way in which commercial television stations have interpreted what they regard as . their duty is wrong. I draw attention in particular to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">460</inline> of this report. In commenting on the actors&#39; submission the Board said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>It is clear that there is no simple solution. Strongly held views about the availability of physical and financial resources and the capacity of the artists concerned vary so widely that it is not easy to determine the best policy to be adopted immediately. Many of the proposals put to the Board about, for example, the production of film arid drama in Australia go beyond the Board&#39;s jurisdiction. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I submit that if the Board believes it is beyond its jurisdiction something has to be done to make that jurisdiction somebody&#39;s responsibility, lt may be necessary, just as the Government has . created funds . for assistance to the film industry, for funds-&#39;to be made available for television. I am &#39;not sure that some contribution should not be made by the commercial interests, in view of the large rake-off they are taking. There should also be created something- in the nature of a drama school where full facilities would be made available. The analysis shows that serious drama is almost nonexistent on Australian television at either the national or the commercial level. Read the statistics for yourself and you will see that what is called drama consists of westerns, crime and light comedy. </para>
        <para>To develop the sort of culture referred to in the section of the report dealing with children&#39;s programmes it is necessary to experiment for quite a while, even if the acting is bad and bad programmes are made for a while It will not improve until we go through this, process of trial and error. I commend for the consideration of the Government that, just as funds have been established for assistance to the film industry, assistance in the field of drama should be looked at separately in an experimental way. </para>

          <para>- I de not. want to detain the House long, . but first I would like to say that twice during this debate mention has been made of the profit of commercial television stations. I would like to put this in its right perspective. The report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board indicates the gross profit, which is the revenue less expenses but before the licence fee arid taxation have been paid. All the commercial telecasting stations are public companies. For the year 1968-69 referred to in the report they all paid 45 per cent of their profit by way of taxation. So to use a figure of $15m as being their profit gives the impression to the community that this is automatically available for shareholders, for reserves and for expenditure in the area of film, production. This would be quite wrong . When licence fees are added to the taxes,, the proportion which is taken away from, tha companies is pretty close to 50 per. cent Only 50 per cent remains for other purposes. </para>

            <para>- That is not the&#39; term in which one refers to company profits. Honourable members opposite come into the House and say that the profit of the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd for the year was- S50m odd. This is after taxation has been a charge against the profit. No taxation has been charged against this $15m. I am merely trying to make the point that if we want to be properly analytical in our debate in this House we should be dealing with realities and not dealing with what one might term the spurious facts which appear to flow but of a particular operation. I do not want to say any more about that. I wanted to make a comment in relation to a query raised by the honourable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Berinson).</inline> Earlier in the week he asked me a question which I answered broadly. He raised the matter again yesterday during this debate and I now have the answer for him. I point out to honourable members that sometimes when a question is asked without notice which relates to an administrative process it is impossible for the Minister to deal with it other than broadly. I now come to the particular in regard to the question. I am sorry that the honourable member is not in the House, but no doubt he will pick up the answer from Hansard in due course. </para>

        <para>The honourable member raised the question of some of the telephone accounts in Western Australia having been held over from September to early in October for distribution. The accounts that have been distributed included rental charges which date from 1st October. Although recognised as the October accounts, as the honourable member for Perth suggested, they are normally issued in September. The increased telephone tariffs are operative from 1st October 1970 and are payable in respect of all services as from that date. Subscribers whose October accounts did not include the higher rental charge will receive their next bills in April 1971. In addition to 6 months rental in advance at the higher rate those bills will include a rental adjustment from 1st October 1970. The experience of the Department has shown that most telephone subscribers prefer to have any . tariff adjustments included in their accounts at the earliest date so as to escape the cumulative effect of back-dated adjustments in later accounts. Before a rental tariff adjustment can be included in telephone accounts a considerable amount of preliminary work is necessary on the departmental records. </para>
        <para>On. this occasion Queensland and Western Australia were the only States in a position to adjust the October accounts, and the increased tariff for the corresponding accounts in other States will be billed in April 1971. In Queensland and Western Australia special efforts were made to include the increased rates in the October bills to avoid the effect on subscribers of adjusting the longer period in the April 1971 accounts. This has caused the normal cycle of bill despatch to be extended by about 1 week. The October bills, which would normally have been despatched during September, would not have been delivered before 2nd October. In order that subscribers would have a full 14 days in which to pay their accounts, the date was amended, and the payment terms read: &#39;Payable within 14 days of 2nd October 1970&#39;. </para>
        <para>As I .indicated yesterday, I have no intention on this occasion of dealing with many of the details that have been raised by honourable members. I took up a quarter of an hour or so yesterday afternoon on very important matters relating to the Post Office and other instrumentalities. I regret only that honourable members have riot seen fit to talk about some of those important things rather than to continue to deal with details which come within the administrative area and which I believe have not a very great significance in relation to the estimates of the Post Office. </para>

          <para>- I will endeavour to accommodate the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hulme)</inline> in his aspiration to have matters of importance discussed on these estimates. I want to talk about the independence of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the need to ensure that this great authority is not made subject to partisan control. I believe that the ABC should not be related to any Party. But to the extent that it is related to government, it should be related to the Parliament of the nation. I think it is very significant that at present it is not the Parliament that chooses the Commissioners; it is the Government. That is to say, at the very source, the notion that the people as a whole through the Parliament have responsibility for this matter is destroyed. The preservation of this notion and this principle is vital if the Australian Broadcasting Commission is to function pluralistically on behalf of the widespread interests and groups in the community. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>There are many ways that the Government and Ministers are able to manifest a political influence over this great instrumentality. Included among these insidious ways are such matters as the control which is exercised over overseas visits by people who are engaged in current affairs programmes. We can easily see that if one wishes to encourage the manifestation of an attitude on the part of Australian viewers the simple thing is to regulate what they are to view. If one does not wish them, for example, to understand the situation in Rhodesia, South Africa or, on the other hand, Communist China, one simple ensures- if, for instance, it is the Government&#39;s desire - that &#39; one does not send a team there so that the members of that team can be in a position to convey an effective understanding of these things. </para>
        <para>The Overseas Visits Committee - the Committee which determines the expenditure in relation to public servants going overseas - is, as I. understand it, in the hands of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton).</inline> There have been occasions when it has been contended that this prerogative has been exercised in an undesirable way. If the Minister is to say anything further about these matters that are the subject of this estimates debate, I would like to see him give a clear cut and unequivocal statement that this committee is not used for the purpose of partisanship. Better still, I would like him to indicate that he is interested in contriving a means by which this subject can be brought into a more neutral area of control. </para>
        <para>Similarly, the Public Service has an Appointments Committee. This Committee can affect the calibre of person and indeed the type of person who, in terms of attitude, will prevail in this news and information disseminating authority, the ABC. The Appointments Committee of the Public Service is another means which can bc invoked and utilised to control the public expression of this great media. In a number of minor ways, the autonomy of the ABC in my view was expanded in the recent legislation before the House. But the Bill did not incorporate proposals to liberalise or to liberate the ABC from these political influences to which I have referred - this great insidious form of internal censorship which is the product of Government pressures. In view of these recent events and the widespread public disquiet which followed attempts to muzzle current affairs programmes, I believe that a declaration of independence for the ABC should be incorporated in the Broadcasting and Television Act as the main cornerstone of the controlling legislation. </para>
        <para>The recent disclosures that the Minister aspired to slash the Commission&#39;s proposed budget by half a million dollars with a specific reduction of $250,000 in current affairs programmes in my view can be regarded only as an attempt to deter the Commission from its public obligation to disseminate news on current affairs as it sees fit. In his statement on 27th May of this year, the Minister gave cause for grave concern, in my view, when he said: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>I have been of the opinion that the ABC&#39;s operations in the field of current affairs programmes .&#39;have been characterised by a lack of sufficient care hi the expenditure of public moneys. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I take the view that the Minister&#39;s responsibilities are such that more than innuendo is expected from him in regard to matters of this type. I believe that it is pernicious to vilify without verification. Where specifically is there &#39;lack of sufficient care&#39; - that was the Minister&#39;s term - in the expenditure of public money in the ABC and particularly in regard to current affairs programmes? </para>
        <para>I think that this term &#39;lack of sufficient care&#39; means disagreement by such members as the honourable member for Evans <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Mackay)</inline> with the emphasis that comes over the current affairs programmes and which often does not suit on occasions either the political views of the honourable  member or even my own views. But we are not talking about the ABC upholding in a partisan way the views of every political party - whether it be the Government or the Opposition. We are talking about the responsibility of the ABC to disseminate a fair cross section of attitudes in regard to these matters. I ask the Minister: Who precisely has been indicted for dereliction of responsibility? Does he not believe that  it is necessary to justify the comments that  he made? <inline font-style="italic">If</inline> the Minister knows, surely he  will fulfil his own obligations and act  otherwise he should not cast aspersions  over this very important instrumentality. </para>
        <para>The Australian Broadcasting Commis- , sion Staff Association met on this matter on 27th May of this year. I think some 400 personnel were present. They said in a &#34; resolution: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The ABC staff are concerned that the Government;having apparently lost its battle on the . political front, should not win an undercover victory by gaining, under threat, assurances or compromises from the ABC management. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>It was resolved further: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>If the Government withdraws its directive, assurances be sought from the General Manager that management will defend its current affairs or other officers from unwarranted and inspired, attacks by political or other sources with vested - interests in the manipulation of the mass media. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>Another resolution was: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Censorship can occur at many levels. Management should affirm its confidence in its staff, should affirm its determination to allow current affairs and other programmes to explore with integrity and objectivity a wide variety of issues free from internal as well as external pressures. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>The way to honour these aspirations is not for Ministers or anyone else in high places in the Government to aspersionise in a general way about &#39;lack of sufficient care&#39;. If someone is guilty of that misdemeanour, appropriate action should be taken by way of an effective indictment. I believe that a great need exists to proceed towards the democratisation of the ABC. I am talking here about the need to inject elements of democratisation by electing, where possible, a viewers advisory committee of the type that we have in the ACT and other places. Then, I believe that we should have a new style ABC management with the staff given a greater say, involving participative management, so that the latent potential of the staff is tapped. . </para>
        <para>In the very short time that remains, I wish to mention a matter whichI believe will become a topic for very extensive consideration in this Parliament as time goes on. I am surprised that up to this point in time we have had no indication from the Government about the emerging technology in television. I refer to what is known overseas especially and what will be known here as the &#39;cassette revolution&#39;, in which great technological developments will take place. This has been the subject of overseas conferences. </para>
        <para>It is contended that television broadcasting as known today is on the way out. The present collection of small numbers of licensed television channels transmitting programmes to limited areas will become obsolete. Soon a person will be able to buy video cassette playback and record machines with television screens. These will replace television. A person will playback with sight and sound and colour by using his own video cassettes or cartridges. A person will buy or borrow cassettes or cartridges in the same way as he borrows books and records. A person will be able to plug in to probably 30 different inlets so that he can invoke a concert, a feature film, a lecture, a play, an educational programme or, if it is his choice, things of a pornographic nature. These are great developments which will involve the utilisation of our co-axial cable service. I think that it is time that we had some indication of these new technological developments. </para>

          <para>- I will not be very long. I wish to say one or two things. The first thing that 1 should say is that I. have stated - and this has been printed in the newspapers in the electorate that I represent - that I think that the highlight of the Budget is the section relating to the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department in which the assurance was given that 15 miles of telephone line in a direct line with the nearest telephone exchange would be built free of charge for rural subscribers. Since I came into this Parliament many years ago the farming community and rural residents generally have been saying that it is costing far too much for them to get telephone communications. As compared with the cities this was very apparent, but it was a difficult position. In the cities there are so many people close together that probably telephone connections could be made much cheaper, whereas for the long stretches in the country the cost was very high. A cost of up to $2,000 or $3,000 was&#39; generally mentioned and people had paid that much to get the telephone onto their farms. Without the telephone they could not very well leave their families on the farms. This became a very acute problem. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hulme)</inline> some time ago decided to provide a further mileage of telephone line for farmers but it was not quite enough. Tn this Budget he announced that telephone line would be erected at the expense of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department for a distance of 15 miles in a straight line from the appropriate exchange. Farmers throughout the country have been delighted with this. As a member of the Australian Country Party I want to say that all our members in all States wish to thank the Postmaster-General for the manner in which he has handled their deputations and the result which has come about. This has pleased so many people who are worthy of the best deal we can give them. These people live way out in the country and play their part in the pioneering of districts. This service should bring us a step nearer to decentralisation. We cannot expect people to live in isolated places without a telephone. The man goes away to the markets and the wife and children are left alone on the farm. With a telephone they feel some security. In addition, the amount of money spent by farmers on the additional telephone line since 1st January 1969 will be refunded by the Department. This is one of the outstanding things that has happened since I came into this House. </para>
        <para>I want to pay a tribute to the officers of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department. I know when one starts to mention names that it is very awkward and one is bound to forget someone. The Mallee electorate is covered by 3 districts. They are the offices of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department at Ararat, Bendigo and Mildura. I do not do much business or need to have much connection with the office at Ararat but on one or two occasions I have arranged meetings and the officers there have come along and spoken to subscribers. They have been most helpful and courteous. I want to mention the other  2  offices because I know their officers better than I know those at Ararat. I will refer to Mildura first. It covers a vast amont of the Mallee electorate. The district telephone manager is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gilshenan.</inline> He is a most progressive citizen. Not only is he the manager of the district telephone office but he is a colonel or major in the local branch of the Citizen Military Forces and a man with great public endeavour who wishes to do what he can. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Thornton</inline> is the next man to him and both these gentlemen have come along readily when I have called meetings of subscribers. We have had no trouble at all. They have met the constituents and perhaps they have not always been able to do what the constituents want. But now with the extra  15  miles of line being provided they will be able to satisfy more people. Nevertheless the people were satisfied that under the policy at that stage these officers did what they could. </para>
        <para>Bendigo is the other telephone office that covers part of the Mallee electorate. I pay a tribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Madden,</inline> the District Telephone Manager, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McGregor,</inline> who is, I think, second in charge. I could not ask for any better service than they have given. It is the same with Mildura. I am not leaving out Ararat because the officers there have given great service too. I am not sure whether there has been some change in the district telephone manager there recently. I do not do as much business in that area. As far as the postal business is concerned we also have a district postal manager at Mildura, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harry</inline> Allen. No-one could expect to get a better man anywhere to give service. He gives great service. If I ring and ask him to come to a meeting because the people are perhaps dissatisfied, he will come at the first opportunity. He handles the meeting in a workmanlike manner and it is appreciated not only by me as the representative of thousands of people but by the people with whom he comes in contact. It may seem to some that I should not say these things in the Commonwealth Parliament but I believe in giving honour where honour is due and the work that has been done is remarkable. 1 wish to refer to Wyperfield Park in the Rainbow-Hopetoun district where there is a lot of work done on wildlife conservation. There is an increasing number of tourists visiting this park. All sorts of native bird life and animals arc being preserved there. People go there with children in caravans and for picnics and outings. They may stay there over a period so that they can go through the park and see what is happening and what is being done to preserve animal life. It may seem that this has not much to do with the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department but it has a great deal to do with it. I am advocating - I have been asked to do so by the residents in the district - that the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department install a telephone at an appropriate place in this park so that when people go there they can go to the telephone, for example, in the case of an accident and ring a doctor at Hopetoun &#62; or  Rainbow. A telephone gives a feeling of security which without it the people do not have at all. </para>
        <para>Other honourable members wish to speak so I will say finally that we appreciate the way the Postmaster-General has handled things generally. I know there is some feeling about, the rise in the cost postage of letters and of bulk postage for newspapers and periodicals. Throughout the country people are talking about the marvellous . profits made by the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department. But the mere fact that the Department will provide 15 miles of telephone line for rural residents will absorb much more than all the profits that are made in a year. It will cost a tremendous amount of money. In the electorate which I represent there have been renovations to post offices in modern times at Robinvale, Mildura, Kerang, Swan Hill and many other places. New telephone boxes have been installed and the general expense of this type of work is tremendous. I know the Government makes a very big grant to the Department each year but we cannot judge the solvency of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department by the amount of money that is in the trading account. I speak with appreciation of the Department and the man who is at its head. </para>

          <para>- Before I go on to what I was speaking about last evening I want to compliment the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hulme)</inline> and his Department for the very co-operative attitude they have taken in dealing with anything f have had to raise with them. Every time I have written a letter to the Minister or asked for action I have received extremely prompt replies and extremely satisfactory solutions have been found to almost all the problems I have asked him about. I would also agree with the honourable member for Mallee <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Turnbull)&#39;</inline> when he complimented the local officers of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department on the tremendous assistance they give. 1 only wish that 1 could say the same about a lot of other departments. Last evening I was referring to a number of matters concerning . television and honourable members may recall that 1 quoted from a speech from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Newton</inline> N. Minow,  Chairman  of the Federal Communications Commission of the United States of America. I talked about the profitability of television stations and referred to the ratings which showed that Australian produced television was highly rated and that it had 6 out of the top 10 shows according to the Australian ratings. 1 hope that the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hulme)</inline> will find time soon to announce what the new quota content will be. A couple of thousand artists are most anxiously awaiting the results of the inquiry as to whether or not there are to beincreased quotas. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>It is interesting to note that the Australian television commercials industry, given complete protection by the banning of imported commercials, has thrived and is highly profitable and ranked in the top 3 in the world. A few of our television commercials have won world awards. Unless drastic action is taken in the near future to protect Australian television shows, particularly drama, it is unlikely that anything remotely resembling an award will be won by Australian writers, Australian artists and Australian producers. If they do win them they will have won them for their work on English television, for that is where most, of them are working now. The complaint that I make on behalf of these people is not that the television stations do not fulfil their quotas hut that the quotas are too low, particular for drama. If the television stations had their own way there would be no quotas and consequently no Australian television industry. Only quotas have prevented the industry&#39;s complete annihilation. </para>
        <para>In recent weeks we have seen the dangerous situation that has arisen through the granting of licences to newspaper proprietors who now have almost complete control over the dissemination of nearly all news, information and editorial comment. In the current debate that has raged over Australian content, the Press, particularly the Packer Press, has been able to distort or misrepresent the arguments of one side while publishing misleading and exaggerated claims in support of their own side. One needs only to read the pontificating pomposity of a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nigel</inline> Dick, General Manager of GTV 9, on 21st August when he attempted to hand down from the mount his view or should I say <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Packer&#39;s view, of what television is all about. If there is anything more sick making than a business executive trying to explain that his company&#39;s actions are motivated entirely by the public interest and not good old fashioned profits, I should like to know what it is. </para>
        <para>It is highly unlikely that any of my speech will be reported in the newspapers where there is this conflict of interest. I might add that it is the opinion of those who have visited the United States - and I cannot count myself among them - and have made a close study of television, that this is the reason for the vast difference between the amount of news, news editorial and current affairs that is broadcast on Australian television and the amount that is broadcast on American television. The major networks in the United States have li hours of news and editorial comment from 6 p.m. to 7.30 p.m., another <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> hour at 9 p.m. and again at 11 p.m. As well as this there are numerous quality panel and discussion shows that delve deeply into every aspect of American social and political life. This is in stark contrast to Australian television where what few current affairs and discussion programmes there were have almost ceased to exist. The Australian Broadcasting Commission provides This Day Tonight&#39; and &#39;Four Corners* as the only continuous current affairs programme. The reasons for this are obvious. Too many of these programmes would lead to a drop in newspaper sales, and  a  well-informed public would not be in the interests of the political party that most newspapers support. One needs only to have studied the deliberate attempt by certain government backbenchers to eliminate the last vestige of political and current affairs discussion on the ABC to understand why the commercial stations have sought to stifle public debate and awareness. </para>
        <para>I mentioned earlier that the television stations, through their organisation, the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations, had waged an elaborate, expensive and factually inaccurate campaign which culminated in the production of a glossy magazine that purported to answer the critics&#39; charges that they were not fulfilling their moral obligations to Australia&#39;s cultural heritage. The publication, called &#39;FACTS&#39;, was historic in that it probably contained more prejudiced, subjective and deliberately misleading and meaningless statements than any document it has been my misfortune to read. The brevity of this debate does not allow me time to mention more than a few, but let me quote a couple of examples. It stated: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>The existing quota has achieved an excellent programme balance between imported and local programmes, making for a good blend of programme variety sufficient to appeal to the Australian public. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">What arrant nonsense! Have honourable members ever heard a more selfcongratulatory view of one&#39;s own work? It must be very convenient when a person can write his own critiques. This brings to mind  a  recent statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Packer, when commenting on the disqualification of &#39;Gretel&#39; in the Americas Cup, about appealing to your mother-in-law about your wife. This is like a mother giving a reference for her daughter to a prospective husband. </para>
        <para>I was going to quote another extract from this publication but the honourable member for Melbourne Ports <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Crean)</inline> has mentioned the number of people who watch television. I think that what is needed are the following requirements: We need increased quotas for Australian content - we should aim, like the Canadians, for 60 per cent; we need special emphasis to be placed on drama and the present 2-hour quota should be increased to 4 hours a week; Australian drama should  be  defined as that written, acted and produced by Australians; repeats should not be allowed to qualify as part of the quota and the clause that allows British Commonwealth productions to qualify&#34; for 50 per cent of their time value as Australian content should be removed. We should introduce tariff protection with a 50 per cent loading on imported shows With the revenue directed towards subsidising Australian film production.  1 hope that the, Government and the Opposition can get together to review the matter of the 10-minute time limit during the Estimates debate. I think that all of us  have agreed that we should cut the time limit on major speeches on Bills and state-  ments but during the Estimates debate it is absolutely impossible to say anything at all profound or anything that has involved research in 10 minutes. </para>

          <para>-For 20 years this Government has deluded the Australian people into believing that it had a defence policy but for a policy it has substituted slogans; for information, lies; and for discussion, pronouncement. In the last few weeks the Malaysian Government, in pressing for accommodatios with China - Mainland  or  Communist, depending on whether  or  not wheat is being sold to it, as far as the Aus tralian Country Party is concerned - and the neutralisation of South East Asia, guaranteed by the United States of America, the Soviet Union and China, has shown a sanity and a maturity which is sadly lacking in this Liberal-Country Party Government. How absurd our policy looks when the countries we pompously pretend and presume to protect do not accept the fallacious patterns on which our policy is supposedly formed. This Government has been extraordinarily reluctant to disclose to the House and to the people of Australia the cost of maintaining our forces overseas. A superficial . glance at the Budget papers would show the amount of $21,846,000 under the heading of Department of the Army. Under the Department of &#34;Air it is $22,025,000. The figure for the Department of Navy does not disclose any cost for maintaining the Australian commitment in Vietnam and in MalaysiaSingapore. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>If we delve a little deeper we find that as from 1st July 1969. in an obvious attempt to minimise the expenditure related to the overseas commitment, the Government has transferred the expenditure on stores purchased in Australia and forwarded to Australian defence forces abroad from Division 666 &#39;Forces Overseas&#39; to Division 670 which deals with armaments and stores. This means that the Government has resorted to accountancy tricks to deceive the Australian people about the cost of maintaining our forces abroad. I challenge the Government to disprove that the total cost is not the sum of $43,871,000, which appears in the Budget, but is in fact closer to $1 00m. </para>
        <para>We on this side of the House regard this expenditure as a waste. It distorts not only our defence expenditure but also the whole Budget expenditure. We would prefer to  channel this money to meet more urgent needs in the defence vote and in the general Budget. For instance, with these funds we could, without raising taxation, increase the standard and married rates of pension by $2 a week instead of the piffling 50c that has been made available by this Government in this Budget This Government has also shown a marked aversion to putting in writing the understandings and commitments that we have with other countries. The F111 fiasco is a notable case. But there have been cases in which the Government has sought to raise its stupidity to the rank of a virtue. When speaking in this House on 25th September 1963 the then Prime Minister said, in relation to the commitment of forces to Malaysia and Singapore:   . . our vital engagements with the United Kingdom are not written or in any way formalised.

        <para class="block">This form of ingenuousness has cost the Australian taxpayers S20m. In June 1957 we agreed with the United Kingdom and New Zealand to share the cost of the construction of a Commonwealth base at Terendak and we paid 22.7 per cent of the total cost. This works out at nearly $6m. The Malaysian Government leased the site to the British Government. The British Government pulled out and, under the terms of the lease, the whole base returned to the Malaysian Government. But has this Government at any stage announced to the people of Australia and to this House what has happened to the $6m that we invested in Terendak? We have not heard one word from the Auditor-General. Regrettably this Government&#39;s gross imcompetence has been repeated with the Royal Australian Air Force base at Butterworth. Although it has been a predominantly Australian base  in terms of. manning the United Kingdom again held the lease. The British Government has returned this base to the Malaysians along with $12m worth of Australian investment. I am at a loss to understand the apathy which condones this massive misuse of the taxpayers money. Furthermore, I am appalled at the lighthearted manner in which the Auditor-General in his report dismissed this misuse of funds. He said: </para>

          <para>The rights of occupancy of the Air Force base, Butterworth, were transferred by the United Kingdom authorities to the Malaysian Government on and from lst April 1970.

        <para>The Auditor-General has made no further comment on this misuse of funds. There has been no examination of , the reason why safeguards were not written in to safeguard our equity in both the Terendak camp and the Butterworth camp.

As to the terms of occupancy when the leasing of these bases or the arrangements with the Malaysians or Singaporeans come up, why have we not. heard what the terms of our occupancy are to be? The Minister for Defence in response to a series of questions which I put to him on this subject has completely evaded the issue. When will our occupancy be regularised? What are the terms to which we will agree to stay in Butterworth and to stay in Singapore? What will it cost the Australian taxpayers? We in this House and the people of Australia have a right to know. For too long we have put up with this monumental incompetence of the Australian Government. I also want to know when the stationing of our forces in Singapore will be regularised. When will we get these satisfactory barracks we have been told about? When will we sign a status of forces agreement? How much money do we have to pay? </para>
        <para>In the very limited time at my disposal in this debate I want to refer to a point which is of very great concern to all members of a democratic institution. I refer to a handbook that is made available to and which is required reading by Australian national servicemen and Australian soldiers going to Vietnam. This book is a deliberate attempt to brainwash members of the Australian forces. It is classified as restricted but members of the forces are encouraged to discuss it with, in the words of the handbook, &#39;your family and friends&#39;. The Army has been used and is being used to propagate the political viewpoint of the Liberal Party. It is a cheap political trick. It is reminiscent of what happened when I was in the Department of External Affairs and that Department was required to send out an essentially propagandist publication called &#39;Questions and Answers on Vietnam* to Australian schools. To take a couple of examples of the kinds of lies, deceptions, innuendos and prejudices, it states in chapter 1, paragraph 3: </para>

        <para class="block">Time and again we can go through these statements and repeat the lies and the deception of the Government, but one point that we should keep in mind is that our forces are enjoined in this document not to think for themselves. They are told: You will be kept informed regarding the true position of the war by your officers&#39;. So we are setting up a system of political commissars when the soldier is told not to think but to take notice of what his political commissar in the Australian Army tells him to think. We finish up with the motto - this could well apply to honourable members opposite but not to any democratic institution such as the Australian Army - that they are required to live up to, namely, constant vigilance, eternal suspicion. This is the kind of attitude we are taking to the people we are sending abroad to fight in the name of democracy. We are denying them democracy and we are denying Australian people democracy. </para>

          <para>-  I have only a few minutes remaining before the House adjourns until next week. I have just listened to flagrantly dishonest and distorted allegations by the honourable member for St George <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Morrison).</inline> It is not the first time that he has made them in this Parliament and elsewhere since he transferred from bis position with the Department of External Affairs. I have before me a Malaysian publication of Friday, 13 th February, which scathingly attacks allegations made by the honourable member for St George, dismissing him and his allegations as being a cheap tactic, one of the cheapest found anywhere in the world. He was referring to our presence in Malaysia and making allegations that Australia should not be committed to Malaysia, and he was talking about the use of the base at Butterworth much as he did today. This is what the Malaysians think of him because you know as well as I do that there has been  a  specific request- </para>

            <para>- I. will be delighted to give my reply. I would like to leave my reply for another minute and a half. I would like to get back to the pocket book which was referred to by the honourable member for St George and which he regards as a technique for brainwashing the Army. The pocket book is a mere summary of background information on Vietnam. Good heavens, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Chairman,</inline> I have a book at home which covers in about 1,500 pages the history of Vietnam, and it is supposed to be a summary. This little pocket book which deals with all sorts of circumstances regarding Vietnam is alleged by the honourable member for St George to be brainwashing. Talk about besmirching the intelligence of every Australian officer and soldier! This pocket book was produced as useful background, and nothing more, for servicemen going to Vietnam, in many instances for the first time. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>Apart from the specific aspects to which the honourable member for St George has referred, the booklet contains advice about the language and customs of the Vietnamese people as well as advice about differences in tribal makeup. The geography of the country and ethnic and historical differences are dealt with scantily. The pocket, book is necessarily a summary. It is available in the Parliamentary Library. If the honourable member for Wills, who is interjecting, had been paying attention to the debates in the Parliament he would know that, as has been stated before, it is available to those who require it. </para>

Like other lenders the societies take a number nf factors into account, including the size and reliability of the borrower&#39;s income and his other financial commitments and responsibilities, lt would be unusual for a society to agree to repayment terms on a housing loan which involved commitments by the borrower exceeding 25 per cent of his income. </para>
