            <para class="block">To the Honourable the  Speaker  and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of residents of the State of Victoria respectfully sheweth: </para>
            <para>That because of uncontrolled shooting for commercial purposes, the population of kangaroos, particularly the big red species, is nowso low that they may become extinct. </para>
            <para>There are insufficient wardens in any State of the Commonwealth to detect or apprehend those who break the inadequate laws which exist. As a tourist attraction, the kangaroo is a permanent source of revenue to this country. It is an indisputable fact that no species can withstand hunting on such a scale, when there is no provision being made for its future. </para>
            <para>We, your petitioners, therefore humbly pray that the export of kangaroo products be banned immediately, and the Commonwealth Government takethe necessary steps to have all wildlife in Australia brought under its control. Only a complete cessation of killing for commercial purposes can save surviving kangaroos. And your petitioners, therefore, as in duty bound will ever pray. </para>

At 3 earlier question times this session the honourable gentleman has attempted to explain away the dissatisfaction in the Royal Australian Air Force over pay and allowances. I ask the Minister how he explains the dissatisfaction expressed at the Williamtown and, apparently, Amberley bases yesterday in a form which the newspapers variously described as a 'mutiny* and a strike' over pay and allowances. </para>

I ask him whether he has seen an instruction issued to peace marchers by one of the Moratorium organising groups, the Students for Democratic Action, which says: </para>

What he is doing is giving this House evidence of weapons used against subjects of  Her  Majesty the Queen. Therefore I suggest that the point of order should fall to the ground. </para>

Leaving aside the Prime Minister's intervention and relying upon your own apparent ruling, it would be equally permissible in this place where everybody has sworn allegiance to the Head of State for the honourable member for Boothby to illustrate one of his favourite subjects at question time by displaying the Rhodesian flags that he has brought back from that country. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Defence and is supplementary to the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition. Does the Minister recall the circumstances which led to a revolt by certain members of the naval forces quite recently? Has he received a report on this matter when members of the Royal Australian Navy expressed their concern and displeasure with the Government over pay rates and conditions of service? I ask the Minister whether there is any parallel between this situation and the one referred to by the Leader of the Opposition. If the Minister has received a report on the case involving personnel from the Royal Australian Navy, is he in a position to inform this House? </para>

            <para>- 1 do not propose to indulge in a battle of semantics with the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, but I would make it quite clear to the honourable gentleman that the term 'revolt' or 'mutiny' is a term of art and has a very precise meaning. Looking back over recent history of his own Party, I would imagine that even he by now would have some comprehension of what is involved. I want to be perfectly clear. The honourable gentleman has made the charge that there was a revolt in the P.oy?!  Australian  Navy. I want to deny that in the most explicit language. There was no revolt. </para>

              <para>- If 1 may continue with a little tranquillising in reply to the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, a revolt or mutiny means a revolt against an order given by constituted authority. In the case of the Royal Australian Navy incident or episode - 1 do not care what term the honourable gentleman cares to apply to it - no order was given. I ask the honourable gentleman how there can be a revolt against an order given by constituted authority when no order is in fact in existence. This is a simple case. The question asked by the honourable gentleman is very much in keeping with the pattern of questions that have been asked by many honourable gentlemen opposite in the last couple of days to try to discredit and break down the integrity and discipline in the 3 Australian Services. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Prime Minister, ls there a delegation of student leaders from Cambodia presently in Australia? Have these students come direct from the war zone to give evidence to Australians regarding the invasion of their country by a foreign power? Why has there been so little public notice of this visit? ls the lack of publicity due ro inefficiency or does it suggest a species of censorship? Will the Prime Minister ask the Australian people to compare the treatment of this visit with that which would surely have greeted such a group if (heir evidence had been anti-American or anti-Australian? </para>

            <para>- I understand there is a group of students from Cambodia who have come to this country in order to let the Australian people know of what is happening in Cambodia and of the facts of the invasion of that country by North Vietnam. I have not noticed them appearing on the public media and I am sure, as the honourable member suggests, that if they had come to be critical it is quite likely they would have so appeared. I would hope that opportunities will be taken by (he media to enable these representatives-- these young student representatives - of a country under attack properly to put their point of view to the Australian people. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer to his statement last weekend to the New South Wales Liberal Party branch convention on the effects of increased wages on the economy. As the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission is shortly to hear the 1970 national wage case, does this regrettable statement indicate that the Government intends to be more blatant in future attempts to influence the Commission? If this is not intended will he assure the House that he will discontinue making such biased and ill-considered statements? </para>

            <para>- I suppose the honourable member is entitled to add what adjectives he likes to his statement. I would like to make it clear that I do not agree with those adjectives at all. I believe it perfectly proper for myself as the leader of the Government or for other Ministers to point out that the only real benefit from wage rises can come if there is an increase in production and those wages can buy more. I believe it perfectly proper to point out and will continue to point out that the inflation which follows wage rises which are not backed up by increased productivity is an inflation which damages members of this community least able to look after themselves. The object of this Government and of the Budget which it has brought in is to contain inflation for the benefit of those who can least look after themselves. Another objective of it was to provide more in the pay packet by taxation remissions which are much more effective in buying power than the actual sum concerned because they are not subject, of course, to taxation at all. I think it proper, responsible and right to point these things out. I shall continue to do so. I think it is irresponsible for the honourable member to say they should not be said. </para>

          <para class="block">Trade and Industry. I preface my question by relating it to advice recently given to the House of Representatives by the right honourable gentleman that the Government intends to introduce amending legislation to permit it to pay a temporary additional bounty to local tractor manufacturers. I ask: Is the Minister aware that the bounty to tractor manufacturers, and the financial benefits flowing to agricultural machinery and chemical manufacturers from the tariff protection they enjoy, is financing a campaign for a grain alcohol distillery to use annually 100 million bushels of wheat; and that this grain alcohol proposal is based on wheat usage at a ruinously low price to wheat growers and an increased cost to users of motor spirit? </para>

            <para>- The honourable member referred to the use of 100 million bushels of wheat at a ruinously low price. No-one in the Chamber would know better than the honourable member that not a single bushel of wheat can be sold in Australia except on the basis of the stabilisation scheme which is operated under Acts of the 6 State parliaments and of this Parliament Within the price fixing provisions of the stabilisation scheme there is no provision whatever which would permit the sale of wheat at a ruinously low price. The honourable member made reference to an intended increase in the bounty payment on tractors and to tariff protection of producers of agricultural machinery. The policies in each respect arise from open hearings by the Tariff Board made at the request of the Government and a finding by the Tariff Board that it is necessary to protect certain Australian industries which comes as a recommendation to the Government. In one case perhaps a tariff will be increased. But in the case of tractors, the recommendation adopted by the Government to protect farmers from dearer tractors was that instead of a tariff a bounty should be paid, as has been the practice of this Government since it has taken office. I think it takes a fair flight of the imagination to argue that because the manufacturer of tractors will in due course have an increased bounty this money is being used to finance a campaign to establish power alcohol distilleries to use cheap wheat. I am bound to say that my mind will not really follow the logic of it. </para>

            <para>- Earlier this year the Government made a number of decisions which needed to be made before detailed drafting could proceed in relation to this matter. As my colleague the Attorney-General knows particularly, it has been a heavy year for drafting. The Leader of the Opposition knows of the steps that the Government has taken to expedite matters in this area. Whether or not the measures can be introduced in this session will depend very largely on the drafting. 1 would be hopeful that they might, but 1 cannot give any undertaking to the House that they can be. The number of important decisions that the Government had to take before drafting could proceed were decided by the Government very early in this calendar year. </para>

            <para>- I ask the Prime Minister: Are films of demonstrations or information obtained from such films used to convey information to counsel or courts in cases unrelated to such demonstrations? Are such films destroyed when it is decided no court action relating to the demonstration is pending or likely? Will he confirm that the description of an accused as a 'known demonstrator' in court proceedings unrelated to demonstrations is prejudicial and subversive of natural justice? Will the Prime Minister assure the House that flags, flagstaffs or instructions made by an unruly minority sponsoring demonstrations are not accepted by the Government as evidence of the motives, actions or aims of individual participants or the official sponsors of the demonstrations, including honourable members of this House, who repeatedly have made it clear that they oppose violence in Australia and in Vietnam? </para>

            <para>-  In reply to the last part of the question which I remember better than the first part, because it was rather long - yes, I would assure the House that the "Government does not regard the instructions given to some who engage in Moratorium marches and other demonstrations in effect to carry weapons with them as being something which applies to all those who engage in such demonstrations or whatever it might be. The Government, however - I am not sure that the Opposition agrees with this - does say that some of those engaged in these demonstrations do carry these types of weapons and do carry them under 1 est ruction and are prepared to use them. </para>

          <para>The other part of the question referred to the taking of films of demonstrations. I do not believe that anybody's rights to natural justice or that anybody's rights of any kind are infringed by the fact that a photograph is taken of him and if, in fact, at some later stage there should be a question of fact arise I see no reason why that photograph should not be produced to decide what the actual facts were. </para>

            <para>- The Commonwealth Government is aware of the serious position in Queensland, particularly in the wool industry, because of the severe economic conditions prevailing, that is, the low wool prices and the drought. As a result, a large sum of money has been made available for drought relief to that State. In addition, the Commonwealth has announced that $30m will be made available for emergency relief to wool growers whose income has declined severely in the last financial year as against income during the year 1968-69. Quite a substantial part of this $30m no doubt will go to graziers and wool growers who are suffering in Queensland. </para>

          <para>It was announced also in the Budget that I and my Department were to carry out an examination of the debt problem in rural industries. I know that this is a severe problem in Queensland. A survey is not something that one can carry out quickly because finance in relation to rural industries is a very big question. Furthermore, it is an extremely complex question. ft is a question that does involve or would appear to involve the State Governments in possible ways and means of handling the question. Lastly, it is a matter which could involve governments in a considerable amount of expenditure in overcoming some of the problems that we have been told exist. </para>
          <para>The survey or the examination that is being carried out by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics will look at the extent of the indebtedness and will try to determine the degree of it in certain areas. The reasons or the cause of this indebtedness will be examined and the Bureau will make recommendations to me as to how the problem ought to be handled, but it is a matter that needs considerable examination. It is not easy to know how some of the matters can be handled. There is a great variation in the problem of indebtedness. Some people are at a stage of near bankruptcy, other people have a severe debt problem which they are finding difficult to manage and others see that their potential indebtedness could be quite severe. All of these aspects must be examined. They will be examined and recommendations will be made to the Government. </para>

            <para>- 1 ask that further questions be placed on notice. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> I wish to make a personal explanation since my name has been used by the honourable member for Dawson. It is quite true that 1 expressed to the honourable member for Dawson my regret that he should have been suspended. I said that I felt that it was because of a misunderstanding by him of what actually had transpired. I still think that the record of Hansard shows this to be so because I think the unaltered record shows quite clearly that the Minister for the Interior was speaking of a May meeting of the Moratorium and he indicated, I think, that the honourable member for Lalor was at that meeting. The honourable member for Dawson, I believe, thought he was speaking of Friday's meeting but I believe that the transcript shows clearly that it was not. In fact, I understand that the honourable member for Lalor was at the May meeting. So I do regret that the honourable member for Dawson was suspended. I do regret that it was the result of a misunderstanding but I think the misunderstanding, a genuine one, was in the mind of the honourable member for Dawson. </para>

            <para>- I claim that 1 gave information yesterday to this House - it was ignored - on what transpired. I want to state it again now. The Government refused to accept my explanation. I said that that was the reason why the honourable member for Dawson was dismissed but honourable members on the Government side refused to accept my explanation and they went ahead and dismissed him. You will note, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> if you examine page 1589 of Hansard that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> made a statement. Following that statement the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> made his statement. It will be seen clearly from looking at page 1589 of Hansard that the Leader of the Opposition said that there were no Vietcong flags at the May meeting, and he then gave the explanation that if there were any Vietcong flags they were brought up at Friday's meeting after he had spoken. </para>

            <para>- No. We had an appeal just a moment ago from honourable members, including members of the Party to which the honourable member for Reid belongs, about the conduct of the House. This is just another episode in the story of how frivolous or extraneous points of order are taken and personal explanations are made. The honourable member for Reid has gone well beyond the bounds of a personal explanation. In fact, the explanation that he is making has not touched on bini personally to this stage. Therefore I ask him to resume his seat. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> the House is discussing a motion to take note of a statement issued by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam).</inline> Both the implications of the content of that statement and the implications of the fact that it was made by him have, I believe, national significance for in that statement he advises young men not to obey the provisions of the law as they at present stand and he advises young men who are soldiers to disobey a military order and to refuse to go to a theatre of war to which their unit may be posted, if they claim to have conscientious reasons for not going to that theatre of war. In this particular case the argument refers to Vietnam but of course it goes far beyond that because if it is proper to say to a young man - a soldier: Disobey a military order to go to Vietnam, if you do not want to go there' then it is equally right to say to a soldier: 'Disobey a military order to go to any theatre that you may say you do not wish to go to.' And therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> the implications of this statement, as I see them, are firstly, a direct attack upon the rule of law as it operates in this country now; and secondly, the counselling of a course of action which would make the operations of an army with a content of national servicemen quite impossible in any theatre of war. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Now it is of no use for the Leader of the Opposition to say that if he had an army he would have no national servicemen in it. The facts of the matter are that as the law stands there is an Army. It is reliant upon national servicemen. That was reinforced and brought about as a result of an election not long ago. And the Leader of the Opposition is advocating a course which would make the operations of that Army quite impossible. Just consider for one moment: You have a battalion trained as a team, and the suggestion made to these soldiers by the Leader of the Opposition is that some of them should say: T would not like to go to Malaysia so I will not go there. I will disobey an order to go there.' Others might say: '1 will not go to Vietnam because I do not like the idea of going to Vietnam, so I will refuse to obey an order to go there.' Whatever theatre of war you may choose to consider this could apply to. The fact that this can be advocated publicly by the Leader of the Opposition - not by somebody outside Parliament, not by somebody seeking to attack the Vietnam war or the rights and wrongs of the Vietnam war, but by the Leader of the Opposition, the man who hopes some day to become Prime Minister - for him to advocate such an action is in fact an implication to which I referred at the beginning of this speech which has national significance. </para>
          <para>For it means that he regards his own position so irresponsibly that he would suggest that should he ever become Prime Minister - should this country ever be afflicted with that disaster - then it would be right for an Opposition or a leader of an Opposition to urge disobedience to any law which he might choose to ask the Parliament to pass. This, coming from a man in that position, has very, very grave implications indeed and, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> COL,1. not be more designed, whether on purpose or not, to render the operation of our military forces ineffective in their present role. This of course is the objective of many - those who take part in moratoriums and those who are members of the Communist Party. That is their objective. This advice would fallow out their objective. Whether from the same motives or not does not matter. It would help them to follow out that objective. </para>
          <para>I have said that not only would this statement by the leader of the Opposition render the use of our military forces ineffective but it was in fact an incitement to a breach of the law as it stands. Let us examine that. Let us examine the quality of this advice and let us examine what must be the thought processes behind it. In the first place there is no inescapable obligation upon any young man in Australia to go to fight with the Army in Vietnam. There is no inescapable obligation at all under the law. If a young man has genuine conscientious beliefs then he can go before a court - that is, genuine conscientious objection to bearing arms at all or to taking part in any war. Then there is provision in the law for him to go before the courts and if the courts finds that he does so hold those conscientious beliefs he is excused from all service, so there is no requirement there. But, secondly, if a young man does not have that conscientious objection to war but objects  to some particular theatre of war then there is provision in the law for that young man to join the Citizen Military Forces, in which case he cannot be called up and will not be called up to serve in a theatre to which he objects. </para>
          <para>Now it is quite clear from -the statement made by the Leader of the Opposition that he is talking about the advice he gives to young men before they register. They come along to him - the statement makes it clear -and say: 'What should T do?' Surely the law being what it is the right and proper advice to give to such a young man would be to say: 'If that is how you feel then I can advise you this way. You should join the CMF if you do not have conscientious objections to bearing arms, and should you do that then you will be excused from being called up for service in Vietnam.' That, however, is not apparently the advice that is given. At least it does not appear to be the advice from the statement that he has made in this House. But if the Leader of the Opposition now as an afterthought is inclined to say: 'Oh, but I do give that advice first. This is the first advice I give to a young man', then what he is saying is this: 'I show this young man a legal and proper way for him to obtain the objective that he seeks. If he turns down and will not use the legal and proper way then I advise him to use an illegal way and to break the law.' Now, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> there are those who argue that an individual has the right to break a law if he considers it to be a bad law. I do not believe for one moment that that contention can hold any water in a country where parliaments make the law and people elect the parliaments but however that may be when there is a legal Act and there is a legal method of obtaining an objective - when a Leader of an Opposition in his capacity as adviser has pointed out that a legal method of avoiding the service required and is then prepared to go on - because an individual refuses to take a legal course - and advise an illegal course, and advise a young man to join the Army and to refuse to go to Vietnam or to any other place to which he does not want to go, then I believe there can be no more reprehensible or irresponsible thing than for a Leader of an Opposition in such a position to say: 'There is a legal way that you can act but of course if you will not act in that way I advise you to act in an illegal way.' And one wonders whether this does show a contempt for law, whether it does show a desire to help to break the law. One knows that in the end result if it is followed out it would lead to severe punishment to young men which could have been avoided had they been given the proper advice and it will lead, while the law stands as it is, to the impossibility of using the armed troops of Australia in the field. The implications of this, coming from the source from which it comes, are very grave indeed for Australia and I believe that all Australians should ponder deeply the fact that that man who now leads the Opposition is prepared to urge - or rather let me say advise - a course of action which would lead to the inability to use our troops and is prepared to advise an illegal course of action when there exists a legal way of attaining the objective required. </para>
          <para>One shudders to think of what this kind of approach would mean to Australia should it ever suffer the disaster of having an alteration and that individual becoming Prime Minister of Australia. Just imagine, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> the way in which this country would move should we accept without protest these kinds of suggestions, this kind of advice, by a Leader of the Opposition that the law should be broken even when it does not need to be broken, and even when the objective can be achieved without it. This is gong to result as I said, whether intentionally or not, in an attack upon our capacity to fight and in a real threat to the rule of law in this country, and it comes from a man who has sworn to uphold the law. I do not believe that the people of this country tor one moment wm accept that kind of leadership and I think it is a great advantage that the kind of leadership really there has been by accident, brought out and shown to the people of this country to be a fact. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline>the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> is under censure from the Government for a reason that has nothing to do with what he said or with the effect of what he said. He is under censure from the Government that knows it cannot maintain office because of its own performance, and which, therefore, tries to divert public attention from itself - to create at least a mild form of hysteria and persuade people that there are others whose faults are even greater than its own. This is not an attempt to examine what the Leader of the Opposition said or the need or justification for it; it is an exercise in the most cynical form of politics that exists. What has the Leader of the Opposition said? First of all he said that if he were speaking to a man who already objected to the war in Vietnam he would tei) him what course he should take if in fact he were called up. The Leader of the Opposition was talking not about young mcn who do not object to the war in Vietnam or to people in general but about young men who already object to the war in Vietnam. What did he say he would fell them? He said he would tell them that they should carry out the law to the full extent their consciences would allow. But the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> of course, has no room for conscience in this country. He just said so. He has no room for conscience because he imagines that he and his Government and the forces behind it are so ultimately democratic that there is no need or room for conscience in Australia. If he thinks that, I do not. </para>
          <para>What did the Leader of the Opposition say he would tell these men? He said he would tell them to carry out the law as far as their consciences would allow. If they were in the Army and were ordered to go to Vietnam and they could not in conscience go. then they would have to disobey orders given to them and disobey those orders at their own cost and penalty. This is a right that is recognised in every civilised country. It is recognised by all those people who have led our thinking in philosophy and theology and have given us a civilisation upon which the democracy of today is based. But the Prime Minister has no room for conscience in 1970 in Australia because he and his Ministers happen to be in office. There is no room for conscience any more. No doubt that is how members of the Government parties look at it. Could they tell these young men to put aside their consciences altogether? Men who know nothing of conscience could do that easily. Could the Leader of the Opposition give them no advice at all and leave it to them to be totally unprepared for what might happen to them once they were in the hands of authority? No doubt that is what members of the Government parties would do - they who have amongst them many who are young enough to volunteer for Vietnam but do not. Yet, on the contrary, they force other young men into the military service against their consciences or into gaol for long months for judges to find and report that they should never have been there at all. </para>
          <para>If honourable members on the other side of the House have any conscience at all and this will not stir them, then I can conclude only that their consciences are faint and cowardly. No, this is not the Labor way of doing things; it is the Liberal way of doing things - the smart, polished, suave Liberal way of doing things. I know which I prefer and 1 refuse to believe that the Australia people could be so devoid of a sense of fair play that they would prefer the method of the Prime Minister and his followers. It may be difficult for Liberals to understand that there are thousands of young men who are convinced in their opposition to the blood bath in which Australia is involved in Vietnam; who are opposed to conscription for that purpose and to every aspect of the Government which enforces it upon Australia, and who will have nothing to do with the Citizens Military Forces. The CMF is no alternative for boys in this position and anyone who, like the Leader of the Opposition, has talked to them knows that the CMF is no alternative for them because they will not have anything to do with the military service which is tied to this blood bath for which members on the Government side are all responsible. If they do not know that they do not know the young men with whom we are dealing and that is the whole point of the submission I am making. They know nothing of these young men in their cynical detachment and their superior positions. </para>

              <para>- Sometimes these young men are so opposed to what the Government is doing that they are willing, like John Zarb and Brian Ross, to undergo 2 years gaol rather than even register for what they consider will be an ultimate moral degradation. What other advice could the Leader of the Opposition give to such young men and maintain his moral integrity? Would honourable members opposite prefer him to help them into gaol for long, cold bitter months before it is discovered that they should never have been there at all? Where is our much vaunted sense of national fair play which allows us to accept petty politicians and pretty Ministers like the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hughes)</inline> who preen themselves in the public eye while playing politics with these young men? In my opinion Zarb and Ross have more courage and character than 10 attorneysgeneral like the honourable member for Parkes. </para>

              <para>- It is only relative, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker.</inline> I could say much more. Would honourable members opposite expect the Leader of the Opposition to behave like the Attorney-General? Never in my opinion. Is it not time that Liberals and members of the public asked themselves why it is that intelligent young men nf the highest character are willing to suffer 2 years in the worst places ancient Australia has been able to produce to imprison and torment those who offend it? Cannot the Government, and those who support it, stop for a moment and ask themselves: What can it bc that moves these young men to face such a harsh and harmful penalty? Cannot they understand that someone has to bc willing to advise such young men, when that person has a personal responsibility, as the Leader of the Opposition has, to advise them, on the assumption that they will never be able to carry out the law to the full? That is the basic assumption here. Do Government supporters want the Leader of the Opposition to abdicate his repsonsibility to advise young men who are in this position and cannot be in any other position? Cannot they understand that there are hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of young men who cannot carry out the law to the full, who cannot hive anything to do with military service, with the war in Vietnam or even with the Government that is responsible for it? </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue><para>Which one of us would undergo even a penalty of a few dollars, let alone 2 years in gaol, for anything we believe in? Which one of us would risk even association with an unpopular idea or group of people? Which of us would risk his popularity with the boss or his prospect of promotion or his job, let alone 2 years imprisonment in one of these inhuman piles of stone we call gaols? Unless we can understand the position of these people we have no right to enter judgment upon them. Would it not be reasonable to expect advice from the Leader of the Opposition to this relatively small number of people which is somewhat different from the talk that goes on in conventional cocktail parties? fs it not only called for but, is there not a moral responsibility on him to give it? These young men, and many , thousands more, believe the war in Vietnam is the instrument of death for the people of Vietnam and an instrument of moral degradation for us. I refer to the words of a leading American, Arthur M. Schlesinger, historian and personal confidant of the late John Kennedy. He said: </para><quote>
            <para>All our measures in Vietnam have been sabotaged because the regimes there were, nml are, composed of men who are members of, or allied with, mandarin families that hold title to properties they have no intention of renouncing. . . . They seek to retain their privileges they have, and to regain those they have lost. Their regime is pervaded by nepotism, corruption and cynicism. </para>
          </quote><para class="block">When a leading American sees Vietnam in that way, may there not be some compelling validity in the way some young Australians see it? May they not need advice from the Leader of the Opposition a little different from that one might give to a member of the Young Liberals about to enter Parliament? ls it unreasonable to ignore what these young Australians have decided, when we determine our attitude towards them, when we find Schlesinger in another place writing: </para><quote>
            <para>Our concentration on Vietnam is exacting a frightful cost. In domestic policy, with Vietnam gulping down . more than a billion and a half dollars a month, everything .is grinding to a stop  the Great Society is now, except for a few token gestures, dead. The fight for equal opportunity for the Negro, the war against poverty, the struggle to save the cities, the improvement of our schools - all must be starved for the sake of Vietnam. And war brings ugly side effects ... . inflation; frustration; indignation; protest; panic; angry, divisions within the national' community; premonitions of McCarthyism. </para>
          </quote><para class="block">If this is the view of a leading American, an historian and a personal confidant of John Kennedy, about the war in Vietnam and its effects on America, is it unreasonable to expect that it will, also be the view of some young Australians? Is it any wonder that there will be at least a few who will need the advice from the Leader of the Opposition on the assumption that they cannot carry out the law to the full insofar as it effects this situation described by Schlesinger. And then there was the testimony of Louis B. Lundborg before the American Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on 15th April this year. He said: </para><quote>
            <para>The war has divided, confused and bewildered Americans. </para>
          </quote><para class="block">Has it not divided, confused and bewildered at least one Liberal Party supporter? Lundborg also stated in his evidence: </para><quote>
            <para>As a result of this confusion and bewilderment many people are losing trust iri the institutions, public and private, through which we govern ourselves and run our economy. Such loss of trust is destructive of the cohesion necessary for an economy's ability to function at maximum effectiveness. To the degree banks, industrial firms, corporations, state and local governments, federal government agencies and universities are under attack or suspicion for their alleged part in the war in Vietnam, they lose some of their effectiveness as institutions that can provide for the common good. -  . The revulsion against our posture in Vietnam has been so strong that it has coloured and distorted the attitudes of our people and particularly of our young people. . . . The disillusionment of the young over the whole Vietnam experience has weakened their willingness to follow adult leadership in anything. </para>

The danger of the action of the Prime Minister and his Government is that it is the real threat to liberty in Australia. Patriotism may become again, as Edmund Burke once wrote - </para><quote>

          </quote><para class="block">This accentuated growth of McCarthyism, the flag wavers paying off old scores, is a process described by Mark Twain years ago. He wrote: </para><quote>
            <para>The loud little handful - as usual - will shout for the war - for someone else to go to the war, but nol for them to go to the war - a few fair men on the other side will argue and reason against the war with speech and pen and at first will have a hearing and be applauded, but it will not last long; those others will outshout them- as the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McEwen)</inline> will try to outshout me in a few minutes - and presently the anti-war audiences will thin out and lose popularity. And then the whole nation - pulpit and all - will take up the war cry and shout itself hoarse, and mob and honest man who ventures to open his mouth and presently such mouths will cease to open. lt would be naive and deceptive to say that this cannot happen here. Men are already being imprisoned in Australia really for their political beliefs. Mouths have already ceased to open in Australia. The loud little handful is shouting for the war and people are afraid of being identified with anything even remotely related to peace, much short of being identified with things like the Moratorium. It is not unreasonable to expect that the Leader of the Opposition may be forced by his moral responsibilities to have to give unconventional advice in such a situation. The police state, whenever it comes, requires an apathetic, silent and quiet majority. It needs to be able to persuade people that if law and order is to be maintained they must give up association with anything that is unpopular and unconventional, from peace, through uncensored literature to homosexuality. </para>
          </quote><para>But this is the very opposite to what law and order does require. Law and order comes from the people. It is what they make by their own decisions. If the people are apathetic, silent and quiet, law and order is nothing but the fiat of those in authority for the time being and this Government wants law and order to be the fiat of itself in office for the time being. It wants to have no penetrating or critical discussion about anything that it is doing, lt wants to divert attention to other people and to what others are doing to be protected in its own inefficiency and its own lack of principle. If the people are apathetic, silent and quiet, law and order becomes nothing but authority. One thing has puzzled observers as it puzzled Lord Russell of Liverpool, who write 'The Scourge of the Swastika'. It is how kind and considerate men are able to authorise the bombing and burning of civilians, the extermination of populations, of cities, towns and villages and the detention and torture of people for long periods without trial or who are willing to support, as this Government is willing to support those things. </para><para>We are told that the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General, the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bury)</inline> are kind and considerate men. But in all this what is needed to rid ourselves of silence and apathy and involvement by our silence in immoral policy. We must never turn to violence. Violence is the scourge of humanity. We must seek to advise young men, when they are convinced that they must break the law to end the war in Vietnam or to end conscription, that they must act not by violence but by persuasion, no matter how long it takes. That is what the Leader of the Opposition has done in this case. </para><para>The Leader of the Opposition has tried to advise young men, who find that they cannot carry out the law to which they have a conscientious objection, how best they can do that with least injury to themselves and least disturbance to the community. He has accepted a responsibility that has to be accepted by somebody, because there are hundreds and perhaps thousands of young men in this position. In contrast to that, all the Government wishes to do is to put these young men into gaol and to discover 11 months later that they had a conscientious objection for which they should never have been put there in the first place. It is not us who should be defending ourselves in this position. It is honourable members opposite who should be defending themselves for what they have done. It is their record which is on the conscience of this nation, with their selfrighteousness, their self-sufficiency and their unwillingness to give any credit to a young man who is prepared to undertake 2 years gaol for his conscience - a situation which I do not believe any honourable member opposite is capable of understanding. They emerge with an attack upon a man who was willing, at risk to his political popularity, to stand upon the principle that something must be done to help and advise these young men who happen to be in this position. </para><para>I am not asking for peaceful action, for persuasion and for patience in all these things for the sake of the authorities in Australia, who readily use the most extreme forms of violence in the name of law and order, and who will continue to do so if they think their own position is threatened, believing that the most immoral action is sanctified because it is done by the Government. But I ask for peaceful action because we must eradicate violence from our country and from the world. </para><continue>

            <para>- There were 3 aspects of the speech of the honourable member for Lalor <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr J. F. Cairns)</inline> which rather intrigued me. The first was his appeal to history in order to substantiate his own view of conscience on this matter. It is a view of conscience which, by the way, is not supported by history. It was an appeal to the centuries of governments of the Western type to support his case. I find this a little intriguing because, in another paper that was tabled yesterday, he sought on 2 occasions to debunk that very history which he sought to use in aid of his own case this morning. Let me give an example. In the other paper tabled yesterday the honourable member for Lalor had this to say: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Now we have reached the stage where we are almost at the end of an historical period. Democracy has been government through Parliament, that is the 17th and 18th century feature of democracy, because Parliament is only one form or one way in which you can govern yourself. </para>
          <para class="block">In a further debunking of history and in a further attempt to indicate that the past is to be erased clean, he had this to say: </para>
          <para>We are reaching, ladies and gentlemen, whether we know it or not, a changing stage in history. </para>
          <para class="block">So he appealed to the past. </para>
          <para>The second point which rather intrigued me was the reason for which the Opposition moved this amendment. I believe the moved the amendment because they were terrified. They know that very many of their members have been affronted by what has been stated by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam).</inline> There is a spark of patriotism that runs through many members of the Opposition. They are concerned and they are worried. The Opposition knows that by moving an amendment which amounts to a censure it will at least be able to drag some of its members, who would -otherwise not be willing, to a vote. That is the reason for which the Opposition seeks to move its amendment. The third point which intrigued me was the honourable member's appeal to the principles of law and order and it is his belief that law and order can be substituted for and invoked against the present social order in the community. With this rather Marcusean doctrine that has so much support from the Opposition I will deal in a few moments. </para>
          <para>We see running through this debate an interesting parallel of forces. We see the twin forces of the honourable member for Lalor and the Leader of the Opposition running in the same direction which we know they have been traversing for some time. They are running in the same direction so clearly and so manifestly today. They are twin tracks running to the same destination. Because that destination is so worrisome and because it forbodes so much ill for this country many of us are concerned. In the one case we have the social philosopher, the political practitioner, the organiser of authority outside Parliament - the honourable member for Lalor. In the other case we have the titular head, who is part of the twinning process. As is wont in any analysis of this, let us have a look at the social philosophy which underlay the statement of the Leader of the Opposition. The social philosophy which was enunciated by the honourable member for Lalor yesterday is so monstrous that it should be exposed for itself and for its interpretation. I shall read again from the address which was tabled yesterday and which the honourable member gave during Moratorium week. He had this to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In order to govern yourself, ladies and gentlemen, you have to exercise power wherever power is, and Parliament ls not the only place where there is power. Power also exists in the schools, in universities, in factories, in government departments, in banks and everywhere else . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Two aspects of that statement deserve examination. Firstly, nowhere is it stated that power exists pre-eminently in Parliament. That is not even conceded. Secondly, the honourable member seeks to politicalise every organisational group within the country. He does not even except families. By making universities, schools, business and financial processes agents in the search for power the honourable member will do this country a grave disservice. That is not part of the history to which the honourable member for Lalor appealed. If this happens in universities there will be no academic freedom left. Universities require this freedom in order to examine the community and seek truth. Nowhere in that statement does the honourable member except families as a part of this process of politicalising power at every stage of the community. </para>
          <para>I ask the House to deliberate on those agencies of Government which, within this century, have sought to implement and to find power in every aspect of society. I go back to the statements of Mussolini which are disastrously similar to the application of the philosophy by the honourable member' for Lalor. I go back to a more rigid and harder application of that philosophy as enunciated in the country next door to Mussolini's and a little to the east. That is the logical extension of the social philosophy which hase been enunciated by the honourable member for Lalor. It is the most monstrous thing we could imagine to occur in this country. It is the most monstrous thing to be stated on a public platform. We are concerned about that philosophy and its practitioners here. </para>
          <para>The honourable member is in company. There is always a military aspect to the deliberation of power. That has been provided in this case by none other than the titular head of the honourable member's own Party. He has stated 3 or 4 things concerning the Australian Armed Forces which need to be examined in detail. He has substituted himself as an authority for Army commanders in the field and in Australia. He has done this quite clearly. The titular head of the Australian Labor Party has given frightful advice to young men who are concerned about military service. He has quoted countries overseas in which none of the principles which he has enunciated has been followed. The philosophy which he has enunciated in terms of military responsibility dovetails, complements completely and is a twin to the definition of power as demonstrated by the honourable member for Lalor. Let me illustrate this point. I refer again to the Press conference held by the Leader of the Opposition. I read the relevant parts of the report of that Press conference: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Q, You should give written advice again that if . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That question tails off. The Leader of the Opposition gave this answer: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>That if he was ordered to go to Vietnam he would not obey that order. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The report continues: </para>
          <list type="upperalpha-dotted">
            <item label="Q.">
              <para>Did you go to the point where if he has given that written advice that he won't and it is ignored that he should ignore the order? </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">The answer by the Leader of the Opposition was: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>He should disobey the order. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Another authority has been set up in place of the authority which is reposed on soldiers in the Australian Army. 1 would ask members of this House merely to reflect from history the occasions in which that has occurred and if they would duplicate that kind of history in this country 1 would hope that they would look to the Leader of the Opposition because he obviously shows himself capable of duplicating it. Of course, in addition to that, the Leader of the Opposition is a simple member of Parliament. He is disposed from time to lime to give advice to constituents. He said at another part of the Press conference that this would be part of the advice he would give to constituents. </para>
          <para>I merely want to examine within this context an attitude of cowardice and I want  a-  cowardice qc it applies <inline font-style="italic">In</inline> advice of this type, lt is not said that the advice to young men is to break the National Service Act. It is not said precisely and specifically. What is said is that these young men should place themselves in jeopardy in a military situation. The Leader of the Opposition has quite clearly covered his own tracks. He has used a glib tongue to secure his own position in this respect while he prods and pushes young men to thwart military justice. This is the attitude which he has taken. This comes not merely from a member of Parliament who is not trained in the law, as most of us are not still, but it comes from a sort of Sydney silk. This is the advice he would give to an unwilling and unpaying client. What he has had to say has to be examined in that context. He proposes neither protection nor sound advice for his non-paying clients. All that remains for him to do is to nominate the time and the circumstances for a mutiny in the Australian Army on Australian soil. I would hope that when he speaks later in this debate he will seek to clarify that position. </para>
          <para>The second aspect of what he has done is this: He has substituted his own sense of strategy as a member of Parliament for the strategy of Army commanders and he has referred to 4 countries. He has nominated Israel, Sweden, Switzerland and Singapore. Will he indicate in which of those countries a choice is open to the members of the Army as to which enemy they would fight? In not one of those countries is that opportunity nominated. Perhaps Sweden is not the best example to compare with Australia for many reasons, but can a member of the Swedish Army say: 'I will not fight the Russians' - the reason for which it exists? Is it open to them to nominate such an exception? Can a member of the Israeli Army nominate the enemy against whom he will or will not fight? Can a member of the Singaporean Army have the same liberty? Does a member of the Swiss Army nominate the enemy against whom he would or would not light? This principle is not utilised anywhere, and I regard as most monstrous the proposition that the Leader of the Opposition has perpetrated here today. </para>
          <para>Of course it is said this might be mutiny or it might not be mutiny; it might or might be an incitement to mutiny. I have always been intrigued by the wriggling which the Leader of the Opposition can undertake. 1 can only see that there is always an origin for his attitudes. 1 recollect that a few months ago the Leader of the Australian Labor Party in Victoria, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crawford,</inline> had something to say about mutiny within the Australian Army. The only difference was that there was a locality difference between that mutiny and that which was enunciated by the Leader of the Opposition. We know now that the Leader of the Opposition, having exploited the contradictions in his own Party and having used the honourable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron)</inline> to do it - he may regret it some day - is a clear lineal descendant of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crawford,</inline> formerly of the Victorian Labor Party. There is clearly little difference in their attitudes. I challenge htm to apply the principles differently or to make distinctions between them. The points are there. It is up to the Leader of the Opposition to enunciate them. </para>
          <para>We return to the honourable member for Lalor. We return to the social philosopher who knows what he is doing about politics and we refer to his titular head. I often think of these two, the honourable member for Lalor and the Leader of his own Party, in the position of another social philosophy used to political power and a titular head. I would put the honourable member for Lalor and the Leader of the Opposition in the same category as Lenin and Keoreinsky. Who will eventually run the show? Who does not know what is going on behind him? Who does not know the revolution that is being organised behind him in his own Party? Who is exercising the real power? I remind the Leader of the Opposition, since he has moved so far to the left, even of the honourable member for Lalor, to reflect what happened to that former Prime Minister- -that  titular head of his own country, lt .may be .his own fate also. </para>
          <para>But we go a little further. We have seen that a philosophy has been enunciated. The organisation of power within that philosophy has been made clear by the honourable member for Lalor. The military aspects of that philosophy have been made clear by the Leader of the Opposition. We can only say that so many on the front bench through Marcuse give substance to that philosophy. The Leader of the Opposition has now given military teeth to its application. Those of us who are concerned with this country and its position in the world have to take note of what is happening. If this is all right, let them say so. But this philosophy and its application rest upon a political base that comprises some interesting personalities. We have seen the union of that philosophy, its application and its leadership with respect to the recent Moratorium. There we saw the same principle carried through again - a philosophy worked on by the honourAustralia in every State - not excepting organisation being developed by him and the Leader of the Opposition participating in both processes. </para>

              <para>-That is perfectly correct. The Vietcong flag is involved in this. The episode of the Vietcong flag is merely a manifestation of the process that has been occurring. A platform that has been erected, and the end result of which we see here today, has been developing for some time. It has depended on 3 supports. This has been enunciated before and we challenge the Leader of the Opposition to deny this, lt is dependent upon the support, as is demonstrated through the recent Moratorium, of the Communist Party of Australia in every State - not excepting any. It is dependent upon their union and their working towards the same end and at the same time working with the peace movement in Australia. It is dependent at the highest level on the support of the Leader of the Australian Labor Party also. He has helped to erect this platform. He has on occasion stood on that platform. That substantiates, supports and acts as a substratum to all that has been enunciated here today. </para>

          <para>I hope he will answer some of these points because they indeed need to be answered and many people in this country are so concerned at what they would lead to. He might say: 'I do not know anything about this. I am completely ignorant of these things. I seek to deny it or I seek to ignore it." He can exploit contradictions. Sometimes they can be exploited for one's own purpose. Other men have been able to exploit contradictions and even state contradictions. I recollect that very famous leader who at the time he was doing to death between 25 million and 30 million people was able to say: 'Nothing is so sacred to the ruler of a nation than the lives of its citizens.' The contradictions can be there. They can be there with respect to Stalin and they can be applied in a much less significant way. but nevertheless significant for Australia, with respect to the leaders on the front bench of the Opposition. </para>
          <para>I said that I would refer to one point in the speech of the honourable member for Lalor with respect to law and order. I find his application of the Marcusean doctrine, which has so many devotees on the front bench of the Opposition, rather intriguing. Having reflected on what the honourable member said with respect to law and order, let me indicate what is said by some of their idols. Herbert Marcuse in his book 'An Essay on Liberation', said concerning the effect of ideas and social organisations in the community: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>These may first be ideological (like the ideas of liberty, equality, fraternity advanced by the revolutionary bourgeoisie), but the ideology can become a material political force in the armour of the opposition . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">A political machine having been fashioned outside this House which would seek to take power to itself through every sector of society has its application in this passage on social order: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In this situation, law and order becomes something to be established as against the established law and order: The existing society has become illegitimate, unlawful: It has invalidated its own law. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I invite honourable members, if they are devotees of social philosophers, to try to find the difference in terms of thinking between the honourable member for Lalor, the honourable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> and others and the expression of that doctrine through such a discredited gentleman. Here we find it. </para>
          <para>There are many other matters to which 1 would like to refer but I leave one or two points for the Leader of the Opposition to answer. I ask him: Does he agree now with the honourable member for Capricornia <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Everingham)</inline> and the honourable member for Oxley that association with people such as has occurred in the Moratorium is now open for members of the </para>
          <para class="block">Australian Labor Party? Does he approve of this social philosophy and its action in undermining his own Party? Does he approve of its application in this place and outside this place? Is he proud of the fact that he is the only leader of an Australian Opposition who has ever actually called for a mutinous situation to be developed within the Australian Army? Even the great opponents of conscription in the First World War never called for that. Finally I suggest that if one is to refer back to his tory one would find that Lenin the protagonist and Kerensky the man with the aparent power formed a more realistic example of the current situation than one would even dare to imagine. </para>

            <para>- I will not rake very long to reply to the speech which has just been delivered by the honourable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kevin Cairns).</inline> I merely want to take him up on one point. The honourable member mentioned the word 'cowardice*. This is strange coming from a man who ran out on his mates when they were helping him to pull down the signs of his electoral opponents. 1 think it is a word that the honourable member would do well to leave out of his vocabulary. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The debate today arises from the tabling of a transcript of a Press conference held by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> on Wednesday last at which he outlined the advice he would give to a conscientious objector to the Vietnam war. I stress that my Leader at no stage has indicated that he would encourage a conscientious objector to resist the draft. In fact, he would advise such persons to accept all their responsibilities - to register, to undergo medical examination, to report for service and to undertake their training. It is only when there is a likelihood that the objector will be sent to serve in Vietnam that a stand is to be taken. The advice which would be given when this stage was reached would be for the national serviceman then to take his stand on a matter of conscience that has been upheld by religious authorities within Australia and throughout the world. </para>
          <para>The Government and the Army would be notified in writing well before this situation had developed. They would be advised that this action would be taken. If the Confrontation is to take place the Government and the Army will be the people who do the confronting. My Leader's advice has been deliberately and poisonously misconstrued and misinterpreted. But after a few years experience in this House dealing with members of the Government one learns to accept that no trick is too low and no lie is too great if there is some political advantage to be gained. During this debate it has already been implied, and it will be implied, that members of the Opposition are guilty of treachery, treason, sedition and subversion. We will be. labelled as Communist stooges and traitors. But our records as loyal Australians will match or surpass the records of any member of the Government. </para>
          <para>The man who is most under attack today is my Leader. For the benefit of the House and the nation I take the opportunity to give a brief history of him and his family. He is the son of an ex-Crown Solicitor of the Commonwealth of Australia who was also Australia's representative on the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations.  His  wife is the daughter of a late Justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales who was also the Vice-Chairman of the Commonwealth Immigration Advisory Council. <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Whitlam,</inline> who is known to roost of us in this House as a charming, distinguished and friendly woman is herself a diplomate in social studies from the University of Sydney.  His  sister is the principal of a leading Sydney girls school.  His  eldest son is a graduate of the Australian National University.  His  second son is a graduate of Harvard and London.  His  third son will be graduating from the University of Sydney this year.  His  daughter, who is still at school, has the distinction of attending the same school as the daughters of the Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> and the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hughes).</inline> I do not know who is going to be corrupted. </para>
          <para>The Leader of the Opposition is a Queen's Counsel. As a law student he was an associate of two Justices of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, one of whom has since been appointed to the High Court. He has acted as junior counsel to a royal commisison. Does this sound like a man who could be guilty of undermining law and order or of encouraging mutiny? As we are discussing service in the Armed Forces, let me continue by informing the House that during his university days he was a volunteer member of the University Regiment. Unlike some present and past members of this House his military career was not spoilt by the advent of war. He volunteered for service with the Royal Australian Air Force "during the 1939-45 War and served for 4 years as an air crew member. At the conclusion of his service he was one of the personal air crew of the representative of the Australian Chief of Staff at General MacArthur's Headquarters. This was a trusted position indeed. Besides his family life and his public life in Australia, the Leader of the Opposition has also been personally acquainted with more heads of state and heads of government in our region, and indeed the world, than any other member of this Parliament and by his conduct, integrity and capacity he enjoys their confidence. </para>
          <para>The Leader of the Opposition has served his nation with honour in peace and war. He has enjoyed the confidence of his fellow men in every sphere in which he has worked. His reputation, his family and his personal conduct is above reproach, but that does not prevent the members of the Government from stooping to this vile attack upon his loyalty to Australia. But whatever is or has been said there are few if »-ny of the Government members who can face the world with a clearer conscience or steadier eye. He or his family have never been involved in diplomatic incidents or murky court cases. Our Leader has earned the confidence of his Party and the people of Australia, and this cheap political trick today will leave his reputation unsullied. The cause of today's debate was the introduction of conscription in Australia. The cause of most of the troubles in Australia at the moment in relation to defence and law and order is the fact that conscription was introduced in 1964. The Government is now reaping the effects of a political action that was taken in 1964. </para>
          <para>There has been dissatisfaction in Australia ever since conscription was introduced. It was recognised then as being unnecessary, that it was being introduced for political reasons and as an easy way to acquire sufficient numbers for the Army. The Opposition maintained in 1964 that conscription whs unnecessary and it maintains that today. Our hostility has strengthened because our young conscripts are being sent to fight in the undeclared war in Vietnam. I have always claimed that the introduction of conscription in 1964 was a political decision and contrary to military advice. Let us go back to August 1964 when the Minister for the Army, now the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Forbes),</inline> made his first comprehensive statement in this House on national service training. After giving all the reasons why it was uneconomical and inefficient to introduce national service training the Minister said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We have not introduced it because to do so would be against the unanimous advice of our military advisers. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">On 26th October in the same year the same Minister went to the National Congress of the Returned Services League held in Hobart and to those ex-servicemen the Minister said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I could perhaps say. however, that we have not introduced conscription up to this point in time because our military advisers have indicated in the clearest and most  unmistakeable  terms that it is not the most effective way of creating the Army we need to meet the situation we face. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> stress that this is military advice. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Despite these very firm and forthright statements against the introduction of national service on 10th November 1964 the then Prime Minister made a defence statement in the House and announced the decision to introduce selective compulsory service. The reason given for the introduction of national service was the confrontation of Malaysia by Indonesia. The Prime Minister said:   lt is very much to be feared that if Indonesia provoked <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> war, the only people in Indonesia who would get advantage from it would be the Communists, ever ready to thrive on disorder and defeat </para>
          <para class="block">The old Communist bogey again, lt is raised on every occasion the Government is in trouble and when a Senate election is pending. The Government has disorder and defeat in Australia now and this is caused by conscription. By not facing up to the will of the people the Government is sowing the seeds for the Communists to increase their strength in Australia. Conscription for overseas service in peace time is morally wrong and should be abolished. This is why the Opposition has moved an amendment to this motion today. But conscription is also inefficient and unfair as has recently been stated by the report of  iiic r  President's Commission  oil an  All-Vo- lunteer Armed Force - a report commissioned by the  President  of the United States of America and presented in February this year. The finding of the Commission was: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We unanimously believe that the nation's interests will be better served by an all-volunteer force, supported by an effective stand-by draft, than by a mixed force of volunteers and conscripts; that steps should be taken promptly to move in this direction; and that the first indispensable step is to remove the present inequity in the pay ot men serving their first term in the armed forces. </para>
            <para>We have satisfied ourselves that a volunteer force will not jeopardise national security, and we believe it will have a beneficial effect on the military as well as the rest of our society. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Commission was made up of 15 members. Its chairman was Thomas Gates  -  a former Secretary of Defense. The members of that Commission came from a wide range of community activities in the United States and they unanimously decided that a volunteer force would be better than a drafted force. This report must be regarded as an informed, impartial and independent report. Some of the arguments advanced for the finding are that conscription is unfair and expects only a certain class in the community to make the sacrifice. In a chapter headed 'Conscription is a Tax' it is said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Any government has essentially 2 ways of accomplishing an objective whether it be building an interstate highway system or raising an army. It can expropriate the required tools and compel construction mcn and others to work until the job is finished or it can purchase the goods and manpower necessary to complete the job. Under tha first alternative, only the persons who own the property seized or who render compulsory service are required to bear the expense of building the highway or housing project. They pay a tax to finance the project, albeit a ta.x-in-kind. Under the second alternative, the cost of the necessary goods and services is borne by the general public through taxes raised to finance the project. Conscription is like the first alternative - a taxinkind. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Later in the same chapter the report states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">When the hidden costs of conscription are fully recognised, the cost of an all-volunteer armed force is unquestionably less than the cost of a force of equal size and quality manned wholly or partly through conscription. The all-volunteer costs are lower for four reasons. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The four reasons are then listed Further on in the report there is mention of Australia's system of selective compulsory training and I will again quote from the report. I am quoting from the report because I feel that having been commissioned by the  President  of the United States of America it is well worth study by members of the Government. If the Government wants to cut out the demonstrations and curtail the activities of those people who thrive on disorder it should listen to the voice in this House of the representatives of the people and also to the organisations outside. Members of the Labor Opposition are not the only people who are telling the Government that conscription is unjust and unnecessary. The -churches are telling the Government these things as are other organisations throughout the community but the Government has become so complacent that it will not listen. Perhaps it will listen to the report from which I am quoting. Dealing with Australia the report states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Some have cited the Australian decision to return to a draft as evidence that an all-volunteer force is not feasible for the United States. There are several reasons why this argument by analogy is inappropriate. First, the Australians have not made a concerted effort to attract additional recruits on a voluntary basis. Once the decision was made to use conscription to raise force levels, no serious effort was made to increase voluntary enlistments either by raising pay or redoubling recruiting efforts. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>It goes on to say: </para>
          <quote>

          <para>Later on in the report, again dealing with our lottery system of selective compulsory training, it says: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The lottery draft recently adopted is at best an expedient. It is important to recognise that the tax inequity implicit in the draft is not eliminated by substituting a lottery for present methods of selection. In theory the lottery makes it equally probable that any individual might be selected from those eligible to serve. It thus aims at equity In selection, but equity in selection is not equity in service.  Thse  few who are selected to serve, whether at random or otherwise, still pay a large tax-in-kind in order to reduce taxes for the majority. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The Labor Opposition says that if the Government cared to make an attempt to recruit volunteer forces, to serve in Vietnam if necessary, it would be able to do it. I have quoted extracts from speeches made in this House and elsewhere by the former Minister for the Army, now the Minister for Health. In 1964, a matter of 10 or 12 days before conscription was announced by the then Prime Minister, the Minister was travelling around the country saying that the introduction of national service training was against the unanimous advice of the Government's military advisers. The Government has to admit that its introduction was a political decision. The Government has got into difficulty with it. The war in Vietnam is curtailing the recruitment of young men into our Regular forces because of the fact that the Army is made up of volunteers and conscripts. Opportunities by way of pay and conditions are not available to assist recruiting. These are some of the things that the Government should look at. </para>
          <para>Ali members of the Opposition are called upon frequently to give advice or assistance to young men who have been called up, are about to be called up or are about to register for national service training. I tell them to take the risk, to register, to have their medical examination and to undertake their training. The Leader of the Opposition has said that he goes that far and then says: 'If they are going to send you to Vietnam, make your stand on a matter df conscience against a particular war.' The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> spoke about the rights of conscientious objectors, but a person has to be a conscientious objector to all wars, not only to the particular undeclared war in Vietnam. Conscription in Australia has been causing anxiety and discontent ever since it was introduced. The troubles it has created are the responsibility of the Government and until conscription is abolished these troubles will continue and, indeed increase. </para>
          <para>This debate arose over the question of conscription. After what I have said, after what has been said by the honourable member for Lalor <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr J. F. Cairns)</inline> and after what will be said by the 2 speakers to follow rae I think it will be clear that there is great feeling in the Australian community against conscription and against conscripts being used in the Vietnam war. The policy of the Labor Party allows for conscription in time of emergency, so members of the Opposition are not against conscription. 1 speak as a man who was a conscript in the 1939-45 war. I had to take my 2 cut lunches at the behest of the Government of the day to the Belmore drill hall on 29th December 1941. I went as a conscript and finally became a volunteer, so I have no objection to conscription. Most of the men behind me have no objection to conscription when Australia is in dire need, but while members opposite are playing politics with the lives of our young fellows in Vietnam in an undeclared war we are against conscription. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Speaker,</inline>for the sake of those members of the House who were not here this morning and for the sake of those who may be listening to this debate, I think it might be as well for me to give a resume of the sequence of events that has occurred and that has led up to this debate. It will be remembered that, in the House yesterday, questions were asked firstly in relation to photographs taken at the Moratorium demonstration last Friday outside Parliament House. A considerable amount of debate followed and points of order were taken in relation to the answer given by the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> and in relation to other matters. Then, a further question was asked, this time of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton),</inline> concerning a statement made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> to a Press conference about matters which were supposed to have occurred at a meeting of the Labor Party Caucus. From those events has come the debate of today. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I heard today and yesterday questions as to whether people are telling the truth, the importance of the truth and the need to protect honourable members against untruth. The debate yesterday culminated with questions as to whether the Leader of the Opposition had appeared at and addressed the Moratorium meeting here last Friday at which were Vietcong flags.' If one studies the Hansard report of yesterday's proceedings one finds that what the Leader of the Opposition said was that the Vietcong flags were not there, or that he did not see them, or that he did not know they were there and that they must have been to the back of him if they were there. </para>
          <para>I can say only this - and I will say it as I put my hand on the Bible I have here in case I am accused of being a liar in an endeavour to dispute what I am saying: At approximately 10 minutes past 10 last Friday morning, I moved out down the front steps of this House. The Leader of the Opposition was standing in the centre of the median strip surrounded by the panting Press waiting for the march to arrive. On the right of him were 2 young people who, I presume, were students with a flag of red and pale blue with a gold star in the centre - the flag of the Vietcong. As I crossed the road, the Leader of the Opposition turned about and moved into the House. </para>
          <para class="block">In the centre of the road, 1 said to him: What is the matter, Gough? Are you embarrassed by being beside Vietcong flags?' He replied to me: 'No. Were they there? I did not see them.' I accept that statement without a doubt. But to say that he did not know they were there is a very different matter. He also stated that he had to go into the House because of question time and that, when the march arrived, he would be out to address those gathered. </para>
          <para>Furthermore, I state that, in front of his nose, at a distance of between 12 feet and 20 feet, at approximately i o'clock on that day, was a young lady, with blonde hair, a red sweater and blue jeans with an unfurled Vietcong flag. This is unimportant. But if we are to talk about truth, let us stick to the truth. I do not think this is important, i do not blame the Leader ot the Opposition. He is not responsible. But do not let us have crocodile tears about truth one minute and not the next. </para>
          <para>But the issue is not that. The issue, if we look at the speeches of this morning from the Opposition, has not even been touched. The Prime Minister stated that the statement that the Leader of the Opposition gave to a Press conference of what I presume was discussed in confidence in the Caucus of the Labor Party has implications for Australia and for the Australian nation. He said that the statement has greater implications because it was mads by the alternative Prime Minister of this country and that must give it major importance. Let me take issue with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Frank</inline> Chamberlain and various other members of the Press who say that this is only a political scuffle, that it is of no important and that question time should not be used for such matters. In my opinion there is no more important issue confronting this Parliament and this country because it is a question of the future of government, the future of authority and the future standing  of  a  government in Australia, whether  it be Liberal, Labor or anything else, which has been elected by democratic processes. </para>
          <para>We now have the alternative Prime Minister of this country lending his weight and standing to the honourable member for Lalor <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr J. F. Cairns)</inline> and those others who have been preaching the right to break the law when the law does not suit one's convenience. The honourable member for Lalor made an impassioned speech on his stand and outlook. I do not think that anyone here was confused or did not understand clearly beforehand his stand and outlook. We have no doubt, I think the people of Australia have no doubt and I am sure the Opposition has no doubt where he stands in political spectrum. However he is not the Leader of the Opposition, much to his regret. He is only a shadow Minister. But when the alternative Prime Minister of this country makes statements of this kind it is a very different thing. </para>
          <para>Then we heard from the honourable member for Lang <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Stewart).</inline> I have the deepest sympathy for him because I have never seen a man who appeared to be more uncomfortable than he was. We are not attacking the reputation of the Leader of the Opposition in respect of his service to the country in war. We are not attacking his father. We are not attacking his father-in-law. We share a high regard and respect for his wife. We are not interested in what schools his children attend and with whom they go. That was nothing more than a red herring to take the minds of the people and of the members of this Parliament off the matter that we are discussing. We are not even discussing conscription. As the honourable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kevin Cairns)</inline> has said, the amendment moved by the Opposition has allowed those honest Labor men who are uncomfortable to come in now and vote for it whereas otherwise they would have had to vote in support of their leader. 1 believe that the honourable member for Grayndler <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Daly)</inline> will follow me in the debate. Always in these debates the tactics adopted by the Opposition are obvious. You put in the comic. You put in the man with the warm feeling towards the Leader of the Opposition, his loyal supporter, the man who never whispers in the Library, the man who never leaks what happens in Caucus. I think that the Leader of the Opposition could well do some research into who has put him in this position. He is in this position because someone leaked from the Labor Party Caucus. I regret, and I am sure he regrets, that he did not make statements on what happened in Caucus. </para>

              <para>- The interjections are not worrying me, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> because 1 think that they show the discomfort of honourable members opposite. Let me go back to what I was saying. If someone had not leaked the story from caucus the Leader of the Opposition would not have had to make a Press statement and he would not have been in this position. No doubt the honourable member for Grayndler will call people Nazis and Fascists, as he did previously. He always calls those, who seem to have served this country against Nazism and Fascism, Nazis and Fascists, but I will leave it to him to explain his own record. No doubt he will refer to certain women's fashion magazines, which will get a light laugh throughout the House. But it still does not lessen the importance of the present situation. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Let me review the situation. I have a friend who returned from Indonesia only a few days ago. He was in Djakarta during the Moratorium demonstration in Australia. In the Indonesian newspapers were photographs of the riots, Vietcong flags and the various members who participated in that affair. He said to me: 'I gained the impression in Indonesia that there had been Molotov cocktails, a revolution, and that this whole country was in riot.' This is the impression that is created. This is the intent of certain people - not all of them by any means - who wish to bring about such demonstrations and effectively use the photographs as propaganda overseas. But let us look at it not as a question as to who wins the Senate election or who is important in this House, whether he be Labor or Liberal, but as it affects Australia. Indeed, let us look at what impetus it could give to the enemies of this country and to the enemies of those with whom we stand in other countries. Let us look at what the effect could be on our own troops in Vietnam and on the 99.8 per cent of Australian youth who answer the call and who have brought to the Australian Army one of the proudest records it has ever held. One never hears honourable members opposite refer to these matters. According to the Opposition, it is the .02 per cent of youth who are our national heroes. This also appears to be the opinion of many members of the Press of this country. </para>
          <para>But what is the situation? Our enemies now can say that the alternative Prime Minister of Australia has come out and given this advice to those in the Army and to those who, if they had had a genuine conscientious objection, would have been excused by the court from serving, or who, if they had had a conscientious objection solely to serving in Vietnam, could have enlisted in the Citizen Military Forces. But because they wish to make martyrs of themselves, because they wish to bc cast in this light, the Leader of the Opposition says to them: 'Carry out your registration and put in a written report that you will not serve if sent to Vietnam. When you have had your medical examination, put in another written report. But if you are inducted into the Army and the order is given by your battalion commander to move at 0900 hours, you stand fast and refuse to obey that order.' </para>
          <para>I think that there arc many views on conscription. I think there is a confused situation, but that is not what we are discussing. We are discussing the future situation in this country in relation to law and order. 1 know that my friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Maccallum,</inline> who is one who seems to write so favourably about law and order, has written an article this morning about the Leader of the Opposition. The article is headed: 'Whitlam was only waiting to be asked'. What a pity he has not waited to be asked for anything else before. But the article contains the following statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam:</inline></para>
          <para>If you put it under headlines saying 'Gorton </para>
          <para class="block">Says Mutiny' it will have a bad effect, but if you see it in the context of Gorton going on about riot and violence and disorder and anarchy, it will rebound on the Government . . . </para>
          <para class="block">I presume that is his instruction. That is his plea to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr MacCallum</inline> and others. All I would suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr MacCallum</inline> is that when he puts his next article in the paper as well as showing his beard the drawing should go down to his navel and show the Vietnam Moratorium badge which he so clearly wears in this House because it is indeed a matter, I think, of great concern to the people of Australia. </para>
          <para>This morning we heard a question relating to students from Cambodia but not a thing has appeared in the Press. Nobody was aware that they were here but if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dick</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gregory</inline> or somebody else came out here with his guitar he would he given a good press coverage and he would appear on 'Four Corners' and 'This Day Tonight*. Lel us not be under any misapprehension. As one famous American general said in respect to Vietnam 'The North Vietnamese have the most powerful propaganda machine in the world but it does not cost them a cent' because indeed certain sections only of the publicity media, and now the Opposition, and now even further the Leader of the Opposition, appear to be carrying out perhaps unwittingly what they most seek to gain and that is the ineffectiveness of our defence forces, the lack of morale of our people and the complete lying down of our will to resist. </para>
          <para>In conclusion I want to deal with another Press conference given by the Leader of the Opposition. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> do not think today has been his day. The Leader of the Opposition gave a Press conference on the Macquarie radio network again supporting law and order and again encouraging the young men in Vietnam who serve this country. I think the text of that interview should be read by all in Australia because it is indicative of how this man's ego and desire for aggrandisement and position has allowed his sense of values to be completely lost and how, in his desire to gain office, he has, I think, lost what standing and what outlook he ever had. If I had a wife, if I had children and if I were all that the honourable member for Lang had said I would indeed wonder when I looked at myself in the mirror. In regard to police in New South Wales the Leader Opposition had this to say. 1 quote only sections of the interview but the meaning will be seen by all. He said: </para>

I do hope he enjoys them. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> certainly has a weird collection of supporters. Let us look at the honourable member for La Trobe. He criticised statements made in regard to the army service of a man convicted of murder following national service. The man who made those statements was a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. Does the honourable member say the judge should be hauled before a royal commission simply because he differs with a fanatic like the honourable member for La Trobe? Of course he should not. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Let us look at it another way. When I look at the honourable member for La Trobe I would be inclined to take a bit of notice of him but for the fact that I read about him in the newspapers now and again. Let me read the following article in the 'Australian' of 22nd April 1970: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Liberal Party was not inspiring young people in Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr R.</inline> Winnel, a 22-year-old party branch  president,  said yesterday. </para>
            <para>People like Jess <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr J. D. Jess, the Victorian MHR)</inline> can rave on about the red bogey, but young people will not swallow it,' said <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Winnel.</inline></para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">And neither will the older people. Let us hear what the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> thinks of the honourable member for La Trobe. He is quoted as saying this in the 'Australian' on 6th January 1970: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jess</inline>sees himself as a knight in shining armour doing his bit, but not being able to substantiate any allegations. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">When you look at it that is a wise statement from that intelligent Minister for the Navy. After all, who are we to take notice of the men who know him or those of us who put up with his ravings here? The men who know him understand him. Let us hear him on all those protesters and all these things. In the 'Herald' on 20th June 1968 the following article appears: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Protesters 'not wanted in the Army.' </para>
            <para>A man should not have been forced into the Army when he had no intention of obeying orders, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jess,</inline> MHR, said today. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Let us put it in round figures. The honourable member spent too much trouble looking at the lovely redhead out the front the other day to pay due attention to a debate of this nature. </para>
          <para>Let us look at the other weird supporter of the Government on this motion. Shortly before the election of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> to that office the honourable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kevin Cairns)</inline> said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Not even in the lowly position of. Deputy Whip will I serve under this Prime Minister. I have no confidence in bim. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Today who is supporting the Prime Minister? It is the greatest fanatic in the nation - the person who would not serve under him in the office of Deputy Whip. </para>
          <para>The Leader of the Opposition should treat the motion with the contempt it deserves. What has he done? He has given advice to people who are now being conscripted under this Government for a war in which this nation should never have been engaged. He has given a lead to young men who are expected to die in the paddy fields of Vietnam in a war that this Government put on for dollars instead of for the salvation of Australia. The real reason why we are in Vietnam is that we are all the way with LBJ. The Government wanted trade and commerce and all these things, and men are dying there for them. Boys are being conscripted at a time when the Government knows our security is not in  danger and when Americans walk past them in thousands on their way home leaving Australians to die and fight their battle. Good luck to the Leader of the Opposition for giving advice on this question. As honourable members opposite know, it is sound advice. They know also that the CMF offers no solution to the problem of service in Vietnam. Men who go into it are liable for service there. There is no law to say they will not. So that type of argument cannot be put up. </para>
          <para>Anyone would think that members ot the Labor Party were the only ones who had anything to say about law and order and obeying the law of the country. I am pleased that the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McCwen)</inline> is in the chamber because he was here during the time of the great white father. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies - the founder of the Liberal Party;the man who brought most of the honourable member's opposite into this Parliament. But now he has gone and they will very shortly follow him. This is what the Leader of the Opposition, as <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies then was, had to say when speaking on the Banking Bill on 23rd October 1947: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It. therefore, becomes the duly of  His  Majesty's Opposition, and every member of it, not merely to oppose this measure in Parliament with all the force of the arguments at their command, but also to exhaust every effort to rouse the people outside the Parliament to a tremendous defence of their own liberties and rights. If this means, as of course it does mean, a division of the people at a time like this, and in the circumstances which will give rise to bitterness and weaken the national effort, the sin will rest grievously upon the heads of Ministers and nobody else. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Those words outline this Government's responsibility today in regard to Vietnam. The Government has divided the nation. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies in 1947 stimulated the whole country, as we all know, on the banking Bills. He was joined by members of the Country Party. On every corner, on every doorstep, people were rising against certain legislation, irrespective of the law or the will of the people as expressed by their elected representatives. Let us now examine the views of the Country Party. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Earle</inline> Page, founder of the Country Party, when speaking on the Banking Bill, was reported in the 'Daily Telegraph' on 30th October 1947 as saying: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Bank Bill was the most immoral product . . . We shall fight this Communistic ramp against individual freedom by every means in our power - political, legal, constitutional and physical. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block" pgwide="yes">These were the words of the then Leader of the Country Party. He was endeavouring to rouse the people outside the Parliament. In days gone by they took it a step further; they formed their own army in the New Guard. If the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> was not a member of it, at least he was sympathetic with it. So it can be seen that this is the back- groundtothethinkingofthesepeople. </para>
          <para>Let us have a look at the Government that says it will maintain law and order and which criticises the Leader of the Opposition for this judgment. The other day the honourable member for Prospect <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Klugman)</inline> asked a question in this Parliament. He wanted to know what members of the Ministry had complied with the law by stating the amount they had spent in their election campaigns, as is required by the provisions of the Electoral Act. Failure to comply with the law is subject to penalty. We find that 9 members of the Ministry have not complied with that provision of the Act. Included amongst those 9 is the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hughes),</inline> the man who is now putting men into gaol at this stage. Even he has not complied with the law. We find also that the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden),</inline> who rounds people up like cattle to put them into gaol, has not complied with the law. Other members of the Ministry who have not fulfilled this requirement are the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hulme),</inline> the Minister for Education and Science <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr N. H. Bowen),</inline> the Minister for External Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barnes),</inline> the Minister for Social Services, the Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Holten)</inline> and the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Peacock)</inline> - a collection of law breakers impressing law and order on the community. Did honourable members ever hear anything worse? Now, because the Government is in disarray, it is hammering at the Opposition on this issue. </para>
          <para>Let us look at this old story of the Liberal Party in relation to flags. It is guilt by association. Honourable members will remember that a few years ago if a soldier marched on Anzac Day with a Communist alongside him the Liberals would designate him a Communist. I attended the Moratorium demonstration in front of this House the other day. I was interested to see how many members of the Liberal Party, their staffs and supporters turned up. Amongst other things, I was interested also in the success of the Moratorium. I have here a photograph of the Leader of the Opposition. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> apparently speaking to one of my colleagues. I. also see a rather good picture of myself standing on the other side of the road, but I was a long way from where <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> was standing. This is the photograph that the honourable member for La Trobe produced. As I stood there someone passed carrying a flag, which I was told was the Vietcong flag. I decided to follow to see who was carrying the Vietcong flag. I was surprised to see that he was an intelligent, well dressed, nice, smart type of chap. So I said to someone standing near me: 'Who would that be?' He said: 'He is a well known member of the Liberal Party. He is so excited and enthusiastic about it that he got carried away. But we hope he will not do himself any harm although it might help to damage the Party.' These are the people who tell us that everybody associated with it today is affiliated with the Labor Party or something else. </para>
          <para>Do honourable members opposite mean to say that if that flag had been raised in Civic Centre the Leader of the Opposition should have gone somewhere else? Of course, he should not. I have another picture here with all kinds of people in h. Here is one of the Leader of the Opposition speaking outside Parliament House - these are the pictures that the Government says it will use - and right in the front row is a gentleman wearing a clerical collar. Do they suggest that he is a Communist, an undercover person or anything of that nature? Does the honourable member for La Trobe think so? </para>

              <para>- I do not know who he is, but he looks like one of my faith and he looks a very intelligent type. If we pick out some other pictures taken at the front of Parliament House what do we see? The absurdity of the Government's allegation is shown by the fact that in these pictures which were taken - quite wrongly by the News and Information Bureau for political purposes - we find the personal assistant to the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr W.</inline> Arthur, shown with demonstrators carrying placards saying: 'Abolish conscription'; 'Withdraw all troops now'; 'Withdraw support for the Saigon regime'. In another picture the honourable member for Deakin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jarman)</inline> is shown with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Arthur</inline> in the same group of demonstrators. If the Vietcong flag had been carried past them at a given lime, under the Government's regulations they ought to be doing time because they are Vietcong spies or something to that effect. This is the old story of guilt by association again. I have here a picture of the Leader of the Opposition with the secretary to one of the most prominent Government members. I know that the Vietcong flag passed by him as he stood there. Is the Minister going to sack him? If Labor men are guilty because a flag happens to be in the same city as they are, why should the Liberal Party escape its responsibilities in this matter? </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I say to the honourable member for La Trobe that this kind of proof is stupidity of the highest calibre. If men are to be condemned for this type of thing, the sooner we get rid of security police and the Government that tolerates this conduct at demonstrations, the better it will be for democracy in this country. The Liberals have a lot to say about Labor Party associations and they produce photographs. Let me produce one or two others for their benefit. I saw the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> on television the other night. I have here a copy of the Canberra Times' of 8th November 1967 which shows a picture of the Soviet Ambassador to Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr N.</inline> Tarakamov, and the charming Minister for Defence with their glasses tilted, full of vodka or rich red wine, toasting the 50th anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution. The article says: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline>was among guests who attended a lunchtime reception at the Russian Embassy yesterday. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">There they were, toasting the revolution: Good luck to the future. Away with the slaves to the salt mines of Siberia.' Over a vodka or a rich red wine all differences between Liberalism and Communism were buried. If the people who were 100 or 200 yards from the Leader of the Opposition contaminated him with the Vietcong flag, it is time for the internment camp for the Minister for Defence. So let us have no more of this rot about guilt by association. </para>
          <para>Let us go into a few other things. We do not hear any more about the occasion when a Soviet diplomat addressed the Woden Valley Branch of the Liberal Party. What did that make members of that branch? What would have happened if he had gone to a Labor Branch? Would we not have seen the successor to W. C. Wentworth - in repose here at the present time - in uproar? Of course  we  would. These are the things they do. Let us have a look at the Country Party. I wonder whether, when the honourable member for Moore <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Maisey)</inline> signed the wheat agreement in Peking, the hammer and sickle was hauled down. Or did he sit under it and enjoy what was going to come to the Country Party? When the  Deputy  Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McEwen)</inline> sat in the Kremlin in Moscow recently and talked glibly about the future of trade with that country, did he sit under the red flag or did it become respectable? Surely he would not sit under a red flag. I know he was looking for Communist gold but at the same time is it not disreputable to have a read flag flying over his head - a hammer and sickle? When the Government's representatives sit in Peking now to negotiate agreements are they contaminated when the red flag goes up? Of course they are not, because the Country Party does not care what it does as long as it trades. Principles go overboard as long as these things can happen to their Party and to those around them. So let us have no more of this humbug of guilt by association. We cannot help who walks around with any kind of flag. To say that some people are allied with a particular philosophy because they are seen at a demonstration at which some type of flag is being carried is probably just as silly as saying that the red flag should be pulled down in the Kremlin and other places. These things do not happen. </para>
          <para>The argument that has been brought forward by honourable members opposite will not hold water. This debate has been forced on the Government by some fanatics who realise that there is no substance in the charges that have been made. 1 ask honourable members opposite who are constantly accusing the Labor Party of being allied with Communism and the Vietcong why it is that this Government trades with all these people. If the Vietcong flag is such a shameful thing - and honourable members opposite think it is - why does the Government sell wheat to China which in many cases, as honourable members opposite know, is going to the Vietcong? Why does the member for Rhodesia tolerate it? Why do we not hear the honourable member for La Trobe in a violent, fanatical outburst condemning these things if they are se wrOn:? It is because he knows that a lot of the wheat that Australia sells to China is going to feed the Vietcong and others. </para>
          <para>But principles do not matter when Government supporters are attacking the Labor Parry and its Leader. The present Leader of the Opposition is no different from those who have gone before him. Until the day he died <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chifley</inline> was called a Communist in this Parliament by some members opposite. The only time anything good is said about a Labor Party Leader is when he is dead. That is when the Press tells the nation what a wonderful leader it has lost. It is no different today. We on this side of the House know that this motion has been brought up in order that honourable members opposite may attempt to destroy a person whom they know will be the next Prime Minister of this country. It is the fact that this is imminent that is making them so desperate today. They realise at long last, even on issues like this, that if members of the Government do not hang together they will hang separately. That is beyond doubt and that is the reason this is happening today. </para>
          <para>I would like the Minister for Trade to tell us whether he thinks he should continue to go to Russia and other Communist countries when his Party reacts so violently to those people in the community who support a cause with which he does not agree politically? Does he think he should continue to sign trade agreements with the Soviet bloc when his Party holds this point of view? We on this side think <inline font-style="italic">we</inline> should trade with everybody, but on the other side of the Parliament members condemn the people with whom they trade and condemn us on this side by implying that we are allied with those people. At the same time they seek to get all the monetary rewards they possibly can. I mention these matters in order that the honourable member for La Trobe may learn well that greater men than he in this Parliament have made accusations about the affiliations of other honourable members and later have had to apologise. He goes very close to that from time to time. lt has been said that the Leader of the Opposition is inciting mutiny. Of course be is not. Anyhow, if he were, what would this Government do about it? Men at Garden Island and members of the Royal Australian Air Force mutinied recently, but nobody has been hanged from the yardarm. There is no substance in the charge made by honourable members opposite, and they know it. I do not wish to say more on this issue at this stage. I believe the Government stands condemned for its guilt by association conduct and for its taking of photographs which have been brought into this Parliament by fanatics in order to bolster up a dying administration. I hope that the Leader of the Opposition and other members on this side of the Parliament will speak again against the most infamous war of our time, that is, the war in Vietnam. If the Leader of the Opposition saves only 1 life by his actions, he will have made a magnificent contribution to the welfare of this country. We on this side of the Parliament stand firmly behind him in his campaign to end conscription and to make sure that boys will not be dragged from their homes to fight for a cause which has no connection with this country. I hope that when honourable members opposite are again taking photographs they will be certain to photograph also some of the boys who are coming back from the Vietnam war and will remember those who do not come back. The Government is responsible for the disunity that exists in the community because of the Vietnam war, from which our troops should be withdrawn immediately. 1 commend the Leader of the Opposition on the attitude he has taken. I hope we will have no more motions of this kind. They are of no credit to the Government. </para>

            <para>- Order! The honourable member for Deakin will resume his seat. I think he has explained about how he claims misrepresentation by the honourable member for Grayndler. I suggest that in continuing his remarks the honourable member is debating the subject before the Chair. </para>

              <para>-The honourable member for Sydney is saying something now. If the honourable member for Deakin used the remarks referred to by the honourable member for Reid, he used them after I called him to order to point out that J thought he had explained his alleged misrepresentation by the honourable member for Grayndler. The honourable member for Deakin explained why he happened to be at a particular place. That was his personal explanation in connection with the misrepresentation.  1  think he is now going into a debate on the issue. I suggest that he has explained his position and  1  also suggest that if he did use the remarks that were referred to by the honourable member for Reid he should withdraw them. </para>

The opinion of honourable members as to why that discussion was being held is a matter for those honourable members. Therefore it is not unparliamentary for a member to  make  a statement as to the circumstances relating to a discussion or meeting outside the House.

That is a matter of debate. It is an opinion held by the honourable member for Deakin, so I say that there is no valid point of order and that matters that have been raised by honourable members are matters of debate and not matters to be raised as points of order or as claims of misrepresentation. </para>

            <para>- You are very gracious, sir. Thank you very much. The honourable member for Deakin <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jarman),</inline> in making a personal explanation, drew conclusions about the crowd and the aims of the group outside Parliament House and then associated the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> with those aims. If he had said that the Leader of the Opposition was to give advice that would have been OK, but he reflected upon the Leader of the Opposition by saying he was giving advice to a group that wanted a Communist victory in Vietnam. If that is what the honourable member for Deakin thinks, he has no right to associate the Leader of the Opposition with that group in the way in which be did. He did reflect upon the character of the Leader of the Opposition and, in my view, your ruling is not correct. That is the reason why I have moved dissent from your ruling, and other honourable members of the Parliament agree with me. </para>

              <para>- There is a study of logic possible, surely, lt is surely logical to deduce that when persons parade a particular flag they do so for the time honoured reason that they owe some allegiance or support to the purposes of the flag. If they were persons, as I saw myself, carrying the Vietcong flag any sane person can deduce that there were those present who sought a Vietcong victory. </para>

          <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> I proceed to get the debate back to the matter before the House. The state- ment which we are debating is the verbatim report of a Press conference which the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> voluntarily held and which eventually was tabled in the House. It is upon the content of that report that this debate turns. The incident, as 1 understand it from the Leader of the Opposition, arose from the fact that he was offering certain advice to the Labor Caucus; that subsequently he learned that a rumour, which was incorrect, was around the place, and he called a Press conference and proceeded to state publicly to the Press what he had been saying to the Labor Caucus. So the fact that we are in possession of the report is in fact an accident. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The Leader of the Opposition had set out to speak, as one does speak, secretly in the Party room, but now what he said is a public matter. As the Leader of the Labor Party he was putting the view to the Caucus that the advice to be given to young men who objected to the Vietnam war was that they should disobey and defy military authority, put in the mildest terms, that they should break the law. Applying this as he did in one sense to hundreds of men and in another to thousands of men, an advice to break the military law is advice to mutiny. There is no doubt about that. That is the policy line that the Leader of the Opposition advocated, that young men who say that they hold a conscientious belief in respect of the Vietnam war, should be advised to break the law. We know that the law provides for the man who claims that he has a general conscientious belief against war. If this course, as advocated, is accepted by the Labor Party as policy - and the debate here today makes it clear beyond doubt to my mind that this course has been accepted as the policy of the Labor Party - then in the future every member of the Labor Party will follow it. the land is, you should set out to break it.' This totals up a complete picture of the attitude to law and order of today's Labor leaders and today's Labor Party. This is the constant thread running right through Labor Party's attitude all the time. Labor says: 'If you do not like the law - whether it is civil or military - break it.' This Labor Party is the alternative government of Australia. If it were to become the government, the logic of its present position is that even if it, in government, made laws, it would allow people to break them if they so desired. That is the pure, undeniable logic of it, and it is completely ludicrous for Labor- </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- The point 1 was making in respect to the. attitude adopted by these 2 leaders of the Labor Party is that they are not really offering this advice in good faith because the situation would be intolerable if the advice were accepted generally. If they were in Government they would not tolerate people breaking the law, either civil or military law. ft is immediately apparent that the advice which the honourable member is giving and which the Labor Party is following discloses that there is not a real attitude of integrity on their part. The Leader of the Opposition has taken the most important area of all - the laws passed by the Parliament relating to the defence and security of the country. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>In the words of the Leader of the Opposition the advice given is to disobey military orders in the circumstances that he and I have enumerated. Without an adequate defence force, a reliable defence force, Australia could not fulfil a treaty obligation. This is perfectly true and undeniable. Who would sign or maintain a treaty of mutual defence with a nation that did not enforce its own military laws? Yet that is the proposition that the Leader of the Opposition put to the Labor Caucus whose members would compose the alternate government and which is advocated in this place where the parliamentary Labor Party decides its policies. We should all be very clear on just what it is that the Leader of the Opposition who aspires to be the Prime Minister is proposing. He himself says that he is advising young men to defy and to disobey the military law. That is a lawyer's way of putting it The plain fact is that he was inciting young national servicemen to mutiny. He spoke ot there being thousands of. young men holding this view and this is the advice which apparently privately and certainly now publicly he is offering to them: If you are called up go into the Army and after you are in the Army then disobey the military law.' In the simplest of terms this is mutiny. That is the only way that one who is not a lawyer can regard it and I myself, as a layman, regard it is an act of treachery to this country. The honourable member for Lalor has been a main proponent - I do not want to do an injustice to him but it seems to me that civil disobedience is a moderate term for what he is proposing. We had thought that he was the leader of the doctrine of defiance of authority but now we discover that, the Leader of the Opposition has left him a mile behind. The honourable member for Lalor has never been so reckless and so irresponsible as to offer and publicly advocate the advice that the Leader of the Opposition is now giving. I suppose one could go through the history books and discover many instances of individuals who have advocated anarchy or mutiny or treason, but I would say that this surely must be the first time in history when, in a democratic country, the leader of a party which regards itself as close to being in a position to form a Government elected by democratic process has advocated a course of disobedience of and disregard for the law. lt is quite unprecedented. </para>
        <para>The Australian people have a long history of supporting and accepting the laws made by the democratically elected Government of the country. The laws have not always been easy or pleasant laws for many of the people to accept but the Australian community has shown a responsibility towards the maintenance of the rule of law over the last 100 years, a record of respect for laws democratically arrived at I would say there is no better record to be found in the world than the record we have. I am sure the Australian public will not have a bar of a political leader or a political party which has shown contempt for the law and the due processes of democratic government and has openly preached law breaking. As a lawyer and a parliamentarian the Leader of the Opposition knows that there is an alternative for the young man who is not a conscientious objector to all wars but has an objection to fighting in Vietnam. The option is to join the Citizen Military Forces. This is provided for. Many have taken advantage of it. </para>
        <para>I put this quite simply and earnestly. The Leader of the Opposition is in his private capacity a professional man whose profession enables him to be turned to for advice. I say that if a young man came to this lawyer and said:  '1  come to you professionally. I am in trouble. I am troubled by a law. I am liable to be called up for service and I may have to go to Vietnam. I do not want to go to Vietnam. Will you please give me your professional advice on whether  1  can avoid it', the Leader of the Opposition, with a knowledge of the law, would be bound to say: 'You have no problem. You join the CMF - the law provides for it'. He could not honestly in his professional capacity give any other advice. But in his other capacity as a political leader he says there is no alternative to defying the law. I say that this has exposed the Leader of the Opposition as a man who in his political capacity is not acting in good faith when he urges his political party to embrace this policy of defiance of military law and propound it and convey it to all the young men who are troubled by the Vietnam war. The only possible conclusion is that he has in bad faith ignored the alternatives available to the young men. </para>
        <para>Apart from the ethical aspects which are involved, this raises a very important question. Why did the Leader of the Opposition choose to ignore the legal alternative to service in Vietnam and, as a lawyer, a Queen's Counsel, an officer of the courts, give advice to young men to break the law? Why did he take a similar position to the expelled  president  of the Victorian Labor Party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crawford</inline> who, not sitting in his Labor capacity, I understand, but addressing a meeting of unions, persuaded those unions to pass a resolution that the troops in Vietnam should mutiny. There is a shade of difference between mutiny in the field and mutiny by refusing to go into the field. It is a fine shade of difference. As far as I can see the Leader of the Opposition is ahead of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crawford,</inline> the former Labor  President  in Victoria. I cannot understand now why he was so hellbent on expelling him from the Party. </para>
        <para>What were the motives of the Leader of the Opposition in giving advice to young men when he knew that their problem could be solved without one man going to gaol. On one occasion he said hundreds and on another occasion thousands of men who are called up do not want to serve in Vietnam. So his advice would result in hundreds or thousands of young men going to gaol, because this is the penalty for defying the military authority. The only possible explanation for his giving this advice is that he is planning to use these young men to cause political embarrassment to the Government. He is advocating that hundreds of young men should go to gaol to their shame. This would be a blemish on their record forever but it would be a political gain to the Labor Party, or perhaps I should say a political gain to the Leader of the Opposition. He would give a young man advice that would inevitably lead him to prison and cause him to have a stigma for the rest of his life. He would have a dishonourable discharge from the armed forces. This would be a liability for him to carry forever when he seeks employment. He would be a man with a record of military imprisonment, a record of defiance of authority, and his personal and private life would be thrown into disorder. The Leader of the Opposition is knowingly condemning these young men for the rest of their lives so that he may gain political advantage. It is embarrassing to the Government to have one man in gaol because he takes this stand. It would be superb, it would be perfect, from the point of view of the Labor Party if the Leader of the Opposition could put hundreds of men into gaol and blame the Government for it. Perhaps he would become Prime Minister through the sufferings of these men and through blemishing their characters for the rest of their lives. </para>
        <para>This is a disgraceful incident. It is a disgraceful motive. There is only one possible answer and that is that this Parliament should show that it will not condone this conduct by lawmakers in advocating law breaking. I hope this debate will make clear to the Australian people the perfidy of the motive behind this advice. This gentleman, who legitimately seeks to be Prime Minister - it is a proper ambition for him to lead his party into office - should never have turned to such a contemptible device  as  to steer hundreds of young men towards imprisonment so that the Government may be embarrassed and he may have political advancement. </para>

          <para>- The first time I contested an election as  Deputy  Leader of my Party the Liberal Party and the Australian Country Party were in the same position of electoral jeopardy as they are now and the same state of tension existed between them as exists now. At that time the Leader of the Country Party, the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McEwen),</inline> took an attitude which was regarded as statesmanlike. He said that he would never sink to branding any leader of the Australian Labor Party as unpatriotic. It suited him to say that at that time. It gave him a reputation for statesmanship. He had every hope that, as the Liberals were going out, he would become even more important politically in this country than he was at the time. It is sad to see the deterioration in this man in the intervening 9 years. This has been a last round-up for the right honourable gentleman. He is no longer taken seriously in this Parliament.  His  style and his material are dated in the extreme. He is no longer taken seriously by any British government. He is no longer taken seriously by any government of the Common Market countries in the European Economic Community or by its Council of Ministers. He is no longer taken seriously in the United States of America. The Tariff Board no longer takes any notice of him. There is no economist of any standing in this country who will endorse his attitudes and his policies. </para>

            <para>- The Deputy Prime Minister, however one may describe him, a man who will hold that position only for a few more months, a man who will be leader of his Party for only a few more months. He has resorted to all that exaggeration and misrepresentation which used to serve in this Parliament but which no longer does. The fact is that when there is a Labor government, as there will be after the next House of Representatives election, there will not only be law and order in this country but there will be justice as well. It is not a contempt for law and order that we are debating. We are debating a contemptible law. The way to change and unjust and unconscionable law in this country is to change the Government. We cannot do that until there is an election for the House of Representatives. Everybody on the other side is doing his best to avoid such an election. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue><para>What, however, is the interim position for the victims of an unjust, unconscionable law? At what stage does the crisis of conscience come for them? That is the matter we were discussing in my parliamentary Party last Wednesday and which, because of a garbled version circulating in the Press lobbies, I corrected at a Press conference later that night. I suppose I am one of the few leaders in this Parliament who is able to give a Press conference at that hour of the night. It is all very well for the  Deputy  Prime Minister to refer to respect for law and order. I presume he supported the Cabinet decision for an amendment to the national service Jaw. The Cabinet decision was announced by the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> but the hawks in the Government parties overruled that Cabinet decision in that respect. </para><para>How strictly does the Government enforce this unconscionable, contemptible law at this stage? A free pardon is given to people like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Zarb</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ross</inline> when the law becomes too uncomfortable for the Government to enforce. There are  2,400  or more men under investigation for suspected breaches of the National Service Act at this moment. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> would not come into this debate today. He is not frightened of the effect on the armed forces of anything I have said. He said on television yesterday that  50  people are awaiting prosecution for breaches of the National Service Act. We all know that for political reasons the Government has not ventured to prosecute all those who are conscientiously opposed to the war in Vietnam. </para><para>If we had won a majority of the seats in this House last October - under any other electoral system in the world we would have done so - this law would have been amended to provide in those cases where there was a need for conscription that at least there would be, as every church in this country has advised, exemption for those with a conscientious objection to a particular war. But not only that. There would be no conscripts by now in the Australian Army; there would be no persons in gaol or awaiting prosecution for breaches of the National Service Act; and Australian troops would no longer be aiding and abetting the slaughter and destruction of Vietnam. Even under this electoral system we would have had a majority of seats in this House if votes had been available to men and women of  18, 19  and  20  years of age - a reform in relation to the introduction of which members on the other side have so long stalled. </para><para>I point out that I have represented more persons of conscript age than any other man in this Parliament. Up to the last election I represented a quarter of a million people. I represented the youngest population of any electorate in Australia. Many men came to me as individuals or with their parents to seek my advice on this question. Was I to say: 'I am not interested in your case'? Of course one goes through the details of the Citizen Military Forces and deferment and exemption. But then the crisis comes. What if a man is conscientiously opposed to this unconscionable war in Vietnam? I have said to such men that they should comply with the law for as long as far as their consciences will permit. It is not easy advice to give them. The Prime Minister, of course, says it is stupid because if they take this advice and if the Army ventures to punish them for it they are sent to places like Holsworthy in my electorate. I know the rigours of the treatment they get there. This is the toughest treatment that one could get in Australia. It is not a civilian prison. It is not easy advice to give to men. The fact is, however, that the Army in these cases, having fair warning of the strength and conscience of these people, by an extraordinary coincidence never sends them to Vietnam. They stay in Australia or they go to Malaysia. </para><para>Let me talk about the future of the Army. I represent, and have for years represented, a greater number of serving officers and men than any honourable member in this Parliament. I know what they want to have this Parliament to do and an Australian government to do if we are to have a volunteer Army as we have a volunteer Air Force and a volunteer Navy. They are frustrated at the complexities of the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund. They are incensed at the dalay in upgrading pay and allowances for servicemen. They are outraged when every supporter of the Liberal and Country Parties votes against the establishment of a parliamentary committee to investigate their pay and allowances. They are incensed at the fact that the war service homes administration is still bedevilled by restrictions which were imposed in 1951 and tightened in 1961  -  restrictions which prevent a serving man from getting a second war service homes advance despite the fact that last year the Division made a profit of $22im. They are incensed at the constant moving from one base to another and the consequent disruption to their children's education. They want a decent opportunity for their children. I see these men, their wives and their children. I know their problems. Hansard will demonstrate that I have shown as consistent an interest in the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund, war service homes, pay and allowances, training for ex-soldiers and educational opportunities for their children as any man who has served in this Parliament. </para><para>I know the problems of young men and the problems of their parents and sweethearts under the National Service Act as it is administered. I know the problems and the frustrations of those who serve in the armed forces. No man in this place has had to represent more men affected by national service; no man has had the privilege of representing more men serving in the armed forces. I have been to Vietnam on 3 occasions. Half of the soldiers who have served in Vietnam have been stationed in my electorate. I personally know half the colonels who have commanded the battalions which have served in Vietnam. I know the consequences of the advice I give but I will not turn the other cheek when men and their parents seek my advice as to how their consciences can be affected by this monstrous law. This law is not all on the statute book. Most of it is administrative. It is not even in the rules and regulations of this Parliament. It can be introduced, amended Or repealed by ministerial fiat, by a mere instruction in writing. </para><para>There is one very clear way in which we can test the credibility of this Government. Much was made of the incident of the Vietcong flag. This is something which is depicted in black and white and where we can see how truthful ministers are. It is a trivial incident. Will anyone really say that a person should immediately leave a meeting if someone hauls out a Vietcong flag? I have spoken at a fair number of these meetings in condemnation of the theory that there can be victory for any side in Vietnam - North, South, Vietcong or Thieu Government. I have always pointed out that the continuing sufferers all the time under this policy by which we are just abetting a prolongation, perpetuation and intensification are the people of the North and the South - Saigon and Vietcong alike. They are the sufferers. We are just haunted by this mirage of victory. There can be no victory for either side. I condemn the notion that there can be or should be victory for the Vietcong just as I have exposed the fallacy of the idea that there can be victory for Saigon - a regime which has had more outside military assistance, men, material and money than any government in history, and which says that it still cannot even maintain its urban enclaves without a continuation of such assistance. </para><para>We can tell the credibility of this Government. We are not dealing with notions; we are dealing with facts as shown by these photographs. I know that for the rest of my life there will be hundreds of thousands of my fellow citizens who will believe that I spoke under a Vietcong flag, who will forget the fact that I served for some years under the Australian flag but will always believe that I was supporting the Vietcong. This is all the Prime Minister wanted to achieve. Look at what he says outside the House. He said nothing about mutiny or speaking under the flags today when he could be answered, but let me quote from what he said to the Liberal Convention in the Sydney Town Hall on Saturday last. He said: </para><quote>
          <para class="block">It is all very well for the Leader of the Opposition to make soothing noises as to what is going on, but just yesterday we saw him speaking to a crowd - an orderly crowd - but a crowd that had Vietcong flags flying above them, and above his head as he spoke to them. </para>
        </quote><para class="block">The fact is that there is no photograph which shows any Vietcong flag fluttering over me. In fact, it took me quite some time yesterday to get copies of the photographs which the Australian News and Information Bureau took. They took almost 60 such photographs which it produced. At last, last night I obtained them. In the meantime a version of the only photograph which had me with the Vietcong flag anywhere within the block had been circulated by the Prime Minister's Press Secretary. The photograph tabled by the honourable member for La Trobe <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jess)</inline> was a trimmed version of the original. The ANIB photograph showed the full lines of trees in the background and the full picture of the Administration Building in the background. It gave a sense of perspective. It showed that the Vietcong flag was on the other side of the road from me. I notice the 'Courier Mail' today says: </para><quote>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jess</inline>tabled a photograph showing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> talking under a Vietcong flag. </para>
        </quote><para class="block">In fact, I was not talking under any such thing. I was walking on the other side of the road. </para><para>Similarly, it is interesting for honourable members to see how photographs can be trimmed. I have here the 'Courier Mail', the 'Australian', the 'Canberra Times', the Sun-Pictorial' of Melbourne and the Telegraph' of Sydney and all of them have trimmed the photographs differently. The fact is that the ANIB photograph which the Prime Minister's Press Secretary cir- culated yesteray - and I am quoting the Canberra Times' - had itself been trimmed to destroy the perspective. There was another photograph taken with the same people in it - me and the other people there - very clearly showing the lines on the road between us. Quite apart from this I was able to secure 9 photographs from the 'Canberra Times' of which 2 showed a Vietcong flag on the steps of Parliament House. I got 8 photographs from the 'Australian' and none showed the Vietcong flag. I have not been able to secure photographs from the Melbourne 'Herald'. It took 41. I am informed by authoritative persons there that none of them showed a Vietcong flag. But here a body, the ANIB - an official agency - takes more photographs than any 3 Australian newspapers. </para><para>What is the purpose of the ANIB taking photographs of a meeting outside Parliament House? We know that there were policemen there filming the whole of the proceedings and, presumably, taping the whole of the proceedings. It was a completely orderly gathering. Even the Prime Minister said that and he will drop words such as riot, violence, disorder, anarchy, mutiny, inciting to breaches of law and order on the least provocation. He says it was orderly. It must have been orderly if he could not detect any disorder in it. So is police action required? The Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon),</inline> does not even know where his office was last May at the time of the last demonstration. I need devote no more time to him. </para><para>There was one other political leader who I gather, made a statement about me. I am quoting the ABC news. He is a man of the same age as the Deputy Prime Minister. He is a man who, if he had any similar sense of public duty, would be retiring similarly. </para><continue>

Would honourable members ever have imagined <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies stooping to get Dorothy Dix questions put up to him? Of course the Prime Minister showed his real spleen here. Last week he was attacking the Premier of South Australia and the former Chief Justice, the present Governor of Queensland. He used about me the same term that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Askin</inline> put up to him to use which he used against the other man whom <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Askin</inline> has urged him to treat as the great 'bogy man of the Labor movement - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke.</inline> A month ago he referred to him as 'that individual': Today I was 'this individual'. This is the way this right honourable gentleman, when he is at his very peak just after question time, describes everybody who happens to displease him. If there is anybody whom he dislikes more than a Liberal Premier it is the Labor Premier of South Australia. The Prime Minister cannot answer criticism. He cannot face up to issues. It is quite clear that at the coming Senate elections, particularly if 18, 19 or 20 year olds are allowed to vote, there will be an overwhelming endorsement of our attitude on conscription for Vietnam. </para><continue>

          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline>the Bill which I now introduce seeks to give effect to the Government's intention to increase the licence fees for radiocommunication stations. In order to give effect to the proposed fee structure it is necessary to define clearly in the regulations the types of stations which require a licence and to amend the present station definitions to accord with modern concepts. </para>
          <para>There are 5 basic categories of stations - land, mobile, fixed, amateur and receiving. Land stations are the key, or base stations for mobile stations which are usually installed in aircraft, ships or motor vehicles. Fixed stations are those established for communication between fixed points. Amateur stations are those stations operated by hobbyists, sometimes referred to as 'radio hams'. Receiving stations arc those land and fixed stations not licensed to providetransmitting capabilities. The types of licences to be issued are set out in the schedule to the regulations. They all fall within one of the broad categories approved. There has been no change in the level of the licence fee since it was set at $2 in 1924. Until about 1950, however, the disparity between costs and revenues was not large enough to cause concern since stations were few in number and in any case were provided primarily as  a  means of emergency communication. Since 1950, however, the situation has changed very rapidly and the number of licences issued has risen from 5,115 to a present day total of 136,000 by increasingly large annual increments. This growth has added greatly to the costs of administration and technical supervision. </para>
          <para>A comparison of these costs with licence fee revenues reveals that there has been a persistent deterioration which has led to the. present annual deficit of $0.8m. It is proposed, therefore, that the fees for licences be adjusted to a more appropriate level which will return an extra $460,000  in 1970-71 and $620,000 in a full year. These new fees do not seek to recover costs associated with Commonwealth Government services and certain services deserving of special consideration because of the community interests involved. </para>
          <para>For land and fixed stations the fee will be $10. For those stations with capacity to receive but not to transmit, and for mobile and amateur stations, the fee will be $6. The different fee levels reflect the variation in administrative and technical effort involved. The existing fee of $2, however, is to continue to apply in respect of stations operating as outpost services. In the outback areas of the Commonwealth there are 5,000 such stations which provide services associated with Schools of the Air or the Flying Doctor and aerial ambulances or are providing the only means of public communication and as such are required to handle telegraph traffic. Australian outback missions come within this group. </para>
          <para>It is also considered that as the regulations apply in Papua and New Guinea, missions in that Territory should obtain similar treatment and be licensed for the present fee of $2. There are approximately 500 such stations. Ambulance services which are not included as outpost stations and rural fire brigades will also continue to be licensed for the present fee of $2.It is also proposed that stations which are established to provide speech connection to the public telephone system both in Australia and Papua and New Guinea will be licensed free of charge because the operators are required to pay the appropriate telephone tariffs. This will be achieved by the issue of special licences already provided for in theregulations and which may be issued without charge. </para>
          <para>It is proposed that the new fees will operate from 1st November 1970. I commend the Bill to honourable members. </para>

          <para>That the  Bill  be now read a second time. </para>
          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to provide temporary assistance to local manufacturers currently producing bountiable tractors additional to the normal assistance provided by the Agricultural Tractors Bounty Act 1966. The decision to introduce amending legislation was taken after an urgent review by the Government of the. Australian tractor manufacturing industry during which evidence was received from the two registered manufacturers - Chamberlain Industries Pty Ltd of Western Australia and International Harvester Co. of Australia in Victoria - that the industry was facing serious damage from import competition. Since the Special Advisory Authority is not empowered to recommend on variations in bounty assistance, it was not appropriate for the problem to be referred to him for consideration. The assistance now proposed will be additional to and at rates equal to those now paid on production under the present Act. The assistance will only be paid in respect of bountiable tractors produced at premises registered under the Agricultural Tractors Bounty Act 1966 as at 1st July 1970. The amendment extends the bounty to 30th June 1972 subject to earlier termination by proclamation if appropriate. It is estimated that this additional assistance will cost the Government $ 1.25m to the end of the 1970-71 financial year, an amount which it is considered will sustain the industry in the current situation. The Government will review the situation before the 1971-72 Budget to determine the effect of this additional assistance and if necessary adjust the rate of payment. In addition, the Tariff Board will be asked to report on the question of longer term assistance to the industry. Without this further assistance it is possible that the country could lose an important industry involving a large capital outlay and directly employing some 1,400 persons, many of whom are highly skilled. Some reduction in the normal labour force has already occurred. I commend the Bill to honourable members. [Debate, (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Stewart)</inline> adjourned.] </para>

No statistics are available of total enrolments at all levels in these institutions. The latest available data as supplied by the various' colleges indicates a preliminary total 44^56 students enrolled in tertiary level courses at Colleges of Advanced Education in 1970. This figure is, in the main, consistent with that given in answer to the previous question (Hansard, 16th September 1969 page 1425) and relates in general to total enrolments in courses which attract a Commonwealth grant- under advanced education arrangements; these courses include those approved, in full or in part, as at tertiary level binder the States Grants (Advanced Education) Acts.

            <para>-  The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: ". It is not realistic to attempt to estimate the cost of providing pre-school education over the whole of Australia on the basis described by the honourable member. There are basic differences between the Australian Capita] Territory and other areas in many of the factors which affect costs in the provision of pre-school education, such as the geographic spread of the pre-school aged population, the size of the pre-school centres which would be required, costs of acquisition and development of sites for centres, building costs, attendance patterns and salary levels. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Estimates based on applying figures appropriate under one set of conditions to. areas where conditions differ so substantially could not help but be misleading. </para>

Overall,  I  have provided answers to  125  questions on notice to date and  of  these,  107  were answers to questions asked by the honourable member.

To the Post Office it means that fewer operators are required, less exchange equipment and buildings need to be provided and trunk docketing and accounting costs are reduced.

          <para>On the other band factors of our own have an obvious effect on our industrial relationships and the incidence of strikes. One is the almost ideological disputation about the so-called penal sections of the Act. Although it is an industrial subject, it is also a political one and it is very difficult to divorce the industrial from the political content. Whether, in the ultimate, the question of statutory sanctions should be regarded as a political rather than an industrial relations question takes a lot of deciding for each person concerned, but in the events which have occurred in my area, it has been handled politically, and those who have thus bandied it would certainly have had regard to the industrial consequences of any political solution. Nevertheless whilst the matter was being bandied politically, an application came . before a single member of the Commission, which I directed should be dealt withbyafullbench.Thedecisionofthis  full  bench followed a normalhearing and was reached on the submissions made in the Court room and not outside it The good thing about all this was that the Commission demonstrated it could go ahead with its procedures in the normal way without any suggestion of it or any of its members becoming involved in party politics, even though feeling was running hot in - the political area. I have given a great deal of thought to whether or not I should, pursuant to section 70, give any indication of what I think the policy of the legislation should be in regard to sanctions. I have come to the conclusion particularly having regard to what I have mentioned, that, unless invited, I should at least on this occasion leave this entirely to the Parliament, without expressing opinions one way or the other'. </para>

Some subjects are of such a nature as to be more appropriate for the adoption of a Recommendation rather than a Convention. The Australian Government and a number of others considered that the adoption of a Recommendation would be the appropriate way of dealing with the subject of discrimination in employment and occupation and, therefore, abstained in the voting on the adoption of Convention No.111 - Discrimination (Employment and Occupation), 1958. After the Convention had been adopted, the Australian Government delegates voted for the adoption of the Recommendation to which the honourable member has referred. This Recommendation supplements the Convention by indicating possible ways in which the general principles set down in the Convention might be applied in legislation, collective agreements, etc. I can inform the honourable member that the general principles set down in the Convention relating to discrimination on the basis of sex, are substantially complied with as regards Commonwealth employees. </para>

          <para>To facilitate the payment of 1969 compensation to the industry, the Australian Apple and Pear Board maintained a special bank account to receive funds made available to it by the Department of Primary Industry.

            <para>Section 76 of the National Health Act 1953-69 required each registered health benefits organisation to furnish its annual returns to the Director-General of Health within 3 months after the expiration of the organisation's accounting year or within such further time as the Director-General, on the application of the organisation, allowed. Organisations did not have a common accounting year. While most organisations operated on an accounting year ending on 30th June,  a  sizeable minority had a different basis. </para>
            <para>Under the National Health Act 1953-70, commencing with the year ending 30th June 1971, all registered organisations must adopt a common financial year ending 30th June so that all annual returns, unless an extension of time is granted, will be submitted by 1st October. From these returns the Director-General will prepare the statutory report required by section 76 (1) of the Act. It is anticipated that this report will be laid before both Houses of Parliament during the subsequent autumn session. These will be the final figures in respect of each registered organisation, but it should be possible to supply reliable preliminary information during December of each year to any honourable member who wishes to have it. </para>

Against this however should be offsetthe contribution of $180 towards passage costs made by each migrant of 19 years and over (credited to Revenue, Department of. Immigration - Miscellaneous). On the pattern of age groups in the total arrivals during 1969-70, 49 per cent of persons travelling under these schemes would have made the $180 contribution, i.e. an average of $88 per person moved. This would reduce the average cost per person to $243. Calculatedon the basis of 143 movements, the net cost for returning Australians paid for in 1969-70 would be approximately $35,000. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>There are no Army activities which specifically require a knowledge of agricultural science and it is unlikely that a member with this particular civilian qualification could be employed in an area related directly to his talents. </para>
            <para>The Army endeavours to utilise to the full the skills and qualifications of national servicemen. It is not to be expected however that the Army requirements for particular skills will necessarily match the normal community distribution of these skills as represented in the national service call up. </para>
            <para>Accordingly, when the number of national servicemen holding these qualifications is in excess of the number required for military purposes, members not allocated to those employments are given training in other military fields where a need for their service does exist. </para>
            <para>The Government is aware that the careers of national servicemen may be disrupted by the two year obligation and has provided a range of reestablishment benefits designed to offset some of the disadvantage occasioned by their call up. These include post-discharge vocational training on a full or part-time basis, where it is necessary or desirable for their resettlement </para>
