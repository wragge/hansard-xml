    <para class="block">Wednesday, 10 April 1963  1 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. SPEAKER (Hon. Sir John McLeay)</inline> took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. </para>
    <para class="block">ROYAL VISIT FILMS. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. STEWART.</inline>- I address a question without notice to the Minister for the Interior. Was an official film taken of the very impressive parade of the Queen&#39;s Colours at Manuka Oval during the visit of  Her  Majesty? If so, will the Minister consider making available to motion picture theatres and television stations suitable extracts from the film for use during the playing of the National Anthem so that  Her  Majesty may be depicted reviewing our own Australian troops? </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. FREETH.-</inline>The honorable member has made an excellent suggestion. There was a fairly complete film coverage of all functions during the royal visit. I do not know exactly what film was taken on the occasion referred to by the honorable member, but I shall certainly look into the matter to see whether his suggestion may be adopted. </para>
    <para class="block">TERM LENDING FUND. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HOWSON.</inline>- My question, which I address to the Treasurer, relates to the term lending fund which was created last year, partly from funds held by the Reserve Bank of Australia as part of the statutory reserve deposits of the trading banks. Has this fund achieved the objects for which it was created? Has it in particular helped to provide long-term export credit, and has the Treasurer now received a request from the banks concerned with the fund to enlarge it? If so, will the Treasurer consider enlarging the fund? </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HAROLD</inline>HOLT.- I think it is fair to say that the fund has been achieving the purposes that we had in mind for it when it was established. The fund was designed to enable the banks to provide longer term credit for various development purposes, including the financing of export credits and the provision of assistance to industries and rural producers. My understanding of the position is that calls on the fund have proved to be of such dimension that, taking commitments into account, the fund as originally constituted may not prove adequate for any considerable time ahead. Consequently, talks are now in progress between the Governor of the Reserve Bank and representatives of the trading banks with a view to ensuring that adequate funds will be available. When I am in a position to state more precisely the outcome of those talks I will be glad to do so. </para>
    <para>AUSTRALIAN COUNTRY PARTY. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CALWELL.</inline>- I direct a question to the Postmaster-General and acting leader of the Australian Country Party. Does the view expressed by the  Deputy  Prime Minister and Leader of the Country Party at the annual conference of the Victorian Country Party on 2nd April last that Australia was selling her national heritage bit by bit every year to foreign investors represent the official attitude of the Australian Country Party? In the honorable gentleman&#39;s view, does the opinion expressed by the  Deputy  Prime Minister conflict with the official policy of the coalition Government on this matter? </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. DAVIDSON.</inline>- The reply to the last portion of the honorable gentleman&#39;s question is, &#34; No &#34;. It is well known that the Minister for Trade has done a mighty job in expanding the scope of Australia&#39;s trade and development and in the preservation of Australian industries. Anything that he has said recently must be considered in that context. I am sure that all my colleagues agree with me when I say that on his present visit overseas he will continue to act to Australia&#39;s advantage. </para>
    <para>POSTAL DEPARTMENT. </para>
    <para class="block">
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. FOX.</inline>- I preface my question to the Postmaster-General by saying that many public telephone booths are not as clean as they could be. Of course this is not the fault of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department but rather is the fault of the public which uses the booths. In the interests of public health, will the Minister arrange for the regular disinfecting and cleaning of public telephone booths? </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. DAVIDSON.</inline>- The condition in which telephone booths are sometimes left by certain vandals gives rise to quite a problem, which my department tries to handle. I shall see whether anything further can be done in the matter of inspecting booths from time to time. Perhaps the honorable member can advise me of telephone booths in certain areas which require particular attention. We are doing our best to solve this problem. I only wish that some people felt a greater need to preserve decency. </para>
    <para>SALES TAX. </para>
    <para class="block">
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BEATON.</inline>- I preface my question, which is addressed to the Treasurer, by referring to the Treasury practice of imposing sales tax not only on the cost of a completed article but also, in the case of country areas, on the freight charges incurred in transporting that article to the country. Is the Treasurer aware that because the major proportion of consumer goods purchased in country areas comes from the capital cities this practice adds to costs in country communities? In effect, the further one lives from the capital cities the higher is the sales tax. Is the Treasurer aware also that goods manufactured by decentralized country industries, which are struggling to compete with city organizations, are loaded with this additional and unnecessary sales tax disability? In view of the fact that the Government admits that there is a special unemployment problem in country areas, will the Treasurer examine the present practice with a view to removing this discriminatory taxation burden on country people and country industries? </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HAROLD</inline>HOLT. - I can assure the honorable member that this matter has been very carefully and very sympathetically examined on many occasions. The practice which now obtains - I remind the honorable gentleman that it obtained also when Labour was last in office - has been found to be the only workable one to adopt. I repeat that it has been given full consideration, but when it has been considered no one has been able to suggest a better practice. </para>
    <para class="block">ROYAL AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HOLTEN.-</inline>My question to the Minister for Air relates to the recent crash of a Sabre jet aircraft in the Lake George area, which was caused by engine failure and resulted in the pilot, Group Captain Mather, having to use the ejection apparatus to bail out. Has the actual cause of this engine failure yet been ascertained? </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. FAIRBAIRN.</inline>- A court of inquiry has been set up to investigate this accident, but I have been informed by the Air Member for Technical Services that it was almost certainly caused by the failure of a fuel pump. However, Avon engines have two fuel pumps and there must have been some malfunction of the second pump, otherwise the engine would have continued to operate successfully. Since the Royal Australian Air Force fitted modifications to these engines two and a half years ago this is the first occasion on which engine failure in the air has caused a pilot to eject, and, therefore, be unable to return to and land his aircraft safely at the nearest base. I think this record of performance shows the remarkable efficiency of Avon engines. </para>
    <para class="block">HOUSING. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. GRIFFITHS.</inline>- I direct a question to the Minister for the Interior. Has he received correspondence from me twice in the last six or seven weeks, protesting against increased rentals being charged tenants of Commonwealth cottages at Belmont North in my electorate? Will he say why I have not received either a reply or an acknowledgement before now? Are increased rentals being charged in face of his department&#39;s refusal to service the area and is he using, as an excuse for the increases, higher costs of such items as maintenance, rates, and the like? Is it not a fact that his department does not pay municipal rates or carry out maintenance work in the village? Is it true that the tenants do their own maintenance and otherwise effect repairs and install essential services in the cottages? If this is so, will he take action to restore the status quo in rentals, pending a thorough investigation of the conditions existing in the cottages at the village to which I have referred? </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. FREETH.-</inline>I have received letters from the honorable member, but I was not aware that they had not been answered. I am sorry. I will have a look at the matter and see whether he can be given an answer straight away. I ask him to place the rest of his question, which was rather long, on the notice-paper. </para>
    <para class="block">WATERFRONT EMPLOYMENT. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. WHITTORN.-</inline>My question is addressed to the Treasurer. As he was asked yesterday to allocate &#163;500,000 of Australian money to assist in the relief of the volcano-stricken Indonesians, I now ask him how he would ensure that the Waterside Workers Federation would handle the goods purchased with this &#163;500,000. I ask him, particularly, when the consignment of dried milk and bulk cooking utensils which was urgently requested by the Indonesian Red Cross, and which has been sitting on the wharf at Walsh Bay since last Friday, will be handled by wharf labourers and whether this instance of man&#39;s inhumanity to man is to be allowed to continue. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HAROLD</inline>HOLT.- I am sure all the members of the House have been watching with concern developments on the waterfront, which appear to indicate a revival of irresponsibility and leadership of a kind damaging to Australia&#39;s export trade and external relations. I join with the honorable member in expressing regret that a gesture of goodwill and practical help of the kind he has illustrated for us here is being frustrated by the failure of the waterfront union to load this cargo. I understand that matters relating to this course of conduct will be debated by the House later in the afternoon and perhaps that occasion will provide a better opportunity for canvassing these matters in more detail. </para>
    <para class="block">DEFENCE. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. JAMES.</inline>- My question is directed to the Treasurer. Does he consider that the governments of countries in South-East Asia and Indian Ocean areas would be concerned about the establishment in Western Australia, by agreement between Australia and the United States of America, of a control centre for 20 or 30 mobile nuclear missile bases, which would be moving about among them? Has his Government made any attempt to ascertain the views of the governments of these countries, or has it ignored them? If any attempt has been made to ascertain their views, will he inform the House of the results? If the views of these governments have not been obtained, will be take steps to obtain them so that this House can be informed before it has to consider the bill authorizing the establishment of the missile bases control centre? </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HAROLD</inline>HOLT-As the Prime Minister has already advised the House, legislation will be brought down and an opportunity provided for debate on matters of the kind to which the honorable gentleman has referred. If there is any information which I can secure for him which would assist him in discussing the particular matter he has raised, I will see whether it can be made available. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James.</inline>- We are asking for that. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HAROLD</inline>HOLT. - I shall see whether it is available. </para>
    <para class="block">SOCIAL SERVICES. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. COCKLE.</inline>- My question is directed to the Minister for Social Services. Has the attention of the Minister been drawn to an announcement made by a Labour sen; tor of an alleged change of policy with regard to the payment of social service benefits to eligible persons who are discharged from mental hospitals? Is the Minister in a position to confirm the announcement, which has been given wide publicity by newspapers and radio stations alike? Under what authority can a Labour senator make an announcement with regard to a change of Government policy since announcements of this kind are usually made by the appropriate Minister? </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. ROBERTON.-</inline>My attention has been drawn to this unauthorized announcement, allegedly made by an Opposition senator. I am indebted to the honorable member for Warringah for raising the question in this House. Announcements of the kind are to be deplored. There has been no change of policy with regard to pensioners who are admitted to mental hospitals, except insofar as the honorable senator may have been referring to events before the general election of 1949. Since that time the Social Services Act has been interpreted to give the greatest possible advantage to pensioners in those most unfortunate circumstances. I would remind honorable members that the </para>
    <para class="block">Social Services Act provides, and always has provided, for the suspension of benefits when pensioners are admitted to mental hospitals. But the act also provides for the restoration of payments as soon as pensioners are discharged from mental hospitals. Such payments are made retrospective, covering a four-week period. That policy has been faithfully followed for fourteen years, and it will continue to be followed. If the policy is changed, then the Minister for Social Services, no matter who he might be, will make the necessary announcement in the traditional way. </para>
    <para>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL FLAG. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. MONAGHAN.-</inline>My question is directed to the Leader of the House. In &#34;Hansard&#34; of 26th March, 1963, the Prime Minister is reported to have informed the House of an extension of the scheme whereunder Australian national flags are issued to schools in Australia. The scheme was extended to include boy scouts and girl guides. I now ask whether the Government will consider a further extension of this commendable scheme to cover all schools in the Australian Territories, including mission schools of all denominations. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HAROLD</inline>HOLT. - I shall be happy to convey that commendable suggestion to the Prime Minister. </para>
    <para class="block">BROADCASTING. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. NIXON.</inline>- I address my question to the Treasurer. Because of the national importance of and Australia-wide interest in the Commonwealth Budget, will the Treasurer endeavour to make arrangements with the Postmaster-General to have the Budget speech broadcast by all Australian Broadcasting Commission stations covering rural areas, so that country people may enjoy the benefit of hearing the Budget proposals for the ensuing year? </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HAROLD</inline>HOLT. - I shall be glad to discuss this suggestion with my colleague, the Postmaster-General. I can only hope that the message conveyed by the Budget will make palatable hearing for the listeners. </para>
    <para>ANZAC DAY. </para>
    <para class="block">
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. REYNOLDS.</inline>- I preface my question, which is addressed to the Treasurer, by mentioning that recently I put on notice a question addressed to the Prime Minister in these terms - </para>
    <para>As 25th April, 1965, will bo the fiftieth anniversary of the events at Anzac, will the Government give special consideration to the striking of a special medal to commemorate the occasion? </para>
    <para class="block">The Prime Minister, in a brief answer which I received yesterday, stated - </para>
    <para>This matter has been considered recently by the Government, but it is felt that the issue of  a  medal to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Anzac Day would not be of a significance commensurate with the relatively large expenditure that would be involved. Consideration is, however, being given to some fitting way of celebrating this very special anniversary. </para>
    <para class="block">I now ask the Treasurer: Does the Government not recognize that its penny-pinching attitude in this matter violates the sentiments of all ex-service organizations and is shockingly out of touch with the Australian public&#39;s sacred regard for this most important event in Australia&#39;s history? What estimate of costs did the Government have before it when it made the decision? Has the Government any precise notion of what alternative means it has in mind for celebrating the occasion? Will the Government give an undertaking that it will review this decision and strike the necessary medal? </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HAROLD</inline>HOLT. - In the first place, I repudiate any suggestion that this Government lacks appreciation of the significance of Anzac Day. In fact, the Prime Minister, the Government and, indeed, our supporters have always been scrupulous in their own observance of Anzac Day and have shown a proper national recognition of its importance to this country. I am not able to name all the considerations which influenced the Prime Minister when he took the decision which was conveyed to the honorable gentleman. I can do no more at this stage than see that what has now been said comes to the right honorable gentleman&#39;s notice. I am quite certain that he would not have replied as he did without weighing the answer quite carefully against other possibilities which may have come to his mind. </para>
    <para class="block">PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BUCHANAN.-</inline>My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health. It is understood that  the Minister for Health recently arranged a meeting between leaders of the friendly societies and the Federated Pharmaceutical Service Guild of Australia in an attempt to resolve their differences over the application of the 5s. charge required for every prescription under the national health scheme. Can the Minister inform the House of the result of the talks and whether, as a consequence, there are proposed amendments of the act that will ensure equality of trading practices in dispensary shops and chemists&#39; shops? </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. SWARTZ.</inline>- It is a fact that my colleague, the Minister for Health, arranged a meeting between representatives of the Federated Pharmaceutical Service Guild of Australia and the friendly societies to discuss this subject. My understanding is that the meeting did not resolve the problems which were being discussed. The report by the independent  chairman  of the conference is still being studied by the Minister, and I shall advise the honorable member as soon as possible what the result of that study is. </para>
    <para class="block">ROYAL AUSTRALIAN AIR FORCE. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. ARMITAGE.</inline>- I wish to ask the Minister for Air a question. Have there been recent discussions between the British Aircraft Corporation and Royal Australian Air Force officers or the Minister concerning the replacement of the obsolete Canberra bomber? Has the Government made any decision to purchase the TSR-2 bomber when it becomes available? Does the Minister, keeping in mind the fact that, even if orders were placed now, it could be some years before the new aircraft would be delivered, consider that a decision on replacement of the Canberra bomber is urgent? </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. FAIRBAIRN.</inline>- I have had discussions with Geoffrey Quill, who is the sales representative of the British Aircraft Corporation and who has been in Australia on a couple of occasions recently trying to interest the Commonwealth Government in the TSR-2 bomber. These discussions showed that this aircraft, when produced, should be outstanding, but my personal feeling is that the date by which it will be produced is so late that the Commonwealth Government would be unable to accept this aircraft. We could accept it only if we were to hire or borrow other aircraft to use in the meantime. I agree with the honorable member that the Canberra is an old type and is becoming obsolete. For that reason the Government is looking at means of replacing it. The Government has decided that the Chief of the Air Staff, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Valston</inline> Hancock, should accept an invitation from the French Government to go abroad early in June and be present at the International Air Show at Paris. He will have an opportunity, while there, to inspect all the aircraft that would be available if and when the Government should decide to replace the Canberra. </para>
    <para class="block">HOUSING FINANCE. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CLEAVER.-</inline>My question is addressed to the Treasurer. I refer to the right honorable gentleman&#39;s recent confirmation that Australian banks are now releasing substantially increased amounts for housing loans. As building societies have helped to establish a splendid partnership between banks and governments, through the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement, I ask the Treasurer whether steps may be taken to urge the banks to increase also their advances to such societies. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HAROLD</inline>HOLT.- The House is well aware of the interest this Government has always shown in the co-operative building society movement, and the practical assistance given by my colleague, the Minister for National Development, when he negotiated the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement and secured the agreement of the States to the allocation to cooperative building societies of 30 per cent, of the funds available under the agreement. Recently, while addressing publicly a gathering of representatives of the cooperative building societies, I did urge that banks and other financial institutions should ensure that co-operative building societies shared in the increased funds that they were making available for housing. I think the suggestion was quite well received. I have seen indications that the co-operative building societies have received some increased provision, although I do not say it has been enough for their requirements. I hope that this expression of the Government&#39;s view will not be without influence on the assistance given by banks and financial institutions in this direction. </para>
    <para>ARMY TRAINING. </para>
    <para class="block">
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. FULTON.</inline>- My question is addressed to the Minister for the Army. As the increased defence vote may favour the Army - or even if it does not - will the Minister consider establishing a permanent camp in the tropical area of Australia, so that troops may familiarize themselves not only with the area itself but also with conditions there? Such a step would also provide an excellent opportunity for medical staff and communications staff to become familiar with the hazards of the terrain  in which they would probably have to operate if we were called on to defend this country. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CRAMER.</inline>- The honorable member may know that we take every opportunity to give troops exercises in areas in which they will encounter tropical conditions. As a matter of fact, great numbers of such exercises have been carried out in the north of Queensland. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fulton.</inline>-  But not far enough north. That was at Mackay. They should be in the tropics. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CRAMER.-</inline>Well, I am afraid I did not catch your exact words. I cannot hear what you are saying now because of all the rumbling coming from your colleagues. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fulton.</inline>-  I meant in the tropics, where the troops were called on to assemble and train before going overseas in the last war. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CRAMER.-</inline>Well, I will have a look at &#34; Hansard &#34; later and see what you did say, and give you a proper answer. </para>
    <para>TELEVISION. </para>
    <para class="block">
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. LESLIE.</inline>- I have a question which I want to address to the Postmaster-General. I ask him whether the fact that no applications were received for the proposed commercial television transmitting station in the Northam-York district, to serve the central agricultural areas of Western Australia, will have any effect on the Government&#39;s intention to provide a national television transmitting station in this area. Will the invitation of applications for a commercial station  to serve this area remain  open? </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. DAVIDSON.</inline>- I can assure the honorable member for Moore that the fact that no applications were received for a commercial television licence in the areas to which he referred will not in any way affect the announced intention to establish a national service there. The honorable member also asked whether the invitation to submit applications for a commercial licence in the areas will remain open. If we are advised, or if he can advise me or the board, that some interest there now wishes to submit an application, I shall see that such application is processed. </para>
    <para>INCOME TAX LEGISLATION. </para>
    <para class="block">
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;CONNOR.</inline>- I ask the Treasurer whether it is a fact that a committee on taxation, presided over by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Ligertwood, presented its report to the Government more than eighteen months ago. What are the reasons for the Government&#39;s failure to say what it proposes to do about implementing the recommendations of the committee? If the Government intends to implement the recommendations, can the Treasurer say when the Government will do so? </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HAROLD</inline>HOLT.- I have answered questions on this topic on a number of occasions since the report was received. On each occasion I have referred to the complexity and variety of matters covered by the report of the Ligertwood committee. In effect, it roamed over the whole field of our income tax legislation. Any  one who has been following the  attempts in the United States of America to implement tax reform there will have some conception of the kind of problems we face here. I may say, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, that</inline> the report of the Commissioner of Taxation on the report of the committee was larger in size than the report of the committee itself. It was also a document of considerable complexity and, of course much importance. </para>
    <para>Work on this matter has been proceeding in the Department of the Treasury and in the office of the Commissioner of Taxation. In order that concentrated attention could be given to the problems and to the preparation of the necessary legislation, I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Denis</inline> O&#39;sullivan, who recently retired from the position of Commissioner of </para>
    <para class="block">Taxation, whether he would be willing to accept an appointment to the Commonwealth Treasury as a consultant and to devote his time and effort to the preparation of policy recommendations and the drafting of legislation that may be necessary after further Cabinet discussions. He has now been engaged and is working in the Treasury on this very matter. </para>
    <para>I am not able to say at this point when legislation will come forward to the House. It may be that we can deal with most of the matters together, but I think it more likely that we will have to deal with them in parts. However, I give the House my assurance that we want to produce the best result we can from the study that is being given to these problems and that any delay will not be the result of lack of attention either by the Department of the Treasury or by the special consultant we have now engaged. </para>
    <para>ANSETT TRANSPORT INDUSTRIES LIMITED. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. MACKINNON.-</inline>My question is addressed to the Treasurer. What steps can the right honorable gentleman take to undo the almost irreparable damage inflicted yesterday on Ansett Transport Industries Limited by the Leader of the Opposition? I ask him to investigate the possibility of taking some action that will protect the integrity of such large organizations from this type of irresponsible and undermining attack, which must destroy public confidence and damage the interests of many shareholders - and I might add that I am not one of them. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HAROLD</inline>HOLT.- Whilst I may deplore, with other honorable gentlemen, the attack made by the Leader of the Opposition, I do not altogether share the view of the honorable member for Corangamite that the Leader of the Opposition has worked irreparable damage Ansett Transport Industries Limited, because I think the people of Australia are sufficiently levelheaded to form their own judgment on an issue of this kind. I feel that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ansett</inline> himself made a dignified reply to these charges. He invited the Leader of the Opposition to repeat them outside the sanctuary of privilege. I am quite certain that the great majority of Australians, who have watched with admiration the courage and ability shown by this Australian in building up a great commercial airline, will form their own assessment. They will not be regardless of the fact that the recommendation on which the Government acted was the unanimous recommendation of the body specially appointed to make recommendations. In giving effect to that recommendation, of course, the Government has been guided by the informed view of those people who are able to assess the relative merits and capacities of the contending candidates. </para>
    <para>EDUCATION. </para>
    <para class="block">
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BRYANT.</inline>- Did the Treasurer receive last week-end a newspaper distributed by the Students Representative Council of the University of Melbourne, highlighting the needs of education in Australia and stressing points that have been made from this side of the House on numerous occasions? As the newspaper was obviously expressing the view of many people who are closely involved in education, will he reconsider the Government&#39;s refusal to appoint a national committee of inquiry into the needs of Australian education generally? </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HAROLD</inline>HOLT.- The honorable gentleman is well aware that very full statements on the Commonwealth provision for education have been made in this House by the Prime Minister and others speaking for the Government. He should be aware that the amount provided directly and indirectly by this Government for education far exceeds anything provided by any previous government, and certainly any previous government which would have enjoyed the support of the honorable gentleman. We have to contend with a great many claims in the field of development, defence and social services - just to name a few - as well as education. Having regard to the many other important claims upon the revenues of the Commonwealth, I do not think any one could fairly a. due that we have not adopted a liberal attitude in the provision of funds for the Sta:  governments and also in the special field of tertiary education, in which our provision has far exceeded that contemplated by any earlier government. </para>
    <para class="block">DEFENCE. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. FORBES.</inline>- My question, which is directed to the Minister for the Army, is supplementary to the question asked by the honorable member for Leichhardt. Is it not a fact that no area in Australia, tropical or otherwise, provides climatic conditions equivalent to those of South-East Asia? Also, is it not a fact that this is one of the things that make the stationing of a battalion group in Malaya - which honorable gentlemen opposite are pledged to withdraw, if they can - so valuable to this country? </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CRAMER.</inline>- Every word that the honorable member for Barker said is definitely true. I should like to add - the honorable member knows it - that at Canungra we have one of the finest jungle training centres in the world. It really prepares troops for the conditions that they have to encounter when they are sent to countries beyond the shores of Australia. So most of our troops are actually trained under jungle conditions. Of course, they do not get at Canungra the atmosphere that they get in Malaya, which was referred to by the honorable member. </para>

      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. NELSON.-</inline>I address a question to the Minister for Territories. Has the period allowed the British Aluminium Company Limited to formulate a programme for its Gove bauxite deposits run out? Has the Minister informed the company that he will review its lease only if it undertakes to produce alumina nearby, as has been arranged by the Pechiney company for the bauxite from its surrounding leases? </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HASLUCK.</inline>- The exact position is that British Aluminium Company Limited, in respect of the single lease that it holds at Gove, had until 31st December last to submit a proposal. It submitted a proposal by 31st December. As a result of subsequent discussions with the Government the company was asked to submit an amended proposal before the end of February and it did so. That amended proposal is now under examination. </para>

    <para class="block">
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. ANTHONY.-</inline>I ask the Treasurer whether he will give consideration to a proposal that may help to decentralize the Taxation Branch. At present the main offices of the branch are in the capital cities. The Postmaster-General&#39;s Department and the Department of Social Services have regional offices in country areas. Those local offices give country people more personal and intimate service. I am sure that if the Taxation Branch established regional offices and did likewise the result would be more accurate returns and speedier lodging of returns. This would help not only the Government but also taxpayers. </para>

    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. LUCHETTI.-</inline>In the absence of the Prime Minister I direct a question to the Treasurer. Is the right honorable gentleman aware of the serious continuing problem of unemployment throughout Australia and particularly its severity in certain areas where the position is chronic? Does the right honorable gentleman recall a promise made by the Government to provide full employment for the mine workers of Australia? Does he know that 9,000 mine workers have lost their jobs since that promise was made? In view of the present situation in mining areas I ask the Treasurer to consider favorably the action taken by the United Kingdom Chancellor of the Exchequer and to provide assistance for the establishment of permanent industries in depressed areas throughout Australia. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. HAROLD</inline>HOLT.- The full answer to the matters raised by the honorable gentleman would take longer than I think the House would permit or desire at this stage. I would point out to the honorable gentleman that he creates a quite misleading impression publicly in the reference that he makes to the unemployment situation in Australia. What he might more usefully refer to is the special problem that exists in some centres. As my colleague, the Minister for Labour and National Service, has pointed out in detail, there has been a general improvement in the demand for labour, and in some categories of employment scarcities of labour have already been revealed. In some directions many of the young people who have just left school are being steadily placed in jobs. Recently my colleague&#39;s department has been receiving notifications of vacancies at the rate of about 14,000 a week and has been placing people in employment at the rate of about 11,000 a week. I am assured by the Minister that this rate of demand for labour is continuing. But that does not mean that there are not in existence particular pockets of unemployment. The honorable member will know that the Government has in various ways tried to give practical help to overcome this problem. It has provided additional approval for loan raising by local government authorities. It has provided special grants to the States for employment-giving purposes. The States have been given absolute discretion to spend those grants in areas where difficulties exist, and they do so in collaboration with the Department of Labour and National Service. The action taken by the Chancellor of the Exchequer which formed part of the recent United Kingdom budget decisions is worthy of examination, and I shall be glad to study it. </para>

      <inline font-style="italic">-I</inline>have received a letter from the honor  able member for Bruce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Snedden)</inline> proposing that a definite matter of urgent public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely - </para>
    <para>The action of the Waterside Workers Federation and in particular the Melbourne and Sydney branches in engineering strikes deliberately designed to disrupt Australian sea transport and consequently to disorganize Australian national and international trade. </para>
    <para class="block">I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. (More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places) - </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline>SNEDDEN (Bruce) &#91;3.17&#93;.- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> approximately 22,000 waterside workers are employed in Australia. The great majority of Australian ports carry on in a reasonable fashion but at all times on the waterfront there is the likelihood of stoppages, strikes and general turbulence. Generally speaking, work in the ports of Australia, with the exception of Sydney and Melbourne, has been carried on, since the last legislation brought down by this Government, in a reasonable way. But a very dreadful situation has arisen in Sydney and Melbourne, where the Communistcontrolled executives in those waterfront ports are able at will to call a strike on or off. They can engineer strikes at the drop of a hat. As soon as they, in a dictatorial fashion, make a decision that there will be a strike, everybody has to walk off. </para>
    <para>The consequences of a strike are very disastrous to the Australian nation as a whole and particularly to the men engaged in the strike. The trade of the nation is disrupted and there is a likelihood that trade in perishable goods will be destroyed completely. Strikes add to the cost structure throughout the Commonwealth. They bring general disruption. These results to the nation are insufferable. The men on strike suffer very severely from loss of wages and loss of future attendance money. The general secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fitzgibbon,</inline> has, I believe, been trying his hardest to bring a state of peace to the waterfront. Unfortunately it must be admitted that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fitzgibbon</inline> is the captive of the Communistcontrolled executives of Melbourne and Sydney and is completely incapable of exercising any true power as the general secretary of the federation. </para>
    <para>The build-up of stoppages that we have seen recently conforms to a specific planned objective. After legislation to amend the Stevedoring Industry Act was passed we had in Australia a period of peace on the waterfront which was unparallelled in our previous history. Indeed, the report of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority of that year pointed out that for the first four months of the financial year 1961-62 the loss of man-hours was so small that we were heading for an all-time record low and that the annual loss would be less than the usual average monthly loss. After <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Healy</inline> died and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fitzgibbon</inline> became the general secretary, the Communists managed to find time to rearrange themselves and to replan their programme. Having replanned their programme, they said: &#34;This is not good enough. There are not enough stoppages. The loss of man-hours is not great enough. We shall have to assert our superiority over this man Fitzgibbon.&#34; Both the Sydney and Melbourne executives decided that they would take the right to declare stoppages out of the hands of the federal executive and assume it themselves. Without doubt, the purpose of this was to disrupt Australia&#39;s economy in accordance with the plans and the principles to which they adhere. They want to inconvenience the Australian people and, where possible, to harm them. </para>
    <para>Then you ask the question, &#34; Who wants the strikes? &#34; The inevitable answer is, &#34; The Communist leaders of the Sydney and Melbourne executives of the Waterside Workers Federation want the strikes&#34;. The reasons given for these stoppages are incredible. The executives say, &#34;The reason for this stoppage is the question of annual leave&#34; or &#34;The reason for this stoppage is the question of margins &#34;. In fact, at the time of those stoppages the case before the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in relation to annual leave and margins had been concluded and a decision was imminent. At a time when members of the metal trades unions and other unionists had presented their case before the commission, the Waterside Workers Federation was calling a strike about the subjects of the application. The conclusion to be drawn is that the federation does not care a jot about other unions. It does not care how they manage. If the circumstances occur, it is prepared to embarrass other unions as much as it can because this is all a part of the Communist planned build-up to assume control of all unions in Australia. What a futile, stupid reason to give for a strike when the full bench of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission was considering the same subjects! </para>
    <para>Another reason which the federation has given for stoppages is the monopolies of the shipping companies. What an incredible reason to give for a strike! In the first place, it is not a reason for a strike, and secondly, there are no monopolies. Another fascinating reason the federation has given is that its members are not receiving their share of Australia&#39;s productivity. It has used the word &#34; productivity &#34;. I see the honorable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. James Harrison)</inline> in the House. I am sure that at least he will give the word &#34; productivity &#34; the meaning that it should be given. Productivity is not an easy thing to define or to measure but the Communistcontrolled Waterside Workers Federation claims that productivity is arrived at by dividing the number of men working at a particular time into the output. The federation then claims a share of the result. In reality it wants not merely a share of the &#34; productivity &#34; but all of it. That is how the Communists operate, and that is one reason that they have given for a waterfront stoppage. </para>
    <para>Then there are all kinds of local issues, such as the provision of protective clothing and higher pay for working in dirty conditions, which are given as reasons for stoppages. But such issues can be determined immediately on the spot by a board of reference. There is no need for a strike, as is demonstrated by the number of times on which a board of reference has determined matters with great facility. </para>
    <para>Let me tell the House of a fascinating occurrence in Melbourne. A stop-work meeting was held at the boxing stadium. The reason given for the stoppage was to hold a meeting to support Fidel Castro. The whole Australian economy was held up while Melbourne waterside workers went to the stadium to hold a meeting to declare their support for Fidel Castro! Another interesting stoppage occurred in Sydney on 8th March. All men working on the Sydney waterfront walked off at 2 p.m. As they were walking off a public servant employed by the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority asked the waterside workers the reason for the strike and they replied: &#34; We do not know. We are just told that we are on strike.&#34; Off they went and not one stroke of work was done all that afternoon. At 5 o&#39;clock the authority still did not know the reason for the strike. Then at 8 o&#39;clock that night the mystery was solved when the State executive of the Waterside Workers Federation issued a press statement and gave &#34;hostages&#34; as the reason for the strike. </para>
    <para class="block">Perhaps not all honorable members know what hostages are. This nice colourful word was dreamed up by the Communist executive because it has appeal. The executive said to the men, &#34;You cannot allow men to be held as hostages &#34; and the men asked, &#34; What does the word mean? &#34;, as honorable members may ask what it means. When a man is suspended from work he is suspended for a working day, but if the port goes on strike the day following the suspension that day is not regarded as a working day for the purposes of the suspension. That is how the &#34; Com.&#34; executive used the word &#34; hostages &#34;. </para>
    <para>The executive claims that the Government should be kinder than it is to the waterside workers. What more kindness can you do than to provide, as the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McMahon)</inline> provided, a right of appeal in cases pf suspension? Not only did the Government provide a right of appeal, but it also provided for the payment of compensation in the event of the appeal being upheld. </para>

    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. SNEDDEN.-</inline>All honorable members may not have heard that comment. In the characteristic, lofty objectivity for which he is so well known the honorable member for Newcastle has accused the judges of Australia of being biased. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. SPEAKER.-</inline>Order! Did the honorable member for Newcastle make that remark about the judges? </para>

      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones.</inline>- Yes. </para>

    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones.</inline>- I withdraw it. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. SNEDDEN.-</inline>One might ask, &#34;Is there rank and file support for the Communistcontrolled executive?&#34; Very clearly the answer is that it has no rank and file support. When given the opportunity the rank and file tipped out the Communist candidate when a successor to the late Jim Healy was to be elected and elected the non-Communist Fitzgibbon. The rank and file does not want the Corns but it is power less at present to do anything about getting rid of them. For instance, Roach is acting general secretary of the federation because Fitzgibbon is overseas. Let me tell you how the Corns operate. They said to Fitzgibbon: &#34;You are getting in our hair a bit. Off you go overseas and leave control of Sydney and Melbourne to us &#34;. So now Roach is the acting general secretary. Recently he went all the way from Sydney to Melbourne to call a meeting but he could not raise a quorum on the Melbourne waterfront. If any one can claim that that indicates anything but a complete absence of confidence by the rank and file in its controllers I should be very surprised. </para>
    <para>Let me deal now with the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The A.C.T.U. is sick and tired of the Waterside Workers Federation but, while it is sick of it, it is stuck with it and does not know what to do. It has called the federation into conference on several occasions and has extracted the promise that the federation will act reasonably, in accordance with union principles. Having given the promise the federation representatives have left the conference without having the slightest intention of honouring it and immediately have called on other strikes. This leads to a very important question. The rank-and-file members are not behind the Communist-controlled executive, but how can they get rid of it? They have been trying, but cannot get rid of it. The only means by which they can rid themselves of the Corns is the secret ballot. This is the very thing that members of the Opposition have opposed violently and constantly. While I have been a member of this House all spokesmen on industrial matters on the other side of the chamber have said - it was said by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> in his policy speech at the last election - that the Labour Party stands for the abolition of the secret ballot in union elections. Honorable members opposite must know that when they stand against the secret ballot they are standing for the Corns, and until they get that clearly in their minds how can anybody have any confidence in the Opposition? On the industrial scene the thing which is most dearly held by the union member now is his right to the secret ballot, if he can fill the preliminary condition regarding the number requiring it. </para>
    <para>We come then to the aspect of penalties. The Opposition has constantly said that it does not agree with the penalties contained in the legislation. How can honorable members opposite justify that stand in any way at all, when the whole of the Australian economy - the passage of goods, trade in general, and commerce and intercourse between the great Australian States - is being held to ransom and is having the brake put on it or is hobbled by the Waterside Workers Federation? Yet the Opposition says it is against secret ballots and the penalties contained in the legislation. How can it possibly hold to that view? </para>
    <para>If the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Whitlam),</inline> the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> and the honorable member for Blaxland speak during the debate, I hope the Australian people will hear at least one of them say, &#34; As far as I am concerned the penalties will stay &#34;. I hope, more important even than that, that one of them will say, &#34; I stand four-square behind secret ballots in trade unions &#34;. Let us hear from one of them. Let us hear one of them say that. Or is the reality of the situation that the 36 faceless men whom we have heard about have to be consulted before the Opposition would say it is against secret ballots? Of course, if the question gets to the interstate conference of the Australian Labour Party, you can rest assured of the decision which the 36 men will take. They will take a decision against secret ballots, because many of them are Communists themselves. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. WARD</inline>(East Sydney) &#91;3.33&#93;.- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> the raising of this matter by the honorable member for Bruce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Snedden)</inline> will at least serve one useful purpose, that is, the people of Australia - probably for the first time in this recent dispute - will hear the case for the waterside workers. The honorable member for Bruce is a lawyer. Outside this chamber he appears as junior counsel for the shipowners. In Parliament he continues the same activities on behalf of the same interests. I do not know whether he received a very poor brief, whether he spoke in complete ignorance of the situation, or whether his- purpose was to attempt deliberately to deceive the Australian public in regard to the exact situation which exists. He talked in generalities, but did not get down to specific disputes to show what is causing unrest on the Australian waterfront to-day. </para>
    <para>It has often been said that the waterfront industry is a turbulent industry. Of course it is! It has been turbulent for very many years, but the turbulence has been due to the attitude adopted by the employers in the industry - the shipowners - rather than the attitude of the men engaged in the industry. Let me, in my limited time, deal with one or two specific instances to show the provocation to which the waterside workers have been subjected. The member for Bruce talks about the word &#34; hostage &#34; being a Com. word. That is always the defence employed by members opposite. But I think that when I explain what is happening on the waterfront to-day any reasonable person could put no other interpretation on the matter than to say that &#34; hostage &#34; is the correct word to use. </para>
    <para>In July, 1962, a vessel called the &#34; Riederstem &#34; arrived in Australia. It was a cargo vessel carrying oil in tanks. The waterside workers claimed that the work of pumping the oil into wagons on the shore was their work, but this- was denied by the shipowners. Previously the oil had been brought in in 44-gallon drums, the handling of which had been the work of the waterside workers. The men were given a suspended sentence and, strangely enough, their claim was subsequently conceded, although they were penalized at the time they made their stand. It was eventually admitted that the claim of the men engaged in this dispute was correct, but they were given this suspended sentence and before it had been served the wool dispute occurred. </para>
    <para>A Japanese vessel arrived in Australia to receive a cargo of Australian wool and one of the men engaged on loading it was injured. Immediately the men, on the grounds that their safety was involved, made a request to the shipowners that three men instead of two be employed on the wool stack. This request was rejected by the shipowners and the dispute then went to a board of reference, to which the member for Bruce referred. He said that on these matters there is no need for the men to strike and that disputes should be taken to a board of reference to be determined. This matter went to a board of reference and I will tell you, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, what</inline> happened when it dealt with the matter, it decided in favour of the shipowners and the dispute then went to an arbitrator. Do you know who he  wa9?  He was the  chairman  of the board of reference which had already rejected the men&#39;s request. So there you had as arbitrator the man who had already passed judgment on the men. He obviously upheld his own decision as  chairman  of the board of reference and rejected the men&#39;s claim. </para>
    <para>The men were suspended for what were termed two normal working days. That was the penalty imposed on them. But the shipowners called in fresh men and asked them to continue this work and in no time there were 571 men involved. After they had gone on strike - this was the only way in which they could get the matter dealt with effectively - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Ashburner ruled that where bales were stacked four or more high four men were to be employed on the stacks. The shipowners had had two men on the stacks and the men asked for three. After the men had gone on strike, which was the only way they could have the matter settled, Judge Ashburner decided that four men should be employed on the stacks. So if there had been no strike on that occasion there would have been no justice for the men employed. But although the men were subsequently found to be correct in their claim, savage penalties had already been imposed upon the union and upon the members of the Waterside Workers Federation, who lost great sums of money through loss of attendance money and loss of pay. </para>
    <para>Let me come now to a more recent dispute - the &#34;Lake Eyre&#34; dispute. In this instance the men were engaged in discharging bags of clay. They made a request for industrial clothing - to which the honorable member for Bruce referred - and when it was refused they took the matter to a board of reference. Their request for industrial clothing was rejected. The matter went to an arbitrator. He had been the  chairman  of the board of reference and upheld his own decision. But strangely enough, when a replacement gang was provided for the vessel the men&#39;s demand was conceded and they were given industrial footwear, aprons, washing time, and 6d. per hour penalty rate. If the men were right finally, in regard to the terms they wanted to apply to this work, the stoppage should never have occurred. Their claims were obviously just in the first instance. These are the things which are occurring and causing unrest. </para>
    <para>In this case the authority determined that as the men had lost one day&#39;s pay and part of a day&#39;s pay, that plus two day&#39;s suspension was an adequate penalty, but before they had opportunity of serving this sentence another dispute occurred. This was not related to the first dispute and occurred on the &#34;Port Aylmer &#34;. It involved only six men and had to do with the placing of the men in the discharging of a railway truck. Because agreement could not be reached a dispute occurred. Then, because these six men employed on a different vessel were involved in a dispute the penalty imposed on the &#34; Lake Eyre &#34; men, being a continuing penalty, could not be satisfied until there had been a normal working day. They are the only days that count in cancelling out a period of suspension. The honorable member for Bruce was completely in error in describing this position. He said that if the port stops the next day, that day is not counted as a normal day. In fact, if one waterside worker is involved in a dispute it is not regarded as a normal day and does not count for the purposes of cancelling out a suspension. So if the men are suspended for one or two days and during that time a handful of men are on strike and remain on strike the men suspended remain suspended although otherwise their period of suspension would have expired. </para>
    <para>I think you will agree that no body of men could stand for that state of affairs continuing in their industry. I commend the action of the waterside workers in standing up for their workmates and saying that this form of injustice shall not be allowed to continue. </para>
    <para>This trouble can be dated back to 1956, when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Ashburner gave the employers the all-clear in regard to sling loads. Prior to that, in the various ports, according to the circumstances and conditions of employment, the waterside workers determined the sling loads, but from 1956 onwards the shipowners were allowed to load the slings as they wished. The judge had been of the opinion that the shipowners could be depended upon to deal reasonably with the men, but they almost immediately increased the sling loads and reduced the number of men working below in a vessel. The honorable member for Bruce tried to dismiss lightly the enormous additional profits that are going to the shipowners to-day. He treated them as being of no consequence. I believe that honorable members opposite are trying to use this issue to influence the electors at an important State election in Queensland and an important federal by-election In South Australia. That is the purpose behind the raising of this matter. If the Australian public listened to the honorable member for Bruce, they would believe that there was chaos on the Australian waterfront and that trade was being permanently affected. I challenge the honorable gentleman to dispute the figures I shall give now. In the year 1962, 3,333,000 tons of additional cargo was handled. In that same year there was a reduction of 3,750,000 in the man-hours employed in loading and discharging cargo. Taking a ten-year period, there was an increase of 7,250,000 tons in the cargo handled, with a reduction of 10,333,000 in the man-hours employed in the handling of that cargo. One would have imagined that the honorable member for Bruce would have suggested a reduction in freight rates for the Australian producer as being fully justified. If he is worried about what is happening to our external trade, why does not he criticize the overseas shipping monopolies that not only are exploiting the waterside workers but also are exploiting the primary producers of this country? &#91;Extension of time granted.&#93; In 1962, 1,016 fewer men were employed in the industry and 2.8 hours fewer per man per week were worked by waterside workers. The total average working hours per week for the waterside worker last year was 25.7. </para>
    <para>Attendance money, which is now paid to waterside workers, was not introduced for the purpose of giving an additional reward to these workers for their labour, but was designed as a weapon. It was thought that a threat that attendance money would be withheld would coerce the waterside workers into working harder, under conditions that normally they would not have accepted. But this threat is no longer a deterrent against stoppages of work. The waterside workers have, in my opinion, acted properly as an organized trade union movement in calling stoppages where justified. There is now such an accumulation of debits in regard to attendance money that the threat of withholding it is no longer a deterrent. Many of the older men in the industry, who are now retiring, realize that they would have to be available for work for another ten years before they could hope to work off the debits that they have accumulated. </para>
    <para>Let me deal with another dispute of recent times, the &#34; Pateena &#34; dispute. That dispute occurred, not because it was engineered by the Communist Party, as the honorable member for Bruce suggests, but because the shipowners decided that in loading the &#34;Pateena&#34; they would have two slings on the one hook instead of one sling. The waterside workers decided, for safety reasons, that they would not work with two slings on the one hook, and the men were then given a suspended sentence. Honorable members opposite try to make out that the present disputes are deliberately designed as a serious blow aimed by the waterside workers at our primary producers. That is utter rubbish. Is it not ridiculous that men who are not involved directly in particular disputes are suspended? The shipowners do not attempt to isolate a dispute. They allow it to extend to other men not directly involved, which results in additional waterside workers being suspended. Large numbers of waterside workers have not been allowed to work on the waterfronts at Sydney and Melbourne, while cargoes are held up for want of labour. While the &#34; Pateena &#34; dispute was continuing, the &#34; Elmore &#34;, loaded with potatoes, was berthed at No. 37 Darling Harbour wharf. This vessel was held up because of a shortage of labour to handle its cargo. If the shipowners claimed that they were worried about the primary producers, I would point out that the suspended waterside workers from the *&#39; Pateena &#34; dispute could have been allowed to unload the potatoes from the &#34; Elmore &#34;, where no dispute existed. It is quite obvious that the shipowners have embarked on a campaign of systematic provocation of the men. </para>
    <para>Let us take the question of extra waterside labour under the roster system. The men have insisted that any extra men engaged shall be taken off the roster in their turn and allocated to hatches as labour is required, and that the foremen should not be given the right to select men, as they and the shipowners desire. In order to prevent preference being given to any employees on the waterfront, it was decided by the men that the right of the foremen to select labour should be taken away and the men required should be taken from the roster for the work as it became available. </para>
    <para>One of the important things in respect of this debate is that waterside workers should be afforded an opportunity to state their case to the Australian public. I am perfectly satisfied that they have a good case and that they will be backed, not only by the Labour Party, but by every trade union organization from one end of Australia to the other. A few years ago the present Treasurer, when we were dealing with a report on the waterfront industry, said thai the shipowners were the worst group of employers in Australia. The late William Morris Hughes, also referring to shipowners, said that they never ceased being pirates. I am appealing to the reasonable members of this Parliament to stand up for the waterside workers when unjustified attacks are being made upon them by foreign shipowners. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BURY</inline>(Wentworth) &#91;3.48&#93;.- The speech of the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> was notable mainly, not for what he said, but for what he left out. In any complicated industry with a great tangle of cases, it is always possible to pick out a few cases which might appear reasonable at first sight. But, granting that some cases are reasonable, I point out that what he completely omitted to mention was the pattern which has developed over the past few months in Sydney and Melbourne, a pattern specially designed by Communists to disrupt Australia&#39;s overseas trade. One thing that the honorable member for East Sydney did say which was ridiculous was that be thought that the unions had acted as they should act. In other words, his speech is tantamount to giving them complete support, without any regard whatsoever to the true interests of Australia. </para>
    <para>The honorable member was challenged to say where he stood in relation to the secret ballot. I suppose there is no doubt that he would like to get rid of it as soon as possible, because the secret ballot is the main way to disarm the Communists and the hooligans whom they use for the purposes of intimidation. One of the cargoes most affected by trouble on the waterfront is perishable cargo. Taking the case of apples and pears, the shipping season for this fruit begins about mid-March and continues until early June. Planning for this cargo starts about September. Large numbers of ships have to be organized and assembled at different points at different times. It is most important that the good&#39;s should arrive in good condition in about twelve different overseas ports. It is important that shipments arrive regularly. If they arc disrupted, there are gluts in the supply of apples and pears to our markets. When shipping banks up, gluts occur, even if the fruit reaches the market in good condition. Success in marketing apples and pears depends on shipping flowing steadily at the right time. This is no trifling matter, as I can illustrate by pointing out that these stoppages threaten the marketing of about 8,000,000 cases of fruit worth about 30s. a case to the grower, or a total of approximately &#163;12,000,000. </para>
    <para>What happens if there i congestion on the wharfs at Sydney? The delays spread. Ships leave late for Hobart and bank up there. The vessel &#34; Port Wellington &#34;, for instance, was held up for three days for completely frivolous reasons. In many instances, no reason at all is given until a walk-off actually occurs. When a ship is held up for three or four days, the next ship is delayed, and so the port becomes congested. The delays spread to successive ships and probably later vessels are given only two or three gangs instead of five or six. In this way, the hold-ups extend into many other trades. </para>
    <para>Disruptions have occurred also in trade with our new, developing market for meat in America. This represents one of the most promising export earners for Australia, because the demand for meat is high in America. However, currently, there are not enough ships to lift the meat within the required time. In some instances, this trade has been held up for about two weeks. re ship &#34;Port Aylmer&#34; was provided specifically to carry Australian meat to the east coast of the United States of America. An important shipment carried by that vessel was held up for four days. The only reason for this was that the shipowners were suddenly confronted with a demand that the strength of the gang engaged in moving the meat from railway trucks to the slings, which for years had been six men, be increased to eight. In the end, the size of the gang came back to six men, but the ship was held up for four days. Numerous other illustrations can be given. The vessel &#34; Cap Corrientes &#34; has just been held up for seven days. So it goes on. </para>
    <para>The honorable member for East Sydney may take up one or two important cases - serious cases - and some may have reason in them. But these do not add up to grounds for the calculated hold-ups and distortions of our Australian trade pattern that have occurred. The honorable member suggested that this dispute was directed entirely at the overseas shipowners and their profits. What are the facts about this? Every stoppage, every increase in congestion, and all the delays - these become progressive - have effects which extend far beyond the individual dispute in each instance. Those effects are quite apart from general hold-ups in port. All the extra costs incurred are taken into account when freight rates are fixed. Those costs have to be taken into account. The costs of these upsets perpetrated by the Communistdominated unions on the waterfront are reflected in freight charges. What happens as a result? What do these increased freight costs mean to Australian exporters and individual farmers? They mean lower returns, and this means lower incomes for farmers and lover wages all round, as well as a general increase in the overseas exchange burden for Australia. The truth is that the people who, by their contemptible conduct, aim a blow at Australia&#39;s overseas trade in fact aim a blow at the standard of living, not of overseas shipowners, but of their fellow Australians. Any one who takes the trouble to follow the process through logically must inevitably be forced to the same conclusion. </para>
    <para>Unfortunately, the wharfs have become the weeping ulcer of the Australian economy. A smooth flow of exports and adherence to promised delivery dates are vital to the development of new markets. The leaders of the Australian Labour Party often talk very gaily and glibly about the development of new markets and the promotion of Australia&#39;s exports, and they do not hesitate to blame the Government on the ground that it does not do A, B or C. Let the leaders of the Labour Party look at the true position and consider the damage inflicted on Australia&#39;s overseas trade by the conduct of the Communist-dominated unions whose activities are so ardently supported in every detail by the honorable member for East Sydney. </para>
    <para>The present situation on the waterfront is very difficult for the Commonwealth to deal with, for the Commonwealth has only very limited powers under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Where does the Australian Labour Party stand on this issue? There was some mumbling among honorable members opposite when the honorable member for Bruce suggested that they were bitterly opposed to the secret ballot. In our political life, the secret ballot has meant emancipation and the development of our modern political system, because it has assured the right of every one to express his opinion without fear of intimidation by organized gangs. One who, I believe, is the crown prince among Opposition members is to speak later, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir. What</inline> does he think about this issue?  His  views are very important because eventually, no doubt, he will dispose of his elderly colleagues and take charge. What does he think about this problem of the waterfront? Would he proceed to expand Australia&#39;s exports by supporting the kind of conduct that we see at present on the waterfront? We have every right to know what he would do, because the present conduct on the waterfront is weighing down and dragging back Australia&#39;s export trade to an enormous degree. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline>JAMES HARRISON (Blaxland) &#91;3.58&#93;. - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> this is not a matter that we should discuss with heat. To a degree, the remarks of the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bury)</inline> have some merit. He was correct when he said that the matter that we are now discussing has an important bearing on the Australian economy in the way that he outlined. For that reason, we on this side of the chamber are pleased to have this discussion. Surely it is remarkable that a supporter of a government that has been in office for more than thirteen years charges that government with being incapable of providing the kind of industrial legislation that will bring peace to an industry. The honorable member for Bruce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Snedden)</inline> talked about secret ballots. Let me tell him straight away that the policy of the Australian Labour Party provides for secret ballots. In point of fact, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fitzgibbon</inline> was elected by a secret ballot. So we look beyond mere secret ballots to find the cause of the present trouble. </para>
    <para>I say right at the outset that I was amazed at the attitude displayed by the honorable member for Bruce. He asked us to look at the things that the waterside workers are striking for. He said that they struck for higher margins during the very week when that issue was before the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. He said that they asked for long-service leave at the very time when the issue was before the commission for decision. Is it not strange that the honorable member for Bruce, who well knows what arbitration means in this country, should base his argument on these matters, when he knows that this Government&#39;s advocate went before that same commission and spoke against the Waterside Workers Federation and every other union in Australia? I shall quote some of that gentleman&#39;s remarks. This was a Queen&#39;s Counsel, speaking for the Government and for this Minister, on 6th February, 1963, the fourth day of the hearing - </para>
    <para>In so far as there may be any suggestion that the Commission is being invited to say formally that its decision would have any kind of applicator) in any other award, the Commonwealth strongly opposes any such suggestion. </para>
    <para>Tn so far as the Commission is invited to say at this stage that the Commission&#39;s decision would have prima facie effect or could be given prima facie significance in other awards, the Commonwealth would strongly oppose that course. </para>
    <para class="block">So the Commonwealth at that stage, through Queen&#39;s Counsel representing this Minister and this Government, invited every union in Australia to go out and fight its own case for margins, how it could and how it would. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McMahon.</inline>- Not how it could and how it would. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline>JAMES HARRISON.- Yes, how it could and how it would. That obviously follows from the language used by the Government&#39;s representative. And don&#39;t forget this: Towards the conclusion of the hearing the same Queen&#39;s Counsel, speaking for the same Minister and the same government, said this - </para>
    <para>For example, the Commonwealth would certainly regard it as a bad thing if a wage increase were to disturb the present stability of prices and costs. </para>
    <para class="block">So we find that this Government, through its representative, has invited the kind of agitation that is going on on the waterfront to-day for increased margins and increased rates of pay generally. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jess.</inline>- -Rubbish! You don&#39;t believe that yourself. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cockle.</inline>- You should not believe it. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline>JAMES HARRISON.- I repeat that the Government invited this kind of agitation. I knew at the time the submissions were made by the Commonwealth Government&#39;s representative that they were calculated to invite every other union to follow the same course as that followed by the Waterside Workers Federation. </para>
    <para>The Government&#39;s representative also asked that any decision arrived at should not be used as a basis for deciding other cases, lt asked that the commission should not express its decision in terms of a formula. This was the very negation of the Government&#39;s argument presented in 1957 in this House. It would have done the honorable member for Bruce and other honorable members opposite a lot of good to sit in at the hearings of the commission and listen to the kind of argument adduced in that case. If they want the transcript I can tell them that I have all of it in my possession. </para>
    <para>Then the honorable member for Bruce asked: Why this terrible trouble in Sydney and Melbourne? He went on to deal with the situation in 1961-62. Honorable members will recall that when we had the stevedoring industry legislation before us the Minister suggested that there was something different about Sydney and Melbourne. But why should Sydney and Melbourne be different from everywhere else? </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McMahon.</inline>- They are under Communist control. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline>JAMES HARRISON.- That is the only answer the Minister has, and that is what is leading this country into trouble. Instead of this Government and the Minister facing realities on the waterfront, they can think only in terms of communism. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cockle.</inline>- What would you fellows do about it? </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline>JAMES HARRISON. - You will see before very long, because we will be over on that side doing it. The Minister said at that time that Sydney and Melbourne were different from other ports, but what did the commission do yesterday? Even as recently as yesterday the commission could not be united on the subject of placing a ban on the whole waterfront. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McMahon.</inline>- It was not the commission. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline>JAMES HARRISON. - All right, the Commonwealth Industrial Court. The court could not be unanimous. One member of it said that the ban should apply only to Sydney, but the other two members of the court, constituting a majority, disagreed with the Minister and said that all waterside workers should be in the same category. Let us have a look at the position in Sydney and Melbourne. I am reading from the report of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority for the year ended 30th June, 1962. At page 21 we find this information - </para>
    <para>Waterside workers at most ports worked shorter hours and earned less in wages. Average weekly hours worked fell by 10 per cent, between 1960/61 and 1961/62. Average weekly wages declined by 6i per cent. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McMahon.</inline>- That is wrong. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline>JAMES HARRISON.- This was the year referred to by the honorable member for Bruce when he paid a tribute to the continuity of effort of waterside workers, and in that year they got for their magnificent effort a reduction in their average weekly earnings of <inline font-style="italic">6i</inline> per cent. That appears from the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority&#39;s own report. The Minister says it is wrong. Well, all Lean do is quote from the official report. When the honorable member for Bruce asks what is the trouble in Sydney and Melbourne, let me refer him to the following comment on the same page of the same report: - </para>
    <para>While gross earnings fell on average by 18/4d. per week the averages at Sydney and Melbourne fell by &#163;2 and &#163;3 respectively. </para>
    <para class="block">There is your reason for the trouble in Sydney and Melbourne! In the year in which all waterside workers were good boys, in which they responded to the Government&#39;s demand and did everything required of them, we find that a group of workers in one port suffered a reduction of &#163;2 a week in average earnings, while another group in another port lost &#163;3 a week. No other workers in Australia were asked to accept such losses, and certainly the workers in this turbulent industry should not have had to accept them. These are the facts. They can be found in the reports of the Government&#39;s own authority, and in the transcript of proceedings of the court and the commission before which the Government has been represented. </para>
    <para>I agree with the honorable member for Wentworth that this kind of thing should not go on, but after thirteen years of office it is quite obvious that this Government will never find the answer to the trouble on the waterfront. When it resorts to laying the blame at the door of the Communists, it burkes the issue and runs away from the real problems confronting it. It is all very well for the boys who represent country electorates to interject. I ask them and all other honorable members opposite why workers in Sydney and Melbourne should, because of automation, suffer a reduction of &#163;2 or &#163;3 a week in average earnings and be expected to accept these losses without a fight? </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cockle.</inline>- Do you believe in the arbitration court? </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline>JAMES HARRISON.- I believe in justice - don&#39;t worry on that score. I say that if employees of the Commonwealth Railways, who are also concerned with the important transport industry, can be assured of a guaranteed wage and continuity of employment, then the waterside worker, who is also playing his part in the transport industry which means so much to Australia, should also have these guarantees. Until this Government faces the fact that a waterside worker is entitled to the same benefits, protection and nourishment as are workers in other industries, we will not have peace on the waterfront. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr. Mackinnon).</inline>- Order! The honorable member&#39;s time has expired. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BARNES</inline>(McPherson) &#91;4.8&#93;.- The two speakers we have heard from the front bench of the Opposition side of the House have shown us that they are completely in support of the waterfront strikes, of this lawlessness on the waterfront that is taking such a toll of our community. They have shown that they are just as irresponsible as these people on the waterfront. I was completely unimpressed by the very weak arguments of the honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward),</inline> who tried desperately to justify these strikes by going back to the time of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes</inline> in his effort to find something to use to bolster his arguments. </para>
    <para>The honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bury)</inline> has stressed the importance to Australia of its export trade. He mentioned the apple and pear growing industry, of which I have some knowledge in my own electorate. This industry is greatly influenced by seasonal conditions. It must try to export its products at a time when they will attract the best prices on overseas markets. In this respect we in Queensland have an advantage of a few weeks over the southern parts of Australia, from which apples and pears are also exported. If we have a hold-up for one week on the waterfront, the primary producers, who have battled with drought, hail and other adversities, lose their markets. They are likely to lose the whole profit of twelve months&#39; work because of some irresponsibility on the waterfront which receives the support of Opposition members. I would like to read a statement made by the  chairman  of the Federal Exporters Oversea Transport Committee, which is of vital interest to every primary producer and every exporter. He said - </para>
    <para>This Committee is seriously disturbed at present industrial conditions on the Australian waterfront, and the adverse effect that these cannot fail to have on the interests of exporters and producers and the national economy. </para>
    <para class="block">The disputes and issues involved should surely be the subject of arbitration, and not unilateral action on the part of the Waterside Workers&#39; Federation and its members. </para>
    <para>Interruptions in the work of loading and discharging vessels, in addition to damaging export markets, have, of course, a direct impact on the cost of the shipping services, and in the end affect freight rates. </para>
    <para class="block">The policy of this Government is to reduce costs, and freight is one of the biggest factors in costs in Australia. But our friends on the opposite side of the House do all they can to egg the waterside workers on to further industrial lawlessness. The waterside workers have never in the history of waterfront employment enjoyed wages and working conditions as good as those they have had in recent years. Until recently we had a record period of peace on the waterfront. We know who is behind this recent lawlessness. It is the Communist element in the waterfront unions. I know that Opposition members will not believe this, but they will have to bring themselves up to date. </para>
    <para>The Government introduced court controlled ballots to give the rank and file members control of the affairs of the unions. Opposition members opposed the introduction of these ballots. They support the idea of secret ballots, but they do not like court controlled ballots, because the Communists do not like them. The  36  men who decide the defence policy of the Australian Labour Party also decide this issue. But, thanks to court-controlled ballots, a nonCommunist was elected to the executive of the Waterside Workers Federation. This shocked the Communists and these strikes are designed to discredit him. The alleged purpose of the strikes - this also is lawless - is to support claims for increased margins, increased annual leave and other leave conditions. These issues, of course, should be decided by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. However, these people do not want arbitration; they want disruption in our community. </para>
    <para>In its efforts to ensure that the rank and file unionists receive justice, the Government has amended the conciliation and arbitration legislation. This does not suit the Communists. Most of our unions abide by arbitration, but those unions that are Communist-controlled do not. The Communists do not care about the average rank and file worker. The workers lose their pay when they are on strike, but the union secretaries still receive their salaries. This suits the Communist bosses. My friend, the honorable member for Bruce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Snedden),</inline> mentioned a stop-work meeting which was held in the Sydney stadium to support Fidel Castro. The Communist bosses of the Waterside Workers Federation concern themselves with such matters rather than with better conditions for the rank and file members. </para>
    <para>Penalties are provided for breaches of our civil laws and criminal laws. Why, therefore, should penalties not be provided for breaches of our arbitration laws? These unorthodox strikes are anti-social and penalties should be provided to deal with them. We know that if Labour were ever returned to office we would have more and more strikes, because Labour is pledged to remove the penalties for breaches of the arbitration laws and to remove the right to hold court-controlled ballots. What sort of chaos would we have if Labour ever became the Government? It is most important that all primary producers who are represented in this place by Labour members should note that Labour supports the kind of lawlessness that leads to increased freight rates and increased costs. </para>
    <para>The honorable member for East Sydney mentioned the conditions that caused some strikes. He went back about twelve months. Perhaps I could mention some instances that are right up to date. In Sydney, on 3rd April last, between 2 p.m. and 3.10 p.m., 243 members of the mechanical branch walked off 45 vessels in protest against the failure to secure increased margins. Between 2 p.m. and 3.30 p.m. 384 men were dismissed for refusing to re-form into manual gangs. A total of 191 men were discharged as being unemployable. The key men had gone and there was no work. At 3.45 p.m. waterside workers required to work all the time refused to accept meal money. Between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. 413 men were dismissed and 123 men were discharged as being unemployable. At 8.15 p.m. the only member of the mechanical branch employed on the evening shift walked off the job. A total of 22 vessels was involved in the refusals to break up gangs and to accept meal money. </para>
    <para>The honorable member for East Sydney had to go back twelve months, but this is up to date. I have lists of other instances of this irresponsible attitude in this vital indus try. I think it is time that the Australian people took full notice of this attitude. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. WHITLAM</inline>(Werriwa) &#91;4.18&#93;.- Tha honorable member for McPherson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Barnes)</inline> is unfortunately typical of so many primary producers and of their representatives in this place who attribute all Australia&#39;s trading problems to the waterside workers.  His  favorite gimmick for correcting this position is to have a secret ballot in the Waterside Workers Federation. Under the rules approved by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, the Waterside Workers Federation has always had secret ballots. There has never been an allegation of irregularity in those ballots. If there had been any irregularity, it would have been open to anybody in the federation, under the Chifley Government&#39;s 1949 legislation, to move to have a court-controlled ballot, as it is called. Attempts have been made in the federation and in many other unions to muster the minute percentage of the members which under the 1951 Holt legislation suffices to displace the rules of the union as approved by the Arbitration Commission and to substitute a postal ballot conducted by the Electoral Office. I aim to bring a bit of proportion into this argument. Listening to government speakers up to this stage, one would think than Australia was a strike-ridden country, that the waterside workers were responsible for most of the lost man-hours in Australia, and that the Waterside Workers Federation was responsible for the inefficiency that we all know occurs on the waterfront. </para>
    <para>I will refute the first allegation, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, by</inline> quoting from the editorial of the &#34; Financial Review&#34; of 11th October last. It quotes figures for the eight years ended 1960 given in the International Labour Office&#39;s &#34;Year Book of Labour Statistics&#34;. It gives the number of working days lost in comparable countries over those eight years and then relates them to the Australian population. In that period Australia lost 6,000,000 working days. With our population, the United States of America would have lost 13,000,000 working days; the United Kingdom would have lost 6,000,000; Japan would have lost 4,500,000; Italy would have lost nearly 9,000,000; France would have lost 5,500,000; and Canada would have lost 9,000,000. It appears, therefore, that trading countries comparable with Australia, in general, lost proportionately more man hours through strikes between 1952 and 1960 than Australia did. </para>
    <para>The next allegation is that the waterside workers are responsible for most of the man-hours lost. Last financial year 358,124 man-hours were lost through wharf stoppages. In the previous year 1,193,000 man-hours were lost through wharf stoppages. So far in this financial year the figure would be somewhere between those two figures. Of the man-hours lost in Australia, the greatest number is due to this Government&#39;s measures of November, 1960. If we assume - this is not unreasonable - that 50,000 fewer people were in employment throughout the years since that date than would have been in employment but for those measures, we find that 200,000,000 man-hours were lost in the two years following those measures. The man-hours lost on the waterfront through the quarrels between employers and employees represent less than 1 per cent, of that total. </para>
    <para>The final allegation is that the Waterside Workers Federation is responsible for the admittedly inefficient conditions on Australian wharfs. I go back to the analysis that was published by the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board in the first year of this Government&#39;s term of office. The board said - </para>
    <para>The state of affairs on the Australian waterfront has become almost everyday reading. Unfortunately, there is a general misconception as to the real cause of the problem. It is convenient and usual to blame wharf labour first and last . . . There is no parallel between the degree of efficiency of labour in productive employment and the present turn-round problem. The crux of that problem lies in the nonproductive proportion of working time by which 1 in every 4 hours of employment of labour is barren of cargo movement. </para>
    <para class="block">From another part of this report, it appears that- </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cockle,</inline>- For what year is that? </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. WHITLAM.</inline>- This is the report for the year 1949-50. From another part of the report, it appears that the degree of working time which was non-productive was 29 per cent, on the waterfront in Sydney and 27 per cent, on the waterfront in Melbourne. The overall percentage has since gone up. In 1957-58 it was 35.5 per cent., and in 1961-62 it was 37.7 per cent. This is due to the fact that management on the wharfs is notoriously inefficient. The report of the board for the year 1949-50 explains that in these terms - </para>
    <para>At the root of waterfront problems are the outmoded methods and techniques of management . . . </para>
    <para>The present position represents a challengewhich responsible management cannot afford to ignore - for a reconsideration of the approach to, and conduct of, stevedoring affairs. </para>
    <para class="block">In January, 1952, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Basten</inline> made a report on this matter. He pointed out that there was no direct contact or sense of respect between management and labour on the waterfront. As this was the only casual employment in Australia, he said -   it is not to be imagined that the man can feel he has any contractual relation with the succession of stevedoring companies who have been his employers and if he concludes that the employer in the industry is a legal fiction he may be very close to the truth. This is, indeed, casual employment and it is not surprising that the relations between employer and employee continue to be weak and mistrustful. </para>
    <para class="block">In the subsequent eleven years there has been no legislation which has made employment on the wharfs any less casual. The former Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline> used to be much more frank about the position. He said this in 1956, when anticipating the report of the Tait committee - </para>
    <para>It is a matter of unhappy notoriety that our waterfront performance is chronically bad. Performance is poor. Industrial relations are bad and have been bad for generations. The stevedoring industry has been rightly described more than once as a turbulent industry . . . </para>
    <para>I say quite frankly that, in my own judgment, the employers made a great mistake in not negotiating an agreement during the last dispute, when the opportunity offered. There was then an opportunity for the negotiation of a satisfactory agreement which might have been the beginning of an improved relationship. </para>
    <para class="block">A couple of months later the Tait committee brought in its report. It pointed out that the rise in stevedoring costs in Australia was not due to, and could not be accounted for by, any conduct of the employees; but was caused by the employers who did not have the incentive to be efficient. It said that they could always pass on their costs; that half the stevedoring companies were subsidiaries. of foreign shipping companies; and that another quarter of them were subsidiaries of interstate shipping companies. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cockle.-</inline>Who said that? </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. WHITLAM.</inline>- The Tait committee, which was appointed by this Government. The fact that the Government has not carried out its recommendations does not mean that the Government can refute its findings. The committee said that the majority of stevedoring companies were subsidiaries of foreign shipping companies and that they passed on their costs. The &#34; Sydney Morning Herald &#34;, in commenting on this aspect, said - </para>
    <para>The shipping industry does not have the same incentives to be efficient as other big industries. </para>
    <para class="block">So we should not complain about the waterside workers only, or principally, on the score of costs. </para>
    <para>A couple of months ago I heard, in New Guinea, that it costs more to bring cocoa from Lae to Sydney than from Ghana to Sydney. The cocoa is unloaded at the same port, so one must blame not the Sydney waterside workers but the foreign shippers for Lae cocoa costing more than Ghana cocoa. Again, we know that where there is efficient management, such as the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited provides at Port Kembla and Newcastle, stevedoring costs are lower. In the Estimates debate last year I quoted a letter which the  chairman  of directors of that company sent to me. He said - </para>
    <para>Although we are not aware of actual stevedoring costs in the United Kingdom and Europe we doubt whether they, are less than those applying at the Newcastle Steelworks wharf or at the Port Kembla Inner Harbour products berth. Also we are of the opinion that our loading rates at these points would compare favourably with those in the United Kingdom and Europe. </para>
    <para class="block">Where there is efficient management, Australian stevedoring costs are lower than those of other exporting countries. In other words, where there is efficient management we can compete with any other people in the world. </para>
    <para>This Parliament has power, under the Constitution, to pass laws with respect to trade and commerce with other countries and between the States. If we desire, we can pass workers&#39; compensation legislation for the stevedoring industry. Per years the </para>
    <para class="block">Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McMahon)</inline> has been telling us that he is seeking information on compensable accidents, but he never publishes the information. We can pass laws to provide for long-service leave. We have done that. We can pass laws to provide for higher pensions for waterside workers. That was done at Rotterdam, the biggest port in the world, by a Labour Minister in The Netherlands Government only three years ago. Thirty-five different authorities operate Australia&#39;s 100 ports. By co-operation with the State Governments we can have an efficient stevedoring industry with wharfs and machinery operated by a joint statutory body and men employed by that body. Such a body could not fail to be more effective than the present diverse authorities, trusts, boards and companies. In other words, by a combination of Commonwealth and State powers we can ensure that Australian maritime terminal facilities are in such hands as our railway terminal facilities have always been. </para>

      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. DEPUTY SPEAKER.-</inline>Order! The honorable member&#39;s time has expired. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McMAHON</inline>(Lowe - Minister for Labour and National Service) &#91;4.28&#93;. - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> as I understood the honorable member for Bruce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Snedden),</inline> who initiated this debate, he wished, first of all, to direct our attention or public attention to what was happening on the Sydney and Melbourne waterfronts and, more importantly, to find out where the Australian Labour Party stood in respect of the strikes that are now taking place. In June of last year I had a conference with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers Federation in which they agreed that it was preferable to settle their disputes by resort to conciliation and, if conciliation failed, then by resort to arbitration. That was an undertaking given to me by the federation and by the Australian Council of Trade Unions. </para>
    <para>For several months we had what may be regarded as an enviable record. I will not give all the details, but the loss of man hours was 10,000 in February last, 16,000 in January, 3,000 in December and 5,890 in November. This means that immediately following those discussions there was a lull on the waterfront and the number of strikes and stoppages was reduced to a minimum. </para>
    <para class="block">But I am prepared to forecast - I have not yet got the figures - &#39;that last month, the period about which we are talking, man hours lost will amount to more than 100,000 and will possibly be as high as 125,000. This indicates what I have tried to point out to the House for several years, namely, that these stoppages need not take place. They are engineered by groups of the Waterside Workers Federation, and particularly by the Sydney and Melbourne branches. My colleague asked: What is the cause of these disputes? The simple fact is that nobody can ever ascertain thencause. </para>
    <para>I have here a list of about 30 disputes that have occurred in the last few days. Men ceased work on the &#34; Shun Wing &#34;, which was loading scrap iron, on 12th March following a demand for 2s. 6d. an hour extra and provision of fresh milk twice a day, safety boots, soap and towels. That was the cause of that dispute, but in many cases the waterside workers do not state the cause of their dispute first and try to settle the matter by conciliation and arbitration. Instead they walk off the job and later make known the cause of their dispute. On 13th March, 76 men engaged on the day shift ceased work in circumstances similar to those I have already referred to. On the same day the &#34; Cape Grafton &#34; was loading scrap metal. Fifty-two men engaged on the evening shift failed to commence work following similar demands. Disputes arose on the Melbourne waterfront over manning schedules on the &#34;Iberic&#34;, the &#34;Straat Cook&#34;, the &#34;Argyllshire&#34;, the &#34;Middlesex &#34;, the &#34; Thorsgaard &#34; and the &#34; State of Travancore-Cochin &#34;. </para>
    <para>The pattern that has emerged from these recent disturbances shows that it is difficult to work out a pattern of disputes. The branch officials are not permitting the arbitration system to work, despite the promise made to me by the federation in June last year. Another important matter that must be recognized by the House is that in relation to two recent disputes, the disputes arose while officers of the federation were negotiating with the shipowners. That did not matter a boot to the executive of the Sydney branch. It pulled the men out. The federation did not know and the Australian Council of Trade Unions was not aware of the dispute or of the nature of it. </para>
    <para>Plenty of evidence exists to show that these disputes are intended to continue for some considerable time. Any one looking at the latest copy of &#34; Branch News &#34; published by the Sydney branch of the federation - I have a copy here - will see a statement by the Sydney branch executive that it intends to p jil on strikes whenever it thinks there is some justification for its action. There can be no doubt in the world that in Melbourne and Sydney these people are determined, if they can, to destroy the system of industrial arbitration as we know it in this country. I have no doubt that their intention is to destroy arbitration - to avoid a board of reference and to have direct access to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Ashburner - or, if they feel like it, to obtain their objectives by direct means. It does not matter what the Opposition says about this matter. It may pooh-pooh the claim that the Communists are in control in the ports of Sydney and Melbourne. The fact is that they are in control. Everybody knows that the objective of the Communist leadership in this country is to disorganize and disrupt not only our international trade but also our interstate trade. The Communists are achieving their objectives - against the wishes of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and certainly without its benediction. Who benefits from the losses on the waterfront? The first thing we must ask ourselves is: What do these losses mean to the men themselves? The honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> referred to what had happened with regard to working hours on the waterfront. He referred to what had happened with regard to weekly hours but he failed to point out that during the years 1953-54 to 1961-62- despite what Tom Nelson said in a letter to the &#34; Sydney Morning Herald &#34; on 2nd April - the average weekly earnings on the waterfront in Australia had increased from &#163;16 6s. 3d. to &#163;19 2s. lOd. In the same period weekly average gross earnings increased to &#163;21 10s. 7d. I am glad that the waterside workers are getting those amounts. I would like to see the men get more and they could get more if the Sydney and Melbourne branches did not consistently pull on these futile and irresponsible stoppages. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ward.</inline>- What happened to the shipowners&#39; profits in the same period? </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McMAHON.</inline>- I am answering the honorable member&#39;s question. I have told him what is happening in terms of average wages and gross payments despite the fact, as stated by the honorable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. E. James Harrison),</inline> that in Sydney there has been a fall of &#163;2 and in Melbourne a fall of &#163;3.  If this is so it proves the point made by my colleague. If the earnings of waterside workers elsewhere have increased so substantially while those of waterside workers in Communistdominated ports have fallen by &#163;2 and &#163;3 a week, surely it proves that there is no necessity for those losses and that the men themselves have been persecuted by their Communist leaders. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. &#163;.</inline>James Harrison. - That was in your good year. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McMAHON.</inline>- It does not matter when it was. If the men in Sydney and Melbourne have lost those amounts in recent years while the men in other ports have received increases, it can be ascribed only to one cause and that is that the federation has lost control of Sydney under Tom Nelson and of Melbourne under its branch officials. This state of affairs cannot be in the interests of the men. Can it be in the interests of the trade union movement? I hesitate to say this, but only to-day the Australian Council of Trade Unions has called the federation to Melbourne to discuss the disputes. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Calwell.</inline>- How do you know? </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McMAHON.</inline>- I have read about it in the newspapers. You are always full of information. You should have found out about this before. You are always a little behind in your information. Read to-day&#39;s newspapers and you will find out. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Calwell.</inline>- I did not talk about the Menzies-Chifley Government. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McMAHON.-</inline>I regret that mistake but you should have been honoured that I mentioned <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley.</inline> I certainly did not try to misrepresent the position by claiming that it was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley</inline> who introduced the legislation. Mine was a slip of the tongue; yours was a slip of the mind. </para>
    <para>It must be recognized that these strikes are contrary to the interests of the trade union movement. As my friend the honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bury)</inline> said, the disruption of our trade is against the interests of all Australians. If the present practice in Sydney and Melbourne continues inevitably there will be a slowing up of trade. This will be followed by a slowing up of manufacturing and the situation will work its way through to the employees and to all sections of industry. As the honorable member for Mcpherson <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Barnes)</inline> said, this state of affairs could lead to disastrous losses by some sections of primary producers, particularly at the moment those people producing apples and pears for export. The trade unions have a big responsibility to take action to get the waterside workers back to work and to keep them working consistently. One of the reasons why we initiated this debate was to develop public opinion about what these men are doing to Australia&#39;s future. We believed that if we could make public opinion sufficiently hostile to the officials, not the men, of the Waterside Workers Federation in time the men would take control and stop the futile acts in which their officials are involving them to-day. </para>
    <para>What are the remedies in this case? Let us consider the remedies which are available under the law of the land. Two major remedies are available, first, against the men themselves, and, secondly, against the Waterside Workers Federation. The men themselves already have lost over &#163;300,000 in attendance money. This money would be in their pockets but for the fact that Nelson and his cohorts, his Communist friends, have pulled them out on strike, deprived them of their day&#39;s pay and also of a total of &#163;300,000 in attendance money. The men themselves must realize that these losses have been caused deliberately by the people whom the Labour Party to-day is supporting in the House. First the honor,able member for East Sydney and then, in somewhat muted voice, the honorable member for Blaxland supported the federation&#39;s activities. Under the influence of the federation and the Labour Party, the men have lost a very large amount of money. Secondly, yesterday a general ban of indefinite duration was imposed by the Commonwealth Industrial Court on wharf stoppages in all Australian ports. When  stating his views yesterday <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Spicer said - </para>
    <para>The reasons for the new order were strengthened by the conduct of the Waterside Workers Federation over the past three years and re-affirmed by material in the union&#39;s publications of the intention to engage in industrial action to obtain certain claims. </para>
    <para class="block">Not arbitration, not conciliation, but industrial action! <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Dunphy remarked - </para>
    <para>Orders restricting stoppages had proved effective in 99 per cent, of cases. A lot of trade union leaders and trade unionists have a respect for law and order and they uphold the Court&#39;s decision. </para>
    <para class="block">But not so the gentleman of the Waterside Workers Federation. If these prohibitions are not observed they are defying the law and even the prohibition of the court itself. The steamship owners can make an application for a penalty under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. These are the legal remedies. </para>
    <para>At this point I want to direct attention, not so much to the legal remedies which are available, as to certain other important factors. The first is that some months ago, when a election was held for the office of general secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation, the men did not vote for Tom Nelson, who stood as a Communist candidate, but for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charlie</inline> Fitzgibbon, who stood as an Australian Labour Party or rank and file candidate. When Charlie Fitzgibbon was elected the first person to claim credit for this was the incredible gentleman from Melbourne, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell).</inline></para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline>Calwell. -  It was not incredible. I supported him from the beginning. I urged him to stand. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline>McMAHON.- The honorable gentleman had nothing to do with Fitzgibbon^ victory. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Calwell.</inline>- You are becoming sillier every day. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McMAHON.</inline>- &#39;If the honorable gentleman did have anything to do with Fitzgibbon^ victory, what is he doing now? Why does he not give Charlie Fitzgibbon some support to help him overcome the trouble which he is having with other federation officials? Why does not the honorable gentleman stand on his hind legs and be counted, and when the next election is being held in the federation state that the Labour Party supports the rank and file candidate? One way in which the waterside workers themselves can come to grips with this problem is by a ballot. </para>
    <para>The second important factor is that the A.C.T.U. must now realize that the activities of the Sydney and Melbourne branches of the Federation are destroying our overseas trade and preventing us from earning export income. If the A.C.T.U. plays its part - a part it can play because of its great political influence as one of the great institutions of this country - I am certain that, through the ballot-box and through the activities of the trade union movement, there can be a drastic reduction in time lost on the waterfront, with immense benefit to Australia, and the destruction of the Communist element on the Sydney waterfront. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline>CALWELL (Melbourne- Leader of the Opposition) &#91;4.44&#93;. - The Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McMahon),</inline> as usual, made a mess of his case. He adduced nothing by way of solid argument in support of the case which was advanced by the honorable member for Bruce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Snedden),</inline> who did not do much good for himself either. He rehashed all the old stereotyped arguments, the halftruths and the complete falsehoods, and carried on the smear campaign that is always directed against the waterside workers by honorable members on the Government side, who support the shipowners. </para>
    <para>The waterfront industry is a turbulent one because of the casual nature of the work. It is the only casual industry remaining in Australia. The Chifley Government did more than any government before it, and certainly more than the present Government, to decasualize the industry. This Government has not continued the work of decasualization which was commenced by the Chifley Government. In addition, there is the problem of mechanization on the waterfront. The honorable member for East Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> touched the centre of the problem when he said that over  1,000  fewer men were employed in this industry this year than was the case last year. Any one who knows anything about the waterfront has only to consider what has happened in recent times to appreciate the truth of the honorable member&#39;s statement. The bulk handling of sugar has thrown hundreds of watersiders out of work at all the Queensland sugar ports from Cairns to Bundaberg and even to Gladstone. The bulk loading of sugar concentrate at Townsville has thrown watersiders out of work, as has the bulk loading of coal at Gladstone. The roll-on-roll-off ships - the &#34; Princess of Tasmania&#34; and the &#34;Bass Trader&#34; which operate from Melbourne to Devonport - both have thrown out of work persons engaged on the waterfront and in all the ancillary occupations. When the &#34; Empress of Australia&#34; is completed more watersiders will be thrown out of work in Sydney and Hobart. Now the Government proposes to extend the roll-on-roll-off system to Queensland. </para>
    <para>What has the Government done to help any of the people who have been thrown out of work? It has merely said, &#34;Let them find other work&#34;. During the last election campaign Labour proposed that a special section should be created within the Department of Labour and National Service to train men displaced from jobs for other work. We do not regard displaced Australian workers as persons who should be discarded and thrown aside. We are not interested in shipowners&#39; profits, as Government supporters are. We believe that people who are thrown out of work have the same right to live and the same right to raise their families as has any other section of the community. Whether the men are watersiders or any one else, if they have been affected by mechanization or automation they are worthy of consideration. They have the right to live. We defend that right. But not a word was said by any honorable member on the Government side about that aspect, although a good deal was said in criticism of the watersiders. Government supporters claim that the watersiders will not do this and will not do that, but the number of jobs on the waterfront is decreasing steadily and continuously and the watersiders claim that if their colleagues are being thrown out of work because of the increased use of mechanical aids then more men should be included in each gang so that the process of elimination will be eased somewhat. However, the shipowners have said that that cannot be done. </para>
    <para>When the men take strike action they are penalized under the provisions of the exist ing legislation. The Government claims that they should be penalized. When there is a strike-free period the Government says, &#34;The workers love us so much that they work for us, so we must be the best possible government which could be elected &#34;. However, when industrial turmoil created by the inability of the shipowners and the Government to understand the workers&#39; needs results in strikes the Government says, &#34; It is all due to a Communist conspiracy &#34;. </para>
    <para>Let us consider the position in Melbourne. The watersiders in Melbourne have an Australian Democratic Labour Party president and a Communist secretary, both of whom have been unbeatable in recent elections. The committee there is made up of Communists and Labour men, as is the case also in New South Wales. There are Communists holding office in many unions and they are there because of the workers&#39; discontent with prevailing conditions. Wherever men and women in industry are satisfied that they are getting a fair deal, Communist influence is negligible or dwindling; it is certainly not increasing. The member for Bruce said that the Waterside Workers Federation is Communistcontrolled. It is nothing of the sort. There are more Labour people in it than anything else, and even some Australian Democratic Labour Party supporters, who are certainly not Communists. </para>
    <para>The honorable member then had the effrontery to say that some of the 36 men who constitute the conference of the Australian Labour Party are Communists. That is a complete falsehood. There is not a vestige of truth in that statement and there is nothing to support it, but the old smear is cast over Labour men and their characters. We will face this fight outside this House, if we have to face it. We know what we want to do to help the waterside workers and every other section of the Australian community. We know that Australians are a fair-minded people who want to do justice to every section of the community. </para>
    <para>The people know that the watersiders are engaged in a turbulent industry. I have lived all my life near the Melbourne waterfront and have seen the watersiders going to work over a period of more than 40 years. I remember them during the depression years and I remember how much consideration they got from the employers in those days and how little they get to-day from many people. You cannot blame the waterside workers for the fact that there is not one ship owned by an Australian company operating on the Australian coast to-day. The ships were not driven off the Australian coast by Australian workers. They were taken off the coast because they were sold abroad by their owners and we are bereft of any real shipping, other than the ships constructed by the Australian National Line, which was established by the Chifley Government. </para>
    <para>The honorable member for Bruce talked a lot of nonsense about the meeting held in Melbourne in support of Castro. It would not have been held for that purpose. Castro&#39;s name was brought up at a meeting called for an industrial purpose and supporters of the Democratic Labour Party, who constitute anything up to one-third of the membership of the Waterside Workers Federation in Melbourne, supported the holding of that meeting. They attended the meeting in force, and they attend meetings in force in Sydney also. All the meetings held in Melbourne and Sydney to discuss the subject-matter of the question raised by the honorable member for Bruce were largely attended and the decisions reached were unanimous. Every one present voted in favour of them, because the waterside workers are fighting for a better state of affairs than they now have, and they know that unless they fight now for something they will soon be in a still worse condition than they are. </para>
    <para>The honorable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Bury),</inline> this elongated academic who wormed himself into Cabinet one week and talked himself out of it the next, said that the waterside workers would not work ships in Sydney, so that apples could be loaded in Hobart. As a matter of fact, the &#34;Orestes &#34; was worked in Sydney by the waterside workers on the day when the Queen was there. They did not need to work, because it was a public holiday, but they worked so that the ship could go to Hobart in order that apples could be loaded. And they did it at the request of the apple-growers of Tasmania. Of course, those things would not be known to the honorable member for Wentworth! &#91;Extension of time granted.&#93; </para>
    <para>I thank the House for its generosity, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> The honorable member for Wentworth talked about the hold-up in respect of meat for export. On that occasion the waterside workers in Sydney asked for an extra man per gang. The meat was taken away, after the request had been refused. It was taken back into the freezers and, having been re-frozen, was brought back again and was loaded into the hold by six members of the Waterside Workers Federation and seven other men who were employed. Seven waterside workers could have done the job. It turned out to be much more costly in the long run than would otherwise have been the case, but no one would expect the member for Wentworth to know that or anything else in that regard. </para>
    <para>The Minister for Labour and National Service says I did not support <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fitzgibbon.</inline> He called me, &#34; the incredible member for Melbourne &#34;. &#34; Incredible &#34; means something that cannot be believed. I believe I am believeable, or can be believed in. At any rate this can be believed - that I did support the candidature of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fitzgibbon</inline> the moment he announced himself. What the Minister and most other members opposite apparently do not know is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fitzgibbon</inline> won his election in a ballot which was not court controlled. He won in straight ballot controlled by the Waterside Workers Federation and it was a clean ballot. </para>
    <para>The member for Bruce says that we do not believe in clean ballots. Those are the words he used. He says that we believe in the abolition of secret ballots in union elections. We have never once said that What we have said is that we believe in the Chifley legislation to prevent corrupt ballots, but would repeal the Menzies Government&#39;s legislation. Most unions conduct thenballots properly. Some invoke the aid of the Commonwealth electoral authorities and some have independent authorities controlling their elections, but in almost all cases the elections are clean. Where they are not, we believe in interference; but it was wrong for the honorable member to say what he said. </para>
    <para>He also said that we do not agree with the penalties provided; that is, you cannot have a system of arbitration unless you have penalties attached to it. We set down - when dealing with the legislation recently before this House - the sections in the arbitration act which we would repeal. The honorable member cannot say we are against all penalties. He knows that what we say is right, but he is careless with the truth. If he performed as badly in the court as he performs here it is a wonder that he gets any briefs at all. As a matter of fact, I think he is a briefless barrister anyhow. </para>
    <para>Honorable members opposite talked about productivity. We are the only people in this House who are really concerned about productivity. We know that the more we increase the volume of productivity in Australia the better it is for the worker and for everybody. We want to increase productivity at a far greater rate than this Government is increasing it. An increase in productivity of 4.33 per cent, in one year and 1.7 per cent, in another year, with an average of 2.5 per cent, over a period of years, is not good enough for the safety and security of Australia. If that is the best this Government can do, the sooner we have another government the better. </para>
    <para>The Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Waterside Workers Federation are meeting to-night, as the Minister has discovered. He said he read this item in a newspaper, but he must have got an advance copy, because I did not read it there. When those organizations meet to-night I hope they will find a solution to this problem. Nobody wants turbulence on the waterfront or anywhere else, because the people who suffer most from it are the workers themselves. The workers never engage lightly in these struggles if they can find some other means for the rectification of their grievances. </para>
    <para>We do not mind this challenge to-day and we commend the member for Bruce for bringing the matter forward. We think it has reacted on him. We think he and his colleagues have been worsted in this fight. They thought they would do something to put us in the wrong in the eyes of the Australian public. We believe that our case, understood by the Australian people, will show that the honorable members opposite who raise these issues are just a lot of humbugs. </para>

    <para>That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1913-1960, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to this House: - Extension of the Stokes Hill wharf and provision of an additional cargo shed at Darwin, Northern Territory. </para>
    <para class="block">The proposal provides for an extension of 100 feet by 160 feet of the wharf in a westerly direction, widening the last 160 feet of the existing wharf, and the erection of an additional cargo shed at a total estimated cost of &#163;430,000. The committee has reported favorably on the proposal, subject to the lowering, widening and flattening of the canopy at the rear of the cargo shed and further consideration being given to the method of fendering and the possibility of using overhead-slung doors in the rear wall of the shed. The design of the canopy has been amended and the suggestions regarding the shed doors and the fendering system are being investigated. </para>

      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. NELSON</inline>(Northern Territory) &#91;5.3&#93;. - This work urgently requires to be done; I do not think there is any more urgently needed work in the Northern Territory. Anybody who has visited Darwin and has seen the waterfront area must have noted the chaotic conditions that exist there. Storage facilities are totally inadequate for the requirements of the port. It is obvious that the double handling and shifting of cargo that takes place on that wharf must add to the overall costs. The sooner this work is started, the better it will be for all concerned. </para>
    <para>I am pleased to note that the committee has agreed to extend the wharf so that it will stretch for 700 feet in a westerly direction. I would have liked the committee to report favorably on the suggestion that the wharf be widened over the whole of its length, thereby providing greater facilities for the handling of cargo. However, it is better that the proposed work should proceed than that a larger project should be held up. The proposal provides for the concrete paving of the whole of the new wharf area. The existing wharf has timber decking, which creates difficulties in moving equipment. We hope that in the future provision will be made for concrete paving for the whole of the wharf. </para>
    <para>I had hoped that the committee would decide to proceed with the whole of the suggested wharf extension, because Darwin is a port with an increasing volume of civil traffic and there is also a possibility of an increase in defence traffic. If the mineral resources of the northern area of Australia are developed, it will be necessary to make provision at Darwin for the bulk handling of ores and other cargoes of that nature. I would have liked to see those factors taken into consideration, but I am quite satisfied that what is now proposed will be a move in a direction where action is urgently required1. I support the proposal. </para>

    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. NEILSON</inline>(Northern Territory)  &#91;5.8&#93;. -  This is another project that I feel should be dealt with urgently. It relates to engineering services to cater for the spread of the city of Darwin. Unless facilities of this nature are provided or are extended in advance of demand, hardships are likely to occur. This proposal relates to the subdivision of Rapid Creek. </para>
    <para>Unless building blocks are made available, the demand for housing cannot be met. Over the years, in Darwin and other centres of the Northern Territory a scarcity of building blocks has forced up building costs to the individual far beyond a fair level. It is only by planning ahead and by providing blocks for home-building at a rate in proportion to the demand that housing costs can be reduced to a reasonable level. The sooner the services in this subdivision are brought up to date, the better it will be for all concerned. In this connexion I will give an example which appears in the committee&#39;s report. There is a backlog in the housing branch of the administration of  245  homes. In the  1963-64  estimates there will be provision for only  125  homes. Thus a backlog of  120  homes will be carried into the next year. This is not good enough. We believe that an effort should be made to bring housing in Darwin right up to date, because the city is the centre for a fast-developing and very important area. After all, the cost of providing the accommodation required there would not be very great, and adequate accommodation would mean a very great deal to the residents. Unless we get proper housing in Darwin, of course, we shall never have a stable community there, because we shall never get people to settle there permanently. </para>
    <para>The report of the Public Works Committee dealt also with the deferring of a proposal for an additional water storage tank of  500,000  gallons capacity. This has been deferred pending an investigation into the whole of the water requirements of Darwin. Again, we believe that the water supply for the city is slipping into arrears, as it were. It is time the supply was brought up to date and improved sufficiently to cater not only for existing requirements but also for requirements for some years ahead. An adequate water supply is urgently needed, and the sooner it is provided, the better. As I said earlier, delays in providing a proper water supply cause delays in the surveying and throwing open of blocks of land, thereby forcing up the cost of land to the community. This should not happen, and the sooner the situation is rectified, the better. </para>

      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. NELSON</inline>(Northern Territory) &#91;5.12&#93;. - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> the report of the Public Works Committee highlights the seriousness of the water position in Alice Springs. We believe that the water services of the town are at least two to three years behind present requirements. An investigation of the situation has just been undertaken and an attempt is now being made to remedy the present critical position. Water restrictions have been in force for some months. Unless the rain that has fallen in central Australia within the last few days causes the Todd River to run through the town, the situation will become much more critical than it is at present. </para>
    <para>We believe that planning should have been undertaken years ago to provide for the future water requirements of the town by, first, undertaking a survey of the surface storage potential of the surrounding area and, secondly, providing for the exploitation of the underground resources that are just now being revealed. As a result of the investigation recently made by the Public Works Committee, three bores will be put down beyond Heavitree Gap, eight or ten miles to the south of the town. Nobody knows for sure whether these supplies will toe permanent. Experience of the existing supplies suggests that these bores could peter out in the nottoofardistant future. If that happens, we in the town of Alice Springs shall again find ourselves in the position that we are in now. No survey of the potential for surface water storage in the area has been made. I would have thought that the storage of surface water would have been the cheapest form of water conservation of the lot. </para>
    <para>As a result of the tapping of underground water by the three bores to be put down to the south of the town, we may get immediate relief. I do not know whether this will permanently improve the situation, but I hope it will. In the meantime, efforts should be made to assess the potential of the surrounding area for the storage of surface water so that dams and other installations can be provided to meet future requirements. </para>

    <para>The proposal provides for the construction in two stages of a primary and infants&#39; school at a total estimated cost of &#163;325,000. The Public Works Committee has reported favorably on the proposal, subject to recommendations that some showers be provided at the school and that the tuckshop be relocated so as not to intrude into the covered assembly area. These modifications will be included in stage 2 of the school.

      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. NELSON</inline>(Northern Territory) &#91;5.16&#93;.  - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> a very illuminating part of the report of the Public Works Committee deals with the accommodation at the existing schools in Alice Springs. I think it will be well worth my while to read this part of the report to illustrate the point that I want to make. Beginning at paragraph 3 of the report, the committee deals with the Hartley-street school, and states - </para>
    <para>The longer established of the two schools is the Hartley Street School where 334 children are enrolled. </para>
    <para>The school has developed piecemeal and now consists of nine classrooms - two are in the original building, two are in a &#34;  Hawkesly  &#34; aluminium building and five are in &#34;Sydney Williams &#34; type pre-fabricated buildings. In addition, the library is being used as a classroom. The 34 children in primary Grade 7 are accommodated at the High School. </para>
    <para>The school site comprises li acres with only J acre of playing space available. The inadequacy of this space is accentuated by the fact that many of the children are old for the classes they attend. </para>
    <para class="block">That highlights the school situation in Alice Springs. A total of 334 children have only three-quarters of an acre of playing space at the school in Hartley-street. It is no wonder that the Public Works Committee, in its report, calls for immediate action on the construction of stage 1 of the Traeger Park school, just south of the hospital, near the centre of the town. We know that attempts have been made to provide more adequately for secondary school children in Alice Springs and that the situation is improving in that respect. But primary school facilities are not adequate, and we hope that the completion of stage 1 of the Traegar Park school - to be followed rapidly, I hope, by stage 2 - will at least cope with the present requirements for primary education. </para>
    <para>In Alice Springs, we have to provide not only for the education of the local children; we have to provide also for the schooling of the children of the outback areas who are not educated by correspondence. Institutions such as Griffiths House, the convents and hostels conducted by the Presbyterian Church of Australia accommodate a lot of children from the outlying areas who come to Alice Springs for their education, and it is up to this Government to keep abreast of the demand for school facilities in the town. </para>
    <para>An attempt to provide for technical education not only in Alice Springs but also in other parts of the Northern Territory is long overdue, and I hope that something will be done in the very near future to provide this kind of training, which at present cannot be obtained in the Territory. This is a phase of education that has been sadly neglected there. But it must be provided for if we are to educate and retain our young people in the north. If young people in the Territory want technical training at present, they have to go south for it. When they go south for training, they take jobs in the south and are lost to the Northern Territory. If provision for technical education were made at Darwin and Alice Springs we could retain those young people and put them to work so that they would be an asset to the north, instead of being lost to the other parts of Australia. </para>
    <para>I trust that the commencement of this work will not be delayed. The sooner stage 1 is completed the better, the sooner stage 2 is commenced the better, and the sooner provision is made for technical education the better for the whole of the Northern Territory. </para>

    <para>AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL UNIVERSITY BILL 1963. </para>
    <para class="block">Second Reading. </para>
    <para>Debate resumed from 28th March (vide page 160), on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Menzies - </para>
    <para class="block">That the bill be now read a second time. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BEAZLEY</inline>(Fremantle) &#91;5.25&#93;.- The Opposition supports this measure. It will be recalled that some six years ago the Australian National University was given control - as one of its scientific research activities - of the Mount Stromlo Observatory, which for many years was the Commonwealth Observatory at Mount Stromlo. The Government has, I think, come up against the problem that the Australian National University, in conducting its astronomical scientific research, may have to acquire, by resumption, various sites in the Commonwealth, and such acts of acquisition could be the subject of legal challenge. The Commonwealth has no power over universities, except in its own territories. Nothing in the Constitution suggests that there is a power to conduct universities, and such a challenge against the Commonwealth might be successful. However, the Commonwealth has power to conduct astronomical and meteorological observations, and so the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Menzies)</inline> has suggested the addition of a section to the Australian National University Act, to read as follows: - 6a. The powers of the University extend to the making of astronomical and meteorological observations in any part of the Commonwealth. </para>
    <para class="block">The activities of the university thus rest on the statutory power of the Commonwealth over astronomical and meteorological observations. </para>
    <para>It is tempting to turn to other fields in which one might find that Commonwealth activity was doubtful. Nothing in the Constitution says that the Commonwealth can conduct scientific and industrial research, and it seems that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization is always very careful not to resume land. It is also, perhaps, doubtful whether the Commonwealth can conduct television activities, but as a result of developments in connexion with Rippon Lea we may see some decision later with relation to such activities. But there is no doubt whatever about the Commonwealth&#39;s capacity to conduct astronomical activities. </para>
    <para>The university has been engaging in three searches, one of which has been completed. The first search was for a site for the Mount Stromlo field station. The second was for an observatory site for major instrumental development, and that second project has apparently been enlarged to embrace the wider idea of establishing a British Commonwealth southern observatory. The report of the Australian National University for 1961 says this: - </para>
    <para>Unexpected delays have reduced the urgency of the second project. Early in 1961 the establishment of a British Commonwealth Southern Observatory with a 120-inch reflector as the main instrument, was discussed but no conclusions have been reached. As a result, the project is presently in abeyance, an unfortunate fact in view of the important role that a Commonwealth Southern Observatory might have played - and still can play in the overall development programme for astronomy in Australia. </para>
    <para class="block">The Mount Stromlo astronomers feel that they must continue a vigorous search for a site for the major telescope development which is essential if Australian astronomy is to retain its present place. They have been testing various mountain sites around the Commonwealth. Nine or ten are mentioned in the 1961 report. But since the 1961 report was published the ideas concerning the British Commonwealth southern observatory have changed somewhat, and the desire of the university at the present time is not for a 120-inch telescope but for a 150-inch reflector. Professor Bok, in a paper that he submitted, had this to say - </para>
    <para>Australian and British astronomers appear to be agreed upon the desirability of a  ISO-inch  Reflector as the basic instrument for the proposed British Commonwealth Southern Observatory. An instrument with an aperture of  ISO  inches should provide in Australia a major telescope that need not take second place to any now in the planning stage. Experience overseas has demonstrated that a 120-inch Reflector, while exceedingly useful, is rather on the small side by modern standards and, furthermore, that it is too small to permit the astronomer to observe directly at the prime focus. As a scientific investment, a  ISO-inch  Reflector is clearly the best buy. </para>
    <para>The plan for a  ISO-inch  Reflector for Australia received strong support from the leaders in the astronomical profession, who attended the recent International Symposium on &#34; The Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds&#34;, held during March in Canberra and in Sydney. The  President  of the International Astronomical Union, Professor V. A. Ambartsumian, specifically endorsed the proposal, which has also received strong personal support from the Astronomer Royal, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Woolley. </para>
    <para>Honorable members will recall that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Woolley was at one time the Commonwealth Astronomer and became Professor of Astronomy at the Australian </para>
    <para class="block">National University before going to the United Kingdom as Astronomer Royal. Professor Bok has made certain estimates as to cost. He said - </para>
    <para>My personal estimate places the total cost at approximately six million pounds Australian, with seven million pounds Australian appearing to be a safe maximum. This capital expenditure will be spread over seven or eight years, with the annual expenditure initially at the rate of approximately one-quarter of a million pounds, to increase to one million pounds annually after about three years. Provisionally, equal sharing of costs by Britain and Australia seems to be called for, but it may of course be that other Commonwealth Nations, Canada or India, for example, might wish to participate in the scheme from the start. </para>
    <para class="block">It is certainly to be hoped that they do. While we on the Opposition side give the Government full support for the legal change that will make these astronomical activities possible, we urge the Government to try to conclude agreements with either the United Kingdom alone or with a number of other Commonwealth countries to make this work possible. We also ask the Government to ensure that the observatory, when set up, is equipped with the finest instruments it is now possible to acquire so that the work done in astronomical research in Australia will be of the highest quality. </para>
    <para>There is one other aspect of this matter. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Menzies),</inline> following section 31 sub-section (viii) of the Australian Constitution, is also empowering the university to undertake meteorological activities anywhere in the Commonwealth. I understand that at the moment the university has no such projects in mind, but I could be wrong in saying this. The main urgency is on the astronomical side. While the Government is conferring upon the university the legal power to carry out these activities, we hope that it will give the university the financial ability to carry out the activities in an optimum manner. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. WENTWORTH</inline>(Mackellar) &#91;5.34&#93;. - I not only support the bill but I also find myself in very warm agreement with the remarks just made by the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beazley).</inline> This may seem to be a small bill, but it deals with a subject that can be of considerable importance. I think it would be a good idea if the House took this opportunity to review some of the progress that Australian science has made in this field and to place on record its pride in the achievement of certain Australian scientists. lt is not given to a small country to lead the world in many directions, but Australia has been able to give a world lead in some directions. Perhaps the House does not realize the world importance of the work done by Australian pioneers in the field of radio astronomy. I have in mind such men as the late <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Pawsey, Dr. Bowen, Dr. Bolton,</inline> Mills, Christiansen and Wild. These people have opened -for the world a new window in the universe. The pioneering work was done here, and we in Australia still lead in radio astronomy. I believe that when this sort of situation emerges, it is up to us as Australians to back those who have shown by their merits and their achievements what can be done. These people deserve recognition and, more than that, they deserve support. </para>
    <para>As we know, our progress in this field has come about through the co-operation of various instrumentalities. One would, I think, name three of them. One is the Commonwealth Observatory under the control of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Bok,</inline> who has been mentioned by the honorable member for Fremantle. The second is the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, which perhaps has played the main part. The third is the University of Sydney, particularly the School of Physics. </para>
    <para>Radio astronomy is a new science that has developed in the post-war period. It was found that in addition to the shortlength visible rays of light - the optical rays - certain objects in space emitted intense radiation at long wave lengths. We were then faced with the problem of focusing this radiation so that we could pinpoint the locations in the sky from which it was coming. The surprise finding was that the intense waves were coming not necessarily from the brightest objects in the sky. In other words, we were able to open a new window in the universe through which we could locate objects, the existence of which had not been suspected. As I said, this work was pioneered in Australia and Australia still leads in this new and vital aspect of the science of astronomy. We are receiving international recognition. The honorable member for Fremantle mentioned a conference which was held recently in Canberra and Sydney. I think the participants in that conference were impressed by the lead that Australia is giving. </para>
    <para>We have at present two or three projects under way in this field of radio astronomy. We have had international support, financial and otherwise, in them. It is no bad thing for Australia that we are attracting from other countries support in this branch of science. We are doing big things in this field. First, I would mention the big radio telescope at Parkes. This is a big movable dish 210 feet across, which is comparable only to the Jodrell Bank instrument in Great Britain. It is better than the Jodrell Bank instrument because it has been built to finer tolerances and can use a fineness of focus which no other large instrument in this field in the world can even approach. From Parkes momentous new discoveries will probably flow. This is something in which Australia will be the focus of world attention. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Howson.</inline>- Will it do a better job than the Jodrell Bank telescope? </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. WENTWORTH.</inline>- Yes, it will do a much better job. Although it is not quite as big as the Jodrell Bank instrument, it has been built to much finer tolerances. From memory, the Jodrell Bank instrument has tolerances of four or five inches, but this instrument has tolerances of under half an inch and down to one-eighth of an inch. That is particularly important because it allows focussing of the 21 centimetre hydrogen line which is outside the range of the Jodrell Bank instrument. Whilst I am not competent to discuss these technicalities, from having conversations with Professor Bok and other people I know that at Parkes we have an instrument that is away ahead of anything available in this field anywhere else in the world. </para>
    <para>Not very far from Canberra, at Hoskinstown, a very large Mills Cross is under construction. It is not yet complete. It will not be completed for a year or two. It is a fixed instrument. It has not the versatility of the Parkes instrument which is capable of traversing the whole sky, but it gives a higher degree of resolution. In certain respects it will do better work than the Parkes instrument, although in other respects it will not be able to cover the work that the Parkes instrument does. The Mills Cross is an Australian invention. We have to wait with some hope to see what this new instrument will turn up. There is every reason to believe that it will be one of mankind&#39;s most significant probes into the nature of the universe. </para>
    <para>At Narrabri we have two instruments - a solar interferometer which is studying the sun, and the new intensity interferometer which is able to give angular diameters of the stars and, for the brightest of them, to determine their distances, their positions and their sizes. These are very important instruments, not only to Australian astronomy but to world astronomy. We have to realize that here we are really leading the field. I have mentioned the three chief sites of radio astronomy. But if we are to get the fullest value from those instruments, it is necessary that we should be able to correlate them with optical astronomy. </para>
    <para>Very many of the radio sources are coming from objects which are too faint to be perceived by any but a very big optical telescope. Our existing telescopes are not capable of working up to the full value of the radio instruments that we already possess. For that reason, among others, we need to have a large optical telescope in Australia. I believe that the honorable member for Fremantle was perfectly correct in supporting this. I also believe that he gave correctly the technical reasons why we should be going for an instrument with a 150-inch aperture rather than one with a 120-inch aperture. As he said, it is more convenient to have the observer placed at the prime focus than to reflect the light from a mirror. Because of the physical size of the human body, and the space it occupies at the prime focus, it is desirable to have the bigger instrument. </para>
    <para>We should thus be thinking of getting this big telescope under way. There are other reasons why we should be thinking of a big telescope besides the undoubted need for it in conjunction with our world leadership in radio astronomy. In the southern hemisphere, so far, there are no big telescopes. I think the best ones are the 74-in. instrument at Canberra and a 74-in. instrument in South Africa. That, of course, is very much less than what is available for the northern hemisphere, in many places. In many respects, the southern hemisphere is the more important and more interesting hemisphere for astronomers. The centre of the Milky Way passes over the southern zenith and not the northern zenith, and the Magellanic clouds - the closest galaxies to our Milky Way - are best observed from the southern hemisphere and not from the northern hemisphere. </para>
    <para>For that reason, astronomers all over the world are now embarking on a programme of getting big instruments into the southern hemisphere. I understand that the United States of America has a project for an instrument in Chile and that the European astronomers have a project for an instrument in either Chile or South Africa. The British Commonwealth should think of its instrument being placed here in Australia. This is the right place for it. South Africa is no longer a member of the Commonwealth. For practical purposes, tha. leaves Australia and New Zealand. New Zealand has the attraction of having higher mountains - it is desirable to place the telescope high up, if possible, in order to minimize the atmospheric interference with observation - but as a site it suffers certainly from one defect and probably from two. </para>
    <para>The certain defect is that it is too near the south magnetic pole and lies in the zone of auroral intensity, which interferes with observation. The probable defect is the amount of cloud cover which would be expected on a New Zealand site and which would be greater than that expected on an Australian site. Therefore, it seems that the logical thing is to place this big British Commonwealth project in Australia, particularly since Australia has, in such a significant degree, shown world leadership in the use of what is, perhaps, the most important new tool of the astronomer. </para>
    <para>Various sites have been suggested. 1 understand that there are three that are primarily under consideration at this moment. One site is at Coonabarabran, adjacent to the 40-in. instrument that is under construction at present near Siding Spring. The second site is in Western Australia, near Mount Singleton, which is about 200 miles north-east of Perth. The Perth observatory has done excellent work in the positional field, as also has the </para>
    <para class="block">Sydney observatory. The third suggested site is in South Australia, on Mount Woodroffe, which, I understand, is in the Musgrave Ranges. It is necessary, of course, since we are observing the southern hemisphere, not to have the telescope too far to the north. When the technical examination has been made 1 do not know which of these three sites, or indeed whether some alternative site - Kalgoorlie, the Flinders Range and Broken Hill all have been suggested - will finally be decided upon. The process of evaluation is, I understand, not a simple one. But at least we know that we have in Australia excellent sites, although we may not at this moment be entirely certain which is the premier site. Whichever one is selected as the best, I hope that we will go ahead without delay in the approval for erecting on it a large optical instrument. The cost will be of the order of &#163;6,000,000 or &#163;7,000,000. Perhaps the lower figure of the two is the more logical, but that may be a matter of opinion. </para>
    <para>The expenditure on this project will be spread over a number of years. If we give the lead in this matter it is quite reasonable to expect other governments, particularly the United Kingdom Government, to share in the expense. This is a world project because we want to keep the whole of the southern skies under continuous observation. It is also a world project because the world centre of radio astronomy is likely to be in Australia and a great case may be made out for having your optical instrument adjacent to, or at any rate reasonably handy to, your main radio instrument. From the world point of view there is something to be gained in this. I put it to the House that whereas Australia could not be expected to bear the whole cost of this world project, it would be reasonable for us to give the lead and to take the initiative. I know that it will be objected that future developments may affect our assessment of this matter. It is probable, for example, that when we get a telescope into space and can observe free from the aberrations caused by the atmosphere we will be thinking of optical astronomy in new terms. This development is a long way off but even if it occurs and even if we use image intensifiers and things of that character, which are now becoming available, there is still a tremendous field for a first-class large-aperture instrument here in Australia to be used parallel with our radio astronomy. </para>
    <para>I have no hesitation in supporting the bill and the remarks passed on behalf of the Opposition by the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beazley).</inline> I suggest that we in this House might, as individuals, do just a little more. We cannot hope to lead in all scientific fields, or indeed in many, but in those in which we do lead - in those in which Australian scientists are in front of the world - surely we should give our scientists our support and our interest. We should know more about what they are doing. We should keep abreast of their progress. I feel that a group - it should not be as formal as a committee - composed of honorable members from both sides of the House should be formed to keep in touch with scientific leaders. The group would obtain information from them on scientific matters that are of practical importance to us in Australia or of theoretical importance to mankind in general. </para>
    <para>It will be asked: What is the use of astronomy? Well, I think there may be two answers to that question. First, astronomy may have a great practical use in that it may lead to discoveries in physics which may affect our daily lives and improve our standards of living. After all, all of man&#39;s mathematics seems to have stemmed from his primary interest in astronomy, the first of the sciences. I do not think we can write off the hard practical value of what may come from these somewhat abstruse and distant studies. All this is speculative but what is not speculative is that man&#39;s urge for progress at this moment seems to be associated with exploring the nature of space - the nature of the universe in which he is placed. It is the astronomer who will give us the physical answers to our queries. We do not know where his quest will lead, but we do know that insofar as some part of our quest, although not all of it, is a material quest, the astronomer is one of the most important people - one of the leaders in humanity - reaching, as we have always said, for the stars. Perhaps the House might take a moment to consider these things. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CLYDE</inline>CAMERON (Hindmarsh) &#91;5.58&#93;.  -  It is always interesting to listen to the honorable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wentworth).</inline> Even when he discusses communism he is interesting, although often quite off the beam. But when you get him away from communism any contribution that he makes is always first class. This afternoon he has shown that he is well versed in astronomy. All honorable members will agree that his contribution to this debate is a credit to him and to the Parliament of which he is a member. </para>

      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin.</inline>- You do not think he is up in the stars? </para>

      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CLYDE</inline>CAMERON. - No, I do not, but I do know that the Communists have not as yet infiltrated the astronomical activities of the Australian National University. </para>
    <para class="block">Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CLYDE</inline>CAMERON.- Prior to the suspension of the sitting I was praising the contribution made by the honorable member for Mackellar. I wish to move now to the bill itself. There is no doubt that Australia has assumed some leadership in the world of astronomical research. This is due in no small measure to the leadership that Australia has received from Professor Bok and from those who preceded him. All were men who devoted their energies and thoughts to the task before them. I know that every honorable member will recall with a great deal of satisfaction the talks that we have bad from time to time by Professor Bok. Those of us who were fortunate enough to be able to visit the observatory on two or three occasions to see for ourselves the work being done by this branch of the university will be more than pleased with the results that we are receiving for the money being expended. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coutts.</inline>- I was there and saw it for myself. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CLYDE</inline>CAMERON.- I know that the honorable member for Griffith was at the observatory. He has taken a tremendous interest in astronomy. Next to the honorable member for Mackellar, he is perhaps the member of this Parliament best versed in that subject. </para>
    <para>We should place on record details of some of the astronomical research that is being carried out by the Australian National University. Our scientists have been studying the structure and astrophysics of the Milky Way, the Magellanic clouds and galaxies, stellar astrophysics, positional astronomy and time service. They have also carried out research on stellar interiors. As every one knows, this particular research has been done by the Department of Mathematics of the School of General Studies. In these fields we certainly have made a mark for ourselves in the world of astronomy. As a nation we have every reason to be proud of the contribution which we have made. We should be proud also of the quality of the Australian astronomers turned out by the Australian National University. It is only proper that one should pay tribute to the head of the department, Professor Bok. </para>
    <para>It has been stated authoritatively that Australia is now producing young optical and radio astronomers in considerable numbers and - this is important - of a calibre equivalent to the best-trained men overseas. That is a statement with which I note the honorable member for Mackellar is in agreement. The young radio astronomers have available to them very powerful tools for carrying out their research, but the young optical astronomers will be retained for Australia only if they can look forward to having available for their use a large optical telescope of modern design. We cannot expect to keep them unless we provide them with the tools of trade. Every year countries overseas are beginning to recognize the growing importance of astronomy. As the honorable member for Mackellar pointed out, no one can say at this stage the extent to which a knowledge of astronomy may affect even our daily lives and improve our general living standards. I thought the honorable member stated the position most succinctly, and every honorable member who was not in the chamber to hear his speech should read it in &#34; Hansard &#34; for his own edification. </para>
    <para>If it is true, as I believe it is and as my friend the honorable member for Mackellar asserts, that this is a field of scientific study to which Australia and the world must pay greater attention, then it is axiomatic surely that as a nation we must supply these young scientists with their tools of trade. What are their tools of trade? In the first place, we must have a large telescope which is capable of doing the work required of it, so that in addition to research we can complement the work of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization radio&#34; astronomers at Sydney and Parkes. These radio astronomers require urgently the presence within easy reach of an optical telescope with an adequate aperture to check without delay on the optical identification of distant radio sources. I thought the honorable member for Mackellar made that point in a pretty compelling way. He pointed out that it was absolutely useless to have one type of telescope unless it was complemented by another type within easy distance. That is the point he was making and I cannot help but agree entirely with his remarks. Perhaps it would not be amiss for me to indicate the kind of work which is being carried out at Sydney and Parkes by the C.S.I.R.O. The radio physics laboratory at Sydney, with the giant radio telescope at Parkes and the ring-shaped solar interferometer under construction near Narrabri, is only one facet of the work being done by the C.S.I.R.O. At Parkes the organization is carrying on research activities, that is, radio studies of the Milky Way, the Magellanic clouds and galaxies, and solar radio astronomy in radio studies of the planets. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline>R. Fraser. - You would think any fool would know that. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CLYDE</inline>CAMERON.- Curiously enough, some people do not know it, and that is unfortunate. I hope that my speech will elucidate the matter and drive home to every Australian that here we have a field of research in which Australia not only can play a great part for itself as a nation but in which it can also make a tremendous contribution to the world&#39;s knowledge of this important branch of science. </para>

      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline>CLYDE CAMERON.- The Minister knows his colleagues much better than we do and I think the point he has made is well taken. There is also a standards laboratory in which can be carried out optical studies of the sun&#39;s atmosphere, with the aid of highly refined optical equipment. </para>
    <para>I wish now to say something more about the large telescope to which I have already referred briefly. From Australia&#39;s latitudinal position - this is a point which I think the honorable member for Mackellar has perhaps not yet properly grasped - one can observe one-third of the sky which is not accessible to view from the northern hemisphere. I wonder whether this House realizes what that means. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Freeth.-</inline>Tell us. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CLYDE</inline>CAMERON.- My statement means what it says, of course. From our latitudinal position you can see one-third of the sky which cannot be viewed from the northern hemisphere. Surely that is terribly important. This one-third of the sky contains objects of critical importance, notably, the Magellanic Clouds and the galactic centre, which, of course, is the centre of the galaxies, to which we often refer in astronomy. Observations of these with more powerful equipment than is at present available should contribute decisively to the solving of many of the outstanding problems of modern astronomy. I am glad that honorable members agree with that. </para>

    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Haylen.</inline>- What about Uranus? </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CLYDE</inline>CAMERON.- I do not know whether the honorable member is correct in assuming that Uranus can be seen more clearly from Australia, but it is a fact that we can see, from this part of our hemisphere, parts of the celestial regions which cannot be seen from anywhere else in the world. This is especially true in the fields of evolution, galactic structure and extra-galactic astronomy. The Magellanic </para>
    <para class="block">Clouds, in particular, provide an opportunity to study the structure and evolution of the galaxy with a completeness which cannot possibly be matched anywhere else in the world. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wentworth.</inline>- Have the Russians got them? </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CLYDE</inline>CAMERON.- If they had the honorable member would be against them, so presumably the Russians have not got them, because he is in favour of them. In the radio telescope at Parkes and the new Mills Cross to be built near Hoskinstown, Australia will have the finest radio astronomy installations in the world. Properly to exploit the discoveries being made by these installations, it is essential that they be matched by an equivalent optical facility located on the same continent as they are. The concentration of large telescopes and observers in the northern hemisphere is perhaps too well known to need comment. Of the twelve existing telescopes with apertures greater than 72 inches ten, including the five largest, are in the northern hemisphere. Several organizations - notably Eso and Aura - are known to have active plans for establishing major telescopes in the southern hemisphere and we have to do the same. </para>
    <para>Australia at the moment is, politically, a very unstable country. That does not mean that it will always remain that way and I believe we ought to be hopeful of the future and plan as though this is a country which can look forward to a stable political situation. I believe there is a large body of competent young Australian astronomers. I understand that tests conducted over several years have demonstrated the existence in Australia of a number of adequate sites for a major optical telescope and I will now deal with some of the proposed sites. </para>
    <para>It is interesting to know that the Australian National University, through Professor Bok and the people working with him, has already made a survey of the sites that might be considered most suitable. The honorable member for Mackellar mentioned three of them. He spoke of Siding Spring Mountain near Coonabarabran in New South Wales, Mount Singleton, near Wubin, in Western Australia, and Mount Woodroffe, in the north-east corner of South Australia. </para>
    <para>I do not want to appear parochial in this matter, but I would like to make some comments about South Australia as a possible site for this work and for this installation. Of all the sites mentioned by the honorable member for Mackellar, the South Australian is the one which provides the greatest altitude - 4,700 feet. The Western Australian site has an altitude of 2,300 feet, while that at Siding Spring Mountain is only 3,820 feet. Not that that is an important factor or one which could ultimately decide the location of the site. But when one takes into account the fact that South Australia - particularly in the Mount Woodroffe and Flinders Range areas - is the part of Australia which probably provides more clear and cloudless nights than any other part of the continent, I think that condition, in the end, must bring the authorities down on the side of South Australia as a possible site. </para>
    <para>I will say no more on the matter. I think I have made it perfectly clear that there is an unanswerable case for Australia to take an even greater interest in this important field of science than has been taken in the past. I believe I have made out an unanswerable case for the purchase and construction of a bigger telescope here. In conclusion, I repeat that I believe that this country is singularly fortunate to have a man of Professor Bok&#39;s outstanding ability. He has a tremendous ability, not only to understand his subject but also to convey an understanding of it to other people who are less knowledgeable than he is. If it is not out of place during a debate of this kind I would like to express the hope that Professor Bok will, some time during this sessional period, give us the opportunity to hear him lecture on the possibilities that astronomy offers to this country. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. FAILES</inline>(Lawson) &#91;8.19&#93;.- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> I am sure the House is grateful to the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beazley)</inline> and the honorable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wentworth)</inline> for their scholarly speeches. Their treatment of this subject came from a knowledge of pure science which those of us who do not possess it must surely admire. I do not speak with any knowledge of pure science at all. Unlike the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Clyde Cameron),</inline> I make no claim to a knowledge of pure science. I make the claim that I speak for the man in the street who has an appreciation of the grand work being done by our Australian scientists. I speak as a man who has an appreciation of the applied sciences. There are few of us who do not realize the great value of the work done by the Mount Stromlo Observatory. There are many of us who have had some connexion with radio, particularly during the war years, who will recollect the Stromlo predictions of suitable frequencies to use from time to time and how accurate were those predictions for months ahead. The work of the observatory at Mount Stromlo is very well known to the people of Australia. </para>
    <para>The bill, which proposes to extend the making of astronomical and meteorological observations to any part of the Commonwealth, as distinct from within the Australian Capital Territory, has come about because, as the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Menzies)</inline> stated in his second-reading speach, there is a need for a field station at some point away from the Mount Stromlo Observatory where clearer viewing is available. I have a definite interest in this bill because the Prime Minister said this - </para>
    <para>After the most careful site-testing programme, extending over some years and bringing into consideration at various times ten different sites, it has been decided to establish a field station on Siding Spring Mountain, near Coonabarabran, New South Wales. </para>
    <para class="block">I am proud to say that Coonabarabran, in the electorate of Lawson, is my home town. The final selection of this site was made after the most rigorous tests had been carried out at the instance of the Director of Mount Stromlo and the Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National University. I should like to quote from a presidential address given by Professor Bok, the Director of Mount Stromlo Observatory in Sydney on 21st August, 1962. He said - </para>
    <para>Mount Stromlo Observatory&#39;s biggest handicap over the past few years has been the excessive cloudiness for the site. The establishment of  a  Mount Stromlo Observatory Field Station on Siding Spring Mountain near Coonabarabran in N.S.W. offers the Stromlo group a first-class astronomical site, and, with the arrival there before the middle of 1963 of the modern and highly efficient 40-inch reflector, our Observatory should be able to step up considerably its productivity. </para>
    <para class="block">May I very briefly remind honorable members that Mount Stromlo Observatory for many years operated as an autonomous organization. Some few years ago it became a department of the Australian National University. That is why the university is named in the bill for the extension of the operations of the Mount Stromlo Observatory. </para>
    <para>This site, which was decided upon after considerable testing, spread over a number of years, is on a spur of the Great Dividing Range about eighteen miles from Coonabarabran, on the central western slopes of New South Wales. The site is called Mount Woorut, but has become popularly known as Siding Spring Mountain. The Warrumbungle Mountains are very old and were first noted by the Australian explorer Oxley on a journey from the west to the coast. He called them the Black Mountains and found out later that the aboriginal name was Warrumbungle. As time goes on, this site will become very famous. Not only will this field station be built there, but these mountains are also the site of a national park. Visits to the mountains have been made by such eminent men as Captain Frank Hurley, who spent many weeks there taking photographs of what he considered to be some of the most unique mountains in Australia. The Australian Broadcasting Commission has also selected these mountains as a site for a regional transmitter, which will be installed when the fourth stage of television is reached. Tests carried out for the selection of this site showed, amongst other things, considerable freedom from cloud and haze, thus giving astronomers an opportunity of better &#34; seeing &#34;. In other words, the definition from this particular site is much better than from other possible sites. </para>
    <para>The site having been chosen, it remained to carry out certain installation work. On 11th May, 1962, the Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National University announced the selection of the site for the field station. This, as he said in the announcement, climaxed four years of comparative tests for cloudiness and astronomical &#34; seeing &#34; from about a dozen sites, narrowed down later to four sites, from which the selection was made. </para>
    <para>During the past eleven months a good road has been constructed to the top of </para>
    <para class="block">Siding Spring Mountain. For some years an old road led up into the mountain and was used for picnics and excursions. Later the shire council attempted to construct a road over the mountains into the adjoining shire. Then, with the selection of the site, the Coonabarabran Shire Council devoted its attention to building a good all-weather road which, although not entirely bitumen now, will later become all-bitumen to give permanent access in all weathers to the site where the telescope will be constructed. Water is available at the site, electric power has been provided and a radio telephone link is almost completed. The buildings to be constructed will house the 40-in. reflector which is being constructed especially for this particular job. There will be some offices and laboratories, and in July of this year the buildings and dome are expected to be completed. The first major telescope which will be erected on the site will be the 40-in. reflector, which is of modern design and is now being constructed at the Boiler and Chivens Company in Pasadena, California. The instrument will probably be delivered to the site in July or August of this year. The total cost of the telescope, its dome and its buildings, will be approximately &#163;145,000. </para>
    <para>This is the first move to establish a permanent field station away from Mount Stromlo. For some years there has been a field station of an experimental nature on Mount Bingar in the Riverina electorate. That site has been superseded as a result of the tests which ended in the selection of the Siding Spring Mountain site. Present plans call for the installation later on the new site not only of this entirely new imported telescope but also of three other telescopes. There will be a 16-in. reflector which, also, is being constructed by the firm of Boiler and Chivens. a modified 26-in. reflector, which is now in operation at the Mount Bingar field station, and the modified 50-in. reflector from Mount Stromlo, which was formerly the Great Melbourne reflector. The Mount Bingar station will cease operation after the transfer of its 26-in. telescope to Siding Spring Mountain. That is a general idea of the developments expected to take place at the new site. </para>
    <para>The reason why I am so interested in these developments and why I regard this bill as so important is that this represents the first step towards establishing a field station as an adjunct to the Mount Stromlo observatory, and possibly towards the establishment of a national observatory in this country, perhaps in co-operation with the United Kingdom or Canada. That is something that has been discussed very adequately by the honorable member for Mackellar and the honorable member for Fremantle, and I do not wish to attempt to add anything to the very fine addresses that both those gentlemen gave us. I would say only that, the radio telescope having been established at Parkes by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, we should not forget how important it is to have a large viewing system of optical telescopes to work in conjunction with the radio system. That matter has been discussed very fully by the honorable member for Mackellar. It is of great importance, and we should not lose sight of it. </para>
    <para>We should not take the view that we can afford to wait for some time before we consider the establishment of a national observatory at some other site that may be considered suitable. The radio telescope and a large optical telescope should be close enough to each other to collaborate. I do not want to make claims for any particular site. On the basis of my experience and what I have already seen, I believe that the Siding Spring Mountain site now chosen will be the best site in Australia for a full-scale observatory. I do not think that parochial ideas will interfere in any way with the judgment of the people who will be responsible for choosing a site for any national observatory that may be established. </para>
    <para>We have in Australia many young astronomers - eager lads who are developing their knowledge and giving of their best in pursuit of the science of astronomy. There must be some means of keeping them here and giving them opportunities to develop the science that they have chosen. This can be done by expanding the facilities for both radio and optical astronomy that we already have. I believe that if we properly support the approach that has been suggested by men so eminent as the Astronomer Royal we shall afford our young men who are seeking to become astronomers the opportunities to which they are justly entitled. </para>
    <para>We have to bear in mind another point. Being situated in one of the choice positions on the globe for the purposes of astronomy, we have wonderful opportunities to observe parts of the heavens which are not so readily seen from the northern atmosphere. We have a unique position in this respect and, internationally, we should make use of the opportunities afforded by the geographical position that fortune has granted to us. </para>
    <para>Honorable members may wonder why a member of the Australian Country Party is so interested in a science of this sort. </para>
    <para>Honorable Members. - Hear, hear! </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. FABLES.</inline>- I am very pleased to hear the general response which indicates understanding of the interest taken in astronomy by a member of the Country Party. Professor Bok has told me that the response by country people to his lectures has been magnificent. He has been interested to note that country people who he thought possibly did not have much interest in astronomy were particlarly interested in his lectures. I do not want to make odious comparisons between country and city attitudes, but this only goes to show that people who may not have been expected to be interested in those sciences which are a little out of the ordinary run have a very definite and very strong interest in astronomy. Their lives in the open make them familiar with the heavens and stimulate their interest in space and the reasons for the existence of the stars and other sights that we see in the sky on clear nights. So country people are particularly interested in the establishment of any scientific undertaking in a country district, and particularly in the establishment of any station associated with a science such as astronomy. </para>
    <para>I say with great pride that the local council and the townspeople of Coonabarabran have been unstinting in their efforts to assist the Australian National University and Professor Bok, the director of the Mount Stromlo Observatory, who has been to Coonabarabran on so many occasions to guide the work that is going on at Siding Spring Mountain. The local people have been unstinting in their efforts to help in the establishment of the field station, for the benefit not only of the Australian people but also of international scientific development. I believe that, once the new field station has been established and is performing the functions for which it is intended, there will be even more pressure for the establishment of a national - or, rather, international - observatory in co-operation with perhaps the United Kingdom or Canada. I am sure, therefore, that this House will support the bill with the very best of intentions for the future of astronomy in Australia. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. ENGLAND</inline>(Calare) &#91;8.37&#93;.- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> the reason for the introduction of this bill has already been explained by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Robert Menzies)</inline> in his second-reading speech and by subsequent speakers. This measure is designed to remove any restrictions, in the geographical sense, on the activities of the Australian National University in the field of astronomy. I, like many Australians, have a personal interest in this science. The electorate of Calare, which I represent, has a keen interest in astronomy. That interest has been stimulated by the establishment and working of the radio telescope at Parkes. </para>
    <para>I have made only very minor studies in this field of science, but I have always been much impressed by the great spirit of co-operation that seems to the average layman to exist between astronomers from many different nations. On the international plane, co-operation between astronomers is very close. This is excellent not only for the advancement of pure science but also for the general public, who benefit in many ways from such co-operative efforts. This co-operation is excellent for human relations. Perhaps we in this House this evening can, in a very small way, emulate that spirit. If we can, all will benefit. There is no opposition to this bill and I fully support everything that was said by the honorable member for Fremantle <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beazley),</inline> who led for the Opposition in this debate. </para>
    <para>It is intended that the head-quarters of flu Department of Astronomy of the Australian National University shall remain at Mount Stromlo. For reasons which have already been advanced, as part of a long range major plan to overcome restricted viewing conditions, a field station i: to be established at Siding Spring Mountain, near Coonabarabran. 1 think that at this stage it is well to look back at developments in the past and to consider the plans that have now been made for the future. This will enable us to get a better perspective and to understand why this bill is necessary. </para>
    <para>I think it is safe to say that this phase of scientific study has really captured the imagination of the Australian people. This has been borne out in many directions. First, there is the heavy visiting schedule at the Mount Stromlo Observatory. Then there are the substantial demands made on the director of that observatory and his staff, who deliver lectures to, and generally instruct, people from all parts of Australia. These heavy demands are also indicative of the excellent public relations that are maintained at the Mount Stromlo Observatory. </para>
    <para>There is another indication of the way in which the public imagination has been captured in recent times by these developments. I refer to the great number of visitors who have inspected the radio telescope that has been installed at Parkes, in my own area. It is a little over a year since that telescope was put into operation, and already about 15,000 people have been taken on conducted tours of the installation. It seems that people are realizing the value that is flowing from these scientific studies. They know that they have already benefited in one way - from improved weather forecasts which we are obtaining as a result of astronomical observations, meteorological observations and space research in general. People appreciate the results in this field that have been obtained by the use of the weather satellites, particularly in the Tiros and Nimbus series, which are recording cloud cover all over the globe. We are getting practical results from the money spent along these lines. We have also been told that the Telstar series of satellites will contribute much to the improvement of long-distance communications, particularly by means of radio and television. It is interesting to note that only last night <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Winston</inline> Churchill was able to sit in England and watch his son stand in for him when he was granted honorary citizenship of the </para>
    <para class="block">United States of America. I am told that this was made possible by the use of one of these satellites. </para>
    <para>Let me now refer to the optical side. It has been already stated that Australia has made great contributions to the wealth of knowledge that has been accumulated over the years. As has been pointed out, part of the reason for this is that Australia is favorably situated geographically, and I do not want to labour that point. Much of our success has been achieved with the 74-in. telescope at the Mount Stromlo Observatory. It was pointed out by the honorable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Clyde Cameron)</inline> that of the twelve telescopes in the world with apertures of 72 inches or more, ten are in the northern hemisphere and only two in the southern hemisphere. </para>
    <para>It is in the field of radio astronomy that we have made our greatest progress. Australia, of course, is a recognized world leader in this field. This is not simply a brash claim that we ourselves make; it is a statement that has been volunteered by men like Professor Gold of Cornell University and by the Russian, Professor Ambartsumian, who presided at the astronomical symposium in Canberra recently, as well as by the Astronomer Royal himself. These are some of the men who regard Australia as being in the top flight in the field of radio astronomy. We have achieved this position in only about seventeen years, since radio astronomy observations were first made at Dover Heights in 1946. Since that time we have seen the development of a large array of instruments and we have seen the expenditure of a good deal of money. We now have the radio spectroscope at Dapto, we have the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization&#39;s radio astronomy field station at St. Mary&#39;s, we have the university interferometer at Narrabri, which is already in operation. We have seen an amount of &#163;240,000 set aside for the building of a C.S.I.R.O. radio heliograph also at Narrabri. I am mentioning these installations for a particular reason, which I will give in a moment. The last and most important of all is the radio telescope at Parkes. </para>
    <para>Looking at the international picture, it is interesting to see where the money came from for some of these installations. In the case of the Parkes radio telescope, some came from the Carnegie Corporation, some from the Rockefeller Foundation, some from private subscribers in Australia; and I am proud to be a supporter of the Commonwealth Government which played its part in supporting this project by giving more than half of the funds necessary for its completion. </para>
    <para>The work done by scientists at Parkes has enabled great advances to be made in the field of radio astronomy. I may say that the results obtained by the main instrument at Parkes have exceeded all expectations. Much of the information that has come from it was completely unexpected. The penetration into space achieved by the instrument has been two to three times as great as that which it was planned for. It has really met with world acclaim. </para>
    <para>As we all know, the International Astronomy Union held a symposium in Canberra in March of this year. I think it was the twentieth held by that organization, and it was the first in Australia. It was attended by overseas scientists of very high calibre, men of the very first rank. It is indeed a great compliment to Australia that they should have met here in Canberra. I like to recall the words of the Astronomer Royal, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Richard</inline> Woolley, who said that Australia has made contributions to astronomy quite out of proportion to its size as a nation. </para>
    <para>Plans for the future have already been mentioned. I have spoken of the C.S.I.R.O.&#39;s radio heliograph which is to be installed at Narrabri. Then there is the Mills Cross installation which will be at Hoskinstown. I understand that work is proceeding on this, and that the instrument will be in operation in about two years. Then there is the Australian national radio astronomy observatory at Parkes. It has not been mentioned in this debate that at this site a further telescope has recently been completed. This is a radio telescope with a diameter of 60 feet, mounted on a track a mile long, which is designed to work in conjunction with the main instrument. </para>
    <para>On the optical side it has long been a fond dream of astronomers - and I think it has now got beyond that stage - to have an astronomical observatory put into orbit, with a telescope having about a 50-in. aperture and equipped, also, of course, with the necessary telemetric and television equipment to broadcast back to earth what is discovered by that observatory. Of course, the advantage of it will be that it will operate from outside the earth&#39;s atmospheric envelope which has a disruptive refractory effect. </para>
    <para>You have been told about the important project for the establishment of the European Southern Observatory, which is becoming commonly known as Eso. I think it is as well to mention the countries involved in this project, to show how they combine internationally on these jobs. The nations concerned are France, West Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Sweden. They are combining to provide a 140-inch telescope somewhere in South Africa or South America. The United States National Science Foundation has already selected a site in Chile and is ready to go. This is where we see a race developing. The American project involves the provision initially of an 80-inch telescope, with a later one to be installed with an aperture of about 150 inches. </para>
    <para>Coming closer to home, as previous speakers have pointed out, it is considered that a large optical telescope is absolutely essential in this country. I do not think it can be too highly emphasized that the two activities should run together. This telescope is to be used for the optical identification of radio sources. At the present moment, the work of the instrument at Parkes is impeded because of the time needed to send information collected there to other parts of the world for verification and to receive information from other parts of the world. This point cannot be emphasized too strongly. Other honorable members have already spoken of the work in this field. </para>
    <para>I understand the search for a site has been narrowed to some extent, but many factors must be considered in selecting a site. I do not wish to go into this phase at the moment, and I am not competent to do so. I know the search for a site has extended over the whole of the southern half of Australia. The proximity of this major telescope to other installations is important, and this is where I strike the only discordant note to-night. 1 know that the view of the honorable member for Hindmarsh is different from mine, but I point out that at present we have an interferometer at Narrabri, a radio heliograph being installed at Narrabri, a new field station going in at Siding Spring Mountain and a new 60-feet radio telescope just installed at Parkes and working in conjunction with the giant telescope already there. In this situation, there must be a strong pull towards a site in this area in the central west of New South Wales. I should say that the site should preferably be at a point near the major installation, which is the radio telescope at Parkes, so that there could be quick and direct contact between the radio telescope and the major optical telescope. </para>
    <para>I am pleased to observe the decentralization that is following the installation of these astronomical instruments. Perhaps the scientists realize that in the inland areas dust squalls and smoke from bush fires are intermittent and temporary. They probably realize that the smoke, soot, fog, smoke and grime in the atmosphere around a city are permanent. I expect that great work will come from the Australian National University in the future. I hope that our universities will produce many doctors of philosophy in astronomy, who will stay in Australia to work on the instruments that are being provided. The Government should encourage them to stay so that we can stop the export of our best brains. I support the bill. </para>

    <para>On this occasion, a new schedule has been prepared. We appreciate the difficulty in following the rather intricate pattern of the tariff amendments.

On this occasion, to save time, I think this method of delineating the debate will be of considerable help to honorable members.

    <para>The <inline font-weight="bold">CHAIRMAN (Mr. Lucock).-</inline> The question before the committee is the motion moved by the Minister, on 15th November, 1962, in connexion with Customs Tariff Amendment (No. 54). As the Minister has said, this amendment and the Customs Tariff (New Zealand Preference) Amendment (No. 9) are complementary. Is it the wish of the committee to consider Customs Tariff (No. 54) and Customs Tariff (New Zealand Preference) Amendment (No. 9) together and also to consider the motion as a whole? There being no objections, this course will be followed. The question is, &#34;That the motion be agreed to&#34;. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. POLLARD</inline>(Lalor) &#91;8.59&#93;.- I appreciate that the Minister for Supply <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fairhall)</inline> in his introductory speech to-night has given details of some improvements that have been made in the setting out of the proposals for consideration by the Parliament. In the past, it has been somewhat difficult to follow the procedure and the method of dealing with the various proposals. All the proposals before us have now been set out with more clarity. This is a very desirable improvement. </para>
    <para>We have for our immediate consideration Customs Tariff Amendment (No. 54). This is the result of an inquiry by the Tariff Board into the coffee industry. I do not want to speak at length on the Tariff Board&#39;s report, because honorable members will recall that last week the Minister for Trade <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McEwen)</inline> made a statement to the Parliament relating to coffee from Papua and New Guinea. In the remarks that I made on that statement I referred to the Tariff Board&#39;s report. I content myself with saying that I regret that in this proposal all of the recommendations of the Tariff Board have not been accepted by the Government. The excuse is advanced - maybe with justification - that all of the recommendations of the Tariff Board cannot be put into effect until Australia has completed negotiations with certain overseas countries in accordance with the provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. </para>
    <para>The Minister for Supply, in his explanatory statement on 15th November, 1962, said - </para>
    <para>In accordance with the Tariff Board&#39;s recommendations increased protective duties are being imposed on soluble coffee, roasted coffee and liquid extracts. The board has also recommended continued free entry of raw coffee from Papua-New Guinea with increased duties from other sources, subject to a remission of such duties, in whole or part, when specified quantities are obtained from the Territory. </para>
    <para class="block">When I look at the Tariff Board&#39;s report and the details of the proposal before the committee, I see that the specified quantity was 25 per cent. In other words, if an importer imported 25 per cent, of his coffee requirements from Papua and New Guinea he would receive a remission on the duties imposed on the whole of his imports. I understand that that is the idea. The Minister, in his explanatory statement, also said - </para>
    <para>Before the board&#39;s findings on raw coffee may be implemented it will be necessary for Australia to negotiate with certain overseas countries. In the meantime it is proposed to maintain the existing tariff duties- </para>
    <para>That is, without the recommended increase - </para>
    <para> . . and to continue the present arrangement whereby an importer is permitted to import a certain proportion of his needs free of duty under customs by-law provided he purchases a given quantity from Papua-New Guinea. </para>
    <para>It is regrettable that we cannot go the whole hog and give the requisite amount of tariff protection in respect of coffee imported from Papua and New Guinea. </para>
    <para>The coffee trade is an important one. In terms of world trade, it is even larger than the world export wheat trade. It amounts to about &#163;1,000,000,000 per annum. Australia is increasing fairly rapidly its consumption of coffee. The annual consumption at present is about 17,000,000 lb. The Tariff Board estimates that in five years* time the consumption will be 29,000,000 lb. I am becoming a coffee addict - not because I am particularly fond of coffee but because it has a flavour. Coffee is gaining ground and popularity because of the great influx of coffee-drinking people from Europe. They have been used to drinking coffee. Not all of them come from Sweden where the coffee consumption is 18 lb. per head per annum - Australians consume about 9 lb. per head per annum - but they come from substantial coffee-importing countries. </para>
    <para>One of the reasons why people in Australia are being converted to drinking coffee, in my opinion, is that many of the tea importers are importing a lot of rubbish. I do not think there is any doubt about that. If those importers want to keep their businesses going, it might not be a bad idea for them to give the public better quality tea than we are getting at present. That is only my personal opinion. I hope that it is not as wholly correct as I think it is. </para>
    <para>My final comment on this matter is that I notice that the Tariff Board has suggested a review of the coffee situation in two years* time. I suggest that the Government consider favorably making a review of the coffee situation in twelve months&#39; time, if it wants to protect more satisfactorily the people of Papua and New Guinea. </para>
    <para>I wish to leave the question of coffee for a moment in order to touch on the tariff situation generally. When this Parliament is confronted with sixteen tariff proposals to be debated at one hit, accompanied by 28 or 29 Tariff Board reports - I have not counted them, but the situation is set out fairly completely in them by the board&#39;s officers - it should be realized that the Parliament is not giving tariff problems the attention that they should be given. However, that highlights a fact which has been very evident for some time now, namely, that it is the wish of this Parliament - and I believe that we are expressing the wish of the Australian people - that as time goes on this country shall be made more and more impregnable against inroads by imported products that Australians can manufacture. </para>
    <para>By doing that we will cater for the increasing population who to-day cannot be accommodated on the land as primary producers to the extent that previous population increases were accommodated. There was a time when there was sufficient good land to induce the rising generations of Australians to become farmers. People had access to land that was made available by the various State governments under closer settlement and soldier settlement schemes. They had an opportunity to become producers of primary products for which there was a huge world demand. I know, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> that I am roaming slightly from the matter before the Chair, but this is all wrapped up with the question of tariff protection. The present position is worthy of note and passing comment. </para>
    <para>Finally, in this slight departure from the matter before the Chair, may 1 say that I am not unaware that, although this Parliament is making Australia impregnable, to some extent, against inroads by imported products and is protecting Australian industries, there is a grave danger that advantage will be taken of this protection and that the Australian people will be exploited behind that tariff wall. That highlights the need for a hastening of the proposed restrictive trade practices legislation. I hope that that legislation will be passed by this Parliament in a satisfactory form. It also stresses the need for some control and supervision of prices charged in this country. I support this proposal. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. DALY</inline>(Grayndler) &#91;9.9&#93;.- Like the honorable member for Lalor <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard),</inline> I am pleased to see an improvement in the method of presenting tariff proposals, but I still think the method leaves a lot to be desired if tariff proposals, which are so important in this day and age and which require meticulous study, are to be considered properly. I hope that further improvements will be made. Perhaps a different method will be adopted and we will not be called upon, as the honorable member for Lalor said, to debate sixteen proposals and 29 or 30 Tariff Board reports, as we are doing to-night. I think you will agree, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> that unless one is a wizard on these matters it is practically impossible to debate them in detail, as they should be debated. The particular point that I wish to make about the report on coffee is that I am concerned at the delays in the presentation of Tariff Board reports. I am concerned at the effect those delays may have on the industries concerned. The board&#39;s report on coffee states that the matter was referred to the Tariff Board by the Minister for Trade on 15th June, 1961. The board finished its deliberations on 27th April, 1962 - ten and a half months later. That is a long time in anybody&#39;s book. The board&#39;s report was presented to the Minister on 4th May. So almost a year elapsed between referring the matter to the board and the presentation of the board&#39;s report to the Minister. But not until seven months later, on 15th November, 1962, was the report presented to this Parliament. So seventeen months elapsed from the time the Tariff Board was asked to inquire into this matter until the report was presented to this Parliament. Now, on 10th April, 1963, about 22 months after the matter was first placed in the hands of the Tariff Board and about five months after the report was first presented to the Parliament, we are given an opportunity to debate it. In anybody&#39;s book that is slow work. Heaven help an industry that is having difficulty in carrying on in the face of competition when delays of this kind occur, particularly an industry in which many thousands of persons are engaged, as is the case in the textile industry! I do not say that these delays occur all the time. I know that the Government is aware that delays occur and that it has set up the Special Advisory Authority in an attempt to overcome some of the delays. But the instance I have given to-night is a classic example, and I do not think that it is an isolated case, as I will show later. I hope that some effort will be made by the Government to speed up the presentation of Tariff Board reports. After a report has been delivered to the Minister why should this Parliament be forced to wait seven months before the report is presented to the Parliament? Why should there be a further delay of five months before Opposition members receive an opportunity to debate these reports? There is something wrong with the procedure governing the presentation of these reports, and the matter requires urgent and immediate attention by the Minister. At this stage I do not propose to deal with the pros and cons of the report, but I hope that the matters to which </para>
    <para class="block">I have adverted will be considered by the Government. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. TURNBULL</inline>(Mallee) &#91;9.13&#93;.- I desire to say a few words about the complaint made by the honorable member for Grayndler <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Daly).</inline> It must be remembered that the Government set up the Special Advisory Authority to deal with industries that need protection urgently. It is well known that the shortest time in which we can expect a result from a Tariff Board inquiry is about twelve months, but an industry may obtain temporary protection from the Special Advisory Authority within 30 days. Having obtained that temporary protection the matter goes before the Tariff Board for inquiry. If, having completed its inquiry, the board decides that the industry should receive protection, the temporary protection is merged with the permanent tariff protection. On the other hand, if the board at the conclusion of its inquiry is of the opinion that the industry is not justified in receiving protection, the temporary protection obtained from the Special Advisory Authority ceases. </para>
    <para>The system of reference to the Special Advisory Authority set up by this Government has been of great importance to industry and has helped to overcome in a large measure the delays referred to by the honorable member for Grayndler. The honorable member correctly stated that there are delays associated with Tariff Board inquiries but pending a finding by the board an industry may obtain protection from the Special Advisory Authority. </para>
    <para>The honorable member for Lalor <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> submitted that the people of Australia wanted more and more tariff protection. He also stated quite truthfully that under protective tariffs unjustifiably high prices may be charged, which would defeat the purpose of protection. I have heard honorable members opposite say that if they had their way they would grant protection against any goods coming into Australia. No nation can hope always to sell and never to buy. This is tedious repetition, I know, but I must say it again in order to get the message across: We must sell goods overseas in order to create overseas credits with which to buy the raw materials so necessary for the functioning of secondary industry in this country. 1 know that we must be fair but no nation can hope always to sell and never to buy. Only when the Opposition realizes this will it cease to make statements like those we have heard to-night from the honorable member for Lalor. </para>

    <para>The  CHAIRMAN.  - The question now before the committee is the motion moved by the Minister for Supply on 29th November, 1962, in connexion with Customs Tariff Amendment (No. 55). As the Minister has already stated, this amendment and Customs Tariff (New Zealand Preference) Amendment (No. 10) are complementary. Is it the wish of the committee that Customs Tariff Amendment (No. 55) and Customs Tariff (New Zealand Preference) Amendment (No. 10) be taken together, and that the motions be considered as a whole? </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pollard.</inline>-  We do not mind them being taken as a whole but we do want the right to refer to any individual item. </para>
    <para>The  CHAIRMAN.-  Order! If the amendments are taken as a whole that will not prevent any honorable member from speaking on individual items. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. POLLARD</inline>(Lalor) &#91;9.20&#93;.- I wish to refer to Customs Tariff Proposals No. 55. When the Minister introduced these proposals he informed us that they covered tariff changes arising from the Government&#39;s consideration of the Tariff Board&#39;s report on glass fibres and glass fibre products and that, in accordance with the board&#39;s recommendations, protective duties of 20 per cent. British preferential tariff and 30 per cent, most-favoured-nation tariff were imposed on fibre glass rovings, chopped strand, chopped strand mat and yarns. He said that the temporary duties which those products had carried up to that time were removed, but the new protection would remain approximately the same as it was under the temporary duties which had been in operation for some months. </para>
    <para>The Minister told us that the Tariff Board had recommended continuation of the existing British preferential tariff rates on glass wool, and increased British preferential tariff rates on practically all other glass fibre products on which evidence was received by the board. He told us also that the most-favoured-nation rates recommended were the highest consistent with Australia&#39;s international commitments. Obviously, our international commitments would prevent the raising of duties above a certain level, even if this were required. That is understandable. One must bear in mind that in a negotiation of this kind, although it may appear that we are losing the right to impose a tariff that we may think desirable, we have bargained away that right to obtain a tariff concession from other countries. There is a counterbalance. </para>
    <para>The Minister also told us in October of last year that he anticipated that during the then current session of the Parliament there would be a re-draft of the tariff on textile fabrics which should be of material assistance to the Tariff Board in its examination of the general textile reference, and to representatives of industry and commerce who were preparing to present evidence to the board in a series of hearings on this subject. The quite extensive drafting changes involved are incorporated in Customs Tariff Proposals No. 55. These include also an adjustment of the British preferential margin on certain narrow fabrics to implement more fully a recommendation by the Tariff Board. </para>
    <para>Not only are we required to consent to the proposed tariff rates on glass fibre and associated products but we must remember also that when the consent is given we shall approve the very many associated drafting changes. No doubt the drafting changes are made to facilitate an intelligent interpretation of the tariff rates on these products. They number well over 100. I think we are justified in assuming that there is no departure in any way from the real intention of the tariff which is imposed upon certain products mentioned under various items in the re-drafted list. </para>
    <para>This is a very new industry in Australia and probably very few people know much about it. Fibre glass is used in a much wider range of secondary production than most people would think. Certain firms have seen fit to commence manufacturing this product in Australia and I understand that eventually they will be able to supply the Australian market. The organizations most vitally interested are companies such as Bradford Cotton Mills Limited and several other firms which are mentioned in the Tariff Board&#39;s report. This being the case, and as the product and the industry will serve a most useful purpose, the Opposition is prepared to accept the recommendation of the Government and of the Tariff Board. The proposed protective tariff of 20 per cent. British preferential and 30 per cent, most favoured nation is not too bad. I understand that tariff was recommended by the board, and I have had no representation from any manufacturer expressing any discontent with this proposal. However, the Tariff Board&#39;s report indicates that there was a considerable number of protests from importers of this product. </para>
    <para>Besides Bradford Cotton Mills Limited, I understand that the Cyclone Company of Australia Limited is also very interested in this proposal. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chipp.</inline>-  A very fine company. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. POLLARD.-</inline>I understand that it is a very fine company and that it was a pioneer in the manufacture of wire products and other industrial items. The Universal and Tygan organizations have come to Australia, I understand, to undertake production of the items under consideration. I leave the matter at that. No doubt other honorable members will have something to say about it. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. KELLY</inline>(Wakefield) &#91;9.26&#93;.- Contrary to what happened on the last occasion on which tariff proposals were before the committee, I propose on this occasion to speak only on five of them. I think that this will be a relief to honorable members on both sides. Certainly it will be a relief to me. I have already told the Minister and the department what I intend to say on these proposals and therefore some authoritative replies should be forthcoming to the questions which I shall raise, which, to my mind, are of some significance. </para>
    <para>As the honorable member for Lalor <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Pollard)</inline> has mentioned, Customs Tariff Proposals No. 55 deal in part with the Tariff Board&#39;s report on glass fibre products. The major portion deals with the dull but necessary business of bringing our customs schedule into line with overseas procedure. This is known technically as adopting the nomenclature. When the Minister foreshadowed the introduction of these proposals, in October of last year, he made it clear that no changes of substance were intended. He said that this would be only a machinery measure. I was particularly disturbed to find that this is more than a mere machinery measure. I shall cite one of many instances. Items 105 (a) and 105 (d) (1) (a) (1) refer to fabrics that are principally used for drapes or upholstery. The new item 460 (c) (4) refers only to furnishing fabrics. That did not mean much to me when I saw it first, but I have since learned something about it. Under the old proposal the materials from which bridal gowns are made carried a duty of 2s. 8id. a square yard. Under this so-called machinery measure the new duty will be 7s. 6d. a square yard, because the department now can say that the material comes within the scope of furnishing fabric and so attracts the higher rate of duty. Under the umbrella of this machinery measure the duty was increased from 2s. 8id. to 7s. 6d. a square yard. The Minister when he fore shadowed this, said no such thing was intended. He said that such a proposal would not involve any changes in duty and would be essentially a drafting measure. It is a question, not of whether the duty should be higher or lower, but of whether the duties should be effectively altered without being submitted to this chamber. These were duties recommended by the Tariff Board and passed by the Parliament and they have now been altered under the umbrella of a machinery duty which we were told was only a machinery measure. </para>
    <para>It is not easy for us to follow these tariff schedules. It may be easy for you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> but not for lesser mortals like me. It is terribly difficult for me, at least, to follow the implications of these schedules. If we cannot have confidence in the statements of the Minister and the actions of the department in things like this I find the position very disturbing. I think I would be totally unjustified in imputing wrong motives to the department or the Minister and I believe this alteration has happened by accident. Probably no deception was intended; I do not know. All I know for certain is that it happened and I would like an assurance from the Minister this will not happen again. </para>

      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Daly.</inline>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> I ask for guidance. At what stage in the debate on these measures - if any - may I make, broadly, a second-reading speech in regard to the position of imports and exports because of the Government&#39;s tariff policy and matters of that nature? </para>
    <para>The  CHAIRMAN.-  At no stage at all during this debate. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. FAIRHALL</inline>(Paterson - Minister for Supply) &#91;9.32&#93;. - One of the problems about the question raised by the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Kelly)</inline> is that for many years there has been difficulty in establishing definitions of what constitutes a furnishing fabric. It must be clearly understood that many of the fabrics we are dealing with to-day can be used for purposes other than furnishing. If one goes over the history of definitions in this matter one sees the difficulties which have faced and are constantly facing the department, and which extend also to the rag trade, if I may use that term, in establishing what is in fact a furnishing fabric. </para>
    <para>Back in 1951, when protection was first given to furnishing fabrics, the definition was &#34;piece goods of the type used for furnishing and upholstery, woven or jacquard or dobby type looms&#34;. That is to say, it gets down to damask types of material. In 1956 the definition was changed and became &#34; piece goods, woven, weighing 6 ounces or more per square yard, of the types which, either as imported or when further processed, are ordinarily used for furnishings, drapes, upholstery, &#38;c&#34;. </para>
    <para>In October, 1960, the wording was changed to cover materials principally used as furnishing fabrics. Unfortunately, over the years, the use of the terms &#34; ordinarily &#34; and &#34; principally &#34; have served merely to cause confusion regarding the type of material and have placed on the department the extraordinarily difficult task of administering the intent of the Parliament in fixing these duties. </para>
    <para>In 1959 the Tariff Board, as the result of an inquiry, cleaned up this matter by producing a common rule - by removing the differentiation between furnishing fabrics and non-furnishing fabrics. In other words, we had a common tariff and for a while there was no problem in differentiating between furnishing fabrics and non-furnishing fabrics, because they were at the same rate of duty. In December, 1960, as the result of a further change and the introduction of temporary duties, this confusion crept back into the definition of furnishing fabrics and non-furnishing fabrics. During 1962, I understand, the department treated the old item - fabrics to be used as furnishing fabrics - as meaning simply furnishing fabrics. It is true that a certain amount of discretion had to be used in establishing whether a fabric was a furnishing fabric of whether it was one which patently was to be used for other than furnishing purposes. </para>
    <para>The fact is that up until now the trade has never been able to produce a proper definition by which this matter might finally be resolved and put away. But there is at the moment a new reference before the Tariff Board, which will be asked to produce a clarification of the position, either similar to that which existed in 1959, during which there was a common tariff, or in some other way to establish finally which is a furnishing fabric and which is not. Until that matter has been finally established by a further reference to the Tariff Board, which will be aided and abetted by the best advice from the industry backed, plus or minus, by the determination, I am afraid the honorable member for Wakefield must be patient and assist the department to find a definition in this matter which will make the administration of the Tariff Board and tariff recommendations workable. That, at the moment, is extremely difficult. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CLAY</inline>(St. George) &#91;9.35&#93;.- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> it is useless to ask the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Kelly)</inline> to produce a definition of what constitutes a furnishing fabric and what constitutes a dress material. From time immemorial people have attempted to define what was a dress material and what was a furnishing fabric, wherever customs duties obtained. It is one of those things in respect of which I do not think it is possible for any human being to give a definition. How frequently do we see, hanging as curtains, very beautiful fabrics and how frequently do we see the same or similar fabrics being used by French or English ladies as dress material? To attempt a definition is hopeless, futile and impossible. It is one of those things for which there is no satisfactory definition and we must face that situation. </para>
    <para>What interested me most was the mention by the honorable member for Wakefield of a protective duty of 7s. 6d. a yard on a fabric made from fibreglass. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kelly.</inline>- No, not fibreglass. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CLAY.</inline>- I thought the honorable member referred to a fabric made from fibreglass, with a 7s. 6d. protective duty. However, I was in error. To my knowledge, the Special Advisory Authority gave an extra 2s. a yard protection to certain furnishing fabrics, notably moquette, when it raised the duty from 2s. <inline font-style="italic">Sid.</inline> to 4s. 8id. a yard. I will have more to say about that matter later. </para>

    <para class="block">I freely admit the difficulty of formulating a definition and of making a tariff schedule work. What worries me is that this change in duty was brought in under the umbrella of a machinery measure which the Minister assured us did not contain any increase in protective incidence.

    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. POLLARD</inline>(Lalor) &#91;9.41&#93;.- This proposal relates to a very important Australian industry - the Australian industry manufacturing deflection yokes for television sets. It arises as a result of a reference to a special advisory authority. The report was tabled and a temporary duty of 7s. 6d. was recommended for imposition on television deflection yokes imported from any or all countries. The temporary duty, which will also apply pro rata to parts of these yokes, will operate in addition to the normal duty but will not be imposed on goods in direct transit to Australia on 9th November, 1962, which were intended for home consumption on arrival. The normal protective needs of the industry have been referred to the Tariff Board for inquiry and report. The temporary duty will operate until the Government takes action upon receipt of the Tariff Board&#39;s report. I have looked through the Tariff Board&#39;s report and it would appear that the television parts manufacturing industry in this country has been seriously threatened by cheap imports, although television yokes of the type in question used in Australia are demonstrably as good, if not better than, the imported yokes. </para>
    <para>Under those circumstances, I consider that the proposal to impose a duty of 7s. 6d., in addition to the existing duty, should not be opposed. Nobody wishes to see an industry employing a lot of people in this country endangered. The Opposition will support the measure. </para>

      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. POLLARD</inline>(Lalor) &#91;9.43&#93;.- I understand that this tariff imposition, which is now operative, concerns motor trucks and trailer wheels, tin, iron or steel in plate or sheet form, and weftless fabrics. There are also some drafting changes. The Minister has said that the duties are in accordance with the Tariff Board&#39;s report. The manufacture of vehicle road wheels, rims and rim side rings is a relatively old industry in Australia. A number of firms, not very large employers of labour, are engaged in this industry. It is a very important industry in this country. Ralph Mackay Limited is engaged in this work in my electorate. It appears from a reading of the Tariff Board&#39;s report that it is essential for the survival of those engaged in this industry that additional tariff protection be given. Under those circumstances, we offer no opposition to the proposed increases. The new duties are considered by the board to be adequate to cover the needs of the industry. </para>

    <para>The  CHAIRMAN.  - The question now before the committee is the motion moved by the Minister, on 28th March, 1963, in connexion with Customs Tariff Amendment (No. 59). As the Minister has already stated, this amendment and Customs Tariff (Canada Preference) Amendment (No. 7) and Customs Tariff (New Zealand Preference) Amendment (No. 13) are associated. Is it the wish of the committee to consider these three proposals together and also consider the motions as a whole? There being no objection, that course will be followed. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. POLLARD</inline>(Lalor) &#91;9.48&#93;.- These are indeed most important proposals, dealing with one of the most essential industries ever established in Australia. I have only the Minister&#39;s press statement. I do not have the statement he made when he introduced the proposals to this Parliament. The duties that are to be imposed are of a protective character. There are also drafting changes, as in previous cases. There are increases of existing tariff rates. For instance, the existing duties on drilling machines are 27i per cent. British preferential tariff and 35 per cent, most favoured nation tariff. The proposed duties are 27i per cent. British preferential tariff, as before, and 40 per cent, most favoured nation tariff - an increase of 5 per cent, on the existing duty. </para>
    <para>If one looks at the history of the metalworking machines industry in Australia, one finds that an enormous amount of progress has been made, particularly since World War I. I do not know of any more important engineering activity than the manufacture of machine tools, which include lathes, milling machines, drilling machines, sawing machines, bending machines and every type of machine that the mind of man has conceived for the working of metals efficiently and satisfactorily. In Australia there are many competent firms producing machines of the highest grade - equal, or almost equal, to machines obtainable anywhere else in the world. That is not to say that some substantial improvement could not be made by some Australian manufacturers of machine tools. </para>
    <para>I suggest that if one searches the world for excellence in machine tools, one would find the highest degree of excellence in Switzerland. The Swiss are masters of the production of precision machinery. No doubt, this is an outcome of the precision that they have always displayed in the manufacture of watches and so on. If one wanted to go further, one could then turn to Sweden. The Swedes, by virtue of their great skills, their application, the availability of very high grade iron ore and their capacity to produce metals of the highest quality, manufacture machine tools of very high grade indeed. This does not mean that we in Australia are not now making some machine tools equally as good as those made in the countries that I have mentioned, and that we shall not be able, if accorded tariff protection, to improve our products and manufacture a wider range of machine tools than is now the case. </para>
    <para>The difficulty that has always confronted the machine-tool industry is that, when we go beyond drilling, milling and sawing machines, lathes and the like, we find ourselves in a highly-specialized branch of engineering and machine-tool manufacture. The market for milling and gear-cutting machines is relatively small compared with that for drilling machines and simple sawing machines. Although the progress made in the engineering industry in this country owing to the necessities of war has enabled us to manufacture these kinds of machines to a degree of excellence equal to that attained in other countries, I think that I ought to say again, as I have always said, that there is need for Australians to display greater thoroughness in the manufacture of many of their engineering products. It is true that one can buy more cheaply a machine that is rough and not well finished. But, after all, not so much extra cost is incurred in making a good job of the machine. </para>
    <para>If this country is to extend its export trade, particularly to South-East Asia and the Asian continent generally, machine tool products offer scope for increased trade. It is well known that we in Australia can do all sorts of things in the field of precision industrial equipment. I recall seeing displayed in King&#39;s Hall during war time an artillery range-finder manufactured in Australia by the Department of Munitions with the co-operation of some of the big private-enterprise engineering firms. If we can manufacture range-finders, the production of which requires the exercise of great engineering skill and precision and a high degree of know-how concerning the use and production of machine tools, as well as an extensive knowledge of mathematics, astronomy and goodness knows what, we can manufacture almost anything in this country. </para>
    <para>The Opposition offers no objection to the relatively mild increase in protection which is to be accorded to the machine-tool industry under these proposals. Indeed, we are happy to facilitate them. </para>

    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. POLLARD</inline>(Lalor)  &#91;9.54&#93;.- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> Customs Tariff Amendment (No.  60)  relates to fabrics used in the manufacture of belting other than impregnated, coated or laminated transmission, conveyor or elevator belts or belting. I think that this amendment will probably interest the honorable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Kelly).</inline> It deals with fabrics that are woven into belting of a special size, form, shape and weight for conveying power from all sorts of motors and prime-movers to all kinds of industrial machinery on the farm, in the factory or anywhere else. This amendment is the outcome of a temporary duty recommended by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Meere, the Special Advisory Authority, at the rate of  20  per cent, ad valorem on belting fabric, wholly, partly or chiefly of cotton or man-made fibre and weighing not more than  18  oz. a square yard. No doubt this belting is in some instances cut into strips much narrow than  18  inches wide - perhaps  2  inches wide, or the width of belting that I would normally describe as balata belting - and cemented or glued to make an excellent product. </para>
    <para>I have seen no reference so far to the Tariff Board report, but I suppose that this amendment is backed by such a report and that the report states that, in the main, these fabrics are made of cotton or manmade of this fabric is told whether the whether the customer who buys belting made of this fabric is told whether the fabric is made of man-made fibre or principally of cotton. Furthermore, I should like to know the relative merits of the two types. </para>
    <para>It appears that the Tariff Board proposes duty at a flat rate of  20  per cent, on belting made of either man-made fibre or cotton. I am not sure whether the Minister can enlighten me on this, but I imagine that he can. I am inclined to think that belting manufactured from man-made fabric would be stronger than belting made of cotton fabric. I think that if one fabric used in the manufacture of belting is better than another, we ought to be told that that is so, and some preference should be accorded to the better fabric when a tariff is fixed. After all, belting is one of the most important items used in the industrial life of the community. That is well known to everybody who has a motor car. If the fan belt breaks, the owner of a motor car is in real trouble. A fan belt made of cotton material may not last as long as one made of man-made fibres. I should like to have the Minister&#39;s advice on these matters. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. KELLY</inline>(Wakefield)  &#91;9.58&#93;.- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> I wish to discuss specifically the proposal for increased duty on rubber belting fabric. You may recall that when the measure authorizing the appointment of special advisory authorities was being considered in this place last year, I pointed out as vehemently as I could the danger of the system that is now operating - the danger of applications for increased duty being shuttled backwards and forwards between the Tariff Board and a special advisory authority. My gloomiest forebodings have been proved justified by events. This shuttling backwards and forwards has happened all too frequently. I shall mention this again and again during the consideration of these Tariff Proposals. </para>
    <para>Because I like to economize in the use of words, I have been searching for a descriptive phrase that would adequately describe this process that I have just mentioned. Several come quickly to mind. One could describe the present arrangements as a yo-yo system under which duties go up and down like a yo-yo, or as a backwardsandforwards system or even a stop-and-go system. I cannot claim any credit for originating the use of the phrase &#34; stop and go &#34;, however. The expression that seems to me to describe most succinctly the process by which references are passed backwards and forwards between the Tariff Board and a special advisory authority is the term &#34; shuttle system &#34;. That expression has the virtue of being simple and descriptive. For the rest of this discussion I shall use the term &#34; shuttle system &#34; to describe this process, the danger of which I have already pointed out. </para>
    <para>Coming back to this duty on belting fabrics, it is interesting to go over the timetable that forms the background to this duty. The temporary duty of  20  per cent. was imposed as a result of a report of the Special Advisory Authority on the reinforcing material of which the belting is made. The previous duties were imposed in May of 1961 - not very long ago. According to the Special Advisory Authority the old duties seemed to average about 50 per cent., which one would think would be a pretty reasonable rate of protection for an economic and efficient industry. This new impost increases the duty to about 70 per cent. You could leave the case there with slightly raised eyebrows and say that this is a pretty heavy protection. But if you are going to examine the matter in detail you cannot leave it at that, because this is only the beginning of the story. </para>
    <para>This fabric is used to make rubber belting, and rubber belting has been the subject of two Tariff Board inquiries since May, 1962, when the Special Advisory Authority granted emergency protection of 5s. per square foot in addition to the old 17i per cent. rate. As a consequence of the report of the full Tariff Board, which followed, it was decided that the emergency protection was not high enough, and the rate was increased to 27i per cent., with the temporary impost removed. </para>
    <para>With this rough time-table in mind let us look in detail at the Special Advisory Authority&#39;s report on the fabric, justifying the new duty. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Meere, the Special Advisory Authority, admits in his report that the imports are not coming in in great quantity, but the manufacturers of the fabric fear that they may come in in the future unless the duties are increased. This evidently has not happened yet, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Meere&#39;s summingup of the situation, but it may happen in the future. Well, I am a farmer. I may have a drought next year, but no one worries about me, I am just one of those who help to produce our export income. Why should any one be concerned about me? But when the manufacturers feel that imports may come in, although <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Meere says they are not coming in now, something must be done about it. </para>
    <para>But I must not be bitter about this. Let us return to the matter of this particular duty. Evidently the manufacturers of the fabric feel that they should not be asked to reduce their prices, although the Tariff </para>
    <para class="block">Board, after examining this subject, had this to say: - </para>
    <para>It is apparent-  and I quote from the Tariff Board&#39;s report, which preceded this by only a few months -  from comparisons which the board has made, that, in respect to conveyor belting, the price by Australian manufacturers to local weavers of the cotton reinforcing fabric, which represents approximately SO per cent, of the total factory cost, is significantly in excess of the duty paid price of imported fabric. </para>
    <para class="block">Evidently the manufacturers of these fabrics felt that they had to have the opportunity to price considerably above duty paid prices. The Tariff Board felt that if they could get their fabric at a reasonable price the manufacturers of belting could produce the belting cheaply. That is what the Tariff Board said. The Special Advisory Authority felt that imports might come in even over the existing 50 per cent, tariff wall, and because he felt that the manufacturers should not be asked to reduce their prices he imposed the extra 20 per cent. </para>
    <para>But this will not solve the problem. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Meere admits this, with his typical candour, to which I have often paid tribute. The manufacturers of the belting will not be able to buy cheap fabrics from overseas because of this duty, so they say it would be much better for them to import the belting direct from their associated overseas companies. In this connexion I again quote <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Meere, when he was talking about this very duty that he intended to impose - </para>
    <para>This, of course, would mean that, irrespective of what protection is given, the Australian manufacturers of belting fabric would lose the whole of their market. </para>
    <para class="block">This is the duty that he recommends which he says will lose the Australian manufacturer the whole of the market. Then he goes on - </para>
    <para>This inquiry, however, does not relate to belting, and my consideration must be limited to the belting fabric only. </para>
    <para>So there it is. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Meere has imposed this duty, which he admits will be effective only if imported belting is prevented from coming in, and the only way to do this is to increase the duty on belting, which was imposed only on 4th October last year as a result of the Tariff Board&#39;s report. I point out to the committee that I prepared these remarks in written form. Tariff Board reports and Special Advisory Authority reports come at me in bewildering profusion, and I have got into the habit of dealing with them as they come. I wrote this in January, when I said, &#34; This probably means that there will have to be another emergency inquiry on belting, and this will have to be followed by a full Tariff Board report on belting&#34;. This is exactly what happened. Later on in these proposals you will find another report on the belting that is made from the fabric. As I said, I considered that another emergency inquiry would be necessary, and the report of the Special Advisory Authority following that inquiry came to hand a few days ago. I am not going to speak at great length on the effect of the increase of the duty on fabric, but I am going to devote myself later to the inevitable increase which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Meere foreshadowed must come. He said that there must be, to make this duty effective, an increased duty on the belting in the manufacture of which the fabric is used. </para>
    <para>I am going to leave the matter there and wait until the belting proposal comes up for discussion. I simply use this as an illustration of the danger inherent in this system, with the Tariff Board divorced, as I pointed out it would be, from the other fiscal arm. Neither of those arms seems to be quite sure of what the other is doing. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CLAY</inline>(St. George) &#91;10.7&#93;.- It might be thought by some persons listening to this debate that the manufacturers of this kind of fabric are starting at shadows when they talk about their fears of possible importations of fabric manufactured overseas, and suggest that they require an increase of the duty of 50 per cent. This increase they received, of course, the duty being raised to 70 per cent. Others might think that the Australian manufacturers were hopelessly incompetent, and that as a result of their incompetency and that of their employees, the skilled workmen in this industry, it was necessary to secure protection. The fact of the matter is that Australia accounts for only about 1 per cent. of the world production of this material. It is produced in other countries in far greater quantity than we produce it in Australia. Because of this great quantity of production in other countries there are occasions when there is a surplus of the commodity. Certain importers always seek to take advantage of these surpluses, because the fabric is then available at reduced prices. </para>
    <para>I also think that our manufacturers have friends overseas who can apprise them of possible developments which might be harmful to Australian manufacturers. As a result of information secured in that way, from friends overseas, they have made an approach to the Special Advisory Authority, and, as a consequence, we now have before us an increased protective duty. </para>
    <para>I do not think that our manufacturers start at shadows. They have pretty good advance information of what is likely to be brought here from overseas, and they took the step of protecting themselves before the damage was done. I congratulate them on having done so. Far too frequently we find in this country that the damage is done before any protection can be obtained. </para>

      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. DON</inline>CAMERON (Lilley) &#91;10.12&#93;. - As most honorable members know, a Freedom From Hunger Campaign is being conducted throughout Australia at present. I can think of no more opportune time than this to direct the attention of the Government to the hunger that exists amongst the pensioners of Australia. Since I was elected to this House some sixteen months ago, I have repeatedly heard honorable members on the Government side boast of the great development, growth and prosperity that has occurred in Australia since the Government took office. The usual practice is to measure the prosperity of a country by the living standards and conditions enjoyed by the people. Honorable members opposite claim that our people to-day are enjoying better living conditions than they enjoyed a decade ago. Yet information I have received and investigations I have conducted show that, in the midst of all this growth and development and all this so-called high standard of living, 745,094 age, invalid and widow pensioners and their dependent children are living in the shadows of death from starvation. This is brought about by the lack of growth and development in tie rate of pensions paid by the Government. </para>
    <para>I have here an extract from a &#34; Vitamin Research News Letter &#34; compiled by Science of Life Books Proprietary Limited in association with Vitamin Supplies Proprietary Limited, 51-55 Warrah-street, East Chatswood, Sydney, which states in part - </para>
    <para class="block">Vitamins Sustain Life! </para>
    <para>The following appeared in the Sydney &#34;Daily Mirror&#34; of 6/6/62:- &#34;Five out of six of Sydney&#39;s pensioners keep alive with vitamin pills&#34; a Macquarie Street specialist said to-day. </para>
    <para>The specialist said pensioners would starve without the pills because they could not afford a proper, balanced diet. . . . &#34; lt is costing the Federal Government a fortune for vitamin pills which are free to pensioners,&#34; be said to-day. &#34; But all general practitioners in Glebe, Marrickville and other less-privileged areas of Sydney know that many of their pensioner patients would soon die of vitamin deficiency if they did not get help.&#34; </para>
    <para>We have never advocated the use of vitamins in lieu of food. It is deplorable that in Australia, known around the world as a food-producing nation, there should be so many pensioners lacking a balanced diet, and that doctors must prescribe vitamins to maintain the spark of life in these elderly people. </para>
    <para class="block">Not once have I heard honorable members on the Government side of the chamber raise their voices in defence of the pensioners Not once have they protested to the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harold Holt)</inline> or to the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Roberton),</inline> calling for an increase in pensions to help these people to ward off starvation and death. On the contrary, a senior Minister said that if he had an extra &#163;40,000,000 to spend, he would put social service benefits last. In effect, he would sentence the pensioners to death by starvation. </para>
    <para>Unless emergency measures are taken to introduce legislation that will increase the pension rates by at least &#163;1 a week, many pensioners who are weakened by an insufficient food intake will die during this coming winter, and the responsibility for this will rest on the Government. An increase of &#163;1 a week in the present pension rates would cost less than &#163;50,000,000 a year. That is not a large sum of money from a gross national product that exceeds &#163;1,000,000,000. It is not a large sum of money when it is remembered that it is being spent to preserve life. An extra &#163;1 a week in the hands of our pensioners would permit them to purchase the extra food they need so badly. This would be &#163;50,000,000 a year placed in immediate circulation. It would create a demand for our home grown and manufactured foods and in turn would give the economy a much-needed shot in the arm. It would set in operation a chain of events that would benefit the country in many ways. </para>

      <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, we</inline>have a Christian, moral and social obligation to provide for the care and wellbeing of the people who are too old, too sick or, through other circumstances, are unable to care for themselves.

      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. FOX</inline>(Henty) &#91;10.18&#93;.- I was most distressed to hear the honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Don Cameron)</inline> speak as he did. He said that he has never heard honorable members on this side of the House speak in support of pensioners. I remind him that during the term of office of this Government the rate of age pension for a single person has increased from &#163;2 2s. 6d. to &#163;5 5s. a week and for a married couple from &#163;4 5s. to &#163;10 10s. This is a higher percentage of the basic wage than was ever given to pensioners. This Government introduced a pensioner medical service; the Labour Government gave the pensioners nothing. This Government introduced a supplementary rent allowance of 10s. a week for those pensioners who live alone and who pay rent. Labour did not give any such allowance. This Government has continually eased the means test so that pensioner couples to-day may have an income from superannuation or from other sources of &#163;7 a week and still draw a pension of &#163;10 10s. a week. They have a total income of &#163;17 10s. Compare them with the men who are on the basic wage. They are receiving only &#163;14 8s. a week and they are trying to feed, clothe and educate their children. This Government has increased the limit of the means test to &#163;9,500. When this Government came into office, if a couple had &#163;1,500 in addition to owning the home in which they lived and their other personal belongings, they received no pension whatsoever. This Government raised that limit from &#163;1,500 to &#163;9,500. That made more people eligible for the pension. It is completely wrong to say that honorable members on this side of the chamber have never spoken up for the pensioners. </para>
    <para>I have received representations asking me whether I would support a pension equal to half of the basic wage. I do not mind telling the House what I have told members of pensioners&#39; associations and councils which have asked me about this matter. I am quite prepared to support a pension in excess of half of the basic wage for one pensioner only; but I will never support the payment of a pension equal to half the basic wage to each of two pensioners in the one family. I do not think that any working man who thinks about that proposition will support it, irrespective of whether the basic wage is &#163;14 8s., as it is to-day, or &#163;40 8s. Virtually no pensioner couples have dependants. The honorable member for Lilley spoke about 745,000 pensioners and their dependants. The age pension is payable to women 60 years of age and over, and to men 65 years of age and over. I cannot see such people having very many dependants. If you suggest that these people, towards the end of their lifetimes, when many of them have paid off their homes and have no rent to pay, should be in a better position than the man on the basic wage, I do not think you will get many workers to support that proposition, </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Einfeld.</inline>- How much do you think the age pension ought to be? </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline>FOX. - I cannot hear the interjection. I assure honorable members opposite that the pensioners have more friends on this side of the chamber than they have on the Opposition side. We have shown that in a practical way. 1 would support a better deal for the single pensioner who is finding it hard to exist on the pension that is given to him at present; but I do not subscribe to the proposition put forward by the honorable member for Lilley, namely, that hundreds of thousands of pensioners are existing on vitamin pills. That is sheer hysterical nonsense. That statement is not true. I know nothing about conditions in Queensland; but, in addition to what the Commonwealth Government does for pensioners, I remind him that many of the councils in my State of Victoria, including two of the councils in my electorate, help pensioners with meals which are delivered to their homes, lt is absolutely ridiculous and hysterical nonsense for the honorable member to speak as he did to-night, however well-meaning he may be. He should present the true picture to the people; that is, that this Government stands for the best possible deal for pensioners. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. DUTHIE</inline>(Wilmot) &#91;10.23&#93;.- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> I wish to speak on a different subject from that mentioned by my friend, the honorable member for Lilley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Don Cameron)</inline> and the honorable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fox).</inline> It is partly related to the subject of pensioners, which was mentioned by both of those speakers. I refer to the poor quality tea that is coming into Australia at the present time. I have in this saucer a sample of the tea being sold to people in Australia to-day. It is a sample from my State of Tasmania. It was bought in an ordinary grocer&#39;s shop in an ordinary half-pound packet. As far as I know, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> the origin of this stuff is Ceylon. </para>
    <para>This sample is powdery. It is almost like dust. When the tea is poured into the cup, this stuff floats on the top. Dust clouds arise when you pour it from the packet into a container, lt smells more like chaff than tea. Really, you would not recognize it as tea if  I  could give it to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and let you smell it. All through it are white sticks of tea leaf that were not filtered out of it before it was packaged. Those are just a few of the faults of this stuff that is being sold in Australia to-day at a pretty high price, although this is one of the cheaper types of tea. </para>
    <para>This sort of tea is not fit for human consumption. Yet thousands of our pensioners who are forced, by economic circumstances, to buy the cheaper brands are drinking or trying to drink this substance that is called tea and which comes into Australia under the cheaper brand names. </para>
    <para>I am wondering whether the tea that comes into Australia is inspected at the point of entry. I do not know who would do that. Perhaps it would be done by health inspectorsor customs officials. Unless there is a tightening up at the point of entry we will be deluged with this cheap, bad-looking and bad-smelling tea for a long time to come. It is up to this Government, through the Department of Trade which handles these matters, to ensure that the quality of tea imports is standardized. In other words, we should have a standard of quality that is applicable to all brands of imported tea. Obviously, we have no standards at present because this type of tea would not get into Australia if we had adequate standards. I have no complaints at all about some of the better known brands, but it is wrong that this stuff should be allowed into Australia. I ask the Department of Trade to have a good look at the imports of tea and to tighten up the inspection, if there is any inspection, in order to prevent the admission to Australia of the sort of stuff that I have shown to the House to-night. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Einfeld.</inline>- That tea is like the Government. It is very weak. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. DUTHIE.</inline>- It is very much like the Government. It is weak, dusty and powdery. I believe that I was justified in bringing this matter before the House to-night. This is the only way that we can raise problems such as this one. I was speaking to a number of women at a meeting on Monday night. I checked with them about the quality of the tea that they are buying. They agreed with me that the cheaper brands are a disgrace. They said that they would not buy those brands, even if they had to go without tea. Many pensioners and other folk in Australia who cannot afford to pay the high price of tea are forced to drink this stuff. It is not a fair go, and I ask the Government to do something about it. </para>

    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ward</inline>asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Navy, upon notice - </para>
    <para>1. From what source did the Minister obtain the information upon which he based his statement that the construction in Australian shipyards of the three guided missile destroyers ordered overseas would have provided employment for only a few hundred workers? </para>
    <para>2. Was the Minister&#39;s assessment of an addition of &#163;15,000,000 to the cost if the destroyers were built in Australia based on a departmental calculation? </para>
    <para>3. As tenders were not invited in Australia, will the Minister state on what basis the calculation was made? </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Freeth.</inline>- The Minister for the Navy has supplied the following information: - </para>
    <para>1. The statement referred to was based on the fact that assembling D.D.G.&#39;s in Australia would certainly require the importation for assembly of such components as guns, missiles, computers, communication equipment, radar, asdic, main propulsion machinery and the myriad sophisticated electronic controls necessary. In this case the main employment provided would be in shipyard assembly work only and the thousands which it is claimed would be employed in sub-contracting would, in fact, not be employed. Even the shipyard assembly work would not be as great as claimed in some quarters since the extra cost involved in assembling such ships in Australia would have precluded the acquisition of three of them. </para>
    <para>2. It was based on an estimate of an additional cost of 25 per cent, for each ship. This, in turn, was based on a number of calculations, some made by the department and some made by a member of the Shipyard Owners Association. It is possible that the estimate of extra cost given was too low, but it was qualified by &#34; at least &#34;. </para>
    <para>3. On the basis of past experience of naval shipbuilding and of a number of facts admitted by the industry. Examples of those facts are - (a) It is much more costly and takes much longer to build the first of a naval type than it is to build the fourth or fifth of that type; (b) at least 12i per cent, must be added to the cost in the country of manufacture of all components imported for assembly in such ships; (c) the longer it takes to build a ship the higher the cost, for a number of reasons. Not the least of these reasons is the amount of shipyard overhead added to the cost of a ship for each extra month or year it takes to build it; (d) special arrangements would have to be made to bring factory experts from the United States of America to supervise the installation of specialist equipment. An example of past experience in naval shipbuilding in Australia, which is relevant to (c) above, is that the shortest time it took to build a type 12 frigate in Australia was six years and three months. This is two and one-half years longer than the time it will take to build the D.D.G. in the United States of America, although the D.D.G.&#39;s are twice the size and infinitely more complex than the type 12. </para>
    <para class="block">Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clay</inline>asked the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation, upon notice - </para>
    <para>1. Can the Minister say to what extent the problems of noise and danger raised by lowflying aircraft taking off or landing over Rockdale, Bexley and suburbs to the north of Kingsford Smith Airport will be relieved by extending the 16/34 runway out into Botany Bay to the present proposed total length of 7,500 feet? </para>
    <para>2. Is it a fact that the length of runway required for large modern jet passenger aircraft is 10,000 feet or more? </para>
    <para>3. If so, will it become necessary for large jet passenger aircraft to use an airport other than Kingsford-Smith Airport if they are to operate on a full pay-load business basis? </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Townley.</inline>- The Minister for Civil Aviation has supplied the following information: - </para>
    <para>1. The take-off and landing of aircraft at Sydney airport is carried cut under conditions of safety prescribed and accepted on a world-wide basis. Aircraft are not permitted Vo operate at Sydney if these conditions are not fulfilled and this will apply also to all operations from the extended airport. It is not possible to set down quantitatively (he advantages to be gained, as far as freedom from noise is concerned, by the extension of the 16/34 runway into Botany Bay to a length of 7,500 feet. It can be said, however, that there will be a very considerable reduction in noise on the surrounding community generally since a large number of take-offs will then take place over the bay. There will be an increase in the frequency of landing aircraft over the areas to the north of the airport but these are largely industrial or commercial where the ambient noise levels are already relatively high. 2 and 3. The runway length for large modern jet aircraft is related directly to the stage lengths to be flown, the fuel loads to be carried for these stage lengths and the consequent all-up-weights of the aircraft. The runway lengths required at any airport are therefore related to the stages to be flown from that airport. At Sydney, the types of aircraft now in operation can carry satisfactory and commercial payloads to Nadi, Darwin and Perth from lengths far less than 10,000 feet. In the case of some aircraft, an operation direct to places such as Singapore or Manila would require a runway of this order under some conditions of temperature and wind. The requirement for such operation is not, however, sufficiently large to justify the extension of the runway to 10,000 feet at this time. If it is necessary to do so later ic is possible to provide this length at Sydney Airport. </para>

    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clay</inline>asked the Treasurer, upon notice - </para>
    <para>1. Is it intended that the recipient, whether married or unmarried, of a war disability pension should receive the full benefit of the pension? </para>
    <para>2. Is a reduction in the war disability pension made, in effect, if a husband is unable to claim as an allowable income tax deduction the wife&#39;s allowance of &#163;143 because his wife is receiving a war disability pension? </para>
    <para>3. Will he examine this apparent anomaly with a view to its correction? </para>
    <para>
      <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harold</inline>Holt. - The answers to the honorable member&#39;s questions are as follows: - </para>
    <para>1. The intention is that a war disability pension should be exempt from income tax. </para>
    <para>2. War disability pensions received by exservicemenor their dependants are exempt from income tax and are not reduced by operation of the income tax law. If an ex-serviceman, in addition to his war disability pension, derives assessable income the tax payable on that income is assessed without reference to the amount of his own pension. The allowance of a concessional deduction for a wife is unaffected unless the wife&#39;s separate net income exceeds &#163;65. If the wife&#39;s separate net income, including war disability pension, is between &#163;65 and &#163;136 a partial deduction only is allowed. If the wife&#39;s separate net income exceeds &#163;136 no deduction is allowed. </para>
