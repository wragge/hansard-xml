We made it very clear almost two years ago that we were determined to deliver taxation reform to the Australian community. We are on the verge of seeing that commitment delivered, and it will be a truly historic day for the economic welfare of Australia when that verdict is delivered because it will bring to an end a process that has now gone on for almost a quarter of a century.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I have with me a copy of the report of the Asprey committee, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Taxation Review Committee: full report</inline>, that was delivered to the Whitlam government on 31 January 1975, fulfilling a remit given to it by the former coalition government and by the late Billy Snedden, who was Treasurer in the McMahon 
 government in March 1972. In the concluding portion of the introduction to the Asprey report, the committee had this to say:</para><para>Accordingly, this Committee expresses the hope that, out of the discussions which appear and the recommendations which are contained in this report and from the disputation which will inevitably follow upon its publication, a fairer, simpler and more efficient taxation system will eventually emerge than the one which presently produces the revenue for the Australian Government.</para><para>I am delighted to say to the House that the policies that the government is implementing in the area of taxation reform will, almost 25 years after that expression of hope was delivered by the Asprey committee, be delivered to the Australian people.</para><para>It is fair to remember that, when I announced the explicit commitment of the government to taxation reform in August 1997, I said that the government's process would be guided by five principles. The first of those principles was that there should be no increase in the overall taxation burden. Far from there being an increase in the burden, in fact, taxation is going down under the government's plans. We are going to cut personal tax by $12 billion a year. We are going to provide another $2.5 billion worth of family benefits, particularly to middle Australian families. So a big tick to the first point. The second point is that any new taxation system should involve major reductions in personal income tax with special regard for the treatment of families. That also has been delivered in full.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>PE4</name.id><name role="metadata">BEAZLEY</name><name role="display">Mr Beazley</name></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order.

</para><para>Those principles of tax reform obviously go to the components, the pro-family bias and looking after those who are disadvantaged; they are clearly general principles and not the details.</para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The Leader of the House has made his point of order. The chair's ruling is consistent with the ruling given in December. I accept the intervention of the Leader of the Opposition where he is anxious that any legislative details not be canvassed, and the Prime Minister is also aware of that.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZD4</name.id><name role="display">Mr HOWARD</name></talker><para>—Mr Speaker, I am not endeavouring to canvass legislative details; I am talking in the broad about the pathway ahead for the Australian taxation system. The third lane in the highway was that consideration should be given to a broad based indirect tax to replace some or all of the existing indirect taxes. Once again, the government gets 10 out of 10 for what it has done. Once again, we have delivered in full on that commitment.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The fourth lane was that there should be appropriate compensation for those deserving of special consideration, and I think it is very, very important to emphasise that the compensation provided in the government's plan is very generous by any measure. It is in stark contrast to the lack of compensation provided by the Keating government after the 1993 election when it dramatically increased every indirect tax it could lay its hands on, hurt the poor in the process and gave not one dollar of compensation to the poor and low income earners of Australia. Finally, we committed ourselves to a reform of Commonwealth-state financial relations.</para><para>So, in every particular, we have delivered in full on the commitments that we have made. We have given a new basis for Commonwealth-state financial relations, and that is why the premiers, despite what they periodically say, all lined up to sign it. And none was more enthusiastic than Bob Carr—he almost bumped Peter Beattie out of the way. He drew himself up to his full height and, in that serious historical tone, he said, `You know, Prime Minister, it is not the policy of my party to support this—but, please, where do I sign, Prime Minister?' And 
 no wonder, because this is a marvellous deal for the states.</para><para>The states, under this plan, for the first time in 50 years, will have a financial base for providing the additional government schools, the additional police services, the additional hospital services and all the other social services that it is the constitutional duty of the states of Australia to provide. They have been begging and arguing and pleading and cajoling and requesting and demanding a growth tax for as long as I have been in politics, and I believe they have been doing that since World War II days—and at long last the government has delivered on it. I know that deep down the states cannot wait to get their hands on the GST revenue because it will give them a fiscal base the like of which they never dreamt they could ever have.</para><para>So I say in response to the member for Hughes: this is a great day most importantly for Australia's economic future; this is a very important day for middle Australia—we are giving them lower personal taxation. We are providing a proper fiscal basis for the states of Australia; we are providing reductions in costs for our business community; we are providing reductions in costs for our exporters. As I look across and see the vast array of representatives of both the Liberal and National parties who represent rural Australia and regional Australia, I know that we are delivering something that—in addition to lower interest rates, which we have also delivered—the people of the bush really want, and that is lower fuel costs.</para><para>It will ever be to the shame of Labor that it voted to keep fuel costs to the Australian bush higher than those fuel costs ought to be. But Labor is against lower fuel costs for the Australian bush, and that is a message that will be taken by every coalition member all around rural Australia—and you will not be allowed to forget the infamy of voting against measures that are designed to cut the costs of fuel for Australian farmers.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tax Reform: Business</title><page.no>7679</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>7679</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have a question which is addressed to the Treasurer.

We were glad to do it. We were glad to stand up in the national interest and support tax reform. It was done as a result of great leadership that was shown by the Prime Minister again after his election in 1996, with the support of the Liberal and National parties, with the goodwill of the Australian public, with the support of the business community and with the good wishes of all of those that believed Australia de 
 served better.

If you do that, you realise that what the member for Hotham is saying is absolute nonsense. The member for Hotham is trying to get off the end of a long skewer. If he were being consistent, he would run to the next election with a proposal to reintroduce his wholesale sales tax, with all the modernity of the tax system of Botswana and Swaziland and the modern thinking of the frontbench of the Labor Party.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Goods and Services Tax: Diesel</title><page.no>7682</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>7682</page.no><name role="metadata">McMullan, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McMULLAN</name><name.id>5I4</name.id><electorate>Canberra</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services.

Today is, as we all know, a historic day because today we are on the eve of getting rid of Labor's wholesale sales tax—a tax on knowledge. The member for Fairfax has put his finger on what is one of the great weaknesses of the taxation system supported by the Labor Party, because the wholesale sales tax, unlike the goods and services tax, is a cascading tax. It flows through, adding cost to item after item. When the Treasury calculated the impact of the wholesale sales tax on the cost of delivering education, it found that it added, over a four-year period, almost $1 billion to the cost of providing education in this country.</para></talk.start><para>Labor's wholesale sales tax is a massive tax on knowledge which this government is now going to get rid of. That means education is going to be cheaper to provide. It means that state governments, private school providers, non-government school providers and parish schools will be able to provide education more cheaply to their communities than they can at the present time. There will be a saving of something like $1 billion—$960 million over four years.</para><para>But the families of this country who believe in education and young people who believe in education should take further comfort from the historic reform which the Prime Minister has brought through this parliament and which will see success today. This tax will provide a growth tax to the states that will ensure that there is a continuing growth in revenue needed to support the government school system in this country. This tax package will provide a massive income tax reduction to Australian families—the biggest income tax reduction in Australian history. The average family in this country will be some $40 to $50 per week better off as a result of this package. This means that education will be more affordable than ever before.</para><para>This is a wonderful tax package for education, and this has been recognised by responsible people outside the government parties in this parliament. As Senator Lyn Allison of the Australian Democrats has said, `Education is a winner from the fairer GST.' It is only the babblers on the other side of the House, the lap-dogs of the Australian Education Union, who are prepared to put up the argument that somehow or other this tax package is not fair for education. Constant negativism and opposition, nothing positive, is what is destroying the reputation of the opposition amongst families and amongst young people.

The good news is that from 1 July of next year all Australians will receive an income tax cut. This will be done by increasing the tax-free threshold by some 11 per cent, from $5,400 to $6,000. It will be done by dropping the 20c tax rate to 17c. It will be done by dropping the 34c and 43c rates to 30c and by pushing out thresholds. It is government policy that 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers will have no higher marginal tax rate than 30 cents in the dollar. That is a great break for Australian families.</para></talk.start><para>For example, a one income family with one child under five years of age on a salary of $29,000 from 1 July of next year will have their tax cut by $800 and their family assistance will be increased to around $5,355. A single income family with one child under five as a result of tax cuts and family assistance benefits from 1 July next year will take home an extra $58 a week in increases in tax cuts and family assistance. That will be a result of reforming the tax system. To quote the words of Bob Hawke:</para><para>Unless there is a source of income in the consumption area, then the mass of Australians—the ordinary taxpayers—are not going to be able to get the substantial cuts in personal direct taxes to which they are entitled.</para><para>Mr Hawke was right. As a result of tax reform, families will do much better. Also, the abolition of Labor's hated wholesale sales tax will make many items cheaper; 21 days after royal assent is given to the abolition of Labor's hated wholesale sales tax the 32 per cent rate is going to come down to 22 per cent. So 21 days after royal assent to the legislation prices should start falling on tape recorders, radios, televisions, watches, clocks, cameras, binoculars and a whole host of items which Labor has been secretly taxing at 32 per cent for decades. Once we get around to abolishing Labor's wholesale sales tax on 1 July 2000 all of those taxes are abolished, but in the interim as a transitional measure the 32 per cent rate will come down to 22 per cent. That will start in advance of 1 July 2000, with those prices starting to fall.</para><para>The great thing about reforming the tax system is that you can abolish the hated 
 wholesale sales tax. We have a program to abolish stamp duties on shares, a program to abolish the financial institutions duty. All of those taxes can go. Income taxes can be reduced. Family assistance can be increased. That is what makes this a historic day for the reform of the Australian taxation system, a great day for the families of Australia, for whom tax reform is going to mean so much.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Goods and Services Tax: Diesel</title><page.no>7685</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>7685</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Connor, Gavan, MP</name><name role="display">Mr O'CONNOR</name><name.id>WU5</name.id><electorate>Corio</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services.

If my memory does not fail me, I think that increase in wholesale sales tax on wine was voted for by the then member for Hunter. When Labor's wholesale sales tax was to be abolished and replaced with the GST, as the government said in its election policy, it was necessary to equalise the price back and it was equalised back with a wine equalisation tax. In relation to the wine equalisation tax, although during the election policy it was posited at something like 32 per cent, the bill actually imposed it at 29 per cent. If I am not wrong, in the Senate yesterday when the Greens voted to change that to a volumetric tax, the Australian Labor Party voted against the Greens. The vote was two to 62, with the Australian Labor Party supporting the government both on the wine equalisation tax and the rate. No amendment was moved by the Australian Labor Party in relation to the rate. Oh, Mr Speaker! Oh, what a tangled web we weave.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In relation to cellar door sales, the government has said and always said that it believes that cellar door sales should be rebated, and they should be rebated as they always have by state governments. Why was it state governments that were running rebate schemes? It was state governments that were running rebate schemes because, in addition to Labor's 26 per cent wholesale sales tax on wine, the state governments had business franchise fees. The business franchise fees by and large exempted cellar door sales. But when those fees were struck down by the 
 High Court at the request of the states, the Commonwealth said it would apply a uniform tax, as it was required to do under the Constitution, in return for the states running rebate schemes. When the wholesale sales tax is abolished and replaced by a wine equalisation tax, the states should continue to run those cellar door schemes.</para><para>That is the agreement that we have reached with the Australian Democrats. The South Australian government has already indicated to me that it will be keeping a rebate scheme in relation to wine equalisation tax. Again, if the Labor Party want to make a positive contribution, what they should be doing is joining the government, supporting the government, going to the states, including people like the Treasurer of Tasmania, and saying to them, `Keep those cellar door schemes going.' That would be a positive contribution. That is what oppositions used to do. There are some members in this place who think that oppositions have always been negative, populist, opportunistic and nitpicking. That was not the case. This is a new rule led by a party with no policy.

Obviously from the electorate that he represents he takes a great deal of interest in issues revolving around the current circumstance of the Australian wool industry. This week is a significant week in the history of the Australian wool industry.	 The first reason is that today our government gets the new tax package through this House. We will be introducing a lot of savings and a much better taxation system for the entire rural community, particularly for wool growers. The benefits from the reduction in transport costs, which we have been debating in the chamber this afternoon, will flow on to wool growers and there will be extra savings for the rail industry with a $160 million cut in diesel excise to the rail industry.</para></talk.start><para>Just as importantly, members would be aware that last year when the government decided to freeze the stockpile in Australia it also decided to privatise the stockpile. This Thursday, WoolStock Australia comes into existence as the new grower controlled company that has the responsibility of managing 
 the stockpile from that point forward. This move has been completely endorsed by the industry. The industry, the entitlement holders in the original stockpile—the shareholders in WoolStock Australia—will be able to take control of this asset from Thursday under the leadership of Mr Donald McGauchie. He will do an excellent job as the Chairman of WoolStock Australia. That starts on Thursday.</para><para>There is another important point to note this week for the Australian wool industry. Members will recall that at the end of last year, at a meeting that was held in Goulburn, the wool industry as a whole made a fairly significant decision; they expressed, very clearly, their feelings on how their industry was being run, and the government responded to that.</para><para>I announced in this House that we would establish a Future Directions Taskforce which would report by the middle of this year. I am pleased to announce that the report of the wool industry Future Directions Taskforce will be made public tomorrow. We will be consulting with the Australian wool industry on the way forward from that point on—how to restructure the industry and how to better target the practices of the industry for the future of the industry and, particularly, for the growers in the industry.</para><para>I will finish on the point that I started on.

We do not have unrealistic expectations about what can be achieved from this first really effective meeting of reconciliation of the conflicting parties to the East Timor conflict, but we do regard it as a very significant step forward.

The fact that the Indonesian government has agreed to allow Xanana Gusmao and members of the East Timorese diaspora—in particular Jose Ramos Horta—to participate in these talks is a very important step forward.

I do know that over the years I have had cause to reflect on the fact that although Sir Robert and I had similar views on a lot of subjects there are a number of subjects on which our views were different. For example, Sir Robert, as befitted people of that generation, had a very different view about centralised wage fixation from the view that I hold. He had a very strong view about the role of the then Conciliation and Arbitration Commission on those issues. Over the years any dynamic evolving political party, no matter how much it holds in respect its founders or its earlier leaders, will evolve policies that are appropriate for the times.

As everyone is now aware, there is an investigation by the National Crime Authority pertaining to me. In a public statement that I made yesterday, I said:</para></talk.start><para>I can confirm that this group of NCA officers were involved in a comprehensive and highly intrusive tapping of my telephone at my offices and possibly my home and mobile for an extraordinarily long period of time—10 months, possibly as long as 18 months. This intrusive process not only meant that the NCA officers were aware of all my personal, political and community activities, they were also aware of the details of constituent cases, including the details of immigration cases. From the informa 
 tion which has come to me, it is clear from the interviews that the NCA has been conducting that they believe they have the right to question people about the substance of their immigration cases and the advice given to them by a member of parliament in relation to the best course available to them on those cases. I believe that this is a gross interference in the duties of a Member of Parliament. If this precedent is to be followed, the capacity of the Members of Parliament to deal confidentially with constituents, especially those in crisis and who seek their help, becomes virtually impossible.</para><para>I can now assert that there are two issues which I believe constitute a prima facie case of breaches of parliamentary privilege in this matter by a group of officers from the NCA.</para><para>Firstly, I have today gained copies of some documented evidence of interviews conducted by a group of NCA officers as part of this investigation. Prior to question time today, I have confidentially provided you, Mr Speaker, with copies of that evidence. In these interviews, this group of NCA officers have asked questions based on information obtained from the tapped telephone conversations. These questions do not pertain to issues of corruption but rather to the detailed claims which people have made in immigration cases and the detailed advice that I have given them in relation to their cases. They have also asked questions about people's personal lives based on this information from the telephone tapping. In each of these cases, this group of NCA officers have set themselves up as having the right to question the confidential advice given by a member of parliament and the course of action the constituent took.</para><para>I have sought advice from the Parliamentary Library in relation to this matter. I consider that, on the basis of this advice, the actions by this group of NCA officers constitute a breach of section 4 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1997 in that `they constitute improper interference with the free performance by a member of the member's duties as a member'. The Privileges Committee has in the past accepted the following:</para><para>. . . as well as participating in proceedings of Parliament Members perform other tasks, including the provision of assistance and advice to constituents.

In relation to this, the Parliamentary Library's advice states:</para><para>. . . impropriety might be shown in a number of ways, as for instance where police or investigating officers act unlawfully or for an improper purpose. But conduct may also be `improper' where the actions taken amount to no more than a `fishing expedition', the investigation process is unnecessarily oppressive or in some other way offends the principles of natural justice and due process.</para><para>I assert that, in the current case pertaining to me, both of these conditions have been met; that is, in my opinion, there has been improper action in relation to constituent cases by certain officers of the NCA and there has been a fishing expedition involved in the use of tapped telephone conversations. Some of these cases also relate to my parliamentary duties in the area of policy development, since I have directly referred to them in parliamentary debates—without, of course, mentioning the names of the persons concerned.</para><para>A fundamental principle arises in this matter which this parliament must now determine in terms of the protection of members' rights. This has to do with the capacity of members to provide confidential information and advice about immigration and other constituent cases without this advice being subject to telephone interception by bodies such as the NCA and then being improperly intruded into.</para><para> There is a second issue. The Privileges Committee is currently undertaking an inquiry into the use by bodies, such as the NCA, of members' files which have been seized, especially when such files relate to the personal and often sensitive problems of constituents. The terms of the inquiry are as follows:</para><para>The question of the status of records and correspondence held by Members of the House of Representatives, with particular reference to:</para><para>(1) 	 the adequacy of the present situation</para><para>(2) 	 the question of whether additional protection could be extended to Members in respect of their records and correspondence; if so, whether those records and that correspondence should be subject to additional protection, and, if so, what the form and nature of such protection should be. 
</para><para>I maintain that this current inquiry by the Privileges Committee is highly relevant to the investigation pertaining to me. I claim that the NCA has firstly misused a search warrant in seizing constituent files and, secondly, misused the information in those files to ask questions in interviews which pertain to the details of immigration cases and not to details of corruption. In so doing, I believe that they have breached parliamentary privilege in this matter.</para><para>Mr Speaker, I believe that the issues I have raised are extremely serious and constitute prima facie breaches of privilege. Whether or not it is finally determined that there have been breaches in this matter, I believe that it is critical for the Privileges Committee to clearly determine the rights of members with respect to the confidentiality of constituent cases and whether some form of protection of the details of such cases should be provided for all members.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—I will examine the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>  record and the confidential documents that the member for Calwell has lodged with me and determine whether or not a prima facie case exists for reference to the Privileges Committee.

The Treasurer then proceeded to mislead this House. He misled this House on two bases. First, he misled this House in trying to sell the House the concept that his wine equalisation tax combined with the GST will have no net increase impact on the wine industry. Second, he misled this House by assuring the House that his plans for the states to provide a cellar door rebate had the imprimatur of the states.</para></talk.start><para>I watched the Prime Minister as he left question time. What did he do? He approached both the member for Warringah and the member for North Sydney and asked them to speak on this matter, but of course they declined. I understand that we are going to get the member for Boothby—not a member of the National Party, not a member of the government frontbench, not a Liberal representing regional Australia but a member from a metropolitan seat in Adelaide. That is how seriously this government takes the wine industry and all those who are employed within it.</para><para>At around 4.55 p.m. yesterday, the Democrats and the government combined to vote down a Labor amendment to facilitate growth and prosperity in Australia's wine industry. The nation's 1,000 wineries employ almost 16,000 Australians directly and many more tens of thousands indirectly. When tourists visit one of our 50 winegrowing regions, they go there to enjoy the cellar door experience. While they are there they buy wine. They buy restaurant meals—which, by the way, will now be subject to the GST. They purchase local arts, crafts and souvenirs. They stay in local resorts, hotels and motels—again, things that are about to become subject to the GST. So, in other words, they voted in the Senate yesterday to destroy jobs. During question time today, as I said earlier, the Deputy Leader refused to take the opportunity offered to him to explain why.</para><para>The Deputy Leader of the National Party and his colleagues want to impose not one tax on the wine industry but two taxes. They describe the second of those taxes as the wine equalisation tax—in other words, a tax designed to top up the wine tax, for good public health policy and for good social policy. The opposition does not in principle disagree with a top-up tax. But, by the government's own admission, the price of wine is going to increase as a result of this measure. The government will reap an additional $147 million annually from the industry. Or, to put it another way—as the Treasurer put it in a recent letter to Senator Winston Crane:</para><para>. . . according to Treasury analysis, there is about an 8% increase in revenue collected under both the GST and the WET compared to collection under the current WST system.</para><para>During question time today, in an attempt to avoid the question I had asked the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the Treasurer attempted to return to `Labor's wine tax'—as he described it. That wine tax amounted to some 41 per cent tax on the industry. But, as the Wine Federation of Australia tells us—not relying only on their own figures but on the figures of Coopers and Lybrand—the double tax being imposed on this industry by this government measures 46 per cent. So, yes, Labor had a tax on wine, but the Treasurer, Liberals from regional Australia and members 
 of the National Party want to increase the effective tax on wine from 41 per cent to 46 per cent.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Mr Downer interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FITZGIBBON</name></talker><para>—Maybe the minister sitting before us can tell me how you can possibly call it a top-up tax when it is going to reap an additional $147 million annually from the industry. This question is not only being asked by the opposition. This question is being asked by bodies such as the Winemakers Federation, the Winegrape Growers Council of Australia, the Australian Regional Winemakers Forum, the South Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation, the Victorian Wine Industry Association, the New South Wales Wine Industry Association, the Western Australian Wine Industry Association, the Vineyards Association of Tasmania and the Queensland Wine Industry Association—and of course by every winemaker around this country, many of them in the very marginal seat of Mayo. As I pointed out today in question time, the Mayor of Indigo, a paid-up member of the National Party, says the combined effect of the GST and the wine equalisation tax will `destroy the wine industry'. On 23 April this year, the country's leading winemakers and grape growers handed out bottles of what they call `extinction wine' as a way of highlighting the death effect the Treasurer's double tax whammy will have on this very important industry.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4G4</name.id><name role="metadata">DOWNER</name><name role="display">Mr Downer</name></talker><para>—You said you were in favour of the tax.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8K6</name.id><name role="metadata">Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP</name><name role="display">Mr FITZGIBBON</name></talker><para>—I will pick up on the interjection of the minister. What I said was that the opposition quite clearly understands that, on the basis of good public health policy and good public social policy, it is important that, as a result of the introduction of the GST, the price of wine does not dramatically fall. We support that principle. What we cannot understand is why the Treasurer, to use his own words, wants to reap an additional eight per cent or $147 million from the industry annually. How can you describe that as a top-up tax or a wine equalisation tax? Even the minister cannot possibly explain the logic of an equalisation tax which reaps eight per cent additional revenue from the industry. 
 This is a measure that should have been revenue neutral in its application. It is clearly not, and the Treasurer has conceded as much.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I will concede one thing to the minister and to the government. I concede that probably—and I underline `probably'—the larger wine producers will survive this tax, because they will no doubt pass it on to the consumer.

I have noticed that before. The opposition's amendments to the wine equalisation tax yesterday were designed to protect those small to medium wineries and, of course, the jobs that they create. In the Senate yesterday the opposition proposed to exempt from the wine equalisation tax cellar door sales and mail orders up to a value of $300,000 annually. This is not the first time we have moved these amendments; earlier this year we moved them in the House of Representatives as well. You have got to ask the questions: where was the member for McEwen? Where was the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the member for Mayo, who has just scurried out of the House in shame? The member for North Sydney refused to front up in this debate, the member for Warringah refused to front up in this debate, the Deputy Leader of the National Party refused to field the question and now the member for Mayo, representing an electorate in a regional wine growing area, has scurried out of the House once again in shame. He is so ashamed he scurried out of this House.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There is one subtle difference between the amendment moved by the Labor Party in the House of Representatives and the amendment we moved in the Senate yesterday. The difference is the level of the threshold that would apply on the cellar door exemption. In the House we suggested that that threshold should be in the order of $100,000. We came to that conclusion in one hell of a hurry, having had the bill dumped on us late one 
 night. We arrived at that figure—which we thought reasonable at the time—under a great deal of pressure. The wine industry quite rightly pointed out to us that we had got it wrong, measuring it the way we did, and when we went into the Senate yesterday we increased it to $300,000. But the $300,000 was not our arbitrarily drawn figure; it was the Treasurer's figure. The Treasurer announced only last week that he had reached what he described as `another historic agreement with the Democrats to ensure that the states shall provide a $300,000 exemption on cellar door sales and mail orders'. What the Treasurer effectively did on that occasion was to absolutely concede that the policy of the Labor Party is correct. But, further to that, he conceded that the cellar door exemption is crucial to the survival of the industry—particularly of the small to medium wineries.</para><para>You cannot concede that this policy is necessary and then say that you are going to make the states pay for it. Before I move to the other point, I should say that this is the second way in which the Treasurer misled the House today. He told the House that he had agreement with the New South Wales Treasurer and the South Australian Treasurer to implement and to fund this rebate. I have two documents with me. The first is a media release from the Treasurer of New South Wales which says a number of relevant things, but I think this is the most relevant paragraph:</para><para>The Treasurer, Michael Egan, said NSW had not been consulted on the changes and it was not yet known what effect they would have on wineries and State Government revenue.</para><para>As the member for Kingston pointed out to the House last week, the South Australian Liberal Treasurer said this during South Australian estimates last week. With respect to the agreement with the Treasurer, he said:</para><para>No, it is not true . . . We have not been consulted, so at this stage we cannot agree to anything.</para><para>The Treasurer has misled the House, and to try to slip-slide his way out of it he plays this other confidence trick: he tries to tell us that the cellar door has historically been the responsibility of the states. What a load of rubbish. </para><para>Let us go back to the process. The states once had a state licensing franchise fee which the High Court found to be unconstitutional—by the way, that franchise fee exempted cellar door sales—so the Commonwealth came to the rescue, increased its wholesale sales tax rates and rebated the amount of money raised back to the states. But there was a difference between the franchise fee and the increased wholesale sales tax rate. The new tax rate applied also to cellar door sales. It was administratively difficult for the Commonwealth to differentiate between the two, so it raised taxes on cellar door sales and then rebated the cellar door component back to the states in order that the states could rebate the cellar door component back to the wineries. So there was never a cost to the states. But now, notwithstanding the fact that the Commonwealth, unlike with the GST, will be the sole recipient of the wine equalisation tax—in other words, it will reap all the rewards of the WET—it wants the states to pay for the cellar door exemption. How outrageous is that? What did Senator Kemp say to the Senate? His explanation for all of this was that the GST was going to produce for the states so much additional revenue each year that of course they should pay for the cellar door rebate. So we have seen a bit of what can be expected in the future. The Commonwealth will expect to increase the impost on taxation. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Nehl)</name></talker><para>—Before I call the next speaker, I am afraid I have to make some remark about the absence from the chamber of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</para></talk.start><para><inline font-style="italic">Opposition members interjecting</inline>—</para></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—I do not need any help from those on my left.

He is a grape grower. He actually has self-interest tied up in the whole debate. I have a quote where the member for Kingston talks about the shadow minister's exemption for the first $100,000 of cellar door sales.

We have heard that the opposition, as well as the industry, supports that. Where there has been some dispute is essentially about whether the wine equalisation tax should be 24½ per cent or whether it should be 29 per cent. The policy that the government took to the last election actually proposed that it be 32.4 per cent. It is actually less than we proposed at the election.

We agree with that. We propose that there be a rebate for the first $300,000 of cellar door and mail order sales. But we also feel that it should be the states that provide the rebate. The member for Hunter mentioned the South Australian Treasurer. My understanding is that, while they are still looking at the detail, they have always provided a 15 per cent rebate for cellar door sales and they have no intentions of changing that.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What will happen from 1 July 2000 is that the state governments will be receiving the revenue from the goods and services tax. If the Labor Party are so concerned about this, they should lobby the Treasurer in New South Wales, lobby the Treasurer in Tasmania—the brother of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition—and lobby the Treasurers in Labor states and ask them to maintain the rebate which they currently provide.</para><para>If we look at what the industry position has been, the Winemakers Federation supports the introduction of a broad based goods and services tax. The Winemakers Federation supports an ad valorem based top-up type tax and rejects a volumetric tax. It also supports the policy of implementing a wine equalisation tax to replace the difference between a 41 per cent wholesale sales tax and a proposed GST. They would have preferred a 24½ per cent WET to the 29 per cent WET the government is proposing. But, had you stuck with a 24½ per cent WET, the problem is that cask wine would decrease in price. The Winemakers Federation in their submission to the Senate Select Committee on A New Tax System recognised the positive factors for tax 
 reform. They talked about the higher disposable income levels—the government is introducing the largest tax cuts ever—increased savings to benefit capital intensive industries and increased consumption and expenditure, especially in bottled wine.</para><para>The whole thrust of the Labor Party's argument today has been to say, `We influenced the government's policy to make them introduce a $300,000 rebate in cellar door sales.' The Australian Labor Party have had no influence in the whole debate on tax reform that has been going for 2½ years. They have opposed everything. We have heard the great windbag himself, the Leader of the Opposition, come here and say, `We're all in favour of tax reform, but we are just not in favour of company tax reform or goods and services tax reform or reforming Commonwealth-state financial relations.'</para><para>So we said in the new tax system policy that the WET would be levied at a rate such that the price of a four-litre cask increased by 1.9 per cent—the general price increase associated with tax reform. The industry and the Treasury all agree that our policy would do that. At present, under the system that we inherited from the Labor Party, wholesale sales tax is paid on samples, promotions and tastings. That will not apply. There will in fact be no GST payable under the new tax system. The Senate committee's report estimated that the compliance cost would be minimal compared with the current compliance cost of accounting for the wholesale sales tax system.</para><para>Regarding the debate between ad valorum and volumetric, I think it is fair to say there has been quite a debate over the last year and there have been a number of reports which show that a volumetric would be detrimental for the industry, especially in high volume areas like Riverina, the Riverland and Sunraysia. I support ad valorem and I notice that most members of the Senate do. The Greens did at least try to amend the government's tax legislation. They did not agree with it and they voted against the legislation and put up an amendment that it be volumetric instead of ad valorum. It was defeated two to 62. And what did the Labor 
 Party do about the 29 per cent WET? They did not oppose it in the Senate. Cellar door sales have traditionally been an area of responsibility for the state governments and this is the Labor Party's approach  to keep on taking responsibilities from the state government. Since August 1997, the Commonwealth has collected excise for alcohol for the states and they have continued the 15 per cent state rebate. Rebates are best left to the states which will receive GST revenue from 2000; and it is estimated that that will grow.</para><para>In terms of the Labor Party's record on wine tax, it is worth going back to the history behind the 41 per cent wholesale sales tax that we had, effectively, when we came into office in 1996. In 1984 a wholesale sales tax of 10 per cent was introduced. In 1986, wholesale sales tax went up to 20 per cent. In 1993, in one of the most hypocritical acts that any government has ever undertaken, the Labor Party ran on an election promise not to raise taxes. They ran an election that was dominated by a debate about indirect tax. When it came to the 1993 budget they proposed to increase the wholesale sales tax on wine to 32 per cent. On top of that, you have a wholesale sales tax from the states of 15 per cent. The coalition—the Liberal and National parties—opposed that in the Senate. It stayed at 22 and it was 26 when we came in. When you add in the 15 per cent wholesale sales tax from the states, you get an overall tax of 41 per cent.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8K6</name.id><name role="metadata">FITZGIBBON</name><name role="display">Mr Fitzgibbon</name></talker><para>—It was a tax increase.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>TK6</name.id><name role="metadata">Southcott, Andrew, MP</name><name role="display">Dr SOUTHCOTT</name></talker><para>—Was it?

The government and the Democrats agree that cellar door rebates are important for wine tourism and small wineries. We have proposed that there should be a $300,000 cellar door rebate and it should remain, as it always has been, the province of the state governments. The Labor Party proposed to pre-empt discussions with the states. Their attitude is just to hand out money. That is why they left us with $96 billion of government debt. That is why the Leader of the Opposition created $25 billion of government debt in the last two years they were in office.</para><para>If we look at the debate about tax reform you would have to say, I suppose, that the member for Hunter is at least on the side of the forces of light in that he seems to have a lot in common with the member for Werriwa. In fact, I think he is the member for Werriwa's protege on the front bench. The member for Werriwa is sitting on the back bench and he has his protege, who is the member for Hunter, down on the front bench. The attitude of the shadow Treasurer has been to oppose everything—reflex opposition of 
 tax reform. At least, to the member for Hunter's credit, he has said, `We oppose this legislation but we are going to amend the legislation that we oppose.'</para><para>It is an interesting thing about the Labor Party. If you look at the people who have opposed tax reform in the Labor Party, you find that the people who are running against the GST and tax reform all support it now. Gary Johns has come out in favour of it. Bob Hogg has come out in favour of it. We know Paul Keating historically supported tax reform. You have got to ask the question: where is the Labor Party heading on this? Because the Labor Party seems to think they are going to spend the next two years opposing what has now gone into legislation. They are now going to oppose the privatisation of Telstra which is now up to 49 per cent. They are going to oppose tax reform.</para><para>It helps to explain why 18-year-old to 24-year-old Australians, Generation X, are more and more in support of the government. They see a government that is actually implementing its policies and that is prepared to stand up for what it believes in. What does the Labor Party stand for? The overriding principle that the Labor Party stands for is opposition to government policies. The Labor Party has now become the party of reaction; the Labor Party is a reactionary party. The Liberal Party and the National Party are promoting reform in areas like privatisation and tax reform. Where does the Labor Party stand? Does the Labor Party seriously think that it is just going to spend the next two years opposing government policy and that people will vote for that in two years time? I do not think so.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>7705</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Byrne, Michelle</name><name role="display">Ms O'BYRNE</name><name.id>84S</name.id><electorate>Bass</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have listened with great interest to the member for Boothby. Unfortunately, I am no further enlightened as to any kind of defence the government can put up for the wine equalisation tax or the dodgy deal they are trying to force onto the states. The Senate voted yesterday on the wine equalisation tax. The government and the Democrats voted completely in accordance with the exchange of correspondence of 22 June 1999 between Senator Lees 
 and the Prime Minister in which the Prime Minister said:</para></talk.start><para>Historically rebates for cellar door sales have been a State responsibility. The Government and the Australian Democrats agree on the importance of maintaining cellar door arrangements. The government undertakes to ensure that the States keep arrangements which provide a tax exemption for cellar door and mail order sales up to $300,000.</para><para>The Government will also examine a number of definitional issues arising from the WET bill, which you have advised, and the scope for concessional treatment of low alcohol wine and intends that these be dealt with in a Bill to be introduced in the Spring sittings. As a consequence of these commitments the Government and the Australian Democrats are agreed that the WET legislation will be passed by 30 June 1999.</para><para>To which Senator Lees replied:</para><para>The Australian Democrats now believe all of the matters covered by our `in principle' agreement of May 28th have been adequately dealt with by way of amendments, appropriations or your letter.</para><para>Since that agreement, there have been a number of conflicting statements made by the Treasurer, Peter Costello, the Treasurer of South Australia, Rob Lucas, and the Premier of South Australia, John Olsen. These statements demonstrate that the issue of a $300,000 exemption from the wine equalisation tax for cellar door sales has not been adequately dealt with, and it would obviously be a gross dereliction of duty for the Senate to pass the WET bills in an unamended form on the basis of any undertakings given from this government. However, unsafe or not, the bill has passed. When the Treasurer announced the exemption to the House last Wednesday, he said:</para><para>Now that the Commonwealth is abolishing financial assistance grants, abolishing the safety net arrangements and introducing a goods and services tax which will ensure that the states have all the revenue which they previously had and more, the states should be in a position to continue those rebate schemes. Indeed, I understand that South Australia has already indicated that it will, and I understand that the matter is under consideration in Western Australia and quite possibly in Victoria as well.</para><para>A couple of hours later, the shadow Treasurer of South Australia, Kevin Foley, raised this matter in an estimates committee of the South Australian parliament by asking the Treasurer:</para><para>I have been advised that, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, Senator Meg Lees has done a deal with the Commonwealth Government that commits the State Government to rebate the wine equalisation tax (commonly known as the WET tax) for the $300,000 of cellar door or mail order sales. Is this true? I have also been advised that the Treasurer has agreed to this with Canberra; is this so?</para><para>And the Treasurer, Rob Lucas, replied:</para><para>The second question is easy to answer: no, it is not true. We have not been consulted on whatever might or might not be part of the Commonwealth Government/Australian Democrats arrangements in relation to cellar door sales. Today, we have been hurriedly trying to get further information. However, we have not been consulted and, until we can see the exact nature of whatever this proposal is, we will have to reserve our position. I would imagine that it would require some State agreement if it is as described. I hasten to say all I have seen is what the honourable member has probably seen which is what was in the newspaper. We have not been consulted, so at this stage we cannot agree to anything. Over the next 24 hours we will do what we have been doing today, namely, urgently trying to get some detail on the proposal and the implications that might have on South Australia.</para><para>This reaction was hardly surprising since the states will not fund a rebate on a federal tax when it is the federal government, not the states, that is actually getting the revenue.</para><para>Indeed, there are strong indications from other states that they are not going to fund the $300,000 cellar door sales rebate on the WET. The Winemakers Federation of Australia have produced a status report on each state's commitment to the existing state's rebate on that portion of the wholesale sales tax which replaces the former state liquor franchise fees and the proposed $300,000 rebate on the federal WET tax. Western Australia, South Australia and New South Wales have previously made commitments in relation to the existing rebates on cellar door sales, promotional stock and mail order sales. On 5DN, the South Australian Premier, John Olsen, told Jeremy Cordeaux that he noticed there was a report from the federal Treasurer this week that there would be a cellar door exemption. He said:</para><para>There hasn't been any discussions with South Australia yet on who is paying that and I just want to say to your caller I think the Federal Government ought to be paying it needless to say. Our Treasury officials have been told to discuss the 
 matter with Canberra with a view to them resolving it and them paying it.</para><para>The Treasurer of New South Wales, Michael Egan, wrote to his state's wine industry association on 16 January 1999 saying:</para><para>I am writing to confirm the NSW Government will retain the 15% rebate on cellar door sales by wineries in the event of the Federal Coalition Government's proposed new tax system being implemented.</para><para>This decision naturally depends on the Federal Government keeping its commitment that the NSW budget will not be any worse off as a result of the Federal tax changes.</para><para>On 15 December 1998, my own Premier, the Tasmanian Premier, Jim Bacon, wrote to the Vineyards Association of Tasmania saying:</para><para>While my Government does not support the introduction of a goods and services tax (GST), the States and Territories may have little direct control over its introduction. At this stage there have not been any detailed discussions with the Commonwealth about the effect a GST would have on wine. My Government is therefore not in a position to make a specific commitment in relation to the future of the cellar door subsidy.</para><para>The Victorian Premier, Jeff Kennett, wrote to the managing director of a Victorian based wine company regarding the WET tax on 26 May 1999 saying:</para><para>I understand your concern, but this is an issue that is within the Federal Government's responsibility.</para><para>From these comments, it is obvious that there have been no consultations with the states and there is no substantial basis for the arrangement entered into. Indeed, the Treasurer confirmed this last Thursday when he was questioned about his misleading statement to the House, and his own explanation was:</para><para>. . . having given that undertaking and assurance 36 hours ago, I now have 365 days minus 36 hours to bring it off.</para><para>If one accepts a similar assurance to the one he gave the House, it seems Senator Lees was probably misled by the Treasurer, and that would be quite an adequate justification in any reasonable person's mind for her not to be bound by that part of the agreement. If the Leader of the Democrats was not misled and actually understood the total lack of substance behind the Treasurer's assurance to them that he would procure the states' agreement to funding the rebate, they join the Treasurer in 
 misleading both the wine industry and the country.</para><para>The only practical solution was Labor's amendment to include the cellar door exemption in the WET bills. Labor has been in negotiation with the Winemakers Federation of Australia about the appropriate level for the exemption since Kim Beazley had a meeting with the wine industry the Friday after the budget. The shadow minister, Joel Fitzgibbon, spent some time travelling the country speaking to representatives of the industry to make sure that our position would reflect the needs of the industry. The Australian Democrats have lost all leverage to force the federal government to provide an adequate exemption for cellar door sales by passing the WET bills in an unamended form.</para><para>The Winemakers Federation of Australia has calculated that a proper equalisation rate as promised by the government would be 24.5 per cent, not the 29 per cent currently contained in the WET bills. When the industry comes to realise the opportunity that has been lost by the Australian Democrats, I imagine they will be very angry. Stuart Bryce, the President of the Vineyards Association of Tasmania, is already very angry.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LS4</name.id><name role="metadata">FERGUSON</name><name role="display">Mr Martin Ferguson</name></talker><para>—A good bloke.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84S</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Byrne, Michelle</name><name role="display">Ms O'BYRNE</name></talker><para>—A good bloke, indeed.

It is a vital part of the entire tourism industry. In a submission to the Senate Select Committee on A New Tax System, Dr Andrew Pirie of the Vineyards Association of Tasmania gave a summary of the role of the regional wine producer outlining the multiplicity of roles played by those producers. He said:</para><para>The small regional operator:</para><para>.	 produces many of Australia's premium wine labels which act as flagships in export markets,</para><para>.	 is more labour intensive because of lack of economies of scale,</para><para>.	 plays a major role in regional tourism,</para><para>.	 is pro-active in the case for responsible use of alcohol,</para><para>.	 is the risk-taker introducing new varieties,</para><para>.	 is the pioneer of new wine-producing areas,</para><para>.	 plays a significant role in wine education, and</para><para>.	 (the 894 producers that) contribute to 1.8% of the Australian production in 1997 paid 15.7% of revenue raised through WST.</para><para>Geoff and Lindy Bull from the National Coalition of Small Winemakers believe that:</para><para>. . . the government's proposal will destroy small regional wineries and concentrate wine production within a handful of major corporate wineries.</para><para>As you can see, the Tasmanian industry has been very vocal in its campaign to stop the government's unfair tax. Unfortunately, this has not always been appreciated by all Tasmanian senators. When approached about the unfair impact of the WET on Tasmanian industries, Senator Abetz responded in this manner to the Vineyards Association of Tasmania:</para><para>Whilst it would be fair to say that I have been less than impressed by the antics of some elements in the industry during the course of the last election campaign, I am committed to working for the benefit of the industry as a whole.</para><para>Can I respectfully suggest that letters that are faxed to all Tasmanian Senators that refer to the Liberal's current tax regime on wine is singularly unhelpful and misrepresentative.</para><para>Tasmanian senators should be listening to the needs of the Tasmanian wine industry. They should not be listening only if the needs reflect their particular policy or concerns. The WET is an unfair tax. It will severely disadvantage small wineries, especially in Tasmania. The Treasurer agrees with this to the extent that he has proposed an exemption. It is to the detriment of the industry that he has failed to take responsibility for this attack on small wineries. This is a Commonwealth government tax and the Commonwealth government should be funding the exemption. They should be protecting jobs in the industry 
 by taking responsibility and enshrining the exemption in legislation. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>7708</page.no><name role="metadata">Wakelin, Barry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WAKELIN</name><name.id>HV5</name.id><electorate>Grey</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I find it quite ironic that on this historic day of the greatest reform in the Australian tax system in the history of Federation we are here talking about a wine equalisation tax at a time when the wine industry is historically at its strongest ever.

The history which the member for Boothby documented very well earlier—that is, the history of taxation on the wine industry from 1983 onwards—really does bear repeating. The new Hawke Labor government in August 1984—which in that period would have been the time when the budget was brought down—introduced a new 10 per cent wholesale sales tax. The wholesale sales tax was subsequently raised to 20 per cent in the August 1986 budget by the Labor Party, by the Hawke government. I wonder who the Treasurer was. I think it was one Hon. Paul Keating. Then, of course, as the member for Boothby so rightly reminded us, on 17 August 1993 that very famous budget of John Dawkins's—which will go down in Australian history as absolutely one of the more remarkable budgets—raised the then tax of 20 per cent introduced by the Hawke government up to 31 per cent.</para></talk.start></continue><para><inline font-style="italic">Mr Fitzgibbon interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HV5</name.id><name role="metadata">Wakelin, Barry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WAKELIN</name></talker><para>—That is very creative from the member for Hunter. I will not interject across the chamber, but I remind the House, as the member for Boothby has done so well earlier, that after that famous election when we were not going to have any more tax rises—we were going to have l-a-w tax cuts—the tax on wine went from zero in 1984 to 31 per cent in 1993. That is how the Labor Party plays this game. It is very interesting to listen to them on the opposition benches, or should I say the opposition trenches. Today, 
 on this historic day, we have a most incredible situation: we have this change and this great leap forward into the third millennium, as the Prime Minister was reminding us, with a new tax system appropriate for a new century, and we have the Labor Party talking about WET at a time when the wine industry is in very good shape. I will just remind the House of how strong the wine industry is currently.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Tomorrow we will have a report brought down on the wool industry which will show that the wool industry is in dire straits, a famous industry in this country brought to its knees by a range of circumstances very much contributed to by the Labor Party in the last 10 or 15 years—not all by Labor; there were certainly market factors as well. So I believe it is relevant to speak about the strength of the wine industry. In 1994-95, the price of cabernet sauvignon per tonne was $845. In 1997-98, the price was $1,183 per tonne. Those figures are based on the Riverland Indicator price. Australian wine exports, by value, in 1991-92 were $234 million and in 1997-98 were $812 million. I think the daily press is reminding us that we are heading towards a billion dollar export industry this year.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>8K6</name.id><name role="metadata">FITZGIBBON</name><name role="display">Mr Fitzgibbon</name></talker><para>—You're out for another growth tax.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>HV5</name.id><name role="metadata">Wakelin, Barry, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WAKELIN</name></talker><para>—The member for Hunter reminds me, and I must bring it before the House, of the taxation on the industry. Labor brought wholesale sales tax on wine from zero per cent to 31 per cent in 1993. I should remind the House, and give the Labor Party a little credit, that due to the outcry in 1993-94 the tax did revert to 22 per cent but then went back up to 26 per cent. This is one of the most remarkable things. For three months in 1993 the tax actually stayed at 31 per cent and then it went back to 22 per cent. Turning to the issue of the wine equalisation tax and the actual taxation measure, let me quote from A New Tax System, which went to the people and was voted on in October 1998. It stated:</para></talk.start></continue><para>The wine equalisation tax will be levied at such a rate that the price of a four-litre cask of wine need only increase by the estimated general price increase associated with indirect tax reform; that is, 1.9 per cent. The concessional taxation treatment 
 of the alcohol content of cask wine will therefore be preserved.</para><para>That is from the tax document, which was freely available to all and sundry before the election. I think the Labor Party really needs to talk, to look inside itself and to look at what it did in the last 15 years with the wine industry—from zero to 31 per cent, down to 22 per cent, up to 26 per cent. It is a very interesting record of the Labor Party.

In my final comments I remind members of the opposition that our tax reform will actually lower their costs of production, not to a great degree but at least it is heading in the right direction. Our tax system takes out the embedded wholesale sales tax, which has been there for the last 30 or 40 or 50 years. So the new tax system will reduce their costs. In terms of the increase in price of the product to the consumer, there will be a 1.9 per cent increase on four-litre casks. That is equivalent to the increase in prices of general consumer goods, including beer and spirits. We have a wine industry which is in a very strong condition. I welcome that of course, and I am sure the Labor Party does as well, but we must get this into perspective. We cannot get distracted on this great day of the passage of the new tax system.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Labor Party have found nothing better to do than to come into this place and talk about an industry which is very strong and about a tax system which is as fair as you can get it and which has been much debated.

 no doubt in my mind that the issue of the rebates for the states will be resolved with some commonsense from the states and the goodwill of the Commonwealth.

This is truly a historic occasion, one which has been a long time in the making.</para><para>I remember that in what must have been at least 1979, if not further back, the then Treasurer, the Hon. John Howard, first started to propose the concept of indirect tax reform. He was rejected. In 1981 he tried again. He was rejected. In 1984, as the then shadow Treasurer, he included in the coalition's then tax policy the proposition to adopt a broad based consumption tax to replace the wholesale sales tax system. We were not successful. The issue was then taken up by the Labor Party. It was then revisited by the coalition parties in 1990.</para><para>I take the opportunity to also pay tribute to John Hewson who, as the then Leader of the Opposition, took us to the 1993 election with the GST as part of our then tax reform policy. It is worth remembering because that election, whilst we were unsuccessful, was an example of an opposition standing up for what it believed to be right. When you look back on the history of reform in Australia all through the 1990s, the fact is that it was the opposi 
 tion which was at the heart of reform measures—not just in tax but in a wide range of policy issues. We were defeated in 1993. Some of us paid something of a political price for it, but we did pave the way for the later adoption and final implementation of this package.</para><para>These remarks, as I said, will be short. Now that the Prime Minister is here I do intend to complete my remarks in a timely fashion. I pay tribute to the leadership that he has shown in bringing this to a head. I also pay tribute to the coalition backbench—those who, all through those difficult years of the 1990s, supported tax reform. I refer to people like the member for McEwen, who has just walked into the chamber. She lost her seat, but people on our side have always been prepared to stand up for policy, even if it has been a hard one to fight.</para><para>I pay tribute lastly to the thousands of people in the Liberal Party and National Party organisations who were very disappointed that we lost in 1993. But I think they would look back on those times and say that we were right, and we perceived the public interest even though we paid a political price for doing so. It should never be forgotten that, when the hesitation factor was recorded in the 1998 election, it was the second highest hesitation factor ever recorded in a general election.</para><para>The highest ever hesitation factor for swinging voters coming across to the Liberal-National coalition was in fact twice that rate. It was recorded in the 1993 election, and that prevented the election of the Liberal-National parties to government back in 1993. Australia lost three valuable years, but we learnt the lesson. We were re-elected in 1996 and we now have, I believe, the greatest reform government this country has seen. It has already produced benefits which are providing assistance to families right across the income spectrum.</para><para>Moving this suspension of standing and sessional orders will provide an opportunity for the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to address the House. How appropriate and historic that address will be from the Prime Minister, who has led this debate from start 
 to finish to provide Australia with a better tax system. I commend the suspension to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>7712</page.no><name role="metadata">McMullan, Bob, MP</name><name role="display">Mr McMULLAN</name><name.id>5I4</name.id><electorate>Canberra</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There was a certain appropriateness about that. The Leader of the House seems never to be able to keep the word he gives on anything. He said he was going to speak for a couple of minutes—he went for nearly eight. I will not take up the time of backbenchers who want to speak on this by responding to the provocative things that he said. I will simply say that we accept the procedural arrangements. It is a great pity that eight minutes of it has just been wasted, but we accept the procedural arrangements and look forward to the debate and the vote.</para></talk.start><para>Question resolved in

It is a historic mo 
 ment that at long last Australia is to have a new tax system.</para><para>It is a source of immense pride to me as leader of the coalition government that, by dint of the policies we put forward and by reason of the fact that they were easy to misrepresent and could be subjected to a populist fear campaign, and having suffered considerable electoral losses in the process—and I want to place on record my appreciation not only to the members of the coalition party who were returned at the last election but also to our colleagues who were not returned in 1998—we were prepared in 1998 to stand for reform and to stand for the future economic strength and economic health of our nation.</para><para>There are occasions when political risks have to be taken in the national interest. There are occasions when, if nations and parliaments pass up the opportunity for fundamental reform of things such as the taxation system, long-term damage is done to those nations. I was reminded of that last week when I read one of the better articles of economic analysis I have seen for many months from a person whom I regard as probably the foremost economic political writer of our current period, Max Walsh, who is now the Editor-in-Chief of the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline>. He recalled historically:</para><para>Perhaps the most famous episode of tax policy undermining national economic strength was the situation a century ago in Britain. Back then its economy which had pioneered the industrial revolution debauched its global leadership by economic and political ignorance. Queen Victoria's Britain refused to introduce a tax provision for the depreciation of capital equipment. Consequently, because maintenance and repairs could be expensive, Britain's factories preferred to maintain old equipment rather than investment in new. As a result, the second phase of the industrial revolution became focused in Germany. Important British inventions such as the first synthetic chemical and improved iron and steel production techniques were developed at a commercial level by and in Germany. Germany displaced Britain as a developer and exporter of capital equipment.</para><para>The footnote is that it took 80 years and the courage and leadership of Margaret Thatcher to turn the industries of Britain around and once again place that country in a stronger economic position. The significance of that 
 historic analogy is that there are occasions when you have to ask yourself: what is the long-term national interest? What is the call that you have to take for Australia's sake rather than your own personal or political sake?</para><para>The reason today is a great day is not for any personal satisfaction that I derive from it, the Treasurer rightly derives from it or the members of the coalition derive from it, but that we have done something good for Australia's future. We have done something good for the national interest. Any objective observer who has been the least bit awake and involved in a literal way in the economic debate that has taken place in this country over the last 20 years would recognise that, during that 20-year period, we have essentially faced the need for reform and change in five major economic areas.</para><para>We needed to get our fiscal situation into a position of strength and surplus. We needed, in the early 1980s, to deregulate an old-fashioned, overregulated financial system. We needed to undertake tariff reform to expose the industries of Australia to necessary competition. We needed to undertake fundamental reform of our arthritic labour market and to deregulate our industrial relations system. Last but not least, we needed to undertake fundamental taxation reform. I will take a moment of the House's time to traverse each of those five reform areas, paying credit where it is due to initiative and reform undertaken by Labor governments and Labor prime ministers. If we are to have an intelligent debate, we should have the honesty to give credit where it is due on occasions when good things were done by Labor governments and by Labor prime ministers.</para><para>Fiscal policy is now in its strongest position ever. I cannot think of a time in Australia's postwar experience where the fiscal accounts of the Commonwealth have been in better shape. I want to pay unambiguous and unconditional tribute to the work that the Treasurer, in particular, has undertaken in that regard, ably assisted by the Minister for Finance and Administration and others. To take the sort of deficit we inherited and turn it into the most robust surplus in the Western world is a truly 
 significant and monumental achievement. It has given this country an economic self-respect and an economic dignity that I do not think I have experienced in the 25 years that I have been in public life. I think that is a monumentally significant achievement.</para><para>The second issue is that of financial deregulation. Those who remember the overregulated financial system we had in the 1970s and the early 1980s will remember that we had an exchange rate fixed by almost daily leadings of the Secretary to the Treasury, the Governor of the Reserve Bank, the head of the Department of Finance and the head of the Prime Minister's department. It became, in its later days, a system described as the crawling peg. It was a very unsatisfactory way of adjusting our exchange rate. It did not do anything to stop the speculators; they still speculated. They still bought against certain positions, and they still put enormous pressure on the Australian exchange rate and the Australian financial system.</para><para>We as a government established the Campbell review which recommended reform of all of those things. The former Fraser government had taken a decision to admit foreign banks before it was defeated. To its great credit, the incoming government, due largely to the activities of the Prime Minister of the day, Mr Hawke, and the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Bob Johnston, took a decision to float the Australian dollar, subsequently to admit foreign banks into this country and to implement the major elements of the Campbell committee's recommendation. Through all of the positions I have occupied, both in opposition and government, I have always given credit to the Hawke government for what it did in relation to the deregulation of the financial system. I will say, though, that they were aided and abetted by the fact that at no stage did we oppose anything they did in that area.

In the early 1980s, accepting a floating exchange rate was not an easy thing for many members of the National Party, yet we were prepared to accept in the national interest that that was a desirable policy. It is to the credit of the Hawke government, particularly to the credit of the former Prime Minister rather than the then Treasurer and the then Governor of the Reserve Bank. I think Mr Hawke and Mr Johnston were the heroes of the floating of the Australian dollar, and any attempt to suggest otherwise is completely wrong.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The third area is the area of tariff reform. I am prepared once again to give credit, particularly to the leadership of Mr Hawke, on this issue. It was not easy for a Labor Prime Minister to argue the cause of tariff reform. The measures that were announced by the Hawke government in that respect had our support because they were measures that were for the long-term benefit of Australia. They got our support because they were in the national interest. I record once again that the opposition parties did not play politics on tariff reform. You could have run the mother of all fear campaigns on the 1991 statement made by the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, on that subject, but we chose not to do so because we knew in our hearts that that was in the national interest. That is where, justifiably on their merits, I leave the complimentary remarks I make about the policy stances taken by the Labor Party.</para><para>I move inexorably to the issue of labour market reform.

All of us will remember the thuggery to which he was subjected in public debate terms by the union movement and by members of the Australian Labor Party. In the long run, history has vindicated his stance and shown that he has delivered a more efficient and a more effective waterfront that is going to build in time a more competitive Australia and a more competitive export system. That, of course, brings us to the issue immediately before the parliament.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I wanted to take a few moments to put in context the importance of what we are going to vote on in the next hour. We are voting to put into place the last of five great pillars that underpin the modern Australian economy. Without all of those reforms that I have mentioned, we would not be the modern, strong, robust economy that we are. If the Australian parliament were to deny us the vote that we seek tonight, we would be robbing future generations of this country of the strong economy that we believe future generations are entitled to have.</para><para>The measure of the significance of what is before the parliament tonight is that, of all the reforms that I have touched upon, none is more important than the cause of taxation reform. Taxation reform is something that people have been pursuing and seeking for the last 25 years. Every significant figure on both sides of politics over the last 25 years, in their serious moments about the future of the Australian economy, has known that taxation reform was necessary.</para><para>The former Prime Minister Mr Hawke knew it was necessary. The former Prime Minister Mr Keating knew it was necessary. I will never forget going into his office before the release of the white paper, when he was 
 Treasurer and I was economic spokesman. He handed me a copy of the white paper and said, `Keep it to yourself for a while. I haven't given it to some of my blokes, and I might be in trouble.' And he said, `But sometimes, mate, you've got to do good things for the long-term benefit of the country.' He was right on that occasion. I recall, and I think, I gave him more support in relation to that white paper than he got from many who sat behind him in the government of the day. He certainly got more support on that from many on our side of politics than he got from members of the Labor Party and members of the ACTU.</para><para>But, significantly, the now Leader of the Opposition was one of the strongest supporters of Keating in the cabinet debates on taxation reform in 1985. As I read it, the two strongest supporters he had were Gareth Evans and Kim Beazley. Deep down, the Leader of the Opposition knows that what we are doing tonight is right, but he does not have the political courage to stand up. He should have the courage but, more importantly, he should have the political integrity to recognise that the Australian people voted for this plan.</para><para>But the opposition has made its decision; the opposition has made a decision to run the politics of negativity and the politics of obstruction. In the long run the Australian people will make a judgment on that, and I do not intend to spend any more time on it in this speech tonight.</para><para>What I rather want to do is emphasise to the House just how important the decision that we are making tonight is. Not only will this give us the reformed taxation system that has eluded governments for the last 25 years but it will give us the most dramatic reductions in personal income tax that we have had since World War II; it will deliver to 80 per cent of the Australian community a top marginal rate of 30 cents in the dollar; it will deliver $12 billion of personal income tax cuts, and it will deliver $2.5 billion of family benefits over and above that; it will deliver billions of dollars of benefits through reduced costs for Australian exporters. It will deliver to the farmers of Australia and the people of 
 the Australian bush lower fuel costs, which they certainly need and which are long overdue; it will deliver to the business community of Australia a simpler, fairer and less complicated taxation system.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Mr Crean interjecting</inline>—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—The Deputy Leader of the Opposition: if I intervene again, it will be to warn you.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Howard, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr HOWARD</name></talker><para>—It will deliver to those who seek to evade their tax, particularly through the cash economy, a far more difficult challenge and a far more different environment in which to operate.

People said, `Give it away and concentrate on other things; keep talking about the current strength of the Australian economy.' That on occasions, I suppose, was an attractive option. But all of us, particularly on this side of the House, know that the current strength of the Australian economy is the product of important and good decisions taken a few years ago.</para><para>What we are doing today by voting for this legislation is that we will in five and 10 years time be delivering the sort of economy we now have, which has been delivered as a consequence of decisions that have been taken over the last few years—some of those decisions taken, to their credit, by Labor Prime Ministers and supported by us. But, sadly, that support is not being reciprocated in relation to taxation reform. Beazley is unwilling to do in relation to our tax reform what we were willing to do in relation to their financial deregulation and tariff reform. In the long run, the Australian people will make a judgment about that.</para><para>But the judgment they make about us tonight is that we have done the hard yards for the long-term benefit of Australia. In the 
 process of that, I do want to thank all of my colleagues for the support and the loyalty that they have given on this issue. I know it has not been easy, and I know I have overcome the concerns and reservations and objections of some in the process. I understand that, but in the long run you have to back your judgment against others in reaching those positions. I particularly want to thank my colleague the Treasurer for the way in which he has handled the detail and the complexities with great skill and great flair; that is evident every day in question time. I want to pay particular tribute to him for having done that.</para><para>But, most importantly, I want to pay tribute to the support that we have received from the Australian community, the understanding of the Australian community. Even though they may worry about aspects of it, even though they may not like aspects of it, even though there may be aspects of it they do not fully comprehend, deep down they realise and believe that it is better for Australia than the present system, and that is why they are going to go along with it.</para><para>I know that it is the fond hope of the Australian Labor Party that they can run a fear campaign on this. The Leader of the Opposition mutters across at question time that they hope the whole thing falls around our ears in two years time. That may be their hope, and let them do their worst. Let them run their negative campaign. Let them run their campaign of obstruction. Let them try to run a campaign designed to torpedo a long-term reform. But, in the end, we on this side of the House have enough faith in the intelligence and the goodwill of the Australian people to know that deep down, in the end, they will back a government that has got the guts to do the right thing for Australia rather than the right thing for their short-term political benefit.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>7756</page.no><name role="metadata">Beazley, Kim, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BEAZLEY</name><name.id>PE4</name.id><electorate>Brand</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Australian people do not want this tax and they are right not to want it.

The Australian people do not want this tax. Listening to the Prime Minister's remarks, never has so much been claimed for such a tawdry little objective. Since his deal with the Democrats, the Prime Minister has been exhibiting all the cockiness, all the relief, that comes from somebody who in political terms has faced a death sentence and had it repealed, had it drawn back. He has faced that death sentence because his party knows and the Australian people know that these tax changes—no longer tax reform—are bad for them and bad for the country.</para></talk.start></continue><para> There is no doubt at all that the Australian people need tax reform. They need it repeatedly. No tax system is going to stand for all time as valuable and as always relevant; it is going to need to be subject to constant change. Massive changes in the taxation system were put in place when we were in office. The Prime Minister in defending himself erects these gigantic hurdles which he has allegedly leapt: for example, his statement that the tax cuts on the benefit side of this tax package are the biggest since World War II. Let me inform the Prime Minister of this: when we put our tax package in place and the subsequent changes we made to the taxation system that we inherited from him as Treasurer, the total value on an annual basis of the income tax cuts was $30 billion—not $12 billion but $30 billion. He talks about the bottom marginal rate coming down from 20 per cent to 17 per cent. Do you know what the rate came down to under us when we took over from you? It came down from 30 per cent to 20 per cent. Compare that with coming down from 20 per cent to 17 per cent.</para><para> Do the Australian people recollect those $30 billion worth of tax cuts? Will they recollect the $12 billion, which basically 
 hands back bracket creep under us and bracket creep under them, and be grateful for that? No, they will not be grateful for it. But they will experience an element of that tax system which has been a drag on European economies where the system was invented—in contrast to that of the United States—which they now wish to exit. We are putting this tax in place while the Europeans are trying to work out how to exit this tax.</para><para>If you compare the growth in the American economy with the growth in the European economy, you have to see a factor of difference between the two. There are many factors and I am not going to be silly enough to claim that this is the only one. But if you said in the United States that you had a beaut new idea in tax—which was that every time a fellow decided to add a bit of value to an object you would tax it and invite him to become a tax collector while you did so—you would be received in the most successful economy in the world today with a very loud horse laugh. Indeed, the Americans considered the goods and services tax during the year of the Reagan tax reforms. They were a little insulting about it, I might say. They said that it was redolent of socialism. That was the view of the US Treasury Secretary at the time on the sort of tax put in place by big spending governments who did not care about adding value. That was the suggestion of the American Treasury Secretary of the time—it was a bit insulting I suppose to our side of the House—and that was why they did not do it.</para><para> One of the many reasons why the Europeans are now trying to exit this tax is that it sits at the heart of their black economy. The size of the black economy in Europe based on the evasion of VAT is the size of the entire British GDP. In Britain itself, a massive proportion of VATable transactions are evaded. The European Commission is now looking at trying to get the tax off services, for two reasons: firstly, it is almost impossible to organise an honest service industry and succeed in the United Kingdom; and, secondly, when you do it has all the characteristics of a payroll tax, a tax on labour and therefore a tax on jobs. So now the Europeans— 
 unfortunately for them it is very hard—are trying to work out ways to reduce and ultimately eliminate this tax. They cannot do it with any sort of readiness at all because a unit veto operates in the European system. Each country has a different perspective when it comes to revenue raising, each Treasury has a different concern about the amount of revenue being brought in, so they have to move to the tune of the lowest common denominator. But they are addressing this at the same time as we are putting this proposition in place.</para><para>The odd thing about it all is that the base that is attacked in political terms in the first instance is not ours, although our people experience great unfairness; it is the people who are obliged to organise it—the small business people of this country who find themselves now the tax collectors of the government.</para><para>If you extract from this process the goods and services tax, what else do you have in this tax reform package? In the rest of this tax reform package you have things with which we agree—the business numbering system, the taxing trusts as companies and the rest of it. But what people really want in tax reform is how you deal with the fact that a lot of people are evading paying their fair share of tax. You do not deal with it by making those who are paying their fair share of tax pay more, which is precisely what you are doing with a GST; you do it by getting to grips with them. The Treasurer is up on his scrapers here every day saying that you cannot have a business numbering system if you do not have a GST. Tell it to Charlie Bell, sport, because he is the bloke who did the study for you on small business. He said, `Yes, instead of doing provisional tax, do this tax numbering system for business, and put it in place to make it easier to pay the other taxes that we have some responsibility for'—a commonsense suggestion that we go along with. It is not dependent on the introduction of a goods and services tax.</para><para>The other thing they claim is that they confronted this gigantic budget problem which they are now dealing with—a $9 billion deficit compared with a $26 billion 
 deficit which we confronted when we came into office. They actually confronted the third best budgetary position in the industrialised world. That was the giant hurdle they had to leap over. They leapt over it manfully. And what did they produce with the combination of bracket creep, the cuts they made and the taxation system that they said was broke? They produced a budget surplus—the budget surplus which is now being spent.</para><para>They talk about sounder finances of government. Let me go through the four reasons why we have this GST: (1) sounder finances for government services, says the government; (2) a tax system which boosts exports, investment and business; (3) rewarding effort; and (4) making the tax system easier to deal with. Let us take `sounder finances'. Half the surplus raised under the old taxation system is being spent on putting this tax system in place. They claim that everybody is going to be better off. That claim is based not on the implementation of the GST but on the spending of the surplus. If this surplus is not spent, a massive impact is felt by ordinary middle income Australians. If you spend the surplus on tax cuts, then you might be able to offset the impact of it. But do not kid yourself that is a result of tax change. It is a result of dealing with a reasonable system and a reasonable situation that you yourselves were left with.</para><para>The consequence of spending all of that on putting in place this debilitating tax is that you limit your capacities everywhere else. The Treasurer was on his scrapers again in question time today saying that the business tax reform agenda is going to be conducted in a revenue neutral way. Why do it in a revenue neutral way? You have to do it in a revenue neutral way only because you have spent so much in putting this in place—on the compensation measures that you have to put in place to deal with this. But, if you really were about jobs and about the sort of innovative economy that we need to be in the next century, you would not be talking about swapping accelerated depreciation—that is, the tax problem confronted by British industry at the end of the 19th century about which you spoke, Prime Minister, oddly enough. 
 You would not be eliminating the question of accelerated depreciation to pay for a 30c rate. You would be talking about encouraging people to invest. You would be talking about capital gains tax changes that would reward people investing in an innovative product. You would be talking about putting back the R&amp;D concessions that you have eliminated.</para><para>You have achieved a couple of great outcomes on the social and educational agenda of this nation. Prime Minister, you alone in the Western world preside over a government which is seeing a net diminution on what is being spent on education and research and development. We were not all that good to start with, it has to be said. We were in the middle of the field. It is not as though we were up there with plenty of fat to play with. We were in the middle of the field. You have denied yourself the capacity to deal with these sorts of needs in our community. Why? Because you spend so much on compensating for a goods and services tax.</para><para>You said `a tax system which will boost exports'. Peter Dixon—who, along with all the economic journalists in this country has abandoned this tax package—says in the conclusions of his analysis of the package:</para><para>It'll generate a significant risk of reduced employment in the short run, not increase employment in the long run, harm Australia's exports of tourism and educational services, reduce the terms of trade, the prices of Australia's exports relative to its imports and have a negligible long-run effect on Australia's economic welfare average standard of living.</para><para>What a terrific report card! What a little ripper! What a marvellous statement! Every single one of the government's claims for this are massively undermined: bad for exports, bad for jobs, bad for equity. At the end of the day, Dixon—who, it has to be said, was no friend of the previous Labor government, just like Ross Gittins and Terry McCrann—says, `Why would you bother?' Why would you bother to do something as silly as this?</para><para>On the issue of rewarding effort, again they fail. There was one truly innovative proposal in relation to tax reform in the last election campaign. If we wanted to pick up something that actually was useful from the European experience—and this was from both the 
 European and American experiences—it would be the idea of putting in place a working tax credit, an earned income tax credit to reward you when you decided to participate in the work force. The irony of it is that without a GST it would have produced (a) a better budgetary position and (b) a greater tax benefit for most families—something like $20 or $30 a week more for the average family than produced by the proposals of this government. They know that that tax change is right but, because the Labor Party first advocated it in this country, they will not do it.</para><para>Do not go through all this guff and garble about how we were so bipartisan. Prime Minister, I remember question time after question time when you got stuck into us on the means testing that we put in place of benefits in this country. You got stuck into the assets test up hill, down dale, campaign after campaign, as we struggled to bring the budget—your budget—into balance, as we struggled to deal with the fiscal mess you left us. You—not someone else—were up on your scrapers every day attacking us. So do not come up with this guff and garble from your 24-hour memory, Prime Minister.</para><para>As well as leaving us with a $24 billion budget deficit, you also attacked us when we started to deal with that with a decent amount of assets testing. That was you and your situation as one rorter after another ripped away at the taxation system which you presided over. In relation to this business about you wandering around with tax reform, I have heard from people who were there in the cabinet room with you. The tax reform proposals of the Prime Minister were not so much a bang as they were a little whimper in the background of it all. But, when we came to do something serious with a bit of fiscal responsibility, you were in the trenches against us at every point.</para><para>Finally, they claim it will make the tax system easier to deal with. This really is an extraordinary claim. From 70,000 taxation points associated with the wholesale sales tax system, we go to 1.5 million. We turn every small business person and every business person in this country into a tax agent of the 
 government. We increase the staff of the Taxation Office by some 4,000 people to deal with the impact. We say we are going to control the price effect by a bit of action from the ACCC. The ACCC has no powers, but it will have a few additional personnel. I am told—and I may be out by one or two, but what would it matter?—that the ACCC personnel to be devoted to monitoring the price effect of all of this in Western Australia will constitute one. One person will be responsible for monitoring the price effect of all of this. I could be wrong, it could even be two or three, but the way I hear it one will be responsible for doing this in Western Australia.</para><para>We will find massive compliance costs associated with this in small business. To get a proper bar-coded cash register will cost $15,000. To get a reasonable cash register to deal with these sorts of things will cost $5,000. To get any guidance as to what you actually do, particularly for those 375,000 small businesses that now deal with the unbelievably complex arrangements as far as food is concerned, you would need at least that $5,000 cash register, but then again you would not know. If, say, you are running your local Kentucky Fried and somebody wanders out the door with a non-taxed coleslaw, sees a mate of his and wanders back in again, he has committed an offence—or somebody has. He has evaded tax. These are the complexities. Complexity on complexity has been built by this.</para><para>Jeff Kennett is now trying to escape the responsibility for this by attacking you, though he was one of those who wound you up to do this. He now tries to escape his complicity in this. Why? It ought to suggest something to you. Jeff Kennett is the father of the goods and services tax, but he spurns his child because he knows that he will have to explain himself to all the service companies that are supposed to be driving jobs in Victoria; all those new manufacturing industries that he would love to see established, all those companies based on the introduction of new technologies—the biotech companies, the information technology companies. All of them will be faced with massive tax compli 
 ance burdens, and he may be blamed. He also knows that the multifarious small businesses throughout Victoria will, courtesy of Kennett-Howard, find themselves as tax collectors. He wishes to crawfish out of his personal responsibilities in regard to this—and well might he do so.</para><para>This tax is bad. It is bad for jobs, it is bad for families, it is bad for businesses, it is bad for the country. I will not begin to go into Dixon's explanation of how this will favour imports over domestically produced goods, but when one contemplates that the areas that are most highly taxed in the wholesale sales tax system happen to be businesses in the areas which are most affected by imports then you get some idea as to why that might be so.</para><para>The point I want to make here today is that we need tax reform in this country, but this is not it. It is just a tax change. We need a reform that will make us more productive, we need a reform that will reward work, we need a reform that rewards innovation—none of that is here. What we have here instead is a pipedream of this Prime Minister in which he calls down all the gods of conservatives past to support him. He has denied his base and, in the process of denying his base, he is denying the Australian people what they truly need. It is a contemptible proposition and he will pay a penalty for it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>7760</page.no><name role="metadata">Costello, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr COSTELLO</name><name.id>CT4</name.id><electorate>Higgins</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I count it an honour to be standing here in the great forum of the nation on what will be one of its great historic days—a day when we sweep away the ramshackle tax system which was appropriate for 1932, a day when we set up a new system for Commonwealth-state financial relations, a day when we move to change Australia's income tax structure, a day when we change family assistance in a profound, deep and meaningful way; and one of those historic days which, in relation to the tax system, comes along perhaps every 40 or 50 or maybe even 99 years.</para></talk.start><para>When you see such days in the House of Representatives, the great days when change is effected on behalf of the nation, you have the opportunity to sit down and to reflect on and put into historical context what the 
 chamber happens to be doing and the great anticipation that there will be for the decades which are to come. You saw one of those speeches from the Prime Minister as he stood at this dispatch box. He put into historical perspective where our country had been in the past in the course of opening up to the great winds of economic change and where it would go in the future as the government builds upon reform and stakes out a position for our country into the next century. It was one of those speeches which marks the occasion with thought and with deep analysis of where we are and where we want to go. I would like to follow in that tradition, not respond to the Leader of the Opposition who gave a speech which you would probably hear at any ALP branch meeting on a Thursday night in a small hall.</para><para>The local members here tonight: what will he give his speech on? He will give a speech on: `Why we oppose tax reform'. I do not know—I have not heard too many of those speeches—but I imagine that the Leader of the Opposition has, over the last two years, probably stood in branch hall after branch hall and after they have read the minutes and the apologies and admitted the various members they will have said, `And now we have a person who needs no introduction, who will give us the benefit of his open, honest and new thinking in relation to the issues which confront the country.' That speech would have been delivered on, I guess, 1,000 occasions. There is always time to turn a new leaf. Perhaps we will see something substantive from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.

But on this side 
 of the House when we sat down two years ago to think about where we wanted to position Australia for the next century we thought that in the next century what this country needed was a new tax system.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We do not begrudge the thinking of Scullin in 1932 when he was thinking about indirect tax. He was confronting an economy which had a narrow goods base. Services were probably unthought of. It was not known how you could possibly tax services. Scullin did what was right for the times of Scullin. But is it right for the 21st century? Could Scullin have thought about the way in which you would trade currencies across screens? Was Scullin thinking about the way in which sophisticated economies would develop services? Was Scullin thinking about how you would take taxes off exports in a WTO compliant manner in a modern trading world? Was Scullin thinking about how you would export financial services, accounting services or legal services and how you would take off those embedded taxes in a new modern trading world? Of course he was not.</para><para>His was not the world of the PC; his was the world of the practical manufactured good. For his time he thought of an indirect tax system which was modern. But it is not modern for the 21st century. I think that if Scullin were here today he would probably be very surprised that there were people in an economy which he did not recognise still supporting a tax which he had authored. I think this would be a matter of great surprise to Scullin—a man who believed in policy right for his time—that in a society that he did not recognise in any meaningful sense there were still people who believed that tax wisdom ended with him. I think he would probably be very surprised that it had not moved on.</para><para>Let us look at the broad sweep of tax reform history. As the Prime Minister said, the Asprey committee in 1975 came to the conclusion that we needed to broaden the indirect tax base. I can remember when I was a student that the big debates going on in those days were how Australia would modernise its tax system. We look at the efforts of the Prime Minister when he was Treasurer in 
 the Fraser government to broaden the indirect tax base and to move into line with most of the developed world. We look at the contribution that was made by Hawke and Keating. Prime Minister Hawke said this, and I could not agree with it more:</para><para>Unless there is a source of income in the consumption area, then the mass of Australians—the ordinary taxpayers—are not going to be able to get the substantial cuts in personal direct taxes to which they are entitled.</para><para>He was right then; he is right now. The allegation was made by the Leader of the Opposition that somehow taxing consumption encourages the black economy. Let me quote Paul Keating in 1985:</para><para>The great majority of the Australian people would be better off; that is a change of this kind that is cleaning up the tax system, knocking out all the rorts and ramps developing a base in consumption, that is taxing expenditure, which means you tax people who sometimes either minimise their tax or worse than that, cheating and evading tax you get a proportion of it when you tax it when you buy something and by doing that, the people who have been paying their fair share of tax will get net tax cuts and be better off.</para><para>That was the thinking of Keating in the mid-1980s. It is pure invention that at this stage in 1999 all of the thinking on taxing consumption and bringing in the black economy was somehow wrong, that what we really needed all along was a wholesale sales tax, the tax of Scullin. </para><para>I have been subject to review teams that have come through Australia representing state-of-the-art international thinking, from the IMF and from the OECD. Both of them have regularly recommended that Australia needs to broaden its indirect tax base. Funnily enough, since I have been Treasurer no mission from the IMF and no mission from the OECD has ever come through and said, `What you need is a wholesale sales tax.' They have never, ever said that or anything like it. They have never said anything like, `What you need to do is narrow your indirect tax base. What Australia needs is a goods based tax system in a services based economy.' They have never said anything like that. Why is that? It is because of this: if you want an indirect tax base that is going to grow in proportion to your economy, it has to 
 be a tax on the output of your economy, which is goods and services. A goods base shrinks in proportion to the economy, and a tax on goods shrinks proportionately year by year. As a consequence of that, you either cut services or you increase income taxes. Australia has been in the business of doing both.</para><para>The Leader of the Opposition made an interesting point before. In many European countries value added taxes were supported by social democrat governments. Why? Because they knew it was important to secure a revenue base to secure a social base. What we are doing here—and, let it be said, opposed by Labor—is securing the revenue base to secure the social base. All of that revenue goes to state governments to secure the social base for future citizens.</para><para>Do we believe for a moment that the Labor Party would run to the next election with a policy of abolishing the goods and services tax and reintroducing wholesale sales tax? Do we believe that? No. That is why we know, by putting in place a base indirect tax system which grows in proportion to the economy, that this parliament can say, here and now, that for decades to come we have secured the means to look after the poor in Australia—those who have needed a helping hand—to look after the education of our young people, to look after the road infrastructures.</para><para>The people who cared about social services in this country were the people who cared enough to develop a revenue base to fund it. That is the point that I want to make in relation to the Labor Party. The Labor Party can go on with a lot of hypocrisy in this debate, but the people who cared for the poor and those who were going to be in need in the decades to come were the people who cared enough to secure the revenue base to look after them. I make no apologies for doing that—for securing the future for those who are going to be in need, those who are going to need education, those who are going to need a helping hand. And let us never hear from the Labor Party, the party that was prepared to put opportunism before caring and compassion, that it ever had an interest in securing the social base for the future.</para><para>I want to make some more points in relation to tax reform. One of the things you did not hear the Leader of the Opposition talk about in his speech was a plan to rerate Commonwealth-state relations. There is no other plan in Australia to rerate Commonwealth-state relations. There is no other plan in Australia to give the states a growth tax. It does not exist. It has not been put forward. His plan in relation to GST is wholesale sales tax. His plan in relation to Commonwealth-state relations is nothing. His plan in relation to income tax is higher income taxes. And his plan in relation to family assistance—which he also opposes—is nothing. Nothing has been put forward from Labor in relation to increased family assistance; there has been no proposal in relation to increasing family thresholds or increasing part A or part B family allowances.</para><para>You heard it in the speech from the Leader of the Opposition: in a 20-minute speech, it was at the 19-minute 40-second mark that he talked about an alternative. It was in these words: `Labor supports tax reform when it opposes broadening the indirect tax base. Labor supports tax reform when it opposes income tax cuts. Labor supports tax reform when it opposes new Commonwealth-state relations. Labor supports tax reform when it opposes family assistance.' Labor does not propose; Labor opposes.</para><para>As I have said previously in this House, why would you take a completely negative position in relation to these matters? It may sound good at the ALP branch meeting, but developing and building is always much harder than tearing down. That is why I think those in the Liberal and National parties, who are sitting in this House on this historic occasion today, can take pride in this: they were builders, not destroyers; they were looking forward, they were not looking back; they were the people who were securing the future for the poor and the needy and not doing them in the eye; they were the people who put principle before opportunism; and they were the people who believed Australia deserved a new tax system for a new century and that we could go into the next century with confidence in a new tax system.</para><para>When Paul Keating put forward these reforms and was unable to bring them off, he said this:</para><para>If we don't as a nation adopt this proposal then you won't see significant reforms in this country in taxation for the balance of the century.</para><para>Here, in our time, in 1999, under the leadership of the Prime Minister—and I want to pay absolute tribute to the Prime Minister who led this debate from the 1970s on—at this turn of the century, there were people who wanted to build. There were people who took hard decisions. There were people who were prepared to take the onslaughts of opportunism and populism because we believed and we wanted to build because we knew Australia always deserved better; because we knew a new tax system was necessary for a new century; because we had a vision for a new Australia; because we had a vision for reform; and because we were prepared to work to get it.</para><para>And the winners will be the Australian nation and the Australian people and the families of Australia who will have the opportunity to work and save. They will have more money in their pockets, and they will have the assurance that the social base has been secured because the government was prepared to lead, and this is the government that takes great pride in doing so. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>7763</page.no><name role="metadata">Crean, Simon, MP</name><name role="display">Mr CREAN</name><name.id>DT4</name.id><electorate>Hotham</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is not a great day for Australia.

It does them in the eye because the government, with their partners in crime the Democrats, have not looked to the compensation measures.</para></talk.start><para>As for the humbug of this being the great forum of the nation in which these issues can be debated, why did they guillotine the first bills through the House back in December and why are they guillotining it through tonight? If they really believe that this is the forum for debate, why won't they have the debate? Why won't they answer the questions we have asked them day after day in this place about the problems with the diesel fuel, the dipsticks on highway 1? Why won't they answer the questions about what food is in and what food is out? Why won't they answer the questions about when the salad becomes taxed and untaxed again? Because the truth is they have not got the answers. This is a complex morass of a tax. And it is not in the interests of this nation.</para><para>The only time we got scrutiny in these bills was when we took that issue into the Senate, and it was the Treasurer who fought every inch of the way to stop that scrutiny. So let us have none of this unctuous, schoolboy Treasurer coming into this place pretending that what he has done is to bring to the nation a great opportunity and to give this parliament a great capacity to debate it. He has not. He is a fraud, and he should be seen for just that.</para><para>Today, we see the last act in this House of the Prime Minister's great tax adventure. His great defining moment in 25 years of public life, and what is it? It is a 10 per cent tax. How original: Mr 10 per cent. This is the John Howard defining moment. In 25 years in politics, what can he come up with? A new 10 per cent tax. Mr 10 per cent, what a dud. And today we see the Liberal-Democrat deal to give this country a new regressive tax which will collect some $27 billion per year, an unnecessary tax through a deal that was best summed up by Peter Garrett when he said that it was a dirty deal done dirt cheap. And so it was. But the truth of the matter is that thousands of Australians will suffer as a result of this GST. They will know, every time they feel the hand of the tax man in their pocket, that Peter Costello put it there. Make no mistake: as much as he wants to heap praise on the Prime Minister and in effect say, `It's his tax; it's not mine,' the truth is this is Peter Costello's GST just as much as it is 
 John Howard's and Meg Lees's. The Australian people will not forget that. They will know the people who have given them this unfairness, this complexity and this approach that is not in the interests of the growth of this nation.</para><para>When this legislation came into the House last December, Labor opposed the bills which introduced the GST. We said there was insufficient time in the House to give it scrutiny, and we supported and successfully achieved that scrutiny in the Senate. We correctly argued that the compensation package proposed was unfair and inadequate. We correctly argued that the GST was not good for the economy, and we correctly argued that the GST was a threat to jobs. But we said that, if the GST were passed in this chamber, we would not oppose the associated compensation measures, such as the pension increases and the tax cuts, because it would be doubly unfair to impose a GST without any compensation—no matter how inadequate that compensation was. We did not oppose those measures, despite what this government argues. We voted for those compensation measures once the GST was passed, and that will be the principle that we adopt with these amendments and these requests back in the House today.</para><para>The GST itself has passed the Senate. The bulk of the amendments that are before us today go to making this a less unfair tax. We will therefore not oppose them, but that does not mean that Labor's opposition to the GST is weakened. We have done just as we said we would do; we have used every tactic and every argument to try to defeat this unfair tax. Every time there has been a vote in the parliament on this GST, we voted against it. We built the coalition against the GST. We opposed Democrat amendments which secured their initial opposition to the bill. Once Senator Harradine made his principled `I cannot' speech, we built the coalition against the government's GST, which could have and should have buried the GST forever. Unfortunately, a majority of the Democrats decided to resurrect it, but that is a decision that they will have to live with. They said they had to negotiate the GST; they did not. They could 
 have said, `We cannot.' They did not. They were dealt a hand where they could have bid nine no trumps; they bid six and won one. That is how good they were in this exercise.</para><para>As a last effort today, Labor will be moving two amendments to the requests and the amendments. I move:</para><para>That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: "the requests be referred back to the Senate for further consideration so as to produce a new tax system without a GST".</para><para>I also foreshadow that, at the appropriate time later in the debate, I will be moving:</para><para>That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: "the amendments be referred back to the Senate for further consideration so as to produce a new tax system without a GST".</para><para>The truth of it is that there are alternatives to the GST, and this hypocrisy from the Treasurer coming in saying that Labor has not put up any alternatives is absolute nonsense. Labor has gone on the record—and not only in the last election—with the alternative that the leader referred to before: the innovative tax credits proposal that economists, the Business Council and many around the country have embraced, but not this government. And we have the unction of the Prime Minister coming in here saying, `Hand on heart, when we see a good idea, we'll pick it up.' Absolute rubbish. The person who leads this nation has not been capable of bipartisanship in his life. This is a person so steeped in his past that he cannot see the future. This is a person incapable of embracing a decent idea if it comes from the Labor party, despite the fact that he went to the last election and the one before claiming to govern for all of us. He is incapable of it, and he has been shown up in this debate as well.</para><para>It was not only in the last election that we put the alternative forward. I spelled out back in February the principles that we would be looking to in guiding us in the direction of tax reform. At the National Press Club in May, we spelled out the way we would approach the budget and the way in which we could do tax reform without the GST, and that was a position reiterated in this parliament in the response to the budget back at the 
 end of May and in early June. The truth of it is that there can be tax reform without a GST, and the simple truth is that it still may not be too late. That is why we are trying, as a last effort, to get these amendments up today. There can be a fair outcome for families, there can be an efficient outcome for small business, but this package does not deliver on those outcomes.</para><para>Among the amendments and requests that we have before us there are some elements that we would oppose were there time to do it. For example, the highrollers amendment—the one that gives the special breaks to the casinos and the high rollers but duds pensioners. What sort of balance and fairness is that? Now that it has the chooks in, chooks out clause, where is the amendment which is actually prepared to put the details of this GST on the receipts? They used to rail forth about the hidden taxes and the embedded taxes in the wholesale sales tax. If they are so proud of this new tax, why won't they put it on the retail receipts? We will campaign around these issues because they are important. People need to know what they are taxed and they need to know when this man, the Treasurer, has his hand in their pocket. Why haven't we got the amendments that would strengthen the hand of the government in terms of tax avoidance to ensure that what we get is people paying their fair share of tax, not just being slugged with a new 10 per cent?</para><para>Because this thing is being rushed through tonight, we are not allowed the opportunity to pick it apart, but Labor did everything it could to defeat this unfair tax. We started from the argument that the GST is unfair, bad for jobs and bad for the economy, and we proved that case. We justified our claim. I want to pay tribute to everyone on the Labor side in the Senate and in the House of Representatives who participated in the exercise that scrutinised this bill, who tested the government's arguments, who found them wanting, who never made a claim in relation to our position that could not be supported by the evidence. Labor played the honest role in this debate. This government made assertion only—never backed it up by modelling, never 
 backed it up by evidence. Not only were they decried by the modellers but also accused of empty rhetoric. And empty rhetoric it was in terms of this government's justification.</para><para>As the facts came out in this debate, community sentiment against the GST hardened. Australians, as the Leader of the Opposition said, do not want this tax. They do not want it, they should not have it and they do not deserve it. It is not in their interests and we do not need it. The tax system is not broke, and this government has dipped into the surplus by a huge amount to fund this unfair tax by giving the compensation and skewing it at the top end of the scale. That is why it is unfair. These are the things that, through the painstaking scrutiny and the exposure of the weaknesses and unfairness of this tax, we demonstrated through the Senate process.</para><para>The Democrats sold out on the GST on Telstra and on the environment, on wine, on books, on their balloted policy and on their membership. It is the Democrats who are the casualties of this debate. They did not have to deal, but deal they did. Their leader has managed to engineer such a poor deal that it divided her parliamentary membership, her party membership and even sparked an attempted leadership spill. The other thing that Senator Lees did was to deliberately mislead Labor about her intentions concerning the environment legislation and the sale of Telstra.</para><para>Prior to her deal with the Prime Minister, Senator Lees requested Labor's assistance to defer Senate consideration of the environment legislation and the Telstra legislation until after 30 June. She had it within her power to ensure that that occurred, but she reneged on it. Instead, Senator Lees deliberately allowed the further sell-off of Telstra and then made the deal concerning the environment legislation. What you cannot do in politics is turn your back on your base, and the Democrats have done that in this rush to get this bill and this legislation through for the government.</para><para>As these bills pass, we will truly have a dog's breakfast of a tax for the new century—a mess that no-one wanted. We not only took a position to the last election but we have developed it since. The amendments we are 
 moving today continue that theme. We developed that package in consultation with a lot of groups in the community, and we will be developing our further position in the same way. Against the same principles and in consultation with the same groups, we will develop a better alternative. We did it at the last election, we have done it since that election and we will do it in the lead-up to the next election. This country does not need a GST. I would urge the House to support the amendments moved by the opposition.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>7766</page.no><name role="metadata">Swan, Wayne, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SWAN</name><name.id>2V5</name.id><electorate>Lilley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I second the amendment. This is a tax we do not have to have and it is a tax that we cannot afford. It is the most fundamental and biggest tax hike on Australian families in Australian history. I cannot work out who is more out of touch—whether it is the Prime Minister, whether it is Meg Lees or whether it is Peter Costello. The Democrats went to the last election saying that they would keep the bastards honest and all they have produced is a bastard tax, a tax which is going to be a fundamental attack on the security and living standards of Australian families.</para></talk.start><para>John Howard has the hide to come into the House today to say to us that Australians will forget this at the next election. Well, as Michael Caton said in the movie <inline font-style="italic">The Castle</inline>, `He's dreamin'.' He is certainly dreaming. Then Peter Costello, the Treasurer, goes on radio this morning and says that this will be great for Australian families. He says that they will be able to save more. He says that they will not have to go out and spend more on school shoes, they will not have to go out and spend more on bus fares. But they do not have the choice. They cannot give up consuming. Low and middle income Australians cannot stop consuming because this government has a 10 per cent GST on all the necessities of life.</para><para>The tax cuts offered to low and middle income earners in this package are not enough. They will be more than consumed by massive price rises which will erode their standard of living. Despite all the inane crowing that comes from this government that they represent the battlers or that they represent middle Australia, it turns out that some 
 thing like 50 per cent of the frontbench over there all have family trusts. That compares to two per cent of the Australian population. How can they go around this country masquerading in the belief that somehow they understand what it is like to go to the shops to buy a trolley full of goods and not have enough money to pay for those goods?</para><para>They are seriously out of touch because there is one thing that this package does: it is very strong in taxing the weak and very, very weak in taxing the strong. In addition to that, in addition to putting the biggest tax hike in Australian history on Australian families, the government have presided over some of the biggest cuts to family services in the history of this country. Go through the cuts to child care, go through the cuts to housing, go through the cuts to all of those essential services that battling Australian families depend on—something like $2.9 billion worth in their first term. The compensation package that the government are bringing in goes nowhere near to restoring those cuts or making up for the impact of the GST.</para><para>The most fundamental group in the community who will suffer the most will be families with children. Families with children spend more on housing costs, families with children spend more on fuel and power, families with children spend more on clothing and footwear. The GST will hit all of those items very, very hard. Despite the bastardisation of this tax in the deal with the Democrats, some one-third of all food that people purchase will still be hit by the GST. Seventy-five per cent of the expenditure of a family or a pensioner earning less than $30,000 a year will still be hit by the GST. When you put that up against the inequity of the tax cuts, you can see how this government has one favourite minority—the wealthy, because all of this package is tilted upwards, taking money from low and middle income Australian families.</para><para>A child born into a family earning $30,000 is worth something like one-quarter of the tax cut that the same child born into a family earning $100,000 will get. So we will be going around the country explaining the unfairness of this package. And every smirk 
 from the Treasurer, every sly grin, will reinforce the inequity of this package. Australians will understand when they look at the structure of the tax cuts, when they look at the impact of the GST on all the fundamentals of life, that they have been absolutely dudded. It is nothing but a cruel hoax.</para><para>Then you come to the family package. The compensation arrangements in this package are built on the assumption that the GST will cost a family just 30c per week per child. What a fraud! 30c a week is what this package is based on. You cannot compensate and have not compensated families at all, while at the same time you have provided a structure of tax cuts which gives tax cuts to those who are earning the most.</para><para>This is not tax reform; this is tax deform. You have deformed the tax system. You have screwed the tax system upwards. You have taken money off low and middle income Australians and in the process of so doing you have reduced the opportunities for their children to get ahead in life. And  simultaneously you cut back essential expenditure on education and you attack low and middle income families. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>7767</page.no><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name><name.id>KL6</name.id><electorate>Calare</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The goods and service tax and accompanying amendments to the taxation system are sitting in wet cement. Whether that cement sets and in what shape it sets time will show—and the distorted shape and cracks are yet to show, but they will. I have made my position clear over many months: the goods and service tax is a regressive tax that favours the well-off at the expense of those caught like a rabbit in the glare of the tax office headlights—nowhere to go to avoid, no discretion. The big tax avoiders, the friends of big government, are laughing. The heat is off. I think I heard the Treasurer today say that tax reform has been completed. Labor cannot cry crocodile tears for lower income earners either. Where was their attack on tax avoidance?</para></talk.start><para>It is a bottom up not top down tax. It gives the greatest benefit to those on higher incomes when a fair progressive system should take more from those who have to provide services which give those who don't the chance to improve their situation. The former 
 Taxation Commissioner Trevor Boucher says there is $21 billion worth of avoided tax and shelters out there that should and could be raided long before the imposition of an unfair tax on those who cannot avoid it. Not only that, but the further you go down the tax scale the less is the impact of tax cuts and the more every dollar spent attracts this tax. The compensations cannot be guaranteed; the GST can.</para><para>The Prime Minister suggests the only route to tax reform is a GST—that is absolute rubbish and the broader tax base we need is one based on greater income tax revenue, not consumption. The government has marketed the proposed changes as a new tax system for a new millennium, but the reality is the package is little more than an old fashioned, regressive, bureaucratic GST—nothing more, nothing less. Take the GST out of the package and the whole thing falls down like a pack of cards.</para><para>Some of the concessions granted to the Democrats were funded by reduction in income tax rates to higher earners. But those taxes in the first place are funded not from the GST, which goes to the states—and heaven help local government under that new funding regime. The tax cuts were funded through cutbacks to the states—funnily enough, cuts in university funding, labour market programs, legal aid and programs like the dental scheme. Incentives have been offered to the regional transport industry and farmers and to rail transport only after it was squeezed from them by the Democrats—the sorts of reforms that could and should have been funded by taxation gathered from areas identified by Mr Boucher.</para><para>I took a platform of opposing this tax to the last election and I claim a mandate from my electorate for that opposition.

</para><para>The <inline ref="s182">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1999</inline>  is perhaps the most significant legislation dealing with environmental issues that has ever been presented to the Commonwealth parliament.</para><para>The bill represents the only comprehensive attempt in the history of our federation to define the environmental responsibilities of the Commonwealth. It proposes the most fundamental reform of Commonwealth environmental law since the first environment statutes were enacted by this parliament in the early 1970s.</para><para>Reform is necessary because the existing suite of Commonwealth law does not ensure high environmental standards in the areas of Commonwealth responsibility. Just as importantly, the existing legislation does not provide the community with certainty as to the Commonwealth's role, nor does it provide an efficient and timely assessment and approval process.</para><para>Over the last three years, the federal coalition government has worked cooperatively with the state governments to identify the reforms needed to produce a more effective and efficient national approach to environmental management. The result was an agreement, given in-principle endorsement by the Council of Australian Governments in 1997, which defines the Commonwealth's role by reference to certain matters of national environmental significance. The COAG agreement also seeks to ensure the seamless integration of Commonwealth and state laws through a transparent mechanism for Commonwealth accreditation of state processes.</para><para>The  Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1999  implements the COAG agreement. In doing so, it provides the framework for a more effective national approach to environmental management, ensuring resources are focused on delivering better environmental outcomes at all levels of government. The Commonwealth's role in this national approach will, for the first time, be clearly and logically defined.</para><para>The bill will replace five existing Commonwealth acts—the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992, the Na 
 tional Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975, the Whale Protection Act 1980 and the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983.</para><para>The bill will establish a new legislative framework to overcome the deficiencies of the existing regime and to allow Australia to meet the environmental challenges of the 21st century with renewed confidence. The bill will promote, not impede, ecologically sustainable development and will conserve biodiversity. The bill will ensure the Commonwealth is equipped to deal with current and emerging environmental issues in accordance with contemporary approaches to environmental management.</para><para>National environmental significance</para><para>A major deficiency in the existing regime is that Commonwealth involvement in environmental matters is determined by ad hoc and indirect triggers, such as foreign investment approval and Commonwealth funding decisions.</para><para>Reliance on such triggers has undoubtedly limited the effectiveness of the Commonwealth's contribution to environmental protection. It has also created significant and unnecessary delay, uncertainty and duplication for industry.</para><para>More fundamentally, the use of indirect triggers means the Commonwealth becomes involved in the assessment of projects which raise environmental issues of only local or state significance. This should not occur. Conversely, under the existing law, the Commonwealth is sometimes locked out of contributing to an issue of genuine national significance because of the absence of an indirect trigger.</para><para>In accordance with the COAG agreement, the bill therefore abandons the reliance on ad hoc and indirect triggers in favour of appropriate environmental criteria.</para><para>The bill introduces a new and more efficient assessment and approval process that applies to actions which are likely to have a significant impact on the Commonwealth marine area; world heritage properties; Ramsar wetlands of international importance; nationally threatened species and ecological 
 communities; and internationally protected migratory species.</para><para>The bill also applies to environmentally significant nuclear actions, actions on Commonwealth land and actions by the Commonwealth and Commonwealth agencies.</para><para>An activity which does not have a significant impact on one of the matters of national significance will no longer trigger Commonwealth involvement in the assessment and approval process, even if it requires a Commonwealth decision or approval such as foreign investment approval.</para><para>In accordance with the COAG agreement, the bill provides a framework for recognising any additional matters of national environmental significance after consultation with the states and the proper consideration of state views.</para><para>Accreditation</para><para>Another deficiency in the existing regime is that it does not enable early, transparent and effective accreditation of state processes and systems.</para><para>For projects of national environmental significance that trigger Commonwealth involvement, the bill substantially increases the capacity for the Commonwealth to `accredit' state processes.</para><para>The Commonwealth will seek to rely on state processes which meet appropriate criteria by entering into bilateral agreements with states which detail accreditation arrangements. In summary, the Commonwealth will be able to `delegate' to the states the responsibility for conducting assessments under the bill where state processes meet best practice criteria.</para><para>The capacity for accreditation of state processes in the bill is significantly greater than under existing legislation. For the first time, legislation will allow the Commonwealth to provide up-front accreditation of state processes, broader accreditation of state processes and systems—avoiding the need to provide accreditation on a case by case basis for all projects—and accreditation of state decisions, but only in accordance with agreed management plans which meet best practice criteria. The bill provides a framework for 
 identifying appropriate criteria for use in the accreditation process.</para><para>An efficient environmental assessment and approval process</para><para>The bill implements a modern environmental assessment and approval process that will transform the Commonwealth process from its archaic 1970s structure.</para><para>Reliance on direct environmental triggers will substantially increase the certainty and efficiency of the assessment and approval process. Accordingly, the new process delivers significant benefits for proponents without compromising on environmental standards. The proponent may trigger the process, avoiding the current delays associated with designation under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. By relying on specific environmental criteria as the trigger—and not the existing indirect triggers—the proponent and the community know up-front whether the Commonwealth is involved. There is not the existing capacity for late intervention, and tight statutory time frames are now included at all stages in the process to ensure timely decision making.</para><para>The decision whether to grant approval is made after considering social and economic factors as well as the matters of national environmental significance.</para><para>Other features of the new process include express recognition of the precautionary principle and other principles of ecologically sustainable development, the adoption of a strategic assessment process to promote cumulative and regional assessments and the establishment of a framework for state accreditation of Commonwealth assessments—for example, for projects affecting more than one jurisdiction.</para><para>Biodiversity conservation</para><para>The loss of biodiversity represents the greatest environmental challenge currently facing Australia. The Howard government has demonstrated its commitment to addressing this challenge by establishing the largest environmental program in Australia's history—the Natural Heritage Trust. The bill now provides a substantially improved legal framework for the conservation and sustain 
 able use of Australia's biodiversity to complement the Natural Heritage Trust. Some of the features of the bill which will improve Australia's capacity to protect its biodiversity include:</para><para>.	 providing for voluntary conservation agreements with landholders for the conservation of biodiversity;</para><para>.	 enhancing protection for threatened species through improvements to the listing process, providing for the recognition of vulnerable ecological communities and conservation dependent species and the application of specialised criteria to assess the conservation status of marine biota;</para><para>.	 providing that regulations may be made for the control of access to biological resources in Commonwealth areas;</para><para>.	 providing for the improved management of Commonwealth reserves, including through application of the Australian IUCN reserve management principles;</para><para>.	 improving protection for world heritage properties;</para><para>.	 for the first time, providing legislative protection for Ramsar wetlands of international importance and migratory species;</para><para>.	 recognising and promoting improved management for biosphere reserves; and</para><para>.	 promoting bioregional planning.</para><para>The bill also provides for the formal establishment of the Australian Whale Sanctuary. The establishment of this sanctuary complements Australia's efforts at the international level to secure, through the establishment of a truly global sanctuary, a permanent international ban on commercial whaling.</para><para>The reforms presented in the  Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1999  are the product of a long period of negotiation with the states and consultation with key stakeholders, including industry, conservation groups and indigenous peoples. This consultation process included an extensive inquiry on the bill by the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee.  </para><para>The bill has been improved, to the advantage of all key stakeholders, as a result of government amendments adopted in the Senate. These amendments will:</para><para>.	 Increase transparency and public involvement. For example, there is: increased public notification; more opportunity for public comment in the environmental assessment and approval process; and requirements for public consultation on making bilateral agreements and bioregional plans. Proponents will be consulted on conditions to be attached to environmental approvals.</para><para>.	 Provide increased recognition of the important role of indigenous peoples in conserving biodiversity and managing jointly managed Commonwealth reserves. The statutory office of the Director of National Parks has been retained at the request of traditional owners.</para><para>.	 Ensure that the range of matters of national environmental significance which trigger Commonwealth assessment and approval is reviewed every five years.</para><para>.	 Impose additional strict safeguards relating to the delegation of Commonwealth environmental approvals to the states.</para><para>.	 Put in place additional specific time limits on relevant steps in the environmental assessment process.</para><para>.	 Require all Commonwealth bodies to report annually on how their activities accord with the principles of ecologically sustainable development.</para><para>Ultimately, of course, we need more than just the best possible environmental law regime to protect Australia's environment and promote ecologically sustainable development. Accordingly, not all of the matters of national environmental significance recognised in the COAG agreement are being addressed in this bill. The Howard government is dealing with issues such as land degradation and the retention of remnant bushland through the Natural Heritage Trust. In 1997 the Prime Minister announced a $180 million policy to reduce the growth in greenhouse gas emissions, and recently committed a further sum 
 of $100 million per year to support greenhouse abatement programs.</para><para>The COAG agreement also identifies heritage places of national significance as a matter of national environmental significance. However, in this instance the `Consultation Paper on the Reform of Commonwealth Environmental Legislation' indicated that development of a national heritage places strategy by the Commonwealth and the states should be concluded before legislation to give effect to a new national framework for heritage protection is progressed. The outcomes of the national strategy will, as necessary, be translated into future legislative reforms. At the Commonwealth level, these reforms can be accommodated within the framework of the  Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1999 .</para><para>In conclusion, the bill enables the Commonwealth to join with the states in providing a truly national scheme of environmental protection and biodiversity conservation, recognising our responsibility to not only this but also future generations. It does so by respecting and building upon the strengths of our Federation and the primary responsibility of the states for delivering on-ground natural resource management. It does so also in a way that is `user friendly' with predictable, transparent and timely assessment processes. By accepting Commonwealth leadership, respecting the role of the states and providing best process for users, the bill provides a framework within which to build public confidence and support for its vitally important objectives. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kelvin Thomson</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ENVIRONMENTAL REFORM (CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1999</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>7773</page.no><id.no>s197</id.no></debateinfo><para>Consideration resumed from 28 June.</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>7773</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>7773</page.no><name role="metadata">Stone, Sharman, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs STONE</name><name.id>EM6</name.id><electorate>Murray</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><para>That the bill be now read a second time.</para><para>This bill continues the process of reform of Commonwealth environmental legislation. It is an adjunct to the <inline ref="s182">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1999</inline>  which proposes the most fundamental reform of Commonwealth environmental legislation since the first environmental statutes were enacted in the early 1970s.</para><para>The  Environmental Reform (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1999  has three primary objectives. Firstly, the bill provides for the repeal of the five acts to be replaced by the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1999. These are the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975, the Whale Protection Act 1980, the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983 and the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992.</para><para>Secondly, the bill puts in place savings and arrangements for a smooth transition from the processes in place under the existing acts, including environment assessment and permitting arrangements, to the new schemes established under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1999.</para><para>The bill also amends Commonwealth government legislation that is affected either by the repeal of the five acts or by the content of the proposed Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1999.</para><para>The bill, together with the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1999, provides a new environmental law regime which enables the Commonwealth to join with the states in providing a truly national scheme of environmental protection and biodiversity conservation, recognising our responsibility to not only this but also future generations.

So there are over 600 pages of simplification here. One has to ask oneself just what old-growth forests hit the fence in order that this might happen.</para></talk.start><para> The second thing one would have to be concerned about is that this legislation features many amendments which have been provided to the parliament only in the last few days and rushed through the Senate without adequate opportunity for scrutiny by either parliament or public. Thirdly, this problem is compounded by the fact that this evening we are being given only a couple of hours to debate what, by the government's admission, is fundamental legislation. It is to treat this parliament with scant respect that we should be given a couple of hours to debate legislation which has been so extensively amended since the parliament and this House last saw it.</para><para>This is not a debate about legislative efficiency, it is not a debate about reducing administrative complexity or duplication, it is 
 not a debate about clarifying the responsibilities of each level of government for protection of the environment; this debate is about the Howard government's determination to revisit history and to remake it. It is also about the determination of their new coalition partners, the Democrats, to bend over backwards to facilitate what is a return to the past.</para><para>I have been reading an article in a newspaper which ought to know better that said that young people under the age of 25 are or should be supporting the Howard government. But, on this issue, as on so many others, this government is taking a position widely out of kilter with the aspirations of young people which, in this case, is for a decent system and proper standards of environment protection. I and other opposition speakers intend to unmask this government's ideologically driven obsession to restage battles which have long been lost by the forces of reaction, their desire to reset the rules of engagement and to erase from the record the victories won in past years by environmentalists.</para><para> This debate is also about incompetence on the part of the Democrats and their betrayal of their environmental and indigenous constituencies. Fair dinkum, you really could sell the Democrats the Brooklyn Bridge. It is not easy being green, so what have the Democrats done? They have given up. They came from the Liberal Party and they are going back. They are turning blue. When they said they were green, we did not realise it was simply the green shade of envy. They wanted to be part of the government and now they are. Their party president recently said that Democrat members who were critical of the party's new direction wanted them to remain the fairies at the bottom of the garden. They are certainly not the fairies at the bottom of the garden any more; the garden has been woodchipped and the Democrats have turned into hobgoblins with chainsaws.</para><para>The reason I say this is that this legislation seeks to remove the Commonwealth from being an active participant on the side of environmental and biodiversity protection. It comes from a government which would have this nation turn its back on international undertakings and responsibilities by radically 
 diluting the Commonwealth's power to give legislative and administratively enforceable effect to Australia's obligations accrued over time for this sovereign nation, for our region and for the biosphere as a whole.</para><para> The government has presented the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill as the only comprehensive and fundamental attempt to reform environmental responsibilities in the history of Federation. Although it might be the largest environmental bill introduced into the parliament, it is neither comprehensive nor fundamental reform. In many ways, it returns environmental law in Australia back to the 1970s and earlier where environmental concerns were the sole province of the states. This comes from Prime Minister Howard who is a back to the future, yesterday's man. He is one of those Liberals who bitterly resent the Commonwealth finding and using powers in past years to protect the environment, to protect the Franklin River, to protect the Daintree Forest and to protect Coronation Hill.</para><para>This bill, firstly, significantly limits the scope for Commonwealth activity on environmental issues. Secondly, even within that limited scope, the bill provides for an extremely broad range of exemptions from its standard procedures on so-called matters of national environmental significance. Thirdly, ministerial discretion in the bill is uniformly unfettered by any semblance of clear environmental standards. Fourthly, public participation in critical environmental decisions is negligible. Fifthly, and I guess unsurprisingly, this bill and its companion  Environmental Reform (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1999 , engage in another mean-spirited attack on the hard-won victories and rights of indigenous peoples in this country. It contains amendments, forged in a backroom deal with the Democrats in direct contradiction of traditional owners' expressed wishes, that have taken no account of the principles of joint management and shown no respect for the expertise of indigenous communities in caring for their environment. These flaws will ensure that this bill will be unable to deliver the certainties sought by all stakeholders.</para><para>It might be worth spending a little bit of time on the history of environmental law during the past few years. It is fair to say that national and international awareness of the importance of protecting the environment has blossomed in the past 50 years. International awareness of the environment is a significant example of one of the new social movements of the late 20th century, driven by local communities concerned about the effects on the social and ecological environment of unchecked pollution, industrialisation and unsustainable resource use. Australia has been no exception to this international phenomenon. All of the great environmental battles fought in Australia have had strong community support, with polling consistently showing environmental issues high on the list of community concerns.</para><para>The 1972 declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment marked the beginning of a serious attempt by the world community to weld environmental concerns to economic and social issues. As with the UN declaration on human rights, the declaration on the environment is an aspirational statement concerned with the potentially catastrophic effects of unchecked industrial development and resource use on the quality of life of all people and on the conservation of nature and ecosystems. During the past three decades, these aspirational statements have been fleshed out in a range of specific international environmental treaties relating to environmental damage, the marine environment, protection of the atmosphere, nuclear risks and the conservation of nature and other living things.</para><para>In the early 1970s, a Labor government introduced the first ever national approach to environmental regulation, with the introduction of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. That legislation was aimed at ensuring that significant environmental matters are considered in relation to actions, proposals and decisions taken by the federal government and its agencies. Commonwealth legislative initiatives on the environment have been critical in saving what are now considered as national environmental icons. The National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 
 1975, passed by a Labor government, ensured that invaluable areas such as Kakadu and Uluru became national parks under national control. Following the 1983 election, fought partially on the question of the Tasmanian Liberal government's intention to construct the Gordon below Franklin dam, the Hawke government introduced the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983. That act ensured Commonwealth protection of the Franklin River. Later that decade, the same Commonwealth legislation was used to stop the logging of the Queensland wet tropics, including the Daintree rainforest, by the Queensland National Party.</para><para>These sorts of battles were won over the dead bodies of those opposite. Both those Commonwealth interventions were fought tooth and nail by conservative state governments and by the federal opposition under the guise of protecting state rights. The Commonwealth government under Labor invoked the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975 when it sought to stop the logging of the Lemonthyme forests in Tasmania—forests identified for world heritage listing. Similarly, the Commonwealth intervened to stop the proposal to mine the ecologically and culturally unique Coronation Hill site in Kakadu.</para><para>Without this national approach to environmental security, all these sites of national environmental significance would have been destroyed. From a constitutional perspective, the legal struggles initiated by the states over the Commonwealth's legitimate use of power to achieve such environmental protection have resulted in a series of High Court decisions finding that the Commonwealth has near to plenary constitutional power to enact laws to protect the environment. However, despite this constitutional scope supported by both national community concern and international obligations, the Howard-Lees government has drafted a bill that provides for a handover of environmental control to the states and territories. Thus we are going the full circle back to the 1960s when states' rights on such matters were sacrosanct.</para><para>As we reflect on this history—a history of Labor achievement of environmental protec 
 tion—I think it is fair to note that the Labor government and the Labor Party have not received enough credit for these things. It is high time that green groups gave up what I think is a rather silly, teenage infatuation with Independents and third parties—an infatuation shown by the Democrats' conduct concerning this bill to be very much misplaced—and realised that there is one party in this nation and one party alone which has delivered on environmental protection—and that is the Labor Party.</para><para>This legislation purports to carve up the respective responsibilities of the Commonwealth and the states and territories through its definition of what it calls `matters of national environmental significance'. Despite the glossy description, the bill ensures that nominal Commonwealth control over even these areas can cascade directly to state and territory control through narrow concepts of the operation of such national matters and through a myriad exemptions to the standard assessment and approval processes. Within the bill, there are six specific matters of national environmental significance and one catch-all provision which grants the power to make regulations for additional matters of national environmental significance in accordance with specified constitutional powers.</para><para>The policy justification for the nomination of these specific areas of national environmental significance is the Council of Australian Government's 1997 `Heads of Agreement on Commonwealth/State Roles and Responsibilities for the Environment'. However, COAG agreed that Commonwealth involvement should include 30, not six, identified matters of national environmental significance. The 30 agreed areas of responsibility included questions such as climate change, greenhouse gases, ozone depletion, air quality, soil salinity, desertification, water allocation, land degradation and land clearing. Despite identification of all these comprehensive issues, we have here a bill which gives effect only to some six. The rest of them do not appear. These major national matters are left to languish in the ether between Commonwealth and state responsibility. This is a recipe for legislative and for administrative 
 paralysis. Those failed environmentalists, the Democrats, failed or forgot in their negotiations with the government to get even one of the 23 outstanding national matters added to the bill. Indeed, they voted with the government in the Senate to defeat Labor's proposal to add the trigger of greenhouse gas emissions as a further national matter. Hardly a satisfactory situation for legislation of environmental change claimed to be comprehensive and fundamental.</para><para>But there is more. The second mechanism by which this bill narrows the ambit of Commonwealth control is that it limits Commonwealth assessment of proposals to those parts of a proposal which specifically affect the six specified matters of national environmental significance. So, if other aspects of the proposal are environmentally destructive, they cannot be assessed at all or they have to be assessed under a state regime, creating a duplication of process which, we are told, this bill is specifically designed to avoid. For example, if a facility were built on the site of an endangered species, it would require assessment by the Commonwealth in relation to that endangered species, but it might also require state government assessment of its greenhouse gas emissions. Such a process is clearly inefficient, involves duplication and fails to ensure coordinated and comprehensive analysis of environmental impact—a truly bizarre state of affairs. Indeed, the Democrat-government deal adds to the complexity. As if bilateral agreements were not bad enough, the amendments rushed through the Senate last week mean we have something new, bilaterally accredited management plans, BAMPs, which will have to be set up under the bilateral agreements. So, instead of a single layer of Commonwealth environmental regulation, this bill delivers three: legislation, bilateral agreements and BAMPs. It is my understanding that miners and other groups who have an interest in development are expressing concern, just as environmentalists are, about the nature of this legislation and the sorts of problems that it will pose for them.</para><para>There is still more. The third way in which the bill devolves national Commonwealth 
 power over the environment is the myriad of mechanisms to exempt Commonwealth control even within that narrowly defined range of national matters. The bill contains at least 17 exemptions or variations from the Commonwealth's ostensibly standard, unified and efficient procedures to assess and approve an action. I will briefly mention some of these. First, governmental authorisations are excluded, so the bill explicitly excludes a decision by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth agency to grant a governmental authorisation, however defined, to another person to take an action. That is in direct contrast to the current arrangements under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act that permits assessment of actions, proposals and decisions taken by or on behalf of the Commonwealth or its agencies. That is an extremely significant exemption. One of the implications of it is that we now have a bill which does not regulate the construction of nuclear power stations in Australia.</para><para>I turn to bilateral agreements—another key exemption. The `Object' section of the bill tells us that bilateral agreements are fundamental aspects of this plan, but the proposed operation of bilateral agreements has caused acute concern for both industry and environmental groups. It is clear that these agreements could be used by the Commonwealth to completely abrogate its responsibility for so-called matters of national environmental significance. In effect, this is a complete retreat from the bill's raison d'etre—the establishment of a national environmental framework. The bill provides that a bilateral agreement may declare certain classes of action exempt from the approval processes if they are taken in accordance with one of the management plans that has been approved by the Commonwealth, state or territory or a specified agency in a specified manner. In `matters of national environmental significance', the criteria that the minister must abide by in determining the standard of satisfaction are minimal, vague and malleable, with no explicit minimum environmental standards as a condition of entering into such agreements. So these provisions constitute a 
 sham. They constitute and provide the antithesis of environment protection.</para><para>Finally, bilateral agreements can only be suspended or stopped in very limited circumstances. Suspension can only occur if the Commonwealth considers that a party to a bilateral agreement has transgressed such an agreement or a state or territory has requested suspension or cancellation. Even in that case, any actions by a private developer done in accordance with the agreement cannot be stopped. There is no provision to suspend or cancel an agreement if it has got unforeseen, negative consequences on the environment which do not amount to a contravention of the agreement.</para><para>I turn to ministerial declarations. These declarations give the minister discretion to declare that a proposed action does not require Commonwealth approval if the Commonwealth or one of its agencies has approved the action in a specified manner. The minister has got to be satisfied that the alternative processes will involve consideration of the impacts of the action, but there is no provision for specified environmental standards or public consultation. Just to give a local example of this sort of situation, earlier this year I asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services what provisions he had in place for the environmental assessment of the City Link project, given that his Deputy Prime Minister had breathlessly announced that City Link would get the infrastructure borrowings tax concessions. He has written back to me effectively saying, `We're still working on this. We're still deciding what form of environment assessment is going to apply.' This while the City Link project is very close to completion. Clearly this is an unsatisfactory state of affairs.</para><para>Given the time constraints, there are many provisions of this legislation which I do not have the time to deal adequately with, but I do want to draw the attention of the House to a legal opinion provided just yesterday by the barrister David Mossop of Blackburn Chambers. Mr Mossop deals with a number of case scenarios and the possible effects of this bill. The first is:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">1.	 Oil Shale Deposits in Queensland—Oil shale mining—Great Barrier Reef—Some in World Heritage Area some not</inline></para><para>He lists the scenario where there would be:</para><para><inline font-style="italic"></inline><inline font-style="italic">(a)	 Bilateral agreement and accredited management plan in place delegating approval powers—mining not prohibited</inline></para><para>He says:</para><para>In this case the power to both assess and approve the mine would lie with the Queensland government. So long as the Queensland government did so in accordance with the terms of the bilateral it could authorise mining both inside and outside the World Heritage area.</para><para>He goes on to say:</para><para>Once a decision was made to authorise mining the Commonwealth could not intervene without special legislation. That is because where the bilateral agreement is cancelled decisions made under it remain unaffected (cl 64).</para><para>He was also asked to comment on a scenario involving the Fitzroy River in Western Australia:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">2. Fitzroy River—broad bilateral and management plan in place with WA government—agreement and plan cover threatened species and Ramsar sites—management plan not disallowed—subsequent approval by WA government of dam on Fitzroy River that floods habitat of endangered species and affects Roebuck Bay Ramsar site.</inline></para><para>Mr Mossop says:</para><para>Once the decision by the WA government has been made the Commonwealth Minister has no power to `call it in' or require approval. Thus if the WA government had approved all stages of the project then the Commonwealth would have no power over it.</para><para>This is the case even if the Commonwealth was funding the action. That is because Commonwealth funding of an environmentally significant action does not trigger the approval requirements in cl 28 (approval of Commonwealth actions affecting the environment). That is because funding is specifically excluded (by amendments in the Senate) from the definition of an "action" . . . </para><para>The third scenario he outlines is that of Fraser Island, where he envisages:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold"></inline><inline font-weight="bold">3. Fraser Island—bilateral agreement and management plan allowing for "ecologically sustainable development" not expressly mentioning sandmining . . . change in government in Queensland—new government approves "ecologically sustainable" sand mine . . . </inline></para><para>Once again, the Commonwealth would have:</para><para>. . . no power to call in a particular decision once made by the State government. The State approval would be valid so long as it was in accordance with the bilateral agreement and management plan. Any power that the Commonwealth Minister might have to cancel the bilateral would not affect an approval already given.</para><para>He also points out:</para><para>A bilateral agreement may be for up to five years (cl 65) and hence may cover more than one State or Commonwealth parliamentary term.</para><para>So if we look at these proposals and at the practical implications of this bill, we can see this piece of legislation for what it is: an act of revenge by a Liberal Party which is still distressed by the actions of Commonwealth Labor governments—the Hawke government in the 1980s—in protecting places such as Kakadu, the Daintree rainforest and the Franklin River in Tasmania.</para><para>Labor believes that this bill is fundamentally flawed and that it should not progress pending resolution of a myriad fundamental issues. We think that the government has comprehensively failed to deliver a decent and workable piece of legislation and that it would be too time consuming in this place to return to first principles in an attempt to amend and redraft it. We do not have the numbers in this place to carry the day, but after the treachery of the Democrats in the Senate I think we owe it to Australians and to our environment to resist this law as strongly as we possibly can.</para><para>If we were to proceed to make proper amendments in this place, we would begin with the fundamental flaws in the bill's drafting and construction. After having only hours to consider the government's 440 amendments in the Senate, we were able to provide in the order of 270 amendments to the Senate. Of course, the guillotine there prevented proper consideration of those amendments, just as it is the government's intention through a guillotine here to prevent consideration of these amendments. But we need to do what the government has failed to do, and provide adequate clarity and certainty concerning the preamble, definitions, objects clauses, decision making processes, assessment processes and review processes. It 
 follows that the maintenance of a Commonwealth reserve power to protect the environment is central to the decency and acceptability of this bill.</para><para>Labor cannot accept the concept and proposed application of bilateral agreements as set out in this bill. We believe we must also provide a review mechanism with uniform and explicit review criteria for any alternative regime. So this bill should not become law unless it is substantially amended to strengthen public accountability and transparency of decision making. Furthermore, any acceptable bill must recognise the breadth and diversity of the interests of indigenous Australians in critical environment and biodiversity issues and provide mechanisms to ensure that their views are accommodated in the process. Consequently, it would maintain current management arrangements both in law and in substance for places such as Kakadu, Uluru and Wreck Bay or, alternatively, provide for regimes in accordance with the wishes of traditional owners.</para><para>Any acceptable bill will retain the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service not as, as per the Democrats' deal, just a token agency subject to direction by the minister without any requirement for that direction to be made public, but as a fair dinkum body. This bill will be further characterised by shadows rather than substance unless it clearly provides for the Auditor-General to fulfil the environmental audit functions which it prescribes.</para><para>This bill fails these basic tests. It is a bill drafted in the department of wishful thinking on behalf of a government engaged in regressive nostalgia looking back down the time tunnel. It seeks to banish those pesky conservationists to the mercies of state governments. It hopes to rid bureaucrats, governments and developers from the unreasonable constraints that international agreements crafted by cunning conspirators have visited upon them. And it is drafted in the hope that, if a national government can flick environmental issues as far away from Canberra as possible, the issues themselves will go away.</para><para>The opposite is the case. If you take away from people hard-won protections, the people 
 will return to the methods that they used to gain them. We are already living with the consequences of this loss of faith in fair and open government. We saw the weak-kneed performance of the environment minister and his colleagues in this place in failing to protect Kakadu. That didn't just bring protests in the Northern Territory; it brought people into the streets across our capital cities and led to angry confrontations at the North Ltd offices.</para><para>If the forest debate in Western Australia has taught this government anything, it should at least have realised that environment and natural heritage are in fact mainstream concerns and that they are concerns held by many that the coalition would see as part of their own constituency. You might not see these people in the streets as often or in as great numbers, but developers and governments will end up seeing more of them in the courts. Sustainable development in these circumstances becomes not even startable development as proposal after proposal is fought through the courts and out on the streets.</para><para>The protection of our environment and heritage, of biodiversity and myriad ecosystems is a first order issue in our society and around the world. Conflicts over land use and resource allocation are real and enduring. Whatever this government might think, you cannot wish them into disappearing. A government wilfully shirking these problems will create more and bigger problems. This legislation is at best a failure of the will to govern well and justly. At worst, it is a cynical attempt to divide and favour, to promote individual profit over the common long-term good. This legislation is not so much about smaller government as about smaller minds. It is ultimately destructive of the interests that it seeks to serve as well as those it seeks to thwart.</para><para>If this was ever intended to be more effective and better conceived legislation for the protection of the environment and the conservation of biodiversity, the government should withdraw it now. It should take it away and start again. It should consult better. It should draft better.</para><para>We are being guillotined. We are being treated with scant respect. The environment is being considered here as a side issue worthy of a mere two or three hours for debate, but this is simply another step along the road. The conservation movement, supported by Labor, has come a long way and has no intention of going back.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>7781</page.no><name role="metadata">Billson, Bruce, MP</name><name role="display">Mr BILLSON</name><name.id>1K6</name.id><electorate>Dunkley</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tuesday, 29 June 1999 is a great day for our nation.

So, even on that subject, the ALP is out of step with what any thinking person is on about with regard to the environment.</para><para>What is so special about this package is that it creates balance and bite in the Commonwealth's role in environmental issues. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage very eloquently outlined how we have worked with a range of interest groups to come up with a package that provides improved certainty for all participants, but also provides a new range of tools to ensure that Commonwealth environmental issues are properly managed and properly addressed by this parliament and subsequent parliaments. But this was not something that happened overnight, as the member for Wills seeks to suggest.</para><para>The bills before this House actually implement a COAG agreement from 1997 on the need for clarity and improved tools. It was borne out of a landmark 1996 speech by our nation's best environment minister ever—the quiet achiever, Senator Robert Hill. He outlined the task that was before us. That there was a need for something to be done was supported by everybody, it would appear, except the ALP, and then we set about the task.</para><para>The bills before the House this evening repeal the existing indirect and inefficient triggers for Commonwealth involvement in environmental issues. If you listen to the member for Wills talk, he likes the way it is now because you do not know what you get. He likes the mystery of the environment legislation in this country at the present time. There is a reason for that and, through his examples, he illustrated the motives of the ALP here. They would much rather have a political blue, a stoush, over an environment issue than have some solid policy on protecting the environment and the biodiversity of this country. They would rather have an argument over an endangered species than put in place the strategies and the plans to take that species off the endangered list. Some people opposite probably think an outcome in regard to an endangered species is to have it listed as an endangered species. In the circles I move in, the goal is to take the danger away. The goal is to see a species or an ecological community taken off the list, because then the danger is not there. Surely that is the goal. That needs a plan. That needs action and cooperation. That is what this bill is about, but members opposite could not get past the political blue. They would rather see a protest than solid progress on policy.</para><para>This package puts balance and bite into the Commonwealth's role in environmental issues. This bill repeals the inefficient triggers that are there now and replaces those indirect triggers with six quite specific areas of national environmental significance. It puts it squarely at the feet of the Commonwealth government to do what it needs to do to make sure those Commonwealth environmental issues are properly addressed. It is the first 
 major overhaul of environmental laws for a generation, and part of it is to make sure that there is accountability and responsibility for environmental issues in this country, given that we are a federation.</para><para>What was also interesting about the member for Wills's contribution was his paying out on his ALP colleagues in the ALP state governments of Tasmania, Queensland and New South Wales. Obviously, I am not as familiar as he is with the environmental records of these ALP state governments, but I had never appreciated quite how evil they were until the member for Wills talked about how you cannot trust state governments with environmental responsibilities. Maybe that is an interesting area for us to research, but the point here is that we are clarifying where those responsibilities lie so that action follows and something occurs. We think that is a step forward, because there is clarity there. There is no buck-passing. There is no forum shopping, hoping that someone else will carry out the responsibilities of the states and territories. It is clear where the buck stops.</para><para>It was even more fascinating that the member for Wills was talking about the limited influence the Commonwealth has on the areas that the states are responsible for and then proceeded to talk about areas where the Commonwealth has an interest, as if we just pack up and go home. Where has he been? This package of bills makes it very clear how seriously this coalition government takes Commonwealth environment responsibilities. As part of that balance and bite mix of this package of bills, under bilateral agreements we can endorse state processes that properly have regard to the issues for which the Commonwealth is responsible. Under his scenarios, you would think we had just gone home and it was just, `Let her rip.' It is interesting that some of the concerns that the states have had about this package are that maybe there is too much federal influence in it. Isn't it fascinating that we have the ALP federal representative bagging the ALP state governments in Tasmania, Queensland and New South Wales as if they are entirely incompetent with respect to their environmental credentials and their policy perform 
 ance, then going further saying, `But hang on, maybe the Commonwealth is not going to pay any attention to that,' and then, in the next breath, saying, `We are going to be so heavy-handed about it.' You cannot have it all ways.</para><para>The dilemma that faced the member for Wills was that this highlighted that he did not have anything to say about the package itself. He talked about a number of bureaucratic and administrative issues no doubt borne out of the documents circulated by the Wilderness Society, Greenpeace and the Australian Conservation Foundation. I lament Don Henry's appointment. I had such hope when Don Henry was appointed that the ACF might be a conservation organisation back in the real world, but never mind.</para><para>The member for Wills has just run through the list, ignoring the entire point and purpose and the changes that have been reflected in this package to make sure that the environment is the big winner. But it is not the only winner. It is also those wishing to invest in the country, those people who want to put their hard-earned resources forward to risk something that they own in trying to do something in an economic way for this country. One of the great disincentives that exists under the current legislation is that they can shop around all over the place trying to find someone to talk to and may even have an entirely unrelated federal issue—whether it be a foreign investment approval, a decision to provide some Commonwealth funding, some licensing issues or the like or an export approval—and all of a sudden the feds are back. Most investors I have met, almost without exception, want to do the right thing. They are a species in this continent as well. They want to do the right thing, but they would like to know what the right thing is, and they would like to know who to talk to. This package gives that certainty to investors in industries. So we have gone from this no-win situation under the current legislation that it seems only the member for Wills seeks to defend through to this win-win situation right across the board.</para><para>The member for Wills talked about some of the world heritage issues. Where has he been? One of the great problems with the world 
 heritage legislation as it stands is that it is a last resort recourse. You have this absurd situation where the federal government can only proscribe things that cannot happen. The best minds in the country see something going on that has a world heritage implication. We cannot do anything to guide the people in the right direction. All we can do is sit down and dream up every conceivable action or step someone might take that we are not happy with rather than get on the front foot and have a conditional approval put forward—this is the way to go for the future.</para><para>I would like to close by complimenting the government for tackling an issue that was unresolved for 25 years. Everybody knows there was a need for reform; it took a coalition government to grasp this very difficult issue, given that former governments found it all too hard to come to grips with. Focusing its efforts on those matters for which there is a national environment significance, the triggers make it clear where the federal government becomes involved. It is about precautionary principles being put on the table up-front so that the actions that follow are protecting the environment. That surely has to be a good thing for this country. The cognate bills before this House will provide significant benefits to business, industry, the government—all governments—and the broader community by allowing for a simplified, efficient and transparent framework of environmental approvals. I commend the bills to the House and may take an opportunity on another occasion to talk more about them.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>7783</page.no><name role="metadata">Wilton, Greg, MP</name><name role="display">Mr WILTON</name><name.id>YK6</name.id><electorate>Isaacs</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—If ever there was an example of the fact that this government treat the environment as a side issue, as an issue which is simply worth no more than guillotining, as an issue to which they devote some 2½ hours of scant debate, we have heard it from the member for Dunkley this evening. Contrary to his exhortations, this is not by any means a historic day for Australia. The majority of people who voted against the GST have had foisted upon them today a regressive and an unfair tax. Simultaneously, we have had it put to us in no uncertain terms that, as I say, this govern 
 ment regards the environment as nothing more than a side issue.</para></talk.start><para>Again, the member for Dunkley was wrong in suggesting that environment groups by and large are opposed to the ALP's stance on this issue. In fact, no Australian based environment group that I know of—certainly not the ACF of which I am proudly a member—supports this legislation. It is simply wrong to say as he said that the ALP is out of step. We are working with the ACF and others to oppose this legislation which has attracted such universal opposition and exposes the government's lack of commitment and foresight on environment policy.</para><para>In a nutshell, this legislation exposes and highlights the errors that can be made when political philosophy—in this case, that geared towards the issue of states' rights—takes precedence over good government. It is not a matter of simply not trusting the states, as the member for Dunkley would have us believe; it is a matter of this government standing up and accepting responsibility for a portfolio requiring a national degree of coordination, and that portfolio is of course the environment.</para><para>However, in this case, unfortunately the issues cannot be reversed or resolved by a change of government. The damage to the environment and concomitant loss of species which live in it cannot be replaced, fixed up or patched up simply by policy shifts as a result of changes at election time. Indeed, the findings of the National Biodiversity Council say:</para><para>Biodiversity conservation is too important to be allowed to be exposed to political vicissitudes.</para><para>Australia is in fact one of the earth's 12 so-called mega-diverse nations. Most of its native plants are endemic due to the fact that Australia is an island continent and its biota has evolved very much in isolation. However, Australia has experienced the extinction of more of its mammal species than any other nation. There are in fact signs that many of Australia's bird species will decline towards extinction by the middle of the 21st century. There have already been phenomenal losses in biodiversity as regional populations of 
 native plants and animals have been replaced by crops in cities and introduced species.</para><para>I was recently informed, for example, by a constituent that the Northern Pacific sea star—a marine pest which has unfortunately no national enemies in Australia and feeds somewhat voraciously on sea sponge and other sea floor inhabitants which are important to the health of waterways—has been found in Port Phillip Bay and the Patterson River in my electorate of Isaacs. As many would know, this introduced species of sea star found itself in the Derwent River several years ago after having been discharged from the ballast of visiting ships. It is very distressing that a pervasive virus like foreign marine animals can find their way into not only our local waterways but also a tributary and a major river in my own electorate.</para><para>The devastating environmental and commercial fishing impact of the sea star, which experts say is, by and large, impossible to eliminate, is not only cause for alarm but also a clear demonstration that biodiversity and other related environmental issues do not recognise state boundaries or national boundaries. Successful management of it requires a large scale, coordinated national approach, not the adhocery of a state arrangement of the kind that the member for Dunkley would foist upon us.</para><para>Obviously this government does not believe in any sort of wholesale commitment to the environment enough to implement a national policy which facilitates across the board the overseeing of environmental issues, regardless of the state of their origin or their geographical breadth of impact. Instead, this government essentially wants to deal itself well and truly out of environmental responsibility altogether and duckshove that responsibility very much onto the states. I quote Senator Hill on this. When the government first came to power, he said:</para><para>I want to get the Commonwealth out of direct involvement in issues that are really of only state or local significance.</para><para>This is an extremely narrow-minded approach by the environment minister. It demonstrates his lack of capacity for any understanding or desire to implement policy which oversees on 
 a coordinated basis the implementation of a national environment strategy for our country.</para><para>It is somewhat perplexing and indeed ironic that our so-called federal environment minister should endeavour to divest responsibility for any environmental issues, regardless of their origin, to the states without any form of overriding safeguard or an overall policy framework. By confining federal involvement to a stock of matters deemed to be what he has termed of national environmental significance, the minister has thrust the care of the environment and its biodiversity into the hands of the states which are far more development oriented and, as we know, in Victoria especially, much less inclined to provide rigorous impact statements. The Victorian coalition tory government is particularly on the nose regarding its poor record on the issue of environmental responsibility. Indeed, there are some recent cases which bear citing to support this argument.</para><para>For example, plans a few years ago to develop Mount Stirling in Victoria into a downhill resort were shelved at the last minute by virtue of public agitation for an environmental assessment that recommended against any such development proceeding for a moratorium period of about 15 years. Similarly, plans to turn our much beloved Wilsons Promontory National Park into a so-called hikers resort, resplendent with hotel style luxury accommodation at the expense of the natural wild beauty of the park—which draws so many visitors to the area from all parts of our nation—were temporarily averted, again as a result of community outcry. This is the sort of community outcry this government is fostering by virtue of trying to withdraw people's right to protest in such matters. Similarly, the state government's support for a toxic dump in Werribee, despite the articulated long-term risks to both the community and the environment, was fortunately not enough incentive for CSR to press on with the project. Again, there was well-organised public protest by the constituents of Lalor and many others.</para><para>Finally, in my own electorate of Isaacs, which once again seems to be flavour of the month in Victoria for the dumping of toxic 
 waste, the state government has turned a blind eye to the dumping of acid sulfate soil on private land by the contractors who have constructed the new City Link freeway project. It has also remained mute on the proposal for an increase in the prescribed waste accepted by the Lyndhurst landfill which is, indeed, very much ill-equipped to handle such increases—aside from the fact that the nearest residential area is a scant 200 metres distant and most of the waste is, by and large, trucked in from the north-western suburbs of Melbourne, an area far removed from Lyndhurst, which is in the south-east. I have written to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage requesting the initiation of discussions with him to try to devise a national strategy for both the transport and disposal of toxic waste. But, obviously, in light of his above comments and again the narrow focus detailed in this legislation, I am not hopeful of there being much in the way of discussions arising from my request.</para><para>My genuine concerns for an increased role for the states are, once again, further compounded by the Kennett government's emasculation of the EPA and that agency's deference to government input on issues that should be closely scrutinised rather than simply glossed over. Unfortunately, I am by no means the only one excluded from any input on environmental policy decisions; more qualified people than I have been excluded from debate, and I refer in particular to indigenous groups. Their knowledge of and intimate relationship with their land is, as members on both sides of this place would know, vital to its sustainable development and the protection and fostering of its all important biodiversity. This legislation totally ignores indigenous expertise and their intimate relationship with their land. This move unfortunately totally ignores the recommendations of the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development, which stated:</para><para>Governments should in full partnership with indigenous people and their communities recognise indigenous people's values, traditional knowledge and resource management practices with a view to promoting environmentally sound and sustainable development.   
</para><para>Again I quote from the Rio declaration which said that indigenous peoples do `have a vital role in environmental management and states should recognise this'. This legislation, to its discredit, contains absolutely no provision whatsoever for any form of consultation with indigenous stakeholders. It similarly ignores native title and cultural heritage protection laws. Furthermore, it does not provide an effective framework for negotiation of indigenous land use agreements. Instead, this  legislation affords the minister an unfettered discretionary power—a minister who has voiced a lack of interest, exhibited a dearth of interest, to my mind—in environmental issues unless they fall into the realm of those narrow descriptors applied to what he terms `matters of national significance'.</para><para>Shamefully, this legislation returns Australia's environmental laws to pre-1970 status where the states were solely responsible for environmental matters. You will recall that in those times people took issues into their own hands and there was a range of protests on the streets, from the green bans to whatever it might be, to protect the environment. I fear this legislation will force people again to take action on their own part and protest in a similar way that brought them out onto the streets in the 1960s. One wonders whether the minister may be well and truly tired of political life and wishes to divest himself of this messy business of looking after the environment and ensuring that our grandchildren have a healthy world in which to live.</para><para>Seemingly, this government has no conscience, no conscience at all, when it comes to environmental issues. Opposition parties were indeed given insufficient time to debate the bill in detail in the Senate, and this is indicative, as I said at the outset of my submission in this place tonight, of the government's absolutely blase approach to  environmental policy. As the member for Wills said in his address, we have only some scant two hours or a little more of debate and then the guillotine. The member for Dunkley, who purported to be so concerned about the environment, made only a 10-minute presentation this evening.</para><para>The Prime Minister has earlier today, and indeed in times past, referred to this legislation as `good for the environment and good for jobs'—a bit of a glib throwaway line, I might suggest. I think he probably had his fingers well and truly crossed behind his back when he said that, because it is indeed a pretty rugged call when the government is, as I say, shifting responsibility on to the states. There is no doubt that, without the protection of our environmental heritage and the cooperation of all stakeholders—be they indigenous or environmental groups or government or citizens in general—to preserve our unique biota, employment for future generations will be nothing more than a very much moot point.</para><para>There are a couple of points that the member for Wills raised which I think do bear repeating. The first of those is simply that people have, by and large, lost faith in what was formerly recognised as being fair and open government. This government, for example, did indeed fail to protect Kakadu. Similarly, it obviously learnt nothing from the recent RFA based forest debate in Western Australia, where logging of old growth kauri forests still continues. It certainly has not learnt that, out there in the community, the environment is of mainstream concern to people. This legislation does seek to duckshove the green movement, for example—a movement with legitimate and abiding interests in the protection of our environment—onto state governments. This government does not want to deal with the green movement. This government wants to divest itself of responsibility for that and have the green movement dealt with—those tacky protesters often seen chained to trees, one of which I might become one day, in the event that I am turfed out of here.</para><para>There is no doubt that this legislation is designed to push environmental matters as far away from Canberra as the government could reasonably push them, in the hope that they will simply go away. There is no doubt again that the same issues will—as I have just alluded to the 1960s—come back to haunt this government. As the member for Wills again said, the more meagre the resources in 
 the hands of the environmentalists, the more fervently they will use those resources and the more steadfastly they will protest and maintain their legitimate protest. Similarly, the member said that the more you weaken the redress available through proper processes, the more people will, understandably and justifiably, seek redress through what the Tories opposite see as nothing other than improper processes.</para><para>I conclude simply by saying that when you remove and totally withdraw, as this government is trying to do, these hard-won protections, people will revert to the same methods that were originally used to win them—whether that be protest in the street or protest in the forest groups around our forested areas, whatever. They will revert to those methods, which again will be distasteful for this government.</para><para>As I said at the very outset, this legislation does highlight the areas that can be made when political philosophy—in this case the issue pertaining primarily to states' rights—takes precedence over good government and the development of sound government policy through a proper consultative process, both with the opposition and with all interested parties. This legislation does little more than set out to destroy those same interests that the member for Dunkley would have us believe it seeks to serve.</para><para>This, by and large, is inappropriate legislation for the times and I join with the member for Wills, and I am sure the member for Lalor and those who will follow me, in urging the government to reconsider, to withdraw this legislation, to start again and to provide a framework for our environment which retains responsibility for its oversight within the federal arena so that environmental issues of national and indeed international significance can be dealt with where they should be dealt with—right here in the forum of the Australian parliament.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>7787</page.no><name role="metadata">Washer, Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Dr WASHER</name><name.id>84F</name.id><electorate>Moore</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 represents a gigantic step forward for Australia by enshrining in legislation on a federal level safeguards to preserve and maintain our unique but fragile 
 environment. It encompasses many areas, but I want to specifically touch on a couple of these, as I am sure the bill's content will be further dissected by other members of the House tonight.</para></talk.start><para>This bill helps to fulfil our domestic responsibilities in relation to the conventions and treaties we have signed as a nation over the years, including the Ramsar convention on wetlands of environmental significance and world heritage properties. Australia has 11 world heritage properties, covering more than 42 million hectares, and Australian sites are among the very few on the World Heritage List that meet all four criteria for natural heritage, with some also meeting the cultural criteria—Uluru probably being the most globally recognised in this rare group.</para><para>This legislation will complement the Natural Heritage Trust, which is Australia's first genuine attempt at an environmental rescue package. This bill will help to balance environmental protection with tourism, industry and the general community well into the next century. It is worth noting that funds from the Natural Heritage Trust have made a substantial contribution to Western Australia's single most dangerous environmental problem—salinity—through the state government's $100 million Salinity Action Plan. By simplifying the approval process for environmental assessment, the environmental protection and biodiversity conservation legislation eliminates the need to rely on indirect and ad hoc triggers. These ad hoc measures mean that currently two projects can raise identical environmental issues, with only one triggering Commonwealth involvement in environmental impact assessments.</para><para>Importantly, this bill also eliminates the duplicity for business and industry when they are trying to deal with environmental approvals at both a state and federal level. It sets time frames for industry, and this will reduce delays as well as bring more certainty to the process. We cannot have effective legislation without certainty, and we cannot make a genuine attempt at environmental protection without clear guidelines that industry will accept and support.</para><para>This bill implements the COAG agreement on the Commonwealth and state roles and responsibilities that was endorsed by all states and territories in 1997 and was open for public comment late last year. It recognised the role of the states and territories as being at the forefront of environmental management rather than the Commonwealth.</para><para>The marine environment around our nation is also protected under this legislation, a feature particularly welcomed in my electorate, which has the Indian Ocean at its longest border. The Whale Protection Act has been incorporated into the bill, and the Australian Whale Sanctuary will be created as a result of this legislation. This title pertains to the highest level of protection that is afforded whales in oceans that come under Australia's jurisdiction.</para><para>This helps species such as the humpback whale, which is more prominent in my state of Western Australia than anywhere else in this country. When the humpback became protected from whaling in 1963, the species was almost extinct. Now they number between 2,000 and 3,000 off the west coast and have spurned a rapidly growing tourism industry with whale watching. The Right whale, which was also hunted to the verge of extinction, can now be seen in increasing numbers in Perth metropolitan waters.</para><para>Another aspect of this bill deserving a mention is the provision for conservation agreements which can be used to promote biodiversity on private land. Maintaining biodiversity in this country, and indeed on a global scale, is without a doubt the most important environmental challenge we face in the next century. The <inline font-style="italic">State of the Environment Report</inline> in 1996, issued by the Environmental Advisory Council, identified biodiversity loss as perhaps the most serious environmental problem in Australia today. It said species in all major groups of plants and animals are at risk.</para><para>As someone who is keenly interested in the prosperity of biotechnology, maintaining our diverse gene pool and our plants is vital if we are to be forerunners in this new revolution. Being able to draw from the pool of wild genes to develop new and better strains of 
 crops which are drought or pest resistant will be vital. Genes from a species of wild grass taken from South-East Asia were used to save sugarcane crops from a virulent disease in the 1920s. The genes from this wild grass gave the sugarcane crops a resistance to this mystery disease and even helped to increase the amount of sugar from the crops. You cannot reproduce that kind of strength in a laboratory.</para><para>Despite what some callers to talkback radio or some sections of the media believe, everything we put in our mouths has had the benefit of genetic modification, thanks to being able to hand pick the best of the genes in our plants and animals. It is an absurd statement for people to say, `I don't want to eat genetically modified food.' If they stuck to this creed, they would not be able to eat anything. So, by maintaining our biodiversity, we ensure that nature's supermarket gives us the genetic variety to choose from and continually improves crops such as sugarcane.</para><para>This bill also provides for the listing of a threatened species and the making and implementing of recovery and threat abatement plans. This measure takes over from the Endangered Species Protection Act, which has been incorporated into this bill. As an aside, another welcome development has been the establishment of a community based program known as the Threatened Species Network. Funded by the Natural Heritage Trust and the World Wide Fund for Nature, this network offers grants to community groups who need funds to take on the long-term responsibility for the recovery of threatened species in their region. These grants offer a fantastic way for community groups to demonstrate a hands-on commitment to conserving their local environment while at the same time fostering partnerships between government agencies, schools and community members that will help make sustainable biodiversity the ultimate beneficiary.</para><para>Australia's environmental diversity is remarkable, and its island status ensures that it is unlike anywhere else in the world. There has been enormous damage done to this diversity in the 200 years since European settlement, and too many native species are 
 now extinct. In fact, we have probably lost more in the past two centuries than in the last 65 million years. This bill is just one part of a new environmental management plan for Australia that this government has taken in the past few years that provides real solutions. Australians care about their unique environment and have welcomed such initiatives. I commend this bill to the House.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>7789</page.no><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GILLARD</name><name.id>83L</name.id><electorate>Lalor</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is indeed appropriate that this cognate debate on these environmental bills should come before the House on the same day as the GST tax package.

Indeed, a great deal of its consideration of this legislation has been done in secret in a deal with the Democrats, who refused to invite the Australian Conservation Foundation—one of this nation's premier conservation bodies—to participate in the drafting process of that legislation. As a result, this legislation is so poor that we need 248 amendments. The Australian Democrats—those fairies at the bottom of the garden turned chainsaw wielding hobgoblins—failed to consult with the Australian Conservation Foundation and the other relevant environment bodies in the drafting of this bill and, as a result, it is fundamentally flawed.</para><para>It was not just the Australian Conservation Foundation with whom they failed to consult. We have in our possession a letter from a number of senior environmental experts: Professor Rob Fowler from the Australian Centre for Environmental Law; Professor Neil Gunningham also from the Australian Centre for Environmental Law; Associate Professor Donna Craig from the Law Division of the University of Sydney; David Hayes, Senior Lecturer in Law at James Cook University; Professor for Environmental Law from the Australian Centre for Environmental Law, Ben Boare; and Jan Macdonald, Associate Professor of Law at Bond University, together with Brian Hayes QC.

This legislation represents the Howard coalition government's commitment to the better protection of Australia's unique environment and splendid biodiversity through proper management standards and transparent assessment processes. In historical terms, the earliest significant environmental legislation by the Commonwealth government was the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, which was enacted by the Whitlam government and represented a nascent stirring of awareness of the fragility and value of the natural environment of Australia.</para></talk.start><para> This legislation represents extensive consultation between the Commonwealth, the states, industry representatives, community groups and indigenous communities. It also reflects the government's determined and comprehensive effort to define environment responsibilities at Commonwealth level. This enactment is the most fundamental reform of Commonwealth environmental statutes for nearly 25 years. This is comprehensive reform because it also reflects a maturity in Commonwealth-state relations whereby areas of respective responsibility in environment assessment processes are defined. This bill will also provide for the first time an important national leverage to ensure the highest standards of environmental accreditation processes across the country.</para><para>Since the coalition government was elected in 1996, the federal government has enjoyed a sound cooperative working relationship with state governments. Both federal and state governments have sought to identify better means of delivering efficient and effective environmental management for Australia as a whole, which will effectively balance the needs of the environment with the needs of industry.</para><para> In 1997, the Council of Australian Governments reached an agreement by which the Commonwealth's role in environmental management would be defined by matters of national environmental significance. COAG also agreed that part of the reform process should include an innovative relationship between state and Commonwealth laws through an effective mechanism of accreditation by the Commonwealth of state assessment and approval processes. This bill puts the COAG agreement into effect.</para><para> The Commonwealth's role is confined to those areas identified as being of national environmental significance. These areas are the Commonwealth marine area, world heritage properties, Ramsar wetlands of international importance, nationally threatened species and ecological communities, internationally protected migratory species, and nuclear actions by the Commonwealth or Commonwealth agencies. As a major part of the reform process, this legislation will also replace five existing statutes on environment and conservation. These are the Environment Protection (Impact of proposals) Act 1974, the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992, the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975, the Whale Protection Act 1980 and the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983. These new bills reflect the changing attitudes and rapid advances in environmental and biodiversity management which aim to employ world's best practice in line with contemporary community expectations.</para><para>One of the main aims of the legislation is to promote ecologically sustainable development and to conserve our precious biodiversity. The structure of the main bill will allow the Commonwealth to respond to emerging environment concerns and environ 
 mental planning and assessment practice. An important aspect of the challenge of this reform bill is to balance the needs of industry and development with the needs of the conservation of the environment. This reform bill seeks to establish that balance.</para><para> Benefits for Australian industry will include statutory time frames in which decisions must be made. This in turn will also provide a considerable measure of certainty to proponents, which has not always been available under the existing act. The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill relies on direct, specifically defined environmental criteria.</para><para>The proponents of a development will know from the outset whether or not a project or an activity will trigger Commonwealth involvement. Should the proponent be in any doubt as to whether this legislation is applicable, they may apply to the minister and the minister must make a binding decision within 20 days on whether or not the legislation is triggered. It is important for industry to note that, once the minister has given this decision, the proponent may rely on this decision with certainty. There are strict limitations on the possibility for this decision to be reconsidered, thus minimising the opportunity for any late intervention by the Commonwealth. This is an important aspect of this bill which ensures greater certainty and efficiency for industry. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>7814</page.no><name role="metadata">Gillard, Julia, MP</name><name role="display">Ms GILLARD</name><name.id>83L</name.id><electorate>Lalor</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We have just heard another coalition speaker in this debate tell us what a landmark piece of legislation this is. If it is such a landmark piece of legislation, why the completely shameful haste in getting it through the Senate before 30 June and then returning it to this House and gagging the debate so quickly? Why wouldn't you put the bill out for consultation with the environment groups in its radically amended form and get some feedback? I will tell you what the answer to that is: despite all the claims of `landmark', everybody participating in this debate knows this is about rolling back Commonwealth responsibility and rolling back environmental standards. If you put it out there in the com 
 munity, if you give it to the environment groups, that is what they are going to tell you.</para></talk.start><para> It is a very sensitive issue in my electorate, because we have Ramsar wetlands, we have the petrochemical industry making some of the most noxious and dangerous substances on earth—that is, if they are not properly dealt with—and we had the Kennett government proposal for a toxic dump in Werribee. 15,000 members of my electorate went out on a winter night—which was as cold as it can be in Canberra—to the Werribee racecourse to protest against that decision. Because I think it is very important to the final position that the Democrats have taken in this debate, let me take you to what the Democrats said to the 15,000 people who were at the Werribee racecourse protesting about the Werribee toxic dump when they were looking for votes in the run-up to the last federal election.</para><para>Did the Democrats come out to Werribee and say during that campaign, `Once we are in parliament, we will do a dirty deal with the coalition to ensure that the Commonwealth government washes its hands of protecting Ramsar wetlands and hands the whole thing—the whole issue it cannot be bothered with—back to the states'? No, they did not come out to Werribee and say that; in fact, the Democrats came out to Werribee and said quite the opposite. Democrat Senator Lyn Allison said:</para><para>The Howard government needs to get moving with the states on establishing national, enforceable guidelines for storing toxic waste.</para><para>Not content with that, she went on to give the following Democrat commitment to the people of my electorates: residents should have the right of veto against projects like the toxic dump via a residential ballot and activated by a petition of 1,000 or more. That was the commitment she made to the electors in Lalor. One notes that the Democrats are very big on petitions: big on having rules about them, but not so good on acting on them when they get them—otherwise they would be in the middle of a leadership ballot. They are pretty big on making promises to constituents when they are in the run-up to a federal election. They came out to Werribee in the electorate of Lalor and said to people who had been campaigning for two years, 
 `This is what we will do if we are returned to the federal parliament.'</para><para>They also promised to introduce a bill in the Senate to stop the Werribee toxic dump. Fortunately, no-one had to rely on the Democrats to deliver. If we had had to rely on the Democrats to deliver, we would see the Werribee toxic dump already in the construction stage. Instead of relying on the Democrats to deliver, the people of Werribee kept campaigning. Ultimately it was not a political party—not the Liberal Party, the National Party or the Democrats—that came to their rescue. Because the people of Werribee campaigned so hard, ultimately CSR, the project developer that wanted to make money out of putting toxic waste in Werribee, decided that it had had enough and that it would not proceed with the project.</para><para>It is important to recognise that, despite those commitments from the Democrats, in this legislation they have enabled the states and the Commonwealth to now go through a process where, through a bilateral agreement, in future the Commonwealth could say to Victoria—and states with track records of environmental vandalism like Victoria—`Here, you have the responsibility for the Ramsar wetlands. Here, you have the responsibility for the environmental impacts of a toxic dump,' and just let it happen. Despite all their brave rhetoric that is where the Democrats have led us to by entering into this agreement with the government—an agreement that they did not need to enter into and did not need to deal with in this time frame. They could have had the decency to come back to the people that they had made grandiose promises to and work them through the issues, if they thought this was the right course. Instead, here we have legislation gagged and the Democrats not abiding by their word. I am sure they will be harshly judged by my electors when it comes to the next election. We know one thing in Werribee—that the coalition does not care about the environment. After all, they are the party that wanted to put a toxic dump on top of us.

We have already heard about the relationship with COAG. This legislation revision was foreshadowed in 1996, when the environmental election policy statement, `Saving our natural heritage', and the `Investing in our natural heritage' budget statement quite clearly identified the need for major legislative reform of environmental law. We also have had public consultation, which went on for some time. The Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Hill, released a public consultation paper on 23 February 1998 for one month of public consultation. That picked up on the COAG review. Some of you might dismiss the COAG review, but it is a most significant body comprising all states and territories, the Commonwealth and local government together deciding on what is best for the nation.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is amazing that you tend to denigrate the states' involvement in the future sharing of environmental consideration and enactment of proper due process and laws in this country. Since we are about to celebrate 100 years of Federation, it is a little sad that you still seem to think that you do not need to work in cooperation on issues like biodiversity protection. The realities are that you need to work not only with the states but with local government, with stakeholders and with non-government organisations. This Commonwealth government understands only too well that the complexity of the issues that now face us—with our environmental degradation, loss of biodiversity, inappropriate vegetation management and, in some cases, inappropriate introduction of animals which have disturbed our biodiversity—requires, on every front, cooperation between the states and Commonwealth. The member for Dunkley made the point that it is not just coalition governments in the 
 states. There are also some three Labor held states in this period of our federation and we are working just as closely with them. It is to denigrate your own side of politics to say that the states cannot be trusted, and it is not right to deride what they consider a most significant set of amendments to legislation, legislation which has been crying out to be improved for a very long time.</para><para>Let me say, too, and I will address it later on, that this legislation has been developed in consultation with the indigenous leadership of this country and they, too, are welcoming it as a major landmark—a step forward to understanding how we must address 200 years of, in many cases, inappropriate actions that have left our natural resources depleted and degraded.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>7817</page.no><name role="metadata">Andren, Peter, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDREN</name><name.id>KL6</name.id><electorate>Calare</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I hope that, in summing up, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage was not regarding my contribution as insignificant, but I doubt that she was. I want to make some general comments on the thrust of the environment bills, concerned as I am for our national environmental program post-Telstra, funded, as much of it is, from the Natural Heritage Trust. I also find it appalling that this so-called landmark legislation is again being rammed through the House—another example of executive contempt for representative democracy.</para></talk.start><para>I remember so well speaking in the House on the bill providing for the sale of the first third of Telstra and pointing out how the Murray-Darling 2001 Program was in fact a 2101 project, so vast are the environmental problems we are confronted with. The former member for Barker, once the shadow minister for the environment, backed up my assessment immediately after that speech. We have heard again in recent days how desperate is the salination problem, particularly in Western Australia, and notably throughout the western parts of New South Wales. In his second reading speech, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage said the Howard government is dealing with issues such as land degradation and the retention of remnant bushland through the Natural Heritage Trust. As I said in the Telstra speech, once we have 
 sold the silverware we can only make the money go so far, and the land degradation problems we face will not be solved by the Natural Heritage Trust. So much for environmental restoration. How about environment protection?</para><para>These bills, based on a COAG agreement, seek to ensure the seamless integration of Commonwealth and state laws through what the minister calls a `transparent mechanism for Commonwealth accreditation of state processes'. It is efficient to combine five acts into one. It is efficient to remove the uncertainty surrounding Commonwealth involvement in environmental matters. It appears efficient to provide accreditation of state processes and agreed management plans, assuming these are uniform across all the states. It is important to clarify those areas of pre-eminent national importance such as the Commonwealth marine area. Having worked on the committee of this parliament looking into Australia's fisheries, I must say it is one area requiring constant supervision and research. Similarly, I trust the approval process for actions having an impact on notionally threatened or internationally protected migratory species will include places like the Macquarie Marshes in New South Wales, which are subjected to ongoing and growing pressures from a variety of water users, including wildlife.</para><para>I have grave doubts about the ability of state governments and local governments to act in the best national environmental interests, and hence my nervousness about certain aspects of these bills. Queensland, for instance, is accommodating 80 per cent of our land clearance at the moment, and we are tipped to increase by 25 per cent our carbon emissions, not the eight per cent we negotiated at Kyoto. The political pressure on state governments to approve developments, whether on the coast or inland, whether tourism or mining, can and do cloud environmental judgments. Fraser Island, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, the Franklin Dam, Lake Pedder, water management, land clearing and forestry management—all these areas leave one wondering if the states are ready for any new responsibilities. All too often those 
 questioning a development do not have the resources to challenge the contentions of environmental consultants hired to prepare impact studies. There needs to be an independent national environmental impact assessment for projects meeting certain impact criteria. I wonder how we determine, as these bills proscribe, `an activity which does not have a significant impact on one of the matters of national significance'? A mine or a quarry on the headwaters of any stream in the Murray-Darling has the potential to cause an impact of national significance.</para><para> On balance, I must accept the work that has gone into these environment bills and the assurances from many sides involved that they will work, or at least work better than the disparate processes we have in place now. But I have no other means of judging, except those comments. I have not had time to study these bills. I have not had time to look at the amendments. The bills have been steamrollered through in the same disgraceful fashion as the so-called Democrats set that rolling gag in motion in the Senate. So much for the term `Democrats' applied to that particular group. I have had insufficient time to get the feedback or study I would like. I would like to support elements of this legislation, but I am ill-prepared to assess these bills in the allotted time. I will therefore be abstaining from recording a vote because I have certainly not had the time to look at the bills in the detail that my constituents demand.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>7818</page.no><name role="metadata">Vale, Danna, MP</name><name role="display">Mrs VALE</name><name.id>VK6</name.id><electorate>Hughes</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Under the current environment legislation, once the Commonwealth government is involved in the assessment process it assesses all the environmental issues involved in the project, including those issues which are really the responsibility and the province of state governments.

 in this country. I am concerned that we have people in this chamber who actually believe that there has been adequate consultation. I might say that I have had representations from indigenous peoples in the Northern Territory, which is the seat I represent, who have been outspoken about the lack of consultation, lack of involvement and lack of notice taken of them by this government.

All members would be aware that the 24 per cent of Australians who do not live in urban Australia have been experiencing very real difficulties in recent years. Terms of trade have moved against us very considerably as a number of global factors have come into play, one of which is that population growth has plateaued earlier than people might have expected. Another is that, to an extent that could not have been foreseen in times gone by, we have enormously enhanced our capacity to produce food and fibre. This means that, in a situation where once the world lined up to buy almost anything that we could produce in bulk in this country—food, fibre, the lot—we now find that global markets are highly competitive. Argentina, for example, now every year seeks to place a very considerable amount of wheat on global markets. We never would have anticipated that. India not only is self-sufficient in grains but has a surplus to export. These sorts of factors have led to a situation of very significant deterioration in the terms of trade of the Australian agriculture sector and the attendant rural communities.</para><para>A similar pattern has been emerging in relation to commodities—iron ore, coal and the other extractive industries. These factors have led to a situation where we need to do everything we can in this country to contain those areas that have been damaging our terms of trade—where we have some say over them. Mr Speaker, as you will be well aware, the terms of trade are a function of domestic input costs as well as prices received mainly on export markets for a country like ours where the vast bulk of what we produce is exported. Therefore, it makes a great deal of sense to do everything that you can to reduce transport costs. I believe that, for some years in this country, transport costs have been very seriously inflated. They have been very 
 unwisely inflated, in the broader national interest, by the taxes and charges on transport. It is never a sound principle to tax productive inputs where you can avoid it, but the level of taxation inputs in this country—</para><para>Consideration interrupted; adjournment proposed and negatived.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Anderson, John, MP</name><name role="display">Mr ANDERSON</name></talker><para>—I think it is very important indeed that we do what we can to remove the impost of taxes on production in this country. Broadly speaking of course, the move to a broad based, rebatable indirect tax system in this country in fact reduces taxes and charges on our export sector by some $4½ billion—that is, $4,500 million—a year. I believe that that is a very worthwhile objective for the Australian economy. In that sense, as we celebrate today the dawning of a very significant new set of opportunities for the broader economy, we do so for rural and regional economies as well. A large part of that taxation reform involves the measures that we are putting in place through the extension of the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme and the introduction of the Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme 1999. A large part of the benefits that flow to rural and regional Australia do indeed derive from those two measures.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There has been some speculation, I think it is fair to say, on compliance issues. It is not at all unusual for a government—in fact, it is the norm—to introduce an act which clearly sets out its objectives and clearly outlines where it intends to go with something like the diesel rebate scheme, which is quite straightforward in terms of compliance and so forth, but more particularly the alternative fuels grants scheme. It needs to be acknowledged and it is a reality that, as we have started serious negotiations in relation to administration and compliance, the difficulties are a little more than we had initially anticipated.</para><para>It also needs to be acknowledged that that is, in effect, Labor's fault. They could have chosen to have entered into meaningful negotiations with us. They chose not to. So we had to negotiate with the Democrats. I have said in this place, and I repeat, that we entered into negotiations with them and found them to be absolutely fair, reasonable and 
 constructive. As noted in an editorial in a very important rural paper today, the fact of the matter is that the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Liberal</inline> from Dubbo in the electorate of the member for Parkes has observed:</para><para>The rebate is worth the small cost of extra paperwork.

The Minister for Transport and Regional Services could not answer a question on regional industry.</para><para>We have not been able to have any satisfactory answers to the fundamental questions of capacity for rorting, to the fundamental questions of where you will place the arbitrary lines and what that will mean for businesses. We have not had any answers to the possible inequities in the competitive balance between businesses depending upon whether they are just inside or just outside the metropolitan area. The whole thing has been exposed as a huge problem for you in the same way as has compliance on what food is going to have the GST applied and what is not. Just as the food issue will come back to haunt the Treasurer, I think the compliance aspects of this diesel package—they may have some positive aspects—will come back to haunt the minister. It is fundamentally flawed. So far it has been demonstrated to be unworkable. Nothing the minister has said or, more correctly, has not said has changed or can alter that fact.</para><para>Amendment agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>7822</page.no></debateinfo><para>Motion (by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tuckey</inline>) proposed:</para><para>That the House do now adjourn.</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Information Technology</title><page.no>7822</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>7822</page.no><name role="metadata">Ripoll, Bernie, MP</name><name role="display">Mr RIPOLL</name><name.id>83E</name.id><electorate>Oxley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Information is the currency of humanity, and humanity is the catalyst for change. In the age of information, change is inevitable and the possible now becomes the probable. The use 
 of information technology has brought much change, even to this place. I address the House tonight, speaking not from written notes or from memory but with my words and thoughts stored on a portable hand-held device, a PDA. In fact, I believe I may be the first member to do this.</para></talk.start><para>This PDA allows me to deliver a prepared speech that has never been set to paper. The paperless office may yet become a reality one day. I also store in this device all of my tasks, my complete diary and my phone book. It also has the ability to fax and access the World Wide Web. But, more importantly, this device synchronises completely with my electorate office. Technology such as this is having a huge impact on the way this House operates and the way that we govern in Australia. While such technologies continue to reduce demand on our use of physical resources, the real advantage of information technology is in the limitless interaction of people and ideas.</para><para>This parliament should not be constrained in the way that information technologies are used in the business of the House. This parliament is already one of the most, if not the most, technologically sophisticated legislatures in the world. From our parliamentary offices we have electronic connections that enable the transfer of data from one member to another or to our constituents and for the downloading of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, press releases, <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digests</inline>, legislation and other documents and information from parliamentary sources.</para><para>This building is one of largest in the world to be built around an electronic backbone of fibre optics. Previous governments deserve congratulations for their commitment to new technology and the efficiency it can bring to the day-to-day operations of government. In fact, at least to some extent, the overwhelming enthusiasm of the Australian people towards new technologies stems from the enthusiasm shown by Australian governments to utilise technology.</para><para>However, just as the development of information technology has grown exponentially, so too government must commit resources and infrastructure at a faster pace. All of this has given elected representatives a greater ability 
 to access information and services and greater access to our constituents and a greater ability to do more for our community. But current technology could allow us to achieve even more, as is often required.</para><para>Since the invention of the printing press, technological advancement has accelerated and broadened the spread of human knowledge, thoughts and beliefs. Current technologies give to billions the voice that once belonged only to the few, so we must listen to these many voices. The challenge for us now is our commitment to foster the enthusiasm of the community towards new technologies. While many government departments use the Internet as a primary resource for providing information to the community and the parliament and the parliamentary library conducts research through the Internet, there remains a frustrating delay in providing electorate offices with a permanent connection to these same resources.</para><para>Current technologies should also be employed to fully integrate the offices in our community with our offices here in Canberra. The single office concept needs to move beyond concept and into reality. The current system of operating two separate networks is totally inefficient. Through technology we can minimise the impact of our absence from our electorates. Anything that allows us to do more and better work in our community must be utilised. In the new age of telecommuting, e-commerce, and being on-line, Canberra to my electorate of Oxley need no longer be such a distance away.</para><para>As a nation we have always recognised the tyranny of distance, in particular the isolation of low population density. Today we have further conquered that distance. This is why rural Australia has always embraced new technology, as have our business community and education sectors. The challenge for us is to do the same in this House. With today's technology we can create the parliament of tomorrow. The need for mobile equipment and access should go beyond trial and also become a reality. The thought of conducting elections over the Internet may seem radical today, but our colleagues overseas are conducting such ventures as we speak and there 
 are legislatures already using computerised voting to avoid time consuming counts during debates. I envisage the day when interactive terminals at our seats in the House will keep members and the Speaker up to date. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">SPEAKER</name><name role="display">Mr SPEAKER</name></talker><para>—May I be permitted to observe that when the electronic machine that the member for Oxley was using responds to voice activation we will have come full circle.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Green Corps: Broken Hill</title><page.no>7824</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>7824</page.no><name role="metadata">Lawler, Tony, MP</name><name role="display">Mr LAWLER</name><name.id>834</name.id><electorate>Parkes</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This evening I would like to take a few minutes to share some thoughts on some of the most admirable people I have come across in my travels around the electorate. I am not referring to mayors or shire councillors; I am not referring to doctors or sporting geniuses or academic marvels. I am talking about two groups of people whom I have had the pleasure of meeting recently. They are the young people associated with the Green Corps program.</para></talk.start><para>I had the absolute honour some weeks ago to be involved in the presentation to the Green Corps group from Broken Hill, who had just finished their six months on a Green Corps project. I do not need to point out to those members in the House that the people who participate in the Green Corps project are volunteers. They are young people who have been on the dole who have decided that there is more to life for them and have decided, of their own volition, to join the Green Corps project.</para><para>Gerard Bennett, Matthew Chandler, Rachel Daley, Carl Krelle (otherwise known as Rainbow), Calvin Lee, Scott Nilson, Leah McWaters and Darren Thomas: these eight people—seven of them from my electorate and residents of Broken Hill and one from Rainbow in Victoria—were working during the six months leading up to about April. One of the tasks that was undertaken, under the supervision of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, was something that I would say many adult Australians who spend time berating the young people of today would not even consider doing. These young people, amongst other things, performed jobs such as 
 installing Environet, creating signs for National Parks, revegetating areas, digging holes for fence posts, et cetera. But the thing that I marvelled at when I met these people was the job that they did without a word of complaint in the 40 degree plus heat of a Broken Hill summer in January, rolling up about 120 kilometres of barbed wire.</para><para>The dedication and commitment that these people showed to perform these tasks, after starting off a somewhat disparate group of people—some of whom knew each other, many who did not—were remarkable. They formed a team, they learned a lot about life, they learned a lot about relationships. They certainly learned a lot about hard work and, most importantly, they learned about the pleasure and the satisfaction gained from getting stuck into a job, whether it is hard or not, and seeing it through.</para><para>These young people had a great time in the Green Corps. It is probably not the type of work that many people would choose, but these young Australians were motivated and excited when they were finished. Many of them were going to take the opportunity to get hold of some further funds to continue with study. It will look terrific on their CVs—the fact that they have contributed to society in this way. They probably did not care whether or not I was there for their presentation, or the mayor or whoever else. The highlight at the end of their Green Corps time was to sit down and chat about the experience and what they had achieved for themselves.</para><para>It was a privilege and an honour for me to meet these people, and I hold them up as representatives to anyone who questions the work of Green Corps. More importantly, I hold them up as an example to anyone who gets on a soapbox and talks about the youth today in a disparaging way. These people face challenges that, as young people, we never had to face. They have risen above these challenges and met them and punched them in the eye.</para><para>I recently also had the pleasure of launching another Green Corps group who are just starting on their learning journey in Parkes—another fine, motivated group of people really looking forward to getting stuck into the work 
 at hand. All of them are appreciative of the opportunity that they were given and I am sure that, like their Broken Hill counterparts, they will also benefit enormously and the community will benefit enormously in turn from their valuable input.</para><para>I look forward to finding out, at the completion of this Parkes Green Corps project, just how many of them finish and what their hopes and aspirations will be then. After what I have seen already, I will be most surprised if the number finishing are any fewer than the number that started.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Pooled Investment Schemes</title><title>Austral Pacific Bus Plant: Closure</title><page.no>7825</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>7825</page.no><name role="metadata">Swan, Wayne, MP</name><name role="display">Mr SWAN</name><name.id>2V5</name.id><electorate>Lilley</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I speak on behalf of at least 3,000 retirees who have invested at least $300 million, many of whom have lost their entire life savings in an out of control pooled investment scheme. I appeal to the federal Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Newman, to establish a team within Centrelink to set in place guidelines so that the devastated investors can access their legal entitlements without delay. At the moment the devastated investors, with no income and frozen assets, are trudging into Centrelink offices around the country and being told that they are ineligible for income assistance. As a consequence many are without any form of income even though many should be eligible for special benefit. It is not the fault of staff behind the counter in Centrelink, rather the failure of this government to appreciate the nature of the disaster and the predicament these individuals find themselves in. Currently two finance brokers, Global Finance and Grubb Finance, are in liquidation. Three more firms are in difficulty. In the Western Australian parliament, the Minister for Fair Trading, Mr Doug Shave, has confirmed that up to 5,000 investors may lose their money and up to $500 million may be involved.</para></talk.start><para>On Saturday 19 June I attended a meeting in Perth with approximately 100 of these investors who have been disgracefully let down by the regulatory framework nationally and in the state of Western Australia. There are many more right across Australia, includ 
 ing many in my home state of Queensland. The Western Australian authorities are yet to appoint a supervisor to liquidate the trust funds, and in the meantime what remains of the investors' assets are frozen and the amount that remains is unknown. With their nest eggs frozen, many of these people are without any income. They are told by Centrelink that they have too much equity to receive temporary support from the federal government. It is my understanding that many of these people may be eligible for special benefit—a discretionary payment that can be paid to a person who meets certain conditions and is unable to provide a sufficient livelihood for themselves or their dependents. Income testing of special benefit is also discretionary and usually involves a deduction of $1 for each dollar of income.</para><para>With respect to the assets test, the Social Security Act provides that where a person's social security entitlement has been reduced under that test and the asset in question is unrealisable, and if the application of the test puts the person in severe financial hardship, the unrealisable asset can be disregarded under the ordinary income and assets test. However, where such an asset has been disregarded in this way, the pension rate will be reduced under a fairly complex formula that takes account of income from other sources, assets other than those that have been disregarded and the value of the disregarded assets themselves. As a matter of urgency, Senator Newman should establish a team to assess the overall situation and put in place guidelines for behind-the-counter staff in Centrelink to use when they are approached by these retirees, many of whom have been defrauded of their life savings.</para><para>The activities of those running these pooled investment schemes are not unlike the recent business failures—take, for example, the Oakdale colliery—that have left many workers short-changed. Just before Christmas 1998 the Austral Pacific bus plant at Geebung in the electorate of Lilley closed as a result of the failure of the Clifford group of companies. In total about 240 jobs were lost. According to the figures from the receiver, an amount exceeding $6.5 million was due to employees, 
 and that is now unlikely to be returned to those employees. Employee entitlements included at least five months of employer funded superannuation instalments and three months of voluntary superannuation payments deducted from employees' wages. The last deficiency is particularly appalling. The directors of the failed company included John Barrie Loiterton and Ian Hall. These two directors were also the directors of Globane, which had a liquidator appointed in 1996—the same year in which Gilba Holdings failed. Loiterton was also involved in an early company failure in 1974 when Vanbro Corporation went to the wall. The receiver estimates that the total deficiency for the group will be in excess of $79 million. In January of this year I referred this matter to the government and I wait with interest the results of an ASIC inquiry into this gross business failure.</para><para>I simply cannot imagine just how I would react if I lost everything, especially if it were someone else's doing. For retirees whose life savings are now frozen, with no source of income, and the workers in my electorate who have lost their jobs and thousands in entitlements and superannuation, words would be of little comfort. What they desperately need is some action from this government, via all possible means to assist them in their time of hardship and to make sure they are not hung out to dry by the dodgy characters that have ripped them off.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Western Australia: Mineral Exploration</title><page.no>7826</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>7826</page.no><name role="metadata">Washer, Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Dr WASHER</name><name.id>84F</name.id><electorate>Moore</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to take this opportunity to support comments made last week by Senator Nick Minchin, Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, regarding the serious situation we face in Western Australia with the continuing downturn in mineral exploration. According to ABS statistics, exploration expenditure in WA dropped by $15 million in the March quarter, down 11 per cent from December 1998. This is part of a continuing trend that is threatening the mining and resource sector as well as the overall economy in my state. Apart from employing more than 45,000 people, the mining sector in WA is responsible for 65 per cent of the state's total invest 
 ment, which equates to 58 per cent of the total mining investment in Australia.</para></talk.start><para>The three main causes of the downturn in exploration expenditure identified by the WA Chamber of Minerals and Energy are lower commodity prices, access to venture capital and uncertainty created by native title legislation being blocked in the WA state parliament. There is little we can do other than ride out the storm of falling commodity prices and the current economic downturn being experienced around the world, but the state upper house in WA is in a position to help turn around the fall in mining exploration.</para><para>They can do this by allowing the Court government to proceed with the native title legislation that complements the Commonwealth's Native Title Act. Although the Titles Validation Amendment Bill was passed in April, albeit seven months after it was introduced, the Native Title (State Provisions) Bill is still to be passed by non-government members in the upper house.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Mr Melham interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84F</name.id><name role="metadata">Washer, Mal, MP</name><name role="display">Dr WASHER</name></talker><para>—It is true, Daryl. It is time these members in the upper house realised just how important the mining sector is to the WA economy. While bearing in mind around 78 per cent of the state is currently the subject of native title claims, it is time they had a look around the state and noticed that vital exploration work is rapidly disappearing because of the uncertainty their actions have created. The only positive news is that mining companies, most likely out of frustration with the upper house, have signed a deal with the Kimberley Land Council to cover the issue of exploration across the north-west of WA. They are probably fed up with the delays caused by parliamentarians and want to get on with the job.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Mining companies are also looking offshore for mineral exploration projects because of the problems they face here, which means Australia is missing out on important export dollars. I call on the upper house to take their responsibility to the people of Western Australia seriously and, for the sake of future generations of our wonderful state, end the 
 uncertainty the mining industry is facing by passing the remainder of the native title legislation.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Goods and Services Tax: Jobs</title><page.no>7827</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>7827</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Martin, MP</name><name role="display">Mr MARTIN FERGUSON</name><name.id>LS4</name.id><electorate>Batman</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise this evening to talk about what I regard as a major failure of the GST package. In doing so, I refer to a conspicuous absence from negotiations, as pursued by the Democrats, of any focus at all on the question of jobs. If anything, I also suggest to the House this evening that there is no excuse for the Democrats totally ignoring the jobs issue. I also suggest that, to retain any credibility with the public, the Democrats had to ensure that the package would not cost jobs—in this endeavour the Democrats have failed dismally.</para></talk.start><para>At the last election, and confirmed again since the election, the Democrats made a number of non-negotiable commitments on how they would improve the employment impact of the package. The minimum jobs hurdle they set themselves called on the government to replace $2.5 billion of petrol and diesel tax cuts with cuts to payroll tax, address the job damaging effects of the tax mix, reduce the maximum taper rate on unemployment benefits, replace the proposed First Home Buyers Scheme with a GST rebate and zero rate inbound tourism packages.</para><para>Not one of these commitments has been fully satisfied. How then do the Democrats reconcile this with their understandable desire to be as far removed from a GST as possible, as they initially stated to the Australian public? Beyond their minimum benchmark on jobs, the Democrats also wanted the government to explain the issues that were not resolved to their satisfaction in the Senate committee process. I again suggest that, in doing their deal, they failed to fulfil that undertaking.</para><para>I raise these issues because I consider at the moment that we should have a major debate on the issue of jobs. I consider that the government actually failed Australia's young unemployed last Thursday afternoon in their hasty endeavour to bring before the parliament their youth employment bill going to the 
 question of junior rates. I consider that we should step back, properly consider the Australian Industrial Relations Commission report and basically pursue a case by case approach on the basis of any applicant having to prove the merits of their case. This is exceptionally important in the light of the GST package—the consideration of which has today been completed—and the fact that, beyond the GST package which will in actual fact destroy jobs, we have a government that is, in essence, failing on the jobs front.</para><para>All we get from the government when it comes to a debate about jobs is an endeavour to shift blame and an endeavour to suggest that there is yet another excuse. Initially we had the question of junior rates. The question of junior rates can now be properly resolved with the assistance of the Australian Labor Party and, more importantly, with the help of a constructive report from the Industrial Relations Commission.</para><para>Also consider that, when you look at the plight of the long-term unemployed today, they are entitled to more than suggestions by the Minister for Employment Services that they are job snobs. They are entitled to more than mere suggestions by the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, assisted by the Minister for Employment Services, that the solution to unemployment in this country is Work for the Dole.</para><para>I want to clearly state this evening that, from the Labor Party's point of view, we understand that in the Australian community there is a range of organisations, including local councils and community organisations and members of the Job Network, that desire to use Work for the Dole because, in essence, it is the only scheme available at the moment to offer any form of assistance at all to the unemployed. In indicating that I am not attacking those organisations, I also clearly indicate to the House this evening that I would hope that, in embracing Work for the Dole, those organisations actually endeavour to add to Work for the Dole by trying, from their own limited local resources, to ensure that a form of accredited training is given to 
 the unemployed who are obligated to undertake Work for the Dole activity.</para><para>I raise the question of accredited training because I consider that, in any activity, we should be about giving the unemployed skills that are relevant to a job in the local community. That represents a fairly significant statement from the Australian Labor Party to the House this evening. We were the first to bring in the reciprocal obligation. We do not think Work for the Dole is adequate, but we understand it is the only existing scheme at the moment. All we ask is that those organisations who embrace it actually try to add to the endeavours of the government by incorporating into the scheme some decent training which actually rewards the unemployed for facing up to their responsibilities and, in doing so, assists them in endeavouring to get job ready and to be more attractive to employers in the Australian community. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question resolved in the affirmative.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">House adjourned at 10.59 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>7828</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following notices were given:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr Reith</inline> to present a bill for an act to amend the law relating to workplace relations, and for related purposes.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Dr Kemp</inline> to present a bill for an act to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988, and for related purposes.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Dr Kemp</inline> to present a bill for an act to amend the Indigenous Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989 and the Student Assistance Act 1973.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Dr Kemp</inline> to present a bill for an act to amend the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 1996, and for related purposes.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Dr Kemp</inline> to present a bill for an act to amend the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr Williams</inline> to present a bill for an act to amend legislation relating to Customs, and for related purposes. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr Williams</inline> to present a bill for an act to facilitate electronic transactions, and for other purposes.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr Williams</inline> to present a bill for an act to amend the Crimes Act 1914, and for related purposes.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr Truss</inline> to present a bill for an Act to amend the Social Security Act 1991 in relation to the effect on social security benefits of the disposal of assets, and for related purposes.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr McGauran</inline> to present a bill for an act to amend the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, and for related purposes.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hockey</inline> to present a bill for an act to provide for a register of unclaimed money and a register of lost members for superannuation funds, and for related purposes.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hockey</inline> to present a bill for an act to deal with consequential and transitional matters arising from the enactment of the Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act 1999, and for other purposes.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Dr Wooldridge</inline> to present a bill for an act to amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 in relation to diagnostic imaging services, and for related purposes.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr Downer</inline> to present a bill for an act to amend the law relating to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, and for related purposes.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr Scott</inline> to present a bill for an act to amend the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and other legislation, and for related purposes.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hockey</inline> to present a bill for an act to amend laws, and deal with transitional matters, in connection with the reform of the financial sector, and for other purposes.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tuckey</inline> to move—</para><para>That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent:</para><para>(1)	 consideration together forthwith of the Senate's amendments to A New Tax System bills conveyed to the House in Senate messages Nos. 154 to 157; and</para><para>(2)	 a Minister then moving one motion—That the amendments of the Senate conveyed to the House in Senate messages Nos. 154 to 157 be agreed to.
